10.1016/j.dib.2015.04.001	To overcome the higher absorption in the 14 day old mice femora, due to their dense structure, a source voltage of 75 kV and a current of 133 µA were used. The high resolution scans made available (Harvard Dataverse 10.7910/DVN/29628, [2]) were produced using 3600 radiographs with 1.2 µm effective pixel size. Medium resolution scans (10 µm, 900 projections) were used to locate the high resolution scans.	CC-BY
10.1084/jem.20161784	The reason for these differences is not clear but could be related, in some cases, to polymorphisms. For example, in the promoter region of TRAV39, a deletion of five nucleotides (TTTTC; available from GenBank under accession no. NC_000014, positions 22 and 125–22,130) was detected in the mouse samples, compared with the TRAV39 gene in the three human donors. A similar polymorphism (TTTTC deletion) has been observed in the CD4 promoter, which was associated with lower promoter activity (Kristiansen et al., 2004).	CC-BY

Resulting analysis data were compiled via social media and direct email.	CC-BY
10.1186/s12864-015-1973-7	After an initial period in which all data were made available through the Manuel Corpas’ Blog [12], it soon became apparent that this venue would make it increasingly difficult to provide a centralised place with all available data sources. A solution was found through figShare, a resource that allows upload of data from experiments, giving them a digital object identifier, which makes them citable. figShare is also useful for tracking the number of downloads, views and shares via Facebook and Twitter. All data available for the family can be accessed via figShare under the project tag ‘Corpasome’. To date, the Corpas Family Trio Exome dataset (Mother, Father, Daughter) in figShare has received 1247 views and 2 shares.	CC-BY
