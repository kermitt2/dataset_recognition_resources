<title>Dear Editor:</title>
<p>Gene networks provide a system-level overview of genetic organizations and enable the dissection of functional modules underlying complex traits. With diverse genomics data, a genome-scale network, which facilitates the prediction of novel candidate genes for a trait, can be constructed. Network-based predictions have been useful in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). However, such a predictive gene network is not yet available for bread wheat, <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, an important staple food crop accounting for approximately 20&#x0025; of the world&#x2019;s daily food consumption. Bread wheat also serves as a model for studying polyploidy in plants.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons that functional genomics studies on bread wheat have lagged behind those on other crops include the large genome of bread wheat (&#x007E;17 Gb) and its polyploidy nature, which complicates genetic analysis. However, recent advances in wheat research have considerably improved genome assembly and gene models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">International Wheat Genome Sequencing, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the discovery and application of genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Upadhyay et al., 2013</xref>) and TILLING technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Uauy et al., 2009</xref>) have enabled targeted knockout in wheat protoplasts and whole plants. These developments have set the stage for the application of reverse genetics approaches for the functional characterization of wheat genes.</p>
<p>Here we present WheatNet, the first genome-scale functional gene network for <italic>T. aestivum</italic> and a companion web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inetbio.org/wheatnet">www.inetbio.org/wheatnet</ext-link>), which provides network information and generates network-based functional hypotheses. WheatNet was constructed by integrating 20 distinct genomics datasets (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplemental Table 1</xref></bold>), including 156,000 wheat-specific co-expression links mined from 1,929 DNA microarray datasets (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Supplemental Table 2</xref></bold>). A unique feature of WheatNet is that each network node represents either a single gene or a group of genes. An allopolyploid wheat genome contains three homeologous chromosome sets&#x2015;A, B, and D&#x2015;that originate from three closely related species <italic>Triticum urartu</italic>, <italic>Aegilops speltoides</italic>, and <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">International Wheat Genome Sequencing, 2014</xref>). Therefore, the wheat genome contains many homologous genes between the three ancestral chromosome sets. Because homeologs are likely to have redundant functions, collapsing homeologs into a single network node would facilitate the network analysis by reducing network complexity. Unfortunately, comprehensive definitions of wheat homeologous relationships are not yet available. Therefore, we computationally partitioned &#x201C;gene groups&#x201D; mimicking homeologous genes by clustering 99,386 wheat genes, resulting in 20,248 gene groups comprising 63,401 genes, and 35,985 individual genes. WheatNet was thus constructed using 56,233 nodes; the final network has 20,230 nodes and 567,000 edges, integrating 20 sources of functional evidence linking pairs of genes (<bold>Supplemental Methods</bold>). The edge information of the integrated WheatNet and all 20 component networks are available for download.</p>
<p>To assess WheatNet, we used biological process annotations by agriGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Du et al., 2010</xref>), which are moderately distinct from the dataset used for network training (&#x007E;38&#x0025; gene pairs by shared agriGO annotations overlap the training data) and one of the few other large-scale wheat annotation sets available for testing. To help reduce bias, we excluded agriGO terms that annotate more than 300 wheat genes. Next, the accuracy of functional gene pairs by WheatNet or by random chance was measured using the proportion of gene pairs that share agriGO annotations for different coverage of the coding genome. We observed strong performance by WheatNet, in which a network covering approximately 20&#x0025; of all genes map functional gene pairs with about 40&#x0025; accuracy (<bold>Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></bold>). The quality of WheatNet was further evaluated by the degree of connectivity among genes involved in a particular biological process. Considering that genes for the same complex traits are more likely to be functionally coupled, high connectivity among known genes for a trait would support the quality of functional networks. We tested network connectivity for a group of genes based on two measures: (i) the number of edges among gene members (i.e., within-group edge count) and (ii) the number of network neighbors that overlap among group members (i.e., network neighbor overlap). We used genes for two complex traits derived from proteomics studies: 45 genes with differential protein expression after <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Mandal et al., 2014</xref>) and 17 genes with differential protein expression under drought conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). The significance of network connectivity was also measured based on a null distribution from 1000 random gene sets of the same size. We found that the connectivity among each trait&#x2019;s genes was significantly higher than by random chance (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A&#x2013;B</xref></bold>). We consistently observed network communities of genes for both traits (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C&#x2013;D</xref></bold>). We conclude that WheatNet successfully predicts additional genes that are involved in a given trait.</p>

<p>Degree of connectivity (A) among 45 genes for response to Blumeria graminis f. sp. Tritici infection and (B) among 17 genes for response to drought stress were measured by determining the number of edges among group members (i.e., within-group edge count) or the number of network neighbors that overlapped among group members (i.e., network neighbor overlap) by using WheatNet (red stars) or 1000 random gene sets having the same size (black circles).

<p>The WheatNet web server provides two options for prioritizing genes for wheat traits: (i) direct neighbors in the gene network and (ii) context-associated hubs (CAHs). In the first approach, a user submits genes known for a trait that can guide network searches for new candidate genes. New genes are then ranked by the strength of evidence connecting them to the &#x201C;guide genes,&#x201D; measured for each candidate gene as the sum of network edge scores from that gene to the guide genes. The result page provides the ranked list of candidates and a visualization of the local guide gene network using the Cytoscape web tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). To provide functional clues for candidate genes, WheatNet provides available wheat and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene annotations from the Gene Ontology biological process (GOBP) (<bold>Supplemental Methods</bold>).</p>
<p>In the second approach, users exploit gene expression data related to a trait of interest. Gene expression profiles are one of the most common types of genomic data, and differential expression analysis provides many genes that are potentially associated with given traits such as abiotic and biotic stresses. However, many genes that are associated with stress conditions are not differentially expressed. Hypothesizing that a gene associated with many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in stress (i.e., CAHs) is likely to be responsible for responses to the given stress condition, we prioritized genes by connections to the context-associated DEGs. To conduct CAH prioritization, we first defined a subnetwork that comprises a hub gene and all of its network neighbors in WheatNet. For the gene prioritization, we considered only subnetworks with hub genes that have at least 50 network neighbors. Assuming that DEGs are representative genes for a relevant biological context, we prioritized hub genes based on the enrichment of their network neighbors for the DEGs, measured using Fisher&#x2019;s exact test. The hub genes with significant enrichment (<italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 0.01) of network neighbors for the DEGs are considered as CAHs and are presented as candidate genes for the context-associated trait. Similar to the network direct neighborhood search, all candidate genes are appended by GOBP annotations for wheat genes and for Arabidopsis orthologs. In addition, users can access a network view of a CAH and its connected DEGs by clicking each candidate gene (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The WheatNet predictions by each of the network-based gene prioritization methods were validated as follows: For the network direct neighborhood method, we evaluated the new candidate genes for drought stress response that were predicted by submitting 17 genes with differential protein expression under drought conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>) as guide genes.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that novel candidate genes for drought response are also likely to be expressed differentially under drought conditions. Thus, we investigated the enrichment of candidate drought response genes from DEGs under drought conditions. We generated a set of 2,346 DEGs under drought condition based on genes that showed more than 4-fold changes in expression levels at <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 0.01 (SRP045409 of NCBI Sequence Read Archive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). We found 15 drought-condition DEGs among the top 50 candidate genes by the network direct neighborhood method, which indicates more than 7-fold enrichment over predictions by random chance (15/50 = 0.3 by WheatNet vs. 2346/56233 = 0.042 by random chance). For the CAH method, we evaluated the candidate genes for <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> infection response that were predicted by submitting 837 DEGs after infection with <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (GSE54551 of NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Wojcik et al., 2015</xref>) as user input data. We found that the top 100 candidates by CAHs were significantly enriched for GOBP annotations relevant to fungus infection based on Arabidopsis orthologs: &#x2018;response to chitin&#x2019; (GO:0010200, <italic>P</italic> = 9.72 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-31</sup>), &#x2018;regulation of plant-type hypersensitive response&#x2019; (GO:0010363, <italic>P</italic> = 8.20 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-21</sup>), &#x2018;defense response to fungus&#x2019; (GO:0050832, <italic>P</italic> = 1.73 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-20</sup>), &#x2018;response to fungus&#x2019; (GO:0009620, <italic>P</italic> = 1.03 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-8</sup>), and &#x2018;detection of biotic stimulus&#x2019; (GO:0009595, <italic>P</italic> = 3.43 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-5</sup>).</p>
<p>These results indicate that WheatNet can effectively prioritize novel candidate genes for complex traits, including those governing abiotic and biotic stress responses, by using multiple network-based methods, which can be easily performed by simple submission of input data in the companion web server. WheatNet should be a useful resource of systems biology and predictive genetics for the wheat research community.</p>

<title>Genes and gene groups for nodes of WheatNet</title>
<p>Genes for WheatNet are based on gene models by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium MIPS annotation version 2.2. In the allopolyploid genome of Triticum aestivum, three homeologous chromosome sets&#x2015;A, B, and D&#x2015;originate from closely related species <italic>Triticum urartu</italic>, a grass relative <italic>Aegilops speltoides</italic>, and <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">International Wheat Genome Sequencing, 2014</xref>). Consequently, the wheat genome harbors many homologous genes between the three ancestral chromosome sets. Since the homeologs are likely to carry redundant functions, clustering a group of homeologs into a single network node would facilitate network analysis by reducing network complexity. Unfortunately, no comprehensive database of wheat homeologous relationships is yet available. Therefore, we computationally established &#x201C;gene groups&#x201D; as mimicking the homeologous groups. We hypothesized that, since homeologs arise from interspecies hybridization of chromosomes, they should resemble orthologous relationships between species. Therefore, we used orthoMCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2003</xref>) to search for groups of homologs among the three chromosome sets. We do not expect these gene groups to completely capture the homeologous relationships, but they should serve to approximate the ancestral homology. Of the 99,386 wheat genes, 63,401 were clustered into 20,248 gene groups. WheatNet was thus constructed on a total of 56,233 nodes, representing the 20,248 gene groups plus 35,985 individual genes. (Unless otherwise specified, we use the word &#x201C;gene&#x201D; to refer to a network node that might be either a single gene or a gene group.)</p>

<title>Benchmarking inferred functional linkages between wheat genes</title>
<p>Various types of genomics data were analyzed to infer functional associations between wheat genes by using supervised machine learning, which requires gold-standard reference data for training the model. The positive gold-standard set of functional links between wheat genes was derived from Gramene Gene Ontology biological process (GOBP) terms (release 49) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tello-Ruiz et al., 2016</xref>) by all-versus-all pairing of member genes for each GO term. Because the number of gene pairs for each term exponentially increases with the number of member genes, the resultant set of gold-standard functional gene pairs could be severely biased toward GO terms with many member genes. To avoid this functional bias, GO terms with more than 200 member genes were excluded. We also generated the negative gold-standard data set by pairing genes annotated by different GO terms. The resultant positive and negative gold-standard data sets comprise 434,368 and 73,273,643 gene pairs, respectively, among 12,142 wheat genes.</p>
<p>Functional linkages between wheat genes inferred from various genomics data were evaluated by using a log likelihood scoring scheme (LLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). The LLS is calculated as follows:</p>
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="105098_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>Where P(L|D) and P(&#x00AC;L|D) are the probability of the positive and negative gold-standard linkages for a given biological data, respectively. In a sense, LLS measures the enrichment of the positive gold-standard links among ones inferred from the given biological data compared to those obtained by random chance. If LLS is above zero, the given pair of genes is likely to operate for the same biological process.</p>

<title>Integrating the functional linkages from different data sources</title>
<p>To construct the gene network, we integrated functional gene-gene links inferred from 20 different genomics datasets (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>). Since these genomics datasets are not entirely independent from each other, we integrated multiple scores from different datasets using a previously described weighted sum (WS) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lehner and Lee, 2008</xref>). We found that integrating scores in a weighted fashion generally yields better results than those by <italic>na&#x00EF;ve</italic> Bayes integration, in which all scores are summed up with full weights. WS is calculated as follows:
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="105098_ueqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where L<sub>0</sub> is the best LLS of all available scores for a given functional link. Rank indices from <italic>i</italic> to <italic>n</italic> are assigned to the rest of the LLSs. Next, the scores are summed up after dividing them by the assigned index number and multiplied by a weight factor D if the given LLS is higher than a score threshold T. In this method, weighted sum yields the best LLS with the full weight, and all others with partial weights show decrement along rank order.</p>

<title>Inferring functional links from co-expression analysis</title>
<p>Genes for related biological processes are likely to have similar expression dynamics across many biological contexts. This co-expression pattern can be exploited to infer functional relationships between genes. We analyzed gene expression data collected using the Affymetrix array platform (GPL3802) and deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Barrett et al., 2013</xref>), because it supports the largest number of samples. We converted the downloaded raw data into a matrix of genes (rows) and samples (columns) for each GEO series (GSE), and then normalized the data using MAS5 software. We then calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) across these preprocessed expression vectors for each pair of genes in order to measure their co-expression. When analyzing co-expression among genes falling in homeologous gene groups, we retained the highest PCC scores among individual gene pairs. The co-expression links were ranked according to PCC score, and LLS scores were calculated for consecutive bins of 1000 gene pairs. The resulting relationship between PCC and LLS was fit with a regression model, and LLSs assigned to individual gene pairs based on the derived model. GEO series with fewer than 12 samples were excluded from the co-expression analysis owing to the high probability of promiscuous functional links supported by insignificant correlation across low numbers of samples. We inferred functional gene networks from nine GEO series (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Supplemental Table 2</xref></bold>), which were integrated into a component network for WheatNet, TA-CX (see <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplemental Table 1</xref></bold>). We also analyzed several expression datasets based on high-throughput sequencing, but none showed strong correlation between PCC and LLS, and we did not incorporate these data into the network, although the rapid growth in RNA-sequencing data in the database suggests this will likely become a valuable source of functional evidence in the future.</p>

<title>Inferring network links from gene neighborhood method by using metagenome assemblies</title>
<p>Functional associations between wheat genes can be inferred by measuring the proximities of their orthologous genes in bacterial genomes, a method that takes advantage of the trend for genes found to be neighbors across many bacterial genomes to reside in the same operon, and thus to generally operate in the same biological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Overbeek et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). Previously, we analyzed gene neighborhoods across completely sequenced bacterial genomes. We adapted the method for metagenomics data spanning hundreds of thousands of bacterial genomes. Metagenome assemblies of 16 body sites of humans were downloaded from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Human Microbiome Project, 2012</xref>), and global ocean microbiome assemblies were obtained from TARA Oceans study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sunagawa et al., 2015</xref>). Wheat protein sequences were aligned to the metagenome assemblies by using the BLASTX alignment mode in DIAMOND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buchfink et al., 2015</xref>) with the &#x2018;sensitive&#x2019; option. The score of each gene pair (S) was calculated as follows:</p>
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="105098_ueqn3.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>We expected that gene neighborhood evidence across the human symbiotic bacteria and marine bacteria would be complementary, given the many differences in the two environments and taxa, and derived two independent networks, one based on the HMP data and the other based on the TARA Oceans study data. We combined the networks into a single gene neighborhood network (TA-GN in <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplemental Table 1</xref></bold>) for integration with other datatypes.</p>

<title>Orthologous functional links transferred from other organisms</title>
<p>Interologs are evolutionarily conserved interactions between proteins whose homologous proteins in other organisms also interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Walhout et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, associalogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) are conserved functional associations between genes whose orthologs in other organisms are also functionally coupled. WheatNet component networks based on associalogs were transferred from our previously published networks for seven organisms: YeastNet for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kim et al., 2014</xref>), AraNet for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee et al., 2015c</xref>), RiceNet for <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lee et al., 2015b</xref>), FlyNet for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shin et al., 2015</xref>), WormNet for <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al., 2014</xref>), DanioNet for <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Shim et al., 2016</xref>), MouseNet for <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), and HumanNet for <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, associalogs from an unpublished functional network for <italic>Zea mays</italic> were integrated into WheatNet. To transfer associalogs from the above organisms, orthologous wheat proteins were identified using the Inparanoid algorithm, which includes in-paralogs as co-orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">O'Brien et al., 2005</xref>). We found that associalogs based on wheat in-paralogs of <italic>Z. mays</italic> genes increased the probability of introducing false functional links, probably because of the complexity of the <italic>Z. mays</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lee et al., 2015a</xref>). Therefore, we transferred associalogs from <italic>Z. mays</italic> networks by orthology relationships based on the bi-directional best BLASTP hits only, not the in-paralog expansion offered by Inparanoid.</p>

<caption><p><bold>Functional links of WheatNet are highly accurate.</bold></p>
<p>To assess networks with validation data that are independent from those for network training, we used GOBP annotations by agriGO. Top-ranked links of WheatNet connect gene pairs of which &#x003E;95&#x0025; of them have at least one shared agriGO annotation between them, whereas only few of random gene pairs have shared annotations. The accuracy decreases as the network size increases.</p></caption>
