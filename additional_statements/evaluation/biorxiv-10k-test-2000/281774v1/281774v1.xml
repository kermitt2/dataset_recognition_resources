<abstract>
<p>The Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport III (ESCRT-III) proteins are critical for cellular membrane scission processes with topologies inverted relative to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Some viruses appropriate ESCRT-IIIs for their release. By imaging single assembling viral-like particles of HIV-1, we observed that ESCRT-IIIs and the ATPase VPS4 arrive after most of the virion membrane is bent, linger for tens of seconds, and depart &#x223C;20 seconds before scission. These observations suggest ESCRT-IIIs are recruited by a combination of membrane curvature and the late domains of the HIV-1 Gag protein. ESCRT-IIIs may pull the neck into a narrower form but must leave to allow scission. If scission does not occur within minutes of ESCRT departure, ESCRT-III and VPS4 are recruited again. This mechanistic insight is likely relevant for other ESCRT dependent scission processes including cell division, endosome tubulation, multivesicular body and nuclear envelope formation, and secretion of exosomes and ectosomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>ESCRTs are categorized into groups &#x2212;0 through -III and act in various cellular processes including cell division, multivesicular body formation, and wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hurley, 2015</xref>). An investigation of protein sorting between endosomes and lysosomes initially led to the discovery of ESCRT-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Katzmann et al., 2001</xref>), with other ESCRTs identified soon afterwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babst et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Babst et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Katzmann et al., 2003</xref>). Sequential recruitment of the ESCRTs enables division of membrane compartments, with ESCRT-III being critical for the membrane scission process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Henne et al., 2013</xref>). ESCRT-IIIs have a five alpha-helix core structure and assemble <italic>in vitro</italic> into macromolecular rings or spirals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>; Muziol et al., 2006). ESCRT-IIIs are believed to polymerize in the neck of the membrane constriction to drive membrane fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cashikar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dobro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fabrikant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Henne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Scission of the membrane, even in the presence of ESCRT-IIIs, stalls in the absence of the hexameric AAA<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Morita et al., 2010</xref>), VPS4A/B, which contains a microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) domain that binds to MIT interacting motifs (MIM) of ESCRT- IIIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>). The final scission process is believed to be associated with VPS4 working on ESCRT-IIIs, but the mechanism is still unresolved. In some models the ESCRT-IIIs provide the motive force for scission and the VPS4 is required after scission to recycle the ESCRT-IIIs for subsequent scissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wollert et al., 2009</xref>). In other models the VPS4 is actively engaging the ESCRT-IIIs prior or during scission by actively remodeling ESCRT-IIIs in order to force scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saksena et al., 2009</xref>), by rearranging ESCRT-IIIs as part of the pathway towards scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cashikar et al., 2014</xref>), or by binding to ESCRT dome structures in order to add rigidity necessary for scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fabrikant et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>ESCRT complexes are hijacked by HIV to enable separation of the viral particle from the host cell plasma membrane. The production of enveloped HIV-1 at the plasma membrane occurs with the recruitment of the structural protein Gag at individual assembly sites. The carboxyl terminus of Gag has a motif that is essential for recruitment of ESCRTs. First Gag recruits the &#x201C;early&#x201D; ESCRTs which contribute to subsequent recruitment of ESCRT-III proteins. The ESCRT-IIIs then polymerize into structures that are believed to constrict the neck and drive membrane fission. HIV release appears to require fewer members of the ESCRT family than other processes. Redundancy likely makes many variants, such as CHMP5, CHMP6 and CHMP7, only conditionally necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morita et al., 2011</xref>). ESCRT-IIIs that are essential for assembly of HIV-1 include CHMP2 (either A or B variant) and CHMP4B, which are recruited to site of budding with other proteins such as ALIX and TSG101 which interact with Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morita et al., 2011</xref>). The reduced number of required ESCRTs makes HIV assembly an approachable system for studying the biophysics of ESCRT mediated membrane scission.</p>
<p>Prior to viral particle separation from a host cell, a roughly spherical particle is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martin-Serrano et al., 2003</xref>), but the topological pathway and timing of events to reaching the Gag sphere has not previously been followed <italic>in vivo</italic>. The order of some of the events in virion assembly has been resolved by live-cell microscopy. First the HIV- genome is recruited to the membrane, potentially with a few Gag molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jouvenet et al., 2009</xref>). Then, over a 5-30 minute period, the Gag accumulates around the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ivanchenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jouvenet et al., 2008</xref>). Once Gag reaches a steady-state, ESCRT-III and VPS4 are transiently recruited at the site of assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baumgartel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bleck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jouvenet et al., 2011</xref>). The timing of some critical steps is not known impacting our understanding of the mechanism. It is not known whether bending occurs before, during, or after the transient recruitment of ESCRTs. Thus, is membrane bending driven by Gag multimerization, by Gag engagement with the HIV-1 genome or by the ESCRTs? It is also not known if scission occurs before, during or after the transient recruitment of ESCRT-IIIs or VPS4. Do they generate the force for scission, do they prepare the membrane for scission, or does VPS4 recycle ESCRT-IIIs after scission?</p>
<p>Here we investigated, during the assembly of HIV Gag, the temporal recruitment of ESCRT-III proteins and VPS4 relative to membrane scission. We also examined membrane curvature during Gag assembly to determine when a spherical particle forms relative to ESCRT- III recruitment. We find that membrane bending occurs contemporaneous with recruitment of Gag and prior to arrival ESCRT-III. The ESCRT-IIIs and the VPS4 ATPase arrive after Gag assembly has concluded, remain at the membrane for tens of seconds, and then leave tens of seconds before scission. During the period after departure of the ESCRT-IIIs, neutralizing the surface charge on the membrane accelerates the membrane scission.</p>

<title>ESCRT-IIIs appear and disappear from site of virus-like particle assembly prior to scission</title>
<p>To determine the timing of ESCRT recruitment relative to membrane bending and scission, we quantified ESCRT recruitment during the assembly of HIV-1 virus like particles (VLPs) while assaying membrane bending and scission. Scission was assayed by monitoring the ability of protons to flow between the cytosol and the lumen of the virion. The pH in the lumen of the virion was monitored with a pH-sensitive GFP (pHlourin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Miesenbock et al., 1998</xref>) fused to Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jouvenet et al., 2008</xref>) while modulating the cytoplasmic pH by cycling the pCO<sub>2</sub> every 10 s between 0&#x0025; and 10&#x0025;, thus an average of 5&#x0025; pCO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 1</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> rapidly diffuses across plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hulikova and Swietach, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Simon et al., 1994</xref>) and is converted to carbonic acid by cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase, altering the cytoplasmic pH. We have previously observed that Gag-pHlourin in a budded VLP is less sensitive to changes of pCO<sub>2</sub> than in the cytosol, suggesting carbonic anhydrase is excluded from VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jouvenet et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>At sites of VLP assembly the average Gag-pHluorin fluorescence increase was similar to the increase of Gag-mEGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jouvenet et al., 2008</xref>), but the intensity oscillated in sync with switching the pCO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>). At various times after Gag accumulation reached a steady-state maximum the magnitude of oscillations decreased, indicating a loss of the ability of protons to move between the VLP and cytoplasm due to scission. Not surprisingly, scission was never observed before Gag had finished accumulating at individual VLPs. Unexpectedly the ESCRT-III CHMP4B both appeared (Avg=59s, N=30 out of 30) and disappeared (Avg=22s, N=27 out of 30) prior to scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>CHMP4B has been proposed to form a circular/spiral structure which supports assembly of a smaller CHMP2(A/B) dome which generates fission by pulling the neck together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fabrikant et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is possible that CHMP4B may be removed prior to scission leaving CHMP2A or CHMP2B present to facilitate fission. To probe the timing of CHMP2, endogenous CHMP2A and CHMP2B were lowered with siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 3</xref>) to facilitate observation of mCherry-CHMP2A or mCherry-CHMP2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>). CHMP2A and CHMP2B both appeared (Avg.=77s, N=29 out of 29; and 63s, N=23 out of 23, respectively) and disappeared prior to scission (Avg. &#x003D; 23s, N=26 out of 29; and 27s, N=23 out of 23, respectively <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>). This observation indicates their assembly and disassembly is also not physically forcing scission.</p>
<p>Next the dynamics of recruitment of VPS4, the energy providing ATPase, was monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 2). Similar to the ESCRT-IIIs, VPS4A also appeared prior to scission (Avg=42s, N=28 out of 28) and disappeared prior to scission (Avg=17s, N=27 out of 28, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). On average VPS4A disappeared from the assembly site closer to the time of scission than CHMP4B (5 s), CHMP2A (6 s) or CHMP2B (10 s). A simultaneous measurement of CHMP4B and VPS4A confirmed CHMP4B was recruited &#x223C;5 s prior to VPS4A (N=41) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 4</xref>), which agrees with previous results in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bleck et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Acidification of cytosol accelerates scission</title>
<p>Our results indicate that the ESCRT-IIIs and the ATPase VPS4 leave the membrane prior to scission. It is possible that the ESCRT-IIIs play an essential role in tightening the membrane neck, but then need to be cleared away to allow for the opposing membranes to come closer for the scission reaction. The specific lipid composition in the neck is not known. However, both HIV-1 Gag and the ESCRT complexes are recruited to regions rich in phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), which has four negative charges at pH 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kooijman et al., 2009</xref>), with the net negative charge being the critical parameter for engaging ESCRTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, ESCRTs at the neck may bias the composition towards more negatively charged lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiaruttini et al., 2015</xref>). The pKa values for the two phosphate groups on the PI of PIP<sub>2</sub> are 6.5 and 7.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">van Paridon et al., 1986</xref>). Lowering the pH by raising the pCO<sub>2</sub> to 10&#x0025; should protonate and thus reduce the charge of these negatively charged lipids thus reducing the repulsive force between the membranes. To test if scission was affected by the changes in cytosolic pH we switched the pCO<sub>2</sub> at a slower rate, every 120s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Scission was &#x223C; 3X more likely when the cytoplasm was in the low pH state (10&#x0025; pCO<sub>2</sub>) than the high pH state (0&#x0025; pCO<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) consistent with the idea that scission is more likely when the net negative charge on phospholipids in the viral neck is reduced by protonation.</p>

<title>Additional rounds of ESCRT-III/VPS4 recruitment occur following failed scission</title>
<p>Multiple rounds of ESCRT-III/VPS4 recruitment were previously observed following completion of Gag accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baumgartel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jouvenet et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible the first wave of ESCRT-III/VPS4 led to productive scission and the subsequent rounds are inconsequential. Alternatively, the initial waves could be non-productive, perhaps a consequence of a failure to recruit both ESCRT-IIIs and VPS4A concurrently, necessitating additional rounds. While simultaneously imaging Gag-pHluorin, CHMP4B and VPS4A, when there were multiple waves, both CHMP4B and VPS4 were recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Scission was only observed after the final wave of recruitment of ESCRT-III/VPS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> B,C). Thus, not every cycle of arrival and then dispersal of ESCRT-III/VPS4 leads to subsequent scission. If scission does not occur, then a subsequent cycle of recruitment and dispersal of the ESCRT-III/VPS4 is required to complete the process. If the function of VPS4A is to recycle ESCRT-IIIs after scission, then only a single wave would be expected since ESCRT-IIIs would not be removed until after the single scission event has occurred.</p>

<title>Membrane bending occurs throughout assembly of virus-like particle</title>
<p>Next, we set out to determine when membrane bending occurs relative to the assembly of Gag and recruitment of ESCRT-IIIs. We expressed a fluorescent protein (either EGFP or one of two circularly permutated superfolder variants, sf3 or sf11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pedelacq et al., 2006</xref>)) as a fusion to Gag (at the carboxyl terminus or in the matrix protein of Gag) to be able to follow membrane bending in live-cell imaging via changes in anisotropy of the GFP tag.</p>
<p>The orientation of the chromophore was characterized with a custom built polarized total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) illuminator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). During accumulation of Gag at VLPs, the emission of the GFP was quantified while excitation alternated with polarization perpendicular (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="281774_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>polarized) followed by parallel (&#x015D;polarized) to the glass surface. Orientation was characterized by the ratio of emission intensities (P/S) and total Gag was monitored by P &#x002B; 2S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S1">Figure 4 &#x2013; supplement figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anantharam et al., 2010</xref>). As Gag accumulated, the ratio of P/S dropped from &#x223C;2 to &#x223C;1.4, with little variation (&#x00B1; 0.1) between the Gag-GFP versions (Figure 4B). The drop in P/S correlated with the increase in Gag as would be expected if the plasma membrane was bending during Gag assembly. The halfway decrease of P/S occurred prior to the halfway increase of the total Gag fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Following Gag recruitment, as indicated by a plateau in Gag signal, there was no transition in P/S. This observation is inconsistent with the subsequent recruitment of the ESCRT-IIIs facilitating the transition from a flat lattice to a spherical particle.</p>

<title>A simulation of spherical budding reproduced the time course of the P/S ratio relative to P &#x002B; 2S</title>
<p>In order to better understand the observed P/S ratio we formulated an expected P/S ratio for a spherical cap growing out of a flat membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

A predicted P/Swith respect to &#x03B2;and the normalized budded surface area (area from 0to 1) was then found by integrating over all defined dipole orientations and the extent budded surface area.</p>
<p>More specifically, using coordinates described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anantharam et al., 2010</xref>), position on the surface of the sphere was given in terms of a polar angle &#x03B8; and an azimuthal angle &#x03A6;, and the current extent budded was defined by &#x03B8; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In retroviral assembly, the late domains of Gag are believed to indirectly recruit ESCRT- IIIs which then polymerize into ring or spiral structures at the bud neck to drive bending and scission of the neck membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cashikar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fabrikant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>). However, our observations compel a new formulation of the role of ESCRTs in bending and scission. First, the initial bending of the membrane from a flat sheet to a spherical bud occurs during Gag assembly and prior to the arrival of ESCRT-IIIs. Thus, ESCRT-IIIs are not required to initiate curvature, a process which may be encouraged by Gag multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Briggs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). Second, the ESCRT-IIIs are only recruited after the accumulation of Gag is complete, indicating that Gag is not sufficient for recruitment. Third, the ESCRT- III/VPS4 are only recruited for tens of seconds and can no longer be detected at the moment of scission. While the ESCRTs and VPS4 cannot be detected in the tens of seconds prior to scission, it does not eliminate the possibility that a subpopulation of fewer than 20&#x0025; of the ESCRT-III/VPS4, which are not detectable in the background fluctuations, stay around for a longer period of time (further discussed in Materials and Methods).</p>
<p>Factors beyond the late domains which might assist ESCRT-III recruitment include activation through ubiquitination or phosphorylation of Gag or one of the early ESCRTs, such as TSG101 which is co-recruited along with Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bleck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jouvenet et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, ESCRT-III recruitment might be facilitated by high curvature in the neck or specific lipids recruited to these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). The observation that the bulk of measured curvature of the nascent virion occurs prior to the recruitment of ESCRT-IIIs does not rule out any role for ESCRTs in membrane curvature. Indeed, the transient recruitment of ESCRT-IIIs may further constrict the neck linking the virion to the cell to prepare it for scission. The ESCRT-IIIs might facilitate scission by polymerizing into a spiral structure to constrict the neck (&#x2018;polymerization constriction&#x2019;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cashikar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wollert et al., 2009</xref>) or into a ring which when removed constricts the neck (&#x2018;purse string constriction&#x2019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saksena et al., 2009</xref>). The VPS4 may remove the ESCRT-IIIs potentially acting as a unfoldase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). VPS4 may also remodel the ESCRT-IIIs throughout polymerization, potentially rearranging or tightening the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cashikar et al., 2014</xref>). Remodeling is consistent with our observation that recruitment of VPS4 was virtually contemporaneous with the ESCRT-III, with a slight 5 s lag in HEK293T cells and 10 s in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bleck et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>We suggest that fission can only occur when the neck is narrow and after the ESCRT-IIIs are removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). What is driving the scission event if ESCRT-IIIs are gone? When the neck is sufficiently narrow (a few nm) fission may be a spontaneous event, possibly through a hemifission intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fabrikant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kozlovsky and Kozlov, 2003</xref>). Narrowing of the neck by ESCRT-IIIs may allow additional Gag molecules adjacent to the neck to oligomerize, thereby keeping the constricted structure stable while the ESCRTs are displaced. However, cryo- EM images indicate a gap in the Gag lattice might be present at the site of the neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, constriction might encourage exchange or modification of phospholipids with shapes and charges that help to retain a narrow neck following ESCRT-III disappearance. The ESCRT-III are dependent on phospholipids with negative charges. This could explain the greater than 3-fold increased scission rate at a lower pH (10&#x0025; pCO<sub>2</sub>), which would raise the proton concentration to that of the PKa (6.5 and 7.7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">van Paridon et al., 1986</xref>), thereby reducing the surface charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). If scission does not occur sufficiently soon after removal of ESCRT-360 IIIs, a new round of ESCRT-III recruitment and assembly is required to achieve scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

HeLa cells were from ATCC and were not authenticated or tested for mycoplasma contamination. For polarization excitation experiments cells were grown on 35 mm glass bottom dishes (#P35G-1.0-20-C, MatTek, Ashland, MA) coated with fibronectin (#33010, Thermo Fisher) by incubating the dish with 10 &#x00B5;g/ml fibronectin in PBS for 1 hour. For pCO<sub>2</sub> switching experiments perfusion slides (#80186 &#x00B5;-Slide, Ibidi, Martinsried, Germany) were incubated with 60 &#x00B5;g/ml fibronectin in PBS for 1 hour before plating cells. For all experiments cells at &#x223C;75&#x0025; confluency were transfected with expression plasmids &#x223C;3.5 hours prior to beginning to image.

Both solutions were then mixed and incubated for 20 minutes before adding to adhered cells on MatTek dish in 2000 &#x00B5;l of DMEM. The same procedure was used for cells in the flow slide, but the transfection mixture was added to 2000 &#x00B5;l of DMEM and then 1000 &#x00B5;l was perfused through the chamber. At least four cells were used for each experimental condition in order to account for potential variability between cells. Both CHMP2A and CHMP2B were knocked down with siRNA for mCherry-CHMP2A and mCherry-CHMP2B experiments. siRNA transfections were conducted 48 hours prior to DNA plasmid transfection using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (following manufacturer&#x201A;s instructions; #13778, Thermo Fisher). A second round of siRNA transfection was performed at the time of DNA transfection. The following DNA ratios were used for transfections: Gag:Gag-mEGFP (4:1), Gag:Gag-MA- sf3 (4:1), Gag:Gag-MA-sf3 (4:1), Gag:Gag-pHluorin:mCherry-VPS4A (12:3:5), Gag:Gag- pHluorin:mCherry-CHMP4B (12:3:5), Gag:Gag-pHluorin:mCherry-CHMP2A-siRNAres (4:1:5), ag:Gag-pHluorin:mCherry-CHMP2B-siRNAres (4:1:5), Gag:Gag-TagBFP:mEGFP- VPS4A:mCherry-CHMP4B (24:6:5:5).

One reservoir was equilibrated with compressed air (labeled 0&#x0025; in these experiments but actually contained 0.04&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>), and the other reservoir was equilibrated with 10&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> (balanced with air) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 1</xref>). The reservoirs were mounted to a flow perfusion system (ValveBank II, AutoMate Scientific, Berkeley, CA) which enabled automated selection of desired media via solenoid valves under the reservoirs. Tygon tubes (R-3603) from each valve carried the media to a fluid combiner just prior to the perfusion slide chamber containing adhered cells. After the flow chamber a single tube carried the discharge media to a collection container. This container was placed below the height of equilibration reservoirs so that fluid flow was driven by gravity. The flow rate (&#x223C; 3 ml/min) was controlled with a clamp regulator attached to the discharge tube. At this flow rate the response time of the fluorophores to a pCO<sub>2</sub> change, characterized in terms of an exponential decay constant, was &#x223C; 7 s. A peristaltic pump (MS-Reglo, Ismatec/Cole-Parmer, Wertheim, Germany) then passed the media from the collection reservoir back to the equilibration reservoirs so that the media could be recycled. The microscope and entire imaging media flow system were enclosed in a temperature control box held at 37&#x00B0;C. Valve regulation, camera trigger and laser excitation were all controlled via custom software written in LabView (National Instruments, Austin, TX).</p>

<title>Imaging with pCO<sub>2</sub> switching</title>
<p>For experiments with pCO<sub>2</sub> switching every 10 s the media was continuously flowed through the imaging chamber, with the reservoir supplying the media being switched every 10 s. Two images were collected every 2.5 s (4.0 s for CHMP4B experiments) with 488nm excitation for pHluorin (100 ms exposure with power between 1-5 mW), followed by 594 nm excitation for mCherry (100 ms exposure with laser power between 5-20 mW; 100mW DPSS laser, Cobolt, Solna, Sweden). A multipass emission filter (zet405/488/594m, Chroma Technology, Bellows Falls, VT) enabled rapid sequential wavelength imaging. For experiments with pCO<sub>2</sub> switching every 120 s the desired media was only applied to the chamber for 10s, followed by no flow for 110 s. During this time sequential 488 nm (100 ms, 1 mW) and 594 nm (100 ms, 1 mW) excitation images were captured every 10 s. All experiments were conducted with 100 Hz azimuthal scanning TIR-FM illumination.</p>

<title>Temporal determination of scission</title>
<p>The cytosolic pH was oscillated by switching the pCO<sub>2</sub> from 0&#x0025; to 10&#x0025; (for an average of 5&#x0025;) every 10 seconds or every 120 s. The cytosolic carbonic anhydrase ensures that the pH in the cytosol closely tracks the pCO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Simon et al., 1994</xref>). At scission the luminal pH of the VLP or virion is no longer continuous with the cytosol and no longer tracks the cytosolic pH. Individual VLPs were identified from the Gag-pHluorin images using Metamorph (version 7.8.10, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and the peak pixel amplitude in a 15 pixel (975 nm) diameter regions of interests centered on individual VLPs was found for all frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>For switching every 10 s we used a custom LabView software lock-in amplifier to find changes in VLP sensitivity to pCO<sub>2</sub> modulation. The data were high-pass filtered (2-pole Butterworth with 0.01 Hz cutoff) to bias the pCO<sub>2</sub> dependent pHluorin intensity fluctuations (with a period of 20s) around 0. This signal was then multiplied by an in-phase sine wave with the same period and a moving average was calculated over a period of 60 s. A significant change in signal indicated a change in sensitivity to pCO<sub>2</sub> modulation. At many of the identified VLPs a clear transition from a high plateau to a low plateau in the lock-in signal was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>). The moment of scission was classified as the halfway amplitude between the two plateaus, with half of the moving window containing pre-scission data and the other half containing post-scission data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 2A</xref>). In the same regions of interest the average mCherry signal (tagged to VPS4A, CHMP4B, CHMP2A, or CHMP2B) was analyzed and peaks were identified in which there was a clear increase followed by decrease in fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>,C,E,G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>). The appearance time was identified when a signal was first observed above cellular background, and the disappearance time when the signal dropped to cellular background. Appearance and disappearance relative to scission were then found by comparing these times to the scission time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>,D,F,H). Based on the observed distribution of appearance and disappearance times relative to scission, with an average of roughly a minute, we excluded data in which scission and ESCRT-III/VPS4A recruitment were more than four minutes apart. Excluded data was attribute to a failed or uncorrelated scission event. &#x223C;25 traces under each condition were collected to gain understanding of the distribution of events.</p>
<p>The average signal-to-noise was approximately 7:1 (peak signal:S.D.) across all ESCRT- III/VPS4A measurements, and ESCRT-III/VPS4A recruitment was estimated to be detectable when the sustained signal deviated from the mean by &#x223C;1-2 standard deviations. Based on this deviation it is estimated that ESCRT-III/VPS4A recruitment below &#x223C;20&#x0025; of peak recruitment would be undetected. We estimate that there are between 10-100 ESCRTs in a complex at peak signal, with the possibility of &#x003C; 10 ESCRTS undetectable in the background noise. Assuming a peak signal (100 ESCRTs) decreases exponentially into the noise after 10s (10 ESCRTS), we estimate only &#x223C;1 ESCRTs would remain after another 10s. This time is comparable to the &#x223C;20s measured between peak disappearance and scission. If the disappearance is faster than exponential, e.g. linear, the ESCRTs will be gone even sooner. This interpolation of ESCRT-IIIs or VPS4A disappearance profiles into the noise indicates the ESCRTs predominantly leave the budding site prior to scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>). For a significant number (&#x003E; 1) of either ESCRT-IIIs or VPS4A to be around following scission there would need to be a second, smaller population that follows much slower disappearance kinetics.</p>
<p>For pCO<sub>2</sub> switching every 120 s for each tracing we determined the first transition of pCO<sub>2</sub> for which the fluorescence had decreased sensitivity, indicating protons were no long freely flowing between cytosol and lumen of the VLP. We assumed that scission must have occurred during the previous plateau of pCO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>-E). For example, if scission occurred during the 10&#x0025; pCO<sub>2</sub> cycle (low fluorescence) then after the next transition to 0&#x0025; pCO<sub>2</sub>, and all subsequent transitions, the fluorescence would be closer to that of the 10&#x0025; (low fluorescence state than the 0&#x0025; pCO<sub>2</sub> (high fluorescence) state. Conversely, if scission occurred during the 0&#x0025; (high fluorescence), future 10&#x0025; pCO<sub>2</sub> plateaus would be closer to the high fluorescence state.</p>
<p>Occasionally traces appeared to be trapped in an intermediate pH state, which we attribute to scission occurring during the transition between pCO<sub>2</sub> states. Individual VLP traces were categorized into being trapped in a high, middle or low pH state by comparing the Gag-pHLuorin signal before and after the VLP became insensitive to pCO<sub>2</sub> switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>

<title>Simultaneous VPS4A and CHMP4B imaging</title>
<p>Gag-mTagBFP, mEGFP-VPS4A and mCherry- CHMP4B were imaged in TIRFM with sequential illumination of 594 nm (100ms, 10-20 mW), 488 nm (100ms, 4-10mW) and 405 nm (100ms, 2-4mW; 120 mW LuxX diode laser, Omicron). mEGFP-VPS4A and mCherry-CHMP4B images were acquired every 5 s and Gag-TagBFP images were acquired every 60 s.

<title>Polarized excitation imaging</title>
<p>Images were collected on an inverted microscope (IX-81, Olympus) with a custom built through-the-objective (100X UAPON 1.49 NA, Olympus) polarized TIRFM illuminator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). Throughout imaging the excitation TIR light was azimuthally scanned at 200 Hz with mirror galvanometers (Nutfield Technology, Hudson, NH) in order to reduce spatial illumination nonuniformities. A multiband polychroic (zt405/488/594/647rpc 2mm substrate, Chroma) was positioned between the galvanometers and objective in order to isolate the excitation light from the emitted light. Light from a 488nm laser (100 mW LuxX diode laser, Omicron, Rodgau-Dudenhofen, Germany) was modulated between being polarized perpendicular <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="281774_inline15.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> or parallel (&#x015D;) to the glass surface by passing the light through an EOM (Conoptics, Danbury, CT) and quarter-wave plate prior to the galvanometer scan-head. The polarization generated by the EOM was modulated in sync with the galvanometers such that during scanning a <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="281774_inline16.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> or &#x015D;state was maintained at all azimuthal positions. The scanning polar angle was selected such that the excitation light was just beyond the TIR critical angle, minimizing &#x015D;polarized light contaminating <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="281774_inline17.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>excitation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>A combined <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="281774_inline18.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>/&#x015D;ratio image was collected every 30s. To generate this ratio image a sequential series of 10 <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="281774_inline19.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>and &#x015D;images were collected, divided (after subtracting camera offset), and then averaged. Each <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="281774_inline20.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>or &#x015D;image had an exposure of 5 ms (laser power between 25-50mW), with a new image collected every 15 ms. Thus, in 30 ms a single<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="281774_inline21.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>&#x015D;image was generated, and then 10 of these images (over a 300 ms duration) were averaged (ImageJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) to create the combined ratio image. The short period was utilized in order to minimize artifacts in the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="281774_inline22.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>&#x015D;ratio image from VLP or cell movement. The galvonometers, EOM, camera shutter, and laser shutters were all driven/triggered by a multifunction data acquisition board (PCIe-6323, National Instruments) and controlled from custom written software in LabView. Images were streamed from a CMOS camera (Flash-4.0, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) to a workstation (T7500, Dell, Round Rock, TX) running image acquisition software (Metamorph). A single band emission filter (ET525/50m, Chroma) was used to isolate fluorophore emission. In order to characterize the amount of Gag in an assembling VLP, an average <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="281774_inline23.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>&#x002B;2 &#x015D; image was also generated at each time point.</p>

On these resampled images P/S and P &#x002B; 2S values were found by averaging the resampled pixel intensities that are within 100nm of the peak fit locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S1">Figure 4 &#x2013; figure supplement 1</xref>). For frames prior to the appearance of a puncta P/S and P &#x002B; 2S values were determined using the fit location of the first frame in which there was a puncta fit. For each tagged version of Gag the average P/S value for background and assembled VLPs was calculated by finding an average P/S for each trace before assembly and after a plateau was reached, and then averaging across all traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A relative time to half growth for each VLP was determined by finding the halfway to assembly point (i.e. the point where the intensity is halfway between the intensity at assembly beginning and plateau) and then finding the normalized time at this point relative to the time assembly began and appeared to reach a plateau. This normalized time was between 0 and 1. A normalized time to halfway drop in P/S was also found (normalized to the same time scale) and these values were subtracted to find: t<sub>1 2 of P&#x002B;2S</sub> -t<sub>1 2 of P S</sub> (normalized). All fluorophore combinations were included in the P/S histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) since all combinations had similar P/S characteristics.</p>
