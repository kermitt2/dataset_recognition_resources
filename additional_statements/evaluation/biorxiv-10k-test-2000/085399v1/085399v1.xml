<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>The availability of dense genotypes and whole-genome sequence variants from various sources offers the opportunity to compile large data sets consisting of tens of thousands of animals with genotypes for millions of polymorphic sites that may enhance the power of genomic analyses. The imputation of missing genotypes ensures that all individuals have genotypes for a shared set of variants.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We evaluated the accuracy of imputation from dense genotypes to whole-genome sequence variants in 249 Fleckvieh and 450 Holstein cattle using <italic>Minimac</italic> and <italic>FImpute</italic>. The sequence variants of a subset of the animals were reduced to the variants that were included in the Illumina BovineHD genotyping array and subsequently inferred <italic>in silico</italic> using either within- or multi-breed reference populations. The accuracy of imputation varied considerably across chromosomes and dropped at regions where the bovine genome contains segmental duplications. Depending on the imputation strategy, the correlation between imputed and true genotypes ranged from 0.898 to 0.952. The accuracy of imputation was higher with <italic>Minimac</italic> than <italic>FImpute</italic> particularly for rare alleles. Considering a multi-breed reference population increased the accuracy of imputation, particularly when <italic>FImpute</italic> was used to infer genotypes. When the sequence variants were imputed using <italic>Minimac</italic>, the true genotypes were more correlated to predicted allele dosages than best-guess genotypes. The computing costs to impute 23,256,743 sequence variants in 6958 animals were 10-fold higher with <italic>Minimac</italic> than <italic>FImpute</italic>. Association studies with imputed sequence variants revealed seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) for milk fat percentage. Two known causal mutations in the <italic>DGAT1</italic> and <italic>GHR</italic> genes were the most significantly associated variants at two QTL on chromosomes 14 and 20 when <italic>Minimac</italic> was used to infer genotypes.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The population-based imputation of millions of sequence variants in large cohorts provides accurate genotypes and is computationally feasible. Using a reference population that includes individuals from many breeds increases the accuracy of imputation particularly at low-frequency variants. Considering allele dosages rather than best-guess genotypes as explanatory variables is advantageous for association studies with imputed sequence variants.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Several genotyping arrays that comprise a varying number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are routinely used for genome-wide genotyping in cattle. Cows are usually genotyped using cost-effective low-density genotyping arrays whereas bulls are mostly genotyped at higher density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Moreover, the sequencing of important ancestors of many cattle breeds yielded genotypes at millions of polymorphic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Combining the genotype data from various sources into a single large data set may enhance the power of genome-wide analyses. The imputation of missing genotypes is necessary to ensure that all individuals have genotypes for a shared set of variants. Genotype imputation may also infer dense genotypes <italic>in silico</italic> for animals that were genotyped at lower density using animals that were genotyped at a higher density as a reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Algorithms that infer missing genotypes apply family- (<italic>e.g.</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]) or population-based (<italic>e.g.</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]) imputation approaches or a combination thereof (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]). Family-based imputation approaches rely on Mendelian transmission rules in pedigrees to infer missing genotypes. Population-based imputation approaches exploit linkage disequilibrium (LD) between adjacent markers to predict missing genotypes using a probabilistic framework without (explicitly) considering pedigree information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. While population-based imputation approaches are accurate, their computing costs are too high to infer genotypes for a large number of animals and markers for routine applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Methods that apply a combination of family- and population-based imputation approaches exploit shared haplotypes among relatives thereby enabling rapid imputation of genotypes for tens of thousands of individuals and millions of markers <italic>in silico</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The accuracy of imputation from low to higher density depends on the relationships between target and reference animals, genotype density in both panels, allele frequencies of the imputed variants, LD between adjacent markers and algorithms applied to infer missing genotypes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]). These parameters also affect the accuracy of imputation from dense genotypes to sequence variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, the accurate imputation of low-frequency variants is critical with sequence data because rare alleles are more frequent in sequence than array-derived variants and the LD between rare alleles and array-derived variants is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>A number of studies with simulated and real sequence data in cattle indicated that using imputed sequence variants may improve genomic predictions and facilitate the detection of causal trait variants because the polymorphisms that underlie phenotypic variation are included in the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. However, the benefits of dense marker maps for genome-wide analyses may be compromised when the accuracy of imputation is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of imputation for sequence variants in two cattle breeds using different imputation algorithms and reference populations. We perform association studies between imputed sequence variants and milk fat percentage in 6958 Fleckvieh bulls and show that the imputation strategy is critical to pinpoint causal mutations.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>We used whole-genome sequence data of 1577 taurine animals that were included in run 5 of the of the 1000 bull genomes project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The reads were aligned to the UMD3.1 bovine reference genome using the <italic>BWA-MEM</italic> algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. SNPs, short insertions and deletions were genotyped for all sequenced animals simultaneously using a multi-sample variant calling pipeline that was implemented with the <italic>mpileup</italic> module of <italic>SAMtools</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and that is described in Daetwyler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The variant calling yielded genotypes at 39,721,987 biallelic sites for 1577 animals. We considered genotypes at 22,737,136 autosomal sequence variants that had a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 0.5&#x0025; to build the genomic relationship matrix among the sequenced animals using the <italic>plink</italic> (version 1.9) software tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Principal components of the genomic relationship matrix were calculated using the <italic>GCTA</italic> (version 1.25.3) software tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Following the inspection of the top principal components, animals whose breed was uncertain were removed leaving 249 Fleckvieh (FV) and 450 Holstein (HOL) cattle (see Additional file 1 Figure S1).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Design of cross-validation scenarios</title>
<p>The imputation from dense genotypes to full sequence variants was evaluated using 15-fold cross-validation in FV and HOL cattle. For each fold, the sequenced animals were divided into reference and validation animals. Forty-nine FV and 100 HOL animals, that were a random subset of the sequenced animals, were considered as validation animals. All remaining animals were considered as a multi-breed reference population. The within-breed reference populations consisted of only 200 FV or 350 HOL animals. We considered only sequence variants that were polymorphic in 249 FV or 450 HOL animals. The genotypes of the validation animals were reduced to the variants that were included in the Illumina BovineHD genotyping array (HD) to mimic dense genotypes. The masked genotypes of the validation animals were subsequently inferred <italic>in silico</italic> using full sequence information from the reference animals. The selection of validation animals and subsequent imputation of genotypes was repeated 15 times for six chromosomes (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Evaluation of the accuracy of imputation</title>
<p>The overall accuracy of imputation was the mean correlation between <italic>in silico</italic> imputed and true (sequenced) genotypes (r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>) across 15 folds and six chromosomes analysed. We additionally grouped the imputed sequence variants into 50 classes with regard to their MAF in the reference population. The r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>&#x2013;value for each MAF class was the mean value across six chromosomes and 15 folds. To detect intra-chromosomal variations in the accuracy of imputation, we calculated r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>-values for successive 1 Mb segments along each chromosome analysed. Differences between imputation scenarios were tested using two-tailed t-tests.</p>

<title>Imputation methods</title>
<p>The performance of the <italic>FImpute</italic> (version 2.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and <italic>Minimac3</italic> (version 2.0.1, henceforth referred to as <italic>Minimac</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] software tools was evaluated using default parameter settings. The algorithm implemented in <italic>FImpute</italic> uses family and population-based information to infer haplotypes and missing genotypes. A pedigree consisting of 47,012 FV animals tracing back ancestry information to animals born in 1925 was considered when genotypes were inferred using <italic>FImpute</italic>. Pedigree records for sequenced animals from other breeds were also included. However, their pedigrees included only first-degree relatives. Genotypes for the imputed sequence variants were coded as 0, 1 and 2 for homozygous, heterozygous and alternative homozygous animals, respectively.</p>
<p>The algorithm implemented in the <italic>Minimac</italic> software tool uses previously phased genotypes, <italic>i.e.</italic>, it takes haplotypes as input for reference and validation animals. Haplotype phases were estimated separately for the reference and validation animals using the phasing algorithm implemented in the <italic>Eagle</italic> (version 2.3) software tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Both <italic>Eagle</italic> and <italic>Minimac</italic> do not consider pedigree information to infer haplotypes and missing genotypes. <italic>Minimac</italic> provides best-guess genotypes (coded as 0, 1 and 2 for homozygous, heterozygous and alternative homozygous animals, respectively) and allele dosages (continuously distributed values ranging from 0 to 2) for the imputed sequence variants. The r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>&#x2013;values were calculated for best-guess genotypes (<italic>Minimac</italic><sub>BG</sub>) and allele dosages (<italic>Minimac</italic><sub>DOS</sub>).</p>

<title>Imputation of sequence variants in 6958 Fleckvieh animals</title>
<p>We imputed 23,256,743 autosomal sequence variants that were polymorphic in 249 sequenced FV animals in 6958 FV bulls that had (partially imputed) array-derived genotypes at 603,662 autosomal variants (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]). Genotype imputation was performed with either <italic>FImpute</italic> or <italic>Minimac</italic> using either within- or multi-breed reference populations that consisted of 249 FV animals or 1577 animals from various bovine breeds (see above). Haplotype phases for reference and target animals were estimated using the <italic>Eagle</italic> software tool (see above). The LD among polymorphic sites was calculated as the squared correlation between imputed allele dosages.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Accuracy of imputation at two known causal mutations</title>
<p>712 and 902 FV animals that had imputed sequence variants also had direct genotypes for two causal mutations in the <italic>DGAT1</italic> (rs109234250 and rs109326954, p.A232K) and <italic>GHR</italic> (rs385640152, p.F279Y) genes that were obtained using TaqMan&#x00AE; genotyping assays (Life Technologies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. The accuracy of imputation at both sites was the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Association analyses in Fleckvieh cattle</title>
<p>Association tests between 23,256,743 imputed sequence variants and milk fat percentage were carried out in 6958 FV bulls using a variance components-based approach that was implemented in the <italic>EMMAX</italic> software tool and that accounts for population stratification by fitting a genomic relationship matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. The genomic relationship matrix was built using array-derived genotypes of 603,662 (partially imputed) autosomal SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Daughter yield deviations (DYDs) for milk fat percentage were the response variables. The genotypes were coded as 0, 1 and 2 for homozygous, heterozygous and alternative homozygous animals, respectively, when sequence variants were imputed using <italic>FImpute</italic>. When the sequence variants were imputed using <italic>Minimac</italic>, we considered both best-guess genotypes and allele dosages as explanatory variables for the association tests. Sequence variants with P values less than 2.1&#x00D7;10<sup>-9</sup> (Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold for 23,256,743 tests) were considered as significantly associated.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We evaluated the accuracy of imputation from dense genotypes to full sequence variants in 249 FV and 450 HOL animals using sequence data on bovine chromosomes (BTA for Bos taurus) 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25. The number of polymorphic sites ranged from 413,371 (BTA25) to 1,444,299 (BTA1) and from 383,072 (BTA25) to 1,382,987 (BTA1) in FV and HOL, respectively, indicating that genetic diversity is higher in FV than HOL cattle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Rare variants were more frequent among the sequence than HD variants; between 58.12 and 60.55&#x0025; of the sequence variants and between 14.27 and 18.55&#x0025; of the HD variants had a MAF lower than 10&#x0025;.</p>

<title>Evaluation of cross-validation accuracy of imputation</title>
<p>The correlation between imputed and sequenced genotypes (r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>) was higher in HOL than FV cattle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) likely reflecting that more HOL animals were in the reference population. When within-breed reference populations were considered, the r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>&#x2013;values were 0.898, 0.908 and 0.934 for <italic>FImpute, Minimac</italic><sub>BG</sub> and <italic>Minimac</italic><sub>DOS</sub> in FV and 0.912, 0.929 and 0.951 in HOL, respectively. Adding animals from various breeds to the reference panel increased r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub> in FV, particularly when <italic>FImpute</italic> was used to impute missing genotypes (P=7.5x10<sup>-11</sup>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The highest accuracy of imputation in FV (r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>=0.939) was achieved using <italic>Minimac</italic><sub>DOS</sub> with a multi-breed reference population. In HOL, a multi-breed reference population increased r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub> when <italic>FImpute</italic> was used to infer missing genotypes (P=4.0x10<sup>-4</sup>). However, the use of a multi-breed reference population had little effect on the r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>-values in HOL when <italic>Minimac</italic> was used (P&#x003E;0.12). Using <italic>Minimac</italic><sub>DOS</sub> with a within-breed reference population provided the highest accuracy of imputation (r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>=0.951) in HOL. Regardless of the composition of the reference population, the r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>&#x2013;values were higher for <italic>Minimac</italic><sub>DOS</sub> than <italic>Minimac</italic><sub>BG</sub> in both breeds (P<sub>FV</sub>&#x003C;2.9x10<sup>-6</sup>, P<sub>HOL</sub>&#x003C;3.9x10<sup>-6</sup>).</p>

<p>A decline in the accuracy of imputation was evident for low-frequency variants across all scenarios tested. While r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub> was high for variants with a MAF higher than 10&#x0025;, it was considerably less for rare variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a-b</xref>).

<p>The accuracy of imputation varied considerably across chromosomes. r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub> was high for sequence variants located on BTA1, BTA20 and BTA25. However, it was lower for sequence variants located on BTA5, BTA10 and BTA15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c-d</xref>). This pattern was observed regardless of the reference population and imputation algorithm used. To investigate the reason for the low accuracy of imputation observed for some chromosomes, we calculated r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>-values within successive 1 Mb windows along the six chromosomes analysed. Multiple (partially extended) segments with high imputation errors were located on chromosomes 5, 10 and 15 (see Additional file 2 Figure S2) at positions where the bovine genome contains segmental duplications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Such segments were not detected along the chromosomes that had a higher accuracy of imputation (BTA1, BTA20, BTA25).</p>

<title>Pinpointing causal mutations among imputed sequence variants</title>
<p>We imputed genotypes for 756,135 and 679,738 sequence variants that were located on BTA14 and BTA20, respectively, in 6958 FV animals using either <italic>FImpute</italic> or <italic>Minimac</italic> and considering different reference populations. To evaluate the ability to detect causal mutations, the imputed genotypes were tested for association with milk fat percentage. Milk fat percentage was the target trait because two variants in the <italic>DGAT1</italic> (rs109326954, pA232K) and <italic>GHR</italic> (rs385640152, p.F279Y) genes have large effects on the milk composition in many cattle breeds including FV. In 249 sequenced FV animals, the minor allele frequencies of rs109326954 and rs385640152 were 6.2 and 7.2&#x0025;. Both variants were more frequent in the multi-breed reference population (17.3 and 12.1&#x0025;, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Depending on the reference population and imputation algorithm used, the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes was between 99.3 and 99.9&#x0025; and between 86.1 and 99.4&#x0025; for rs109326954 and rs385640152, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

<p>A total of 239 variants located between 91,857,670 and 93,955,207 bp on BTA5 were significantly associated (P&#x003C;2.1x10<sup>-9</sup>) with fat percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, see Additional file 7 Table S1). Thirteen variants in the first intron of the <italic>MGST1</italic> gene (<italic>microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1</italic>) were in high LD (r<sup>2</sup>&#x003E;0.95) with each other and had markedly lower P values (P&#x003C;6.5x10<sup>-21</sup>) than all other variants. These 13 variants were also associated with milk composition in New Zealand dairy cows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The top variant (rs208248675) was located at 93,945,991 bp.

<p>A QTL for fat percentage on BTA6 encompassed the casein gene complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, see Additional file 7 Table S1). One hundred and sixty-four variants with P&#x003C;2.1x10<sup>-9</sup> were located between 87,084,144 and 87,296,017 bp. The most significantly associated variant (rs109193501 at 87,154,594 bp, P=7.6x10<sup>-14</sup>) was located in an intron of the <italic>CSN1S1</italic> gene (<italic>casein alpha s1</italic>).</p>
<p>Two hundred and sixty-two variants located within a 50 kb interval (between 103,274,736 and 103,324,728 bp) on BTA11 were associated with fat percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, see Additional file 7 Table S1).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We evaluated the accuracy of imputation from dense genotypes to sequence variants in 1577 sequenced animals which is a four- to eight-fold increase in sample size compared to previous studies in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Our findings are likely to be relevant for many cattle populations because we considered animals from two breeds with different effective population sizes as validation panel and inferred sequence variants on six chromosomes that reflect a broad spectrum of LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. The accuracy of imputation was the correlation between imputed and sequenced genotypes (r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>), which is a measure that depends less on the allele frequencies of the sequence variants than <italic>e.g.</italic>, the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. However, the cross-validation procedure that was applied in our study yields reliable results only when the quality of the sequence data is high. Low fold sequencing coverage and sequencing or assembly errors may result in flawed genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Genotype imputation might infer true genotypes at such positions that differ from the sequenced genotypes thereby underestimating the accuracy of imputation. Considering that the genotype error rates were low in the sequenced FV and HOL animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], it is unlikely that our findings are biased due to flawed genotypes at sequence variants.</p>
<p>We assessed the performance of <italic>FImpute</italic> and <italic>Minimac</italic> because both methods can impute millions of polymorphic sites in large populations within a reasonable time. Previous studies showed that <italic>FImpute</italic> is more accurate than other tools with similar computing costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. The population-based genotype imputation algorithm implemented in <italic>Minimac</italic> is highly accurate and fast because it takes previously phased genotypes as input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. We phased the target population using <italic>Eagle</italic> because it enables timely and accurate haplotype inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The computing costs to impute 23 million sequence variants in 6958 animals were more than ten-fold higher with <italic>Eagle</italic> and <italic>Minimac</italic> than <italic>FImpute</italic>. However, the wall-clock time was only 1.67-fold higher because <italic>Eagle</italic> and <italic>Minimac</italic> support multi-threading to reduce the process time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. The difference in computing costs would be greater when haplotypes were not available for the reference animals. Since many variant detection pipelines include phasing and imputation algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], the computing time required to phase the sequence data was not considered in our study. However, the phasing of the reference panel was necessary because the variant detection pipeline of the 1000 bull genomes project was applied to successive 5 Mb segments rather than whole chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The accuracy of imputation was higher with <italic>Minimac</italic> than <italic>FImpute</italic>, although <italic>Minimac</italic> does not consider pedigree information. Most sequenced animals of our study were selected in a way that they represent a large proportion of the genetic variation of current populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. They are likely less related with each other than random animals from the population, although some parent-offspring pairs were included. The accuracy of imputation might be higher when reference and target animals are closely related particularly when <italic>FImpute</italic> is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. However, dense genotypes for reference and target animals, <italic>e.g.</italic>, sequence and HD-derived genotypes, can be used to identify short shared haplotypes among apparently unrelated animals that originate from ancient ancestors possibly predating the separation of breeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Including reference animals from various breeds increased the accuracy of imputation, particularly in FV cattle. The principal components analysis revealed that animals from many breeds clustered nearby the FV population indicating that they are distantly related whereas the HOL animals formed a cluster that was separated from all other breeds. The benefit of a multi-breed reference population on the accuracy of imputation was less pronounced in HOL cattle. Since the number of reference animals was nearly twice as high in HOL, our results may also corroborate the suggestion that multi-breed reference panels are particularly useful to impute genotypes when the reference population is small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. In agreement with previous studies in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], a multi-breed reference population increased the accuracy of imputation at rare variants likely reflecting the shared ancestry of many cattle populations and the limited number of sequenced animals per breed. However, it seems advisable to periodically evaluate different imputation strategies because multi-breed reference populations may compromise the imputation of sequence variants when the diversity of the reference panel increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The population-based imputation of sequence variants was particularly advantageous at rare alleles corroborating previous findings in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. The true genotypes were even more correlated to predicted allele dosages than best-guess genotypes which is in line with the findings of Br&#x00F8;ndum et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. An association study between allele dosages and milk fat percentage revealed that two rare (MAF&#x003C;10&#x0025;) causal mutations in the <italic>DGAT1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] and <italic>GHR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] genes were the most significantly associated variants at two QTL on BTA14 and BTA20. This finding demonstrates that utilizing predicted allele dosages in association studies with imputed sequence variants can pinpoint causal mutations which agrees with Zheng at al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>] and Khatkar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. So far, imputed sequence variants did not substantially improve the accuracies of genomic predictions in real data which might partly result from flawed genotypes at low-frequency variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Our results show that allele dosages are more accurate than best-guess genotypes particularly at rare variants because they better reflect imputation uncertainty. However, the analysis of allele dosages for millions of sequence variants in tens of thousands of individuals for genomic predictions is computationally costly and has not been attempted so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Since the proportion of rare alleles is more than three-fold higher in sequence than HD variants, further research is warranted to investigate if allele dosages may enhance genomic predictions with imputed sequence variants.</p>
<p>Although the accuracy of imputation was high in our study, the r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>&#x2013;values varied considerably across chromosomes and dropped at multiple positions along the genome. Previous studies using array-derived genotypes showed that a sudden decline in imputation accuracy may indicate intra- or inter-chromosomal misplacement of SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. We detected strikingly low r<sub>IMP,SEQ</sub>&#x2013;values in regions where the bovine genome contains large segmental duplications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The population-wide imputation of sequence variants for two chromosomes (BTA12, BTA23) was not possible using <italic>Fimpute</italic>. Assessing the accuracy of imputation along these chromosomes using cross-validation revealed two large segments including the highly variable major histocompatibility complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] with low imputation quality. We were able to eventually impute genotypes for BTA12 and BTA23 using <italic>FImpute</italic> when we excluded those segments from the reference panel. Imputing genotypes within both segments was possible using <italic>Minimac</italic>. However, the inferred genotypes are flawed and must be treated with caution as our results show (see Additional file 4 Figure S4). While an improved assembly of the reference genome may resolve some of these problems, a better resolution of large structural elements is not possible using short paired-end DNA sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Since flawed genotypes are likely to compromise downstream analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], it seems advisable to exclude sequence variants within segments of low imputation quality from the target population and retain the array-derived genotypes only.</p>
<p>Our findings show that the composition of the reference population and the choice of the imputation algorithm are critical to infer accurate genotypes thereby enabling us to pinpoint causal mutations in association studies with imputed sequence variants. When the accuracy of imputation is low, causal variants may be &#x201C;buried&#x201D; among other variants in LD (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,d</xref>). In such situations, association testing will not reveal true causal mutations because variants with lower P values are likely to be prioritized as candidate causal variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Our findings also show that true causal variants are not necessarily the top variants in association studies even when their genotypes are almost perfectly imputed. Although the imputation accuracy for the causal p.A232K-polymorphism in the <italic>DGAT1</italic> gene was greater than 99.5&#x0025;, several adjacent variants had identical or slightly lower P values likely indicating sampling errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] or synthetic associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Nevertheless, the mutations in the <italic>DGAT1</italic> and <italic>GHR</italic> genes offer a convenient approach to evaluate the ability to detect causal mutations with imputed sequence variants, because both variants segregate in many cattle breeds where phenotypes for fat percentage are available.</p>
<p>Our association study with more than 23 million sequence variants detected seven QTL that were significantly associated with milk fat percentage. Applying a less stringent significance threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>] would reveal additional QTL (see Additional file 6 Figure S6). Since we were able to pinpoint the actual causal mutations at two QTL, it is likely that causal mutations for other QTL are among the most significantly associated variants. However, the QTL identified in our study include several sequence variants in high LD and with similar P values rendering the identification of causal sites difficult. Association studies in animals from multiple breeds may facilitate differentiation between causal and non-causal sites in LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Causal sites may be located on ancient haplotypes that still segregate across multiple breeds as is the case for the fat percentage QTL on BTA5. Our association study revealed thirteen candidate causal variants in high LD in an intron of the <italic>MGST1</italic> gene that had markedly lower P values than all other variants. It is very likely that one of those variants is the actual causal polymorphism because they were also highly significantly associated with milk composition in another dairy cattle breed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. An improved functional annotation of the bovine genome and a fine-mapping strategy that incorporates biological information may facilitate to pinpoint causal mutations at such QTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Inferring accurate genotypes for millions of sequence variants in large bovine cohorts is feasible using population-based imputation algorithms. Using a multi-breed reference population increases the accuracy of imputation for rare alleles. Considering the predicted allele dosages rather than best-guess genotypes as explanatory variables is beneficial for association studies with imputed sequence variants. The ability to pinpoint causal mutations in association studies with imputed sequence variants depends on the composition of the reference population and imputation approach used to infer genotypes.</p>

<p>Title: <bold>Detailed view of a milk fat percentage QTL on bovine chromosome 27</bold></p>
<p>Description: Different colour represents the linkage disequilibrium between the top variant (violet) and all other variants. Blue arrows indicate the direction of the gene transcription. The top variant (36,211,258 bp) was associated with fat percentage (P=1.9&#x00D7;10<sup>-8</sup>) albeit not at genome-scale. Twenty-two variants in high LD (r<sup>2</sup>&#x003E;0.68) with the top variant were located between 36,200,888 and 36,253,406 bp and had P values less than 7.7&#x00D7;10<sup>-7</sup>. Among those were three candidate causal variants (36,211,252 bp with P=2.4&#x00D7;10<sup>-8</sup>, 36,211,708 bp with P=2.8&#x00D7;10<sup>-8</sup>, 36,209,319 bp with P=3.3&#x00D7;10<sup>-8</sup>) for fat content in the early lactation that were reported in Daetwyler et al.

<p>Description: Variants located on chromosomes 5, 6, 11, 16 and 19 with P values less than 2.1&#x00D7;10<sup>-9</sup>. The positions of the variants correspond to the UMD3.1 assembly of the bovine genome. The substitution effects (beta, standard error of beta) are given for the alternative allele.</p>
