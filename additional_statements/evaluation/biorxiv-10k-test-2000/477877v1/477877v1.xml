<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>EMT has the crucial effect on the progression and metastasis of tumor. This work will elucidate the role of miR-425 in EMT and development of TNBC.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The differential miRNA expression among non-tumor, para-tumor (adjacent tissue of tumor) and tumor tissues was analyzed. The luciferase activities of TGF-&#x03B2;1 3&#x2019; UTR treated with miR-425 were determined.

The expression of TGF-&#x03B2;1 and markers of epithelial cell and mesenchymal cell were analyzed. The influences of miR-425 on development of TNBC through inducing EMT by targeting TGF-&#x03B2; 1 and TGF-&#x03B2;1/SMAD3 signaling pathway in TNBC cell lines were investigated. Furthermore, Xenograft mice were used to explore the potential roles of miR-425 on EMT and development of TNBC <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Compared with non-tumor tissues, 9 miRNAs were upregulated and 3 miRNAs were down-regulated in tumor tissues. The relative expression of miR-425 in tumor tissues was obviously much lower than that in para-tumor and non-tumor tissues. MiR-425 suppressed TGF-&#x03B2;1 expression, additionally inhibited expression of mesenchymal cell markers, while exerted effects on cell proliferation and migration of TNBC cell lines. Moreover, the agomir of miR-425 could protect against development process in murine TNBC xenogarft model.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In worldwide, the most usual cancer of women is BC (Breast cancer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Moreover, the morbidity of BC is the seventh among all cancers, and its mortality rate is third in the women world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. According to different prognoses and options of treatment, BC is divided into several subtypes disease associated with heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. In clinical, corresponding to expression of ERBB2/HER2 (epidermal growth factor receptor 2), PR (progesterone receptor), and ER (estrogen receptor), patient with BC are classified as three subtypes of triple-negative, HER2&#x002B;, and ER&#x002B;/PR&#x002B;. The overall prognosis of patients with Her2&#x002B; or ER&#x002B;/PR&#x002B; subtypes has been dramatic improved by trentment with HER2 targeted hormone therapy. But, base on the aggressiveness of TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) and the lack of effective targeted therapy, the overall survival rate of patients with TNBC is the worst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. About 20&#x0025; patients with BC is TNBC, and the high metastasis rate could be seen in patients with TNBC, such as visceral organs (brain, liver, and lung, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic interventions for preventing and treating metastasis of TNBC.</p>
<p>EMT (Epithelial to mesenchymal transition) is the critical course, and has the important role in metastasis and progression of cancer. The invasion and migration abilities increase, and epithelial polarity vanishes away during this process together with epithelial markers down-expression and mesenchymal markers over-expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Some transcription factors regulate the process of EMT, including Zeb1, Slug, Snail, TGF&#x03B2;, and Twist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. The biological process of EMT is complex, including losing characteristics of epithelia, and acquiring mesenchymal phenotypes. Moreover, the expressions of mesenchymal cell markers, such as Smad 3, &#x03B1;-SMA (alpha smooth muscle actin), etc, were promoted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The growth of tumor relies not only on tumor malignancy but also the relationship between stromal and tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The system of tumor vessel includes pericytes, smooth muscle cells and, epithelial cells (ECs), which plays an important role in tumors progression and angiogenesis activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. The EMT process of ECs is conduced to the progression of cancer, that has been identified by recent researches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. In this process, the properties of migration or invasion and markers of mesenchyma (e.g., &#x03B1;-SMA, FSP-1) are obtained, the epithelial markers (e.g., CD31, VE-cadherin) of ECs and junctions of cell-cell were losed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. These investigations confirm that all kinds of pathological processes occurs with, for example, cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Therefore, inhibition of EMT process may be a good tumor treatment strategy.</p>
<p>Lately, some scholars have revealed that TGF-&#x03B2;1 is a cytokine with multifunction, and plays a crucial role in pathophysiology of BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The canonical and noncanonical TGF-&#x03B2;1 signaling pathways gene mutations encoding TGF-&#x03B2;1 or the change of TGF-&#x03B2;1 receptors associates with BC oncogenic activity. In BC, the progression of epithelial cell cycle is inhibited by TGF-&#x03B2;1 at early phase while apoptosis is promoted, which indicates its suppressive effects on tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. But, this cytokine promotes tumor progression in the late phase and associated with metastasis or invasiveness of cancer, and higher motility of cancer cell. In addition, TGF-&#x03B2;1 induces EMT, and is related to modification of microenvironment in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The well known "TGF-&#x03B2;1 paradox" is called to describe this phenomenon, which suggests TGF-&#x03B2;1 can be used for the novel therapy approaches on BC with better understanding its functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. By protecting against TGF-&#x03B2;1, several drugs for nonclinical and clinical investigation in early stages are developed based on these knowledge.</p>
<p>The current realization demonstrated that mesenchymal characteristics of TNBC cells with paclitaxel-resistantance, and these cells has higher mesenchymal markers expression, including N-cadherin and vimentin. Thus, through inducing inhibition of TGF-&#x03B2; signaling pathway can promote chemotherapeutic effect on anti-tumor and reduce metastasis after paclitaxel therapy with kinase inhibitor for TGF-&#x03B2;1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Therefore, it indicates that the novel potential strategy for TNBC therapy through combination with kinase inhibitors of TGF-&#x03B2; and its receptor.</p>
<p>Many data confirmed that microRNAs have crucial effect on activity of epithelial or EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. So, in our investigation, the relationship between down-expression of miR-425 and TNBC was identified by comparing miRNA expression profiles from breast cancer tissues of patients with TNBC. Over-expression of miR-425 played an important regulator in negative feedback for TGF-&#x03B2; signaling and canonical pathway through suppressing expression of TGF-&#x03B2;1 and its changes associated with EMT in development of TNBC.</p>
<p>The system of tumor vessel includes pericytes, smooth muscle cells and, epithelial cells (ECs), which plays an important role in tumors progression and angiogenesis activation, such as breast cancer. The EMT process of ECs of breast cancer is conduced to the progression of cancer, that has been identified by recent researches. Therefore, the human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T of ECs were choosed to address these process.</p>

<title>Specimens of patients</title>
<p>The tissues of patients with TNBC were obtained from January 2014 to December 2017. All these patients were performed with mastectomy for BC, and did not receive any treatment before hospital. At the operation day, samples of tumor tissues, para-tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues were collected and handled immediately, respectively. The para-tumor is adjacent tissue of tumor.</p>
<p>This investigation and the utilization of human specimens in this work had been approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospitals (Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China) on the basis of the Declaration of Helsinki. We clearly confirmed that the informed consents were obtained from all patients. Moreover, the recorded and documented of participant consents were kept in our hospital.</p>

<title>Data extraction and analysis</title>
<p>All the mature miRNAs sequences were identified through library preparation of reference sequences with miRBase (version 19.0) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Given that the length of minimum read was 50 nucleotides, specific adapters were used to anneal to their 3&#x2019; ends and extended the entire small RNAs during the library preparation. Thus, we removed the adapters and obtained the potential miRNAs with the length of 15-30 nucleotides for further analysis using cut adapt software in silico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Subsequently, the sequences were perfectly matched with the prepared reference library with Bowtie (version 0.12.7) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie/0.12.7/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie/0.12.7/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Then the numbers of mapped reads were counted for every miRNA. Acquired data of all samples were normalized with RPM (Reads per Million) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>

Subculture the stock cultures of cells to 2&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml in medium containing 50&#x00B5;M 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), when a density of 2&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml is reached, add mimics, inhibitors of miR-425 or its control, respectively. Wash the cells twice with the above medium centrifugation at 300&#x00D7;g for 5 minutes. 4. Determine cell number and viability (by trypan blue exclusion), and resuspend the cells to a final concentration of 1&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in the above medium. Dispense 50&#x00B5;l of the cell suspension (5,000 cells) into all wells of the 96-well plate prepared. The total volume in each well should be 100&#x00B5;l. Incubate the plate at 37&#x00B0;C for 48 h in a humidified, 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Add 20&#x00B5;l per well of CellTiter 96<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> AQueous One Solution Reagent. Incubate the plate at 37&#x00B0; C for 2 h in a humidified, 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Record the absorbance at 490nm using a 96-well plate reader.</p>
<p>The ability of cells migration was detected using wound scratch assay using CytoSelect&#x2122; 24-Well Wound Healing Assay kit (Cat. no. CBA-120-5; Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Allow the 24-well plate with CytoSelect&#x2122; Wound Healing Inserts to warm up at room temperature for 10 minutes. Using sterile forceps, orient the desired number of inserts in the plate wells with their &#x201C;wound field&#x201D; aligned in the same direction. Ensure that the inserts have firm contact with the bottom of the plate well. Create a cell suspension containing 1&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in media containing 10&#x0025; fetal bovine serum (FBS). Add 500 &#x00B5;L of cell suspension to each well by carefully inserting the pipet tip through the open end at the top of the insert. For optimal cell dispersion, add 250 &#x00B5;L of cell suspension to either side of the open ends at the top of the insert. Take care to avoid bumping and moving the inserts. Incubate cells in a cell culture incubator overnight or until a monolayer forms. Carefully remove the insert from the well to begin the wound healing assay. Use sterile forceps to grab and lift the insert slowly from the plate well. Avoid twisting the insert as this will damage the wound field. Slowly aspirate and discard the media from the wells. Wash wells with media to remove dead cells and debris. Finally, add media to wells to keep cells hydrated. Visualize wells under a light microscope. Repeat wash if wells still have debris or unattached cells. When washing is complete, add media with FBS and/or compounds to continue cell culture and wound healing process. Incubate cells in cell culture incubator. For best results, use a reticle with micrometer measurements to create a defined surface area in order to monitor the closing, or &#x201C;healing&#x201D; of the wound. Focus on the center of the wound field. Create the defined surface area by multiplying the width of the wound field (0.9 mm) by the length. Monitor the wound closure with a light microscope or imaging software. Measure the percent closure or the migration rate of the cells into the wound field. Wound healing results can be visualized with phase contrast.</p>
<p>Ten fields per experimental condition were randomly selected and micrographed with IX71 microscope (Olympus, japan) to quantify cells of migration. Images represent at least three independent experiments.</p>

<title>Matrigel invasion assay</title>
<p>Matrigel was dissolved overnight at 4&#x00B0;C and then diluted with serum-free DMEM (1:3). The diluted Matrigel was added to the upper chamber of the Transwell to form the membrane in three additions (15, 7.5 and 7.5 &#x03BC;l), with 10 min. between each addition. The Matrigel was evenly spread and covered all micropores at the bottom of the upper chamber. The two cell lines were collected at 48 h after transfection to prepare cell suspensions. Cell suspensions were seeded into the upper well, and 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 10&#x0025; FBS was added to the lower chambers (24-well plates). The cells were cultured routinely for 48 h at 37&#x00B0;C with 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>. After using a cotton swab to gently wipe off the remaining free cells in the upper well, the well membrane was collected and fixed for 15 &#x007E; 20 min. in 95&#x0025; ethanol. After rinsing with clean water, the membrane was stained for 10 min. and washed again with clean water. The membrane was then observed under a high-powered inverted microscope to count the number of cells on the membrane. The invasion ability of the cells was determined by counting the number of cells that passed through the Matrigel, and the average number from five high-magnification fields of view was used for each sample.</p>

<title>Experiment in vivo</title>
<p>The experiment was initiated with 6 week-old of mice, which weight was 20-25 g. Then, 1 ml suspension of MDA-MB-231 cells (1&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) was injected into subcutaneous tissue of nude mice at right flanks (n&#x003D;6/group). While tumor size of mice reached 3-8 mm, the experiment initiated as the 1st day. The agomir of miR-425 were formulated (1.0 mg/ml in PBS). The nude mice were categorized into experiment and control groups at random, then injected with agomir of miR-425 (5 &#x00B5;l) or it control once every three days for 6 times and terminated on the 18th day. Then, these mice were sacrificed at the 21th day, and tumor mass was dissected from each mouse. These tumors were cut into two sections, then the volume of tumors were determined every 3 days base on the formulate width<sup>2</sup> &#x00D7; length &#x00D7; 0.5. Moreover, the expression of TGF-&#x03B2;1 were determined with western blotting and immunohistochemical staining assay, respectively.</p>
<p>The dose of urethane used for euthanasia of mice is (at 1 g/kg), the following methods were used to evaluate consciousness or confirm death. We verified animal death in our study after the administration of urethane by observing lack of a heartbeat, lack of respiration, and lack of corneal reflex for more than 16 seconds. The signs of pain or disease, such as the earliest indicator in an animal of pain, distress, suffering, or impending death were considered humane endpoints in our study.</p>

It identified that miR-425 suppressed the process of proliferation and migration in TNBC cell lines, especially for mesenchymal phenotypic cell line MDA-MB-231. The hypothesis to explain these results was that the inhibition roles induced by miR-425 in proliferation and migration of TNBC cell line, mesenchymal phenotypic cell line MDA-MB-231 were much more than the basal epithelial phenotype cell line Hs 578T <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>)</bold>. Moreover, it maybe the mesenchymal characteristics of MDA-MB-231 cell line was obviously more than Hs 578T cell line. Moreover, the inhibitors of miR-425 promoted invasion ability of TNBC cell lines, but the mimics of miR-425 suppressed the invasion ability of TNBC cell lines (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), a mesenchymal phenotype in epithelial cells can be acquire, wherein the marker expression and acquired functions of mesenchymal cell, in addition to lost the epithelial functions and markers expression of epithelia. Besides, migration and delamination of epithelial cells can be caused by EMT, then mesenchymal cells derived from epithelial cell can migrate into the underlying tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. The ligands of TGF-&#x03B2; (transforming growth factor &#x03B2;) family often initiate the cellular process, EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Many investigations aim at the markers of EMT from thirty-two cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] and the roles of TGF-&#x03B2; pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. A number of elements are important factors in regulation of gene expression and EMT, while referred to development of TNBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Moreover, the transcriptional regulation mechanism of EMT and how miRNA modulated EMT or development of TNBC was unclear yet. Recent research revealed that miR-34 might serve as inhibitor in Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) by targeting TNBC-derived growth factor (HDGF). It indicated that miR-34 acted as a tumor suppressor in NPC, and may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatments of patients with NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Moreover, over-expression of miR-425 is induced by IL-1&#x03B2;, which aim at 3&#x2019;UTR of miR-425, could regulate homolog expression of tensin and phosphatase. The activation of NF-&#x03BA;B induced by IL-1&#x03B2; up-regulates miR-425 expression, while enhances transcription of miR-425 gene. Therefore, the proliferation of gastric cancer cell is promoted by miR-425 through suppressing tensin homolog and phosphatase. In summary, it confirm that over-expression of miR-425 dependent on NF-&#x03BA;B plays the critical role for the above process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. EMT could induce extracellular cytokine TNF-&#x03B1;, TGF-&#x03B2;, PDGF, HGF or bFGF to bond with its receptor in BC, and then activate intracellular effectors, such as Ras, NF-&#x03BA;B, Smads, etc. Therefore, in this study, miRNAs were ascertained and searched after its effects on EMT and development process of TNBC.</p>
<p>At first, the differential miRNAs expression profiles between tumor and para-tumor tissues were assessed with miRNA-sequencing experiments. Then, we found that, compared with para-tumor tissues, 9 miRNAs were upregulated and 3 miRNAs (included miR-425) were down-regulated in tumor tissues of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, the relative expression level of miR-425 in non-tumor, para-tumor, and tumor tissues were determined using qRT-PCR method. This work identified relative levels of miR-425 expression in tumor tissues were obviously less than that in para-tumor and non-tumor tissues. However, there was no obvious difference between para-tumor and non-tumor tissues. Consequently, the relative miR-425 expression levels were investigated in two cell lines of human TNBC. The results confirmed that miR-425 expression level was significantly decreased in the basal epithelial phenotype cell lines Ts 578T and mesenchymal phenotypic cell line MDA-MB-231, which indicatd that miR-425 down-expression was related to phenotype of EMT. Therefore, the targets of miR-425 were foretasted with Targetscan, an online software, and TGF-&#x03B2;1 was found that it is the possibly target of 3&#x2019; UTRs of TGF-&#x03B2;1 mRNA. Then, further experiments were performed and identified that miR-425 could straight bind with 3&#x2019; UTRs of TGF-&#x03B2;1 mRNA. In a word, miR-425 directly targeted to TGF-&#x03B2;1 mRNAs. Hence, miR-425 could straight control mRNA and the protein expression level of TGF-&#x03B2;1, and furtherly affect expression levels of E-cadherin, VE-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, &#x03B1;-SMA, and SMAD3 protein in TNBC cell lines. Taken together, our study maybe point out a novel aim at treatment for TNBC associated with EMT.</p>
<p>Besides, to assess the biofunctions of miR-425, several molecular functional tests were performed in TNBC cell lines transfected with mimics or inhibitors of miR-425, respectively. It identified that miR-425 suppressed proliferation process and the migration or invasion ability of TNBC cell lines, and significantly promoted the expressions of epithelial markers E-cadherin and VE-cadherin, and suppressed mesenchymal markers expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, &#x03B1;-SMA, total and phosphorylated SMAD3 (p-SMAD 3) in TNBC cell lines. Our results demonstrated that miR-425 targets to TGF-&#x03B2; 1, and was a crucial mediator of EMT and development of TNBC through regulating TGF-&#x03B2;1/SMAD3 signaling pathway. Moreover, we did not found that it is involved in well-known molecules such as mTOR, Ki-67, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the effects on Human TNBC xenografts and its mechanism were investigated using miR-425 agomir. Our results conirmed that the xenografts of control groups grew rapidly. But in the experiment group, which treated with agomir of miR-425, the xenografts grew slowly <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the size and weight of tumors in experiment group (treated with agomir of miR-425) was significantly less than that of control group. At the time of end, the average tumor volume of control group was much larger than that of experiment group, and the difference between the two groups had statistical significance. Therefore, the agomir of miR-425 could obviously inhibit tumor proliferation and its development process. Moreover, treatment with agomir of miR-425 could down-regulate the expression of TGF-&#x03B2;1 and SMAD3 with a statistically significant, while suppressed the expression of mesenchymal cell markers and promoted epithelial markers E-cadherin and VE-cadherin expression in xenografts.</p>
<p>We thought that our manuscript was obviously composed only one part of the whole. The assays <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> were all separately used to identify our conclusions. In summary, we illustrated that miR-425 targets to TGF-&#x03B2;1. Moreover, miR-425 was a crucial suppressor of EMT and the development of TNBC through inhibiting TGF-&#x03B2;1/SMAD3 signaling pathway. It suggested that aim at TGF-&#x03B2;1/SMAD3 signaling pathway through enhancing miR-425 expression, was a feasible therapy strategy for TNBC.</p>
