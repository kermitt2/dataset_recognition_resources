<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Perceptual decision making involves a complex network of brain regions including premotor and motor cortices. Premotor areas activate in proportion to the available evidence, thus anticipating the movements required to indicate the still developing decision. Conversely, primary motor cortex is thought to execute planned movements indicating a completed decision by innervating muscles. Recent results question this strict division of labour among premotor and primary motor areas, but the exact role of primary motor areas in perceptual decision making remains unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that human primary motor cortex follows the ups and downs of available evidence during decision making. We used stimuli changing randomly every 100 ms to induce fast variations in the available decision evidence throughout single trials. The stimuli were chosen such that participants had to observe typically more than 5 stimulus changes before being able to make a confident decision. This enabled us to investigate corresponding changes in brain signals within trials. We correlated the stimulus-induced varying evidence as predicted by an ideal observer model with the ongoing neuronal signals measured by magnetoencephalography. This approach provided us with unprecedented statistical precision for identifying brain areas that represent decision evidence. We found that the primary motor cortex of humans indeed represents decision evidence, at least 500 milliseconds before the actual response, confirming that it is not just executing, but also anticipating decisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During perceptual decision making observers judge the state of their environment. Already while the observer makes the decision, brain areas presumably related to motor planning such as premotor cortex and the frontal eye fields represent evidence for the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gold &#x0026; Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hanks &#x0026; Summerfield, 2017</xref>). In contrast, primary motor cortex has traditionally been only associated with the execution of movements through the suitable activation of muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kalaska &#x0026; Rizzolatti, 2012</xref>). This view suggests that the primary motor cortex is only marginally involved in the decision making process by signalling the outcome of the decision in the form of a motor command.</p>
<p>This strict functional role of primary motor cortex as a motor control device has come under strain in the recent past. In monkeys, there are single primary motor cortex neurons whose firing rate appears to track the decision evidence shown on a screen before committing to a motor response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Thura &#x0026; Cisek, 2014</xref>). In humans, lateralised oscillatory signals, for example, in the beta band measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) exhibit choice predictive build-up that is thought to mirror the increasing evidence for a decision and the sources of these oscillations have been located in dorsal premotor and primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Donner, Siegel, Fries, &#x0026; Engel, 2009</xref>). Lateralised readiness potentials and oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) correlate with the average strength of evidence before the motor response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kelly &#x0026; O&#x2019;Connell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lange, Rahnev, Donner, &#x0026; Lau, 2013</xref>) and are thought to originate in primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Smulders &#x0026; Miller, 2012</xref>). Further, reflex gains in elbow muscles exhibit evidence-dependent build-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Selen, Shadlen, &#x0026; Wolpert, 2012</xref>). These findings suggest that also primary motor cortex prepares responses in proportion to the available evidence during decision making. The results in humans, however, are only based on indirect, average measures of decision evidence such as a general build-up of evidence within a trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Donner et al., 2009</xref>), or the average strength of decision evidence within and across trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kelly &#x0026; O&#x2019;Connell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Selen et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A more direct approach to investigate representations of decision evidence in the brain is to control the amount of available evidence during decision making by manipulating the stimulus such that evidence fluctuates in specific patterns throughout an experimental trial instead of simply being constant or increasing steadily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brunton, Botvinick, &#x0026; Brody, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Thura &#x0026; Cisek, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Wyart, Gardelle, Scholl, &#x0026; Summerfield, 2012</xref>). The advantage of this approach, relative to previous ones, is that the induced evidence fluctuations enable more specific predictions about the time course of measured evidence signals and therefore increase the power and specificity of the corresponding analyses. Applying this approach to MEG measurements we, therefore, expected to be able to identify areas in the human brain that specifically represent decision evidence while the decision develops. Although the focus of our analyses was on primary motor cortex, the approach also allowed us to test for representations of decision evidence across the whole cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Using source reconstruction of the MEG data, we found significant correlations with decision evidence in primary motor cortex 300 to 500 ms after the onset of a new stimulus element. Critically, these correlations were distinct from the motor signal related to a participant&#x2019;s actual motor response. This finding confirms that human primary motor cortex represents decision evidence while making perceptual decisions and not only executes decisions. Apart from primary motor cortex, we identified the posterior cingulate cortex as a brain area with consistent representations of decision evidence.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>While MEG was recorded, 34 human participants observed a single white dot on the screen changing its position every 100 ms and had to decide whether a left or a right target (two yellow dots) was the centre of the white dot movement (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></bold>). Participants indicated their choice with a button press using the index finger of the corresponding hand. The distance of the target dots on the screen was chosen in behavioural pilots so that participants had an intermediate accuracy around 75&#x0025; while being told to be as accurate and fast as possible. The average median response time across participants was 1.1 s with an average accuracy of 78&#x0025; (cf. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<caption><title>Course of events within a trial in the single dot task (A) and behaviour of individual participants (B).</title>
<p>Each trial started with the presentation of a fixation cross, followed by the appearance of the two yellow targets after about 1 s. 700 ms after the appearance of the targets the fixation cross disappeared and a single white dot was presented at a random position on the screen (drawn from a 2D-Gaussian distribution centred on one of the targets). Every 100 ms the position of the white dot was changed to a new random draw from the same distribution. Participants were instructed to indicate the target which they thought was the centre of the observed dot positions. After 25 dot positions (2.5 s) without a response, a new trial was started automatically, otherwise a new trial started with the response of the participant. Average behaviour (accuracy and median response time) for each of the 34 participant is shown in B.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="350876_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>An ideal observer model for inference about the target given a sequence of single dots has been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bitzer, Park, Blankenburg, &#x0026; Kiebel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Park, Lueckmann, Kriegstein, Bitzer, &#x0026; Kiebel, 2016</xref>). This model identifies the x-coordinates of the white dot positions as momentary decision evidence while the y-coordinate only provides irrelevant perceptual information and acts as a decision unrelated control variable. Further, the sum of x-coordinates across single dot positions reflects accumulated evidence and corresponds to the average state of a discrete-time drift-diffusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bitzer et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Participants integrate evidence provided by single dot positions to make decisions</title>
<p>As the task required and the model predicted, participants made their decision based on the provided evidence. In <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></bold> we show this as the correlation of participants&#x2019; choices with momentary and accumulated evidence. Momentary evidence was mildly correlated with choices throughout the trial (correlation coefficients around 0.3) while the correlation between accumulated evidence and choices increased to a high level (around 0.7) as more and more dot positions were presented. This result indicates that participants accumulated the momentary evidence, here the x-coordinate of the dot, to make their choices. In contrast, as expected, the y-coordinates had no influence on the participants&#x2019; choices as indicated by correlation coefficients around 0 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref></bold>).</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Each shown point corresponds to the Pearson correlation coefficient for the correlation between choices of a single participant and the sequence of presented dot positions across the 480 trials of the experiment. We plot, over stimulus duration, the momentary (blue) and the accumulated evidence (orange). The dotted vertical line shows the median RT across participants. Until about the 10th dot presentation the correlation between accumulated evidence and participant choices rises, reaching values around 0.7 while the momentary evidence is only modestly related to participant choices across all dots. <bold>(B)</bold> The same format as in A but all measures are computed from the y-coordinates of dot positions. As expected, y-coordinates do not correlate with participant choices.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="350876_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Naturally, momentary and accumulated evidence can correlate quite strongly, because the last sampled x-coordinate has a strong influence on the accumulated evidence (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref></bold>). Therefore, we here only report results for momentary decision evidence and mean momentary evidence whenever writing &#x201C;evidence&#x201D; in the text unless stated explicitly otherwise. As <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></bold> shows, and as expected, the momentary evidence is more clearly dissociated from the final choice of the participants than the accumulated evidence. This feature of the momentary evidence will be useful below in separating effects related to decision evidence from effects related to the final choice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>MEG signals correlate with evidence at specific time points after stimulus update</title>
<p>For the analysis of the MEG data we used regression analyses computing event-related regression coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Clarke, Taylor, Devereux, Randall, &#x0026; Tyler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hauk, Davis, Ford, Pulverm&#x00FC;ller, &#x0026; Marslen-Wilson, 2006</xref>). For our main analysis the regressors of interest were the momentary evidence and y-coordinates of the dots. We normalised both the regressors and the data so that the resulting regression coefficients could be interpreted as approximate correlation values while accounting for potential covariates of no interest (see Methods). Note that this correlation analysis contrasts with standard event-related fields, where one would test for the presence of some constant time-course across trials. With the correlation analysis, the estimated regression coefficients describe how strongly the MEG signal, in each time point and each sensor (or source), followed the ups and downs of variables such as the momentary evidence, across trials.</p>
<p>As a first result, we found that correlations between momentary evidence and MEG signals followed a stereotypical temporal profile after each dot position update (cf. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>). Therefore, we performed an expanded regression analysis where we explicitly modelled the time from each dot position update, which we call &#x2018;dot onset&#x2019; in the following. To exclude the possibility that effects signalling the button press motor response influence the results of the dot onset aligned analysis, we only included data up until at least 200 ms prior to the participant response of each trial into this analysis.</p>
<p>We first identified time points at which the MEG signal correlated most strongly with the momentary evidence. To do this we performed separate regression analyses for each time point from dot onset, magnetometer sensor and participant, computed the mean regression coefficients across participants, took their absolute value to yield a magnitude and averaged them across sensors. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref></bold> shows that the strongest correlations between decision evidence and magnetometer signals occurred at 120 ms, 180 ms and in a prolonged period from roughly 300 to 500 ms after dot onset. In contrast, correlations with the control, that is, the dot y-coordinates, were significantly lower in this period from 300 to 500 ms (two-tailed Wilcoxon test for absolute average coefficients across all sensors and times within 300500 ms, W &#x003D; 382781, p &#x003C;&#x003C; 0.001).</p>

For comparison, dotted lines show the corresponding values for data which were randomly permuted across trials before statistical analysis. Black dots indicate time points for which the sensor topography is shown below the plot. These topographies directly display the grand average regression coefficients at the indicated time with negative (blue) and positive (red) values. <bold>(A)</bold> The decision evidence has strong correlations with the magnetometer signal at 120 ms, 180 ms and from about 300 ms to 500 ms after dot onsets. <bold>(B)</bold> The y-coordinate correlations are visibly and significantly weaker than for the evidence, but there are two prominent peaks from about 120 ms to 210 ms and at 320 ms after dot onset. There is no sustained correlation with the y-coordinate beyond 400 ms and the topographies of magnetometers differ strongly between evidence and y-coordinates. Specifically, the evidence exhibits centro-parietal topographies whereas the y-coordinate exhibits strong correlations only in lateral occipito-parietal sensors.</p></caption>

<p>The sensor topographies shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref></bold> also indicate for the decision evidence a progression of the strongest correlations from occipital to central sensors while y-coordinate correlations remained spatially at occipito-parietal sensors.</p>

<title>A motor-posterior cingulate network of brain areas correlating with decision evidence</title>
<p>We reconstructed source currents along the cerebral cortex for each participant and subsequently repeated our regression analysis on the estimated sources. Specifically, we performed source reconstruction on the preprocessed MEG data using noise-normalised minimum norm estimation based on all MEG sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dale et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gramfort et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2014</xref>). Further, we aggregated estimated values by averaging across sources within 180 brain areas defined by a recently published brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>). This resulted in average time courses for each experimental trial in each of the 180 brain areas defined per hemisphere for each participant. We then repeated the expanded regression analysis on these source-reconstructed time courses instead of on MEG sensors. Following the summary statistics approach we identified time points and areas with significant second level correlations by performing t-tests across participants and applying multiple comparison correction using false discovery rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Benjamini &#x0026; Hochberg, 1995</xref>) simultaneously across all time points and brain areas.</p>
<p>In the time window from 300 to 500 ms after dot onset significant correlations with decision evidence occurred predominantly in bilateral primary motor, somatosensory and posterior cingulate cortices, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4.</xref></bold></p>

<title>Spatial pattern of correlations in motor cortex is similar to activation for response</title>
<p>Having established the involvement of primary motor and somatosensory cortices in representing the momentary evidence we tried to further clarify the nature of these effects. In a first step, we compared the found spatial pattern of correlations with the response-specific (button press) activations in motor areas. To do this we computed standard event-related averages centred on the response time of the participants in source space. Additionally, to provide for a high spatial resolution, we repeated the expanded regression analysis directly on sources of premotor and motor areas without averaging across sources within area. For the comparison of spatial patterns resulting from both analyses we selected those time points for each analysis which had the strongest effects in terms of second-level t-values in bilateral primary motor cortex (area 4). These time points were 490 ms after dot onset for the analysis centred on dot onset and 30 ms after the response for the response-aligned averages (cf. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>). The resulting spatial patterns are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref></bold> where one can see that the sources of both effects have the same location in dorsal premotor and primary motor cortex. Importantly, as we excluded in the dot onset centred analysis all time points earlier than 200 ms before the motor response, this result indicates that the areas in the brain that were involved in the execution of the button presses also represented decision-relevant information before the button press.</p>

<title>Correlations with decision evidence in pri nary motor cortex occur well before the response</title>
<p>In the previous, dot onset aligned analyses we excluded all data of time points later than 200 ms before the response. This allowed us to exclude the possibility that response-related effects around the response time influenced the found effects. To further investigate how early before the response correlations with decision evidence occurred in primary motor cortex we conducted a response-aligned regression analysis. To increase the statistical power of the analysis, similar to the expanded regression analysis used above, we repeated the analysis for different assumed delays between a dot position update on the screen and the neural effect. We then averaged regression coefficients across delays from 300 to 500 ms within participant before conducting the second-level analysis. This means that an effect at time point &#x2212;500 ms from the response reflects a correlation of the signal 500 ms before the response with dot positions that were visible on the screen 800 to 1000 ms before the response. See Methods for a detailed description of the procedure.</p>
<p><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></bold> shows that there were significant correlations between the signal in primary motor cortex and decision evidence at least up to 500 ms and earlier before the response. Correlations with the control variable, the y-coordinate, fluctuated around 0 without significant effects at any time after multiple comparison correction. As expected, sources in left primary motor cortex showed large positive correlations in trials with large positive evidence (presented on the right half of the screen) while right primary motor cortex showed anti-correlation with evidence indicating large signal values in trials with large negative evidence (presented on the left half of the screen).</p>

<p>Strongest correlations with decision evidence (orange) occurred just after the response and can be attributed to response-related motor processes (see main text). However, evidence-correlations can be observed already 500 ms and earlier before the response. For comparison, y-coordinate-correlations are shown in green. Lines depict mean regression coefficients across participants together with a band of uncertainty showing twice the standard error of the mean (see Methods for details). Small coloured dots indicate time points at which the corresponding regressor differed significantly from 0 after multiple comparison correction for the number of time points across both hemispheres (FDR &#x03B1; &#x003D; 0.01, no significant effects for the y-coordinate).</p></caption>

<p>The peaks (orange line) just after the response (dotted line) in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></bold> reflect the motor response typically observed for primary motor cortex. Around these time points left primary motor cortex is strongly activated for a right button press and the right primary motor cortex is strongly activated for a left button press, but not the other way around. This is also reflected in corresponding peaks in the evoked signal (cf. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>). This motor response results in an increase in correlation with decision evidence, because i) on average the evidence provided by dot positions will point towards the correct choice, as expressed in the correlation between evidence and choice (cf. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></bold>) and ii) the motor response signal is rather strong such that it leads to a larger correlation with decision evidence as compared to pre-response time points.</p>

<title>Signals in posterior cingulate cortex correlate with decision evidence at early and late time points after dot onset</title>
<p>In addition to motor cortex our results in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold> identify the posterior cingulate cortex as another key brain region involved in representing decision evidence. While posterior cingulate cortex has been associated with perceptual decision making before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Heekeren, Marrett, Bandettini, &#x0026; Ungerleider, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Heekeren, Marrett, Ruff, Bandettini, &#x0026; Ungerleider, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Keuken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Philiastides, Heekeren, &#x0026; Sajda, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tosoni, Galati, Romani, &#x0026; Corbetta, 2008</xref>), its precise role during perceptual decision making is still mostly unclear. To further enquire this role we tested whether the signal in posterior cingulate cortex exhibits correlations with decision evidence outside the time window of 300 to 500 ms after dot onset as in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold>. We found significant correlations in posterior cingulate cortex already at 120 ms after dot onset, similarly as for early visual areas such as the primary visual cortex (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>). Further, the signal in posterior cingulate cortex exhibited correlations with decision evidence around 180 ms after dot onset (cf. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref></bold>), although these did not become significant after correcting for multiple comparisons across the shown time points and brain areas (in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref></bold> and B).</p>
<p>Among the effects in posterior cingulate cortex, area v23ab (roughly the ventral part of BA 23) stands out, because it consistently exhibited relatively strong correlations (magnitude of second-level t-values &#x003E; 2) with decision evidence at the three time periods 120 ms, 180 ms, and 300 to 500 ms after dot onset (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). In general, the time course of the correlation strength followed that of the grand average shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref></bold>, but the sign of the correlation switched between 120 and 180 ms (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 B</xref></bold>). This means that initially the signal in area v23ab increased for dot positions shown on the ipsilateral side of the screen while at later time points we observed larger signals for dot positions on the contralateral side.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have investigated the involvement of motor areas in the human brain during a perceptual decision making task. In contrast to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kelly &#x0026; O&#x2019;Connell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lange et al., 2013</xref>), we directly examined in how far brain signals as measured with MEG correlate with fast changes in the available decision evidence. We induced these fast evidence fluctuations using a visual stimulus in which new evidence appeared every 100 ms. Motor areas and specifically primary motor cortex exhibited correlations with individual pieces of decision evidence 300 to 500 ms after the new evidence appeared on the screen. These correlations in primary motor cortex could be distinguished from the motor response and occurred several hundreds of milliseconds before the actual response. These results, therefore, confirm that the human primary motor cortex does not merely execute completed decisions, but also prepares motor responses in proportion to the available decision evidence. Apart from motor areas we additionally found posterior cingulate cortex to represent decision evidence. While the correlations with evidence occurred in motor cortex only in the time window from 300 to 500 ms post-stimulus, correlations in posterior cingulate cortex occurred additionally already at 120 and 180 ms.</p>
<p>To manipulate decision evidence in our task we changed the position of a single dot presented on a screen. Only the x-coordinates of these dot positions represented decision evidence while the decision irrelevant y-coordinates acted as a perceptual control variable. We have shown that correlations of brain signals with the perceptual control variable, in contrast to decision evidence, were strongly diminished in the period from 300 to 500 ms after dot onset. This suggests that the brain ceases to represent perceptual information that is behaviourally irrelevant around this time and that brain areas with strong correlations with decision evidence in this time window indeed are involved in decision making. This interpretation is further supported by previous work which has shown that purely perceptual stimulus information is represented in electrophysiological signals only until about 400 ms after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mostert, Kok, &#x0026; Lange, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Myers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wyart et al., 2012</xref>) while specifically decision-related information is represented longer starting around 170 ms after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mostert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Myers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Philiastides et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Philiastides, Ratcliff, &#x0026; Sajda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Philiastides &#x0026; Sajda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wyart et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Although previous work has already pointed towards the possibility that the primary motor cortex of primates represents decision evidence in certain situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Thura &#x0026; Cisek, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tosoni et al., 2008</xref>), the present results support this conjecture for the human brain in unprecedented precision. Specifically, we were able to show that human primary motor cortex not only increases its activity in preparation for a response, as, for example, measured in lateralised readiness potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Smulders &#x0026; Miller, 2012</xref>), or shown for a motion discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Donner et al., 2009</xref>), but the average source currents in primary motor cortex tend to rise and fall with decision evidence on a timescale of 100 ms. According to our results, these decision evidence signals in primary motor cortex are about an order of magnitude weaker than the response-related signal in primary motor cortex (cf. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></bold> pre-response correlations versus post-response peak).</p>
<p>One potential caveat of our correlation results in primary motor cortex is: Could it be that we only observed evidence correlations in primary motor cortex, because participants actually executed micromovements that tried to track the perceptual stimulus? Especially, did participants try to follow dot movements on the screen with their eyes, or did their fingers slightly move over the corresponding buttons, when the dot was shown on the respective side of the screen? Although we cannot completely exclude this possibility we deem it unlikely, because: i) Dots were shown only very centrally at visual angles within about 10&#x00B0; visual angle with most dots within 5&#x00B0; diameter from fixation meaning that most dots were well within the foveal visual field. ii) The spatial pattern of early evidence correlations corresponds to that of later button press responses (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref></bold>), that is, it does not appear to be specifically related to eye movements. iii) Other pre-response motor effects have been reported in the EEG in tasks with stimuli which did not change their location within a trial and therefore could not prompt decision-unrelated movements towards the corresponding side during decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gould, Nobre, Wyart, &#x0026; Rushworth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kelly &#x0026; O&#x2019;Connell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lange et al., 2013</xref>). In conclusion, we do not believe that the correlations with decision evidence observed in primary motor cortex are merely an expression of motor control signals that caused stimulus-correlated micromovements. Even if such micro-movements existed, we deem it likely that these follow the time-course of decision evidence rather than decision-irrelevant stimulus properties, as suggested by recent results about the adaptation of reflex gains during decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Selen et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>What is the functional role of primary motor cortex, beyond its obvious role of causing the movement? The present results support the notion that primary motor cortex continuously prepares for the execution of alternative actions in proportion to their behavioural relevance before committing to a choice, as it has been found for single neurons in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Thura &#x0026; Cisek, 2014</xref>). Such an interpretation would be congruent with the affordance competition hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cisek, 2007</xref>) which describes movement generation as a dynamic process in which possible actions compete with each other and are continuously refined in a loop between sensory and motor related areas while frontal areas provide contextual modulation.</p>
<p>Given that primary motor cortex itself, as the area in cerebral cortex that is most directly associated with the execution of movements, represents decision evidence, one may ask whether the eventual choice is also made in primary motor cortex and not, for example, in more frontal regions. Possible neural implementations of a suitable mechanism have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wang, 2008</xref>). In these, different pools of neurons in one brain area compete until a threshold is crossed and one pool decisively signals the choice. Our results are compatible with such a mechanism, but one can ultimately not exclude the possibility that the decision is formed somewhere else in the brain and primary motor cortex only represents the results of this process. We also observed some correlations with decision evidence in premotor regions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref></bold>), but these tended to be weaker than in primary motor cortex (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Supplementary Table 2</xref></bold>). We did not find any correlations of sufficient strength to pass the correction for multiple comparisons in other frontal areas (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>). Although this may suggest that primary motor cortex plays a more important role in the decision making process than these areas, the lack of correlation may also be explained by the sensitivity profile of MEG measurements across cerebral cortex. It has, for example, previously been noted that &#x201C;only areas with a macroscopic contralateral motor bias were apt to signal subjects&#x2019; choices&#x201D;, when measured with MEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Donner et al., 2009</xref>). That we were able to identify additional areas representing decision evidence, specifically the posterior cingulate cortex, supports the strength and increased power of our approach compared to previous ones, but the precise limits of which representations of decision evidence in the brain can and cannot be detected with MEG has still to be determined.</p>
<p>Based on single neuron recordings in dorsal premotor cortex, primary motor cortex and the basal ganglia of monkeys, it has been suggested that perceptual decisions are made in premotor or primary motor cortex while the basal ganglia eventually invigorate the movement selected in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thura &#x0026; Cisek, 2017</xref>). While these findings, as ours, have been obtained with perceptual decision making tasks in which sensory evidence immediately maps to a button press or reaching movement, it is an interesting future research question how representations of evidence across motor areas change, when the response mapping is only revealed after the decision, for example with a sufficiently large delay after the offset of stimulus presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Filimon, Philiastides, Nelson, Kloosterman, &#x0026; Heekeren, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu &#x0026; Pleskac, 2011</xref>). In this situation the brain cannot frame decision making as a competition between specific actions and may represent decision evidence in different coordinates and in different brain areas than primary motor cortex.</p>
<p>The correlations found in posterior cingulate cortex rivalled in strength those of primary motor cortex, or even exceeded it (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Supplementary Table 2</xref></bold>). Further, while in motor areas these correlations occurred only from about 300 ms after the evidence first became available, we also observed significant correlations much earlier, around 120 ms and 180 ms, in posterior cingulate cortex and specifically in the ventral part (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref></bold>). We speculate that the first time point of significant correlations around 120 ms reflects early sensory processing of dot positions, because we found the by far largest effects at this time point in early visual areas such as primary visual cortex (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>). From about 180 ms after stimulus onset, however, it has been found that information about the decision can be decoded from brain signals (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Lange, Jensen, &#x0026; Dehaene, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mostert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Myers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Philiastides et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Philiastides &#x0026; Sajda, 2006</xref>). This suggests that these later effects may represent processes directly involved in forming the decision. Consequently, posterior cingulate cortex appears to be involved in both early sensory processing and decision making and, therefore, could act as a bridge between these processes.</p>
<p>Previous studies investigating the function of posterior cingulate cortex have mostly concentrated on slow time scales, for example, contrasting different task conditions to each other, while we analysed rapid fluctuations of neural signals. These investigations of slow changes in posterior cingulate cortex activations have identified the posterior cingulate as a key node in the default mode network which deactivates as attention is focused on external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Leech &#x0026; Sharp, 2014</xref>). However, posterior cingulate cortex has been associated with a wide range of functions which have recently been proposed to be consolidated as estimating the need to change behaviour in light of new, external requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pearson, Heilbronner, Barack, Hayden, &#x0026; Platt, 2011</xref>). Our findings are compatible with this view, when transferred to the context of comparably fast perceptual decision making where decision evidence may be viewed as the need to follow one or another behaviour.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings suggest that during perceptual decision making posterior cingulate cortex is involved in transforming sensory signals into behaviourally relevant information. This information is shared with primary motor cortex which continuously prepares the corresponding actions in proportion to the available evidence.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>37 healthy, right-handed participants were recruited from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (Leipzig, Germany) participant pool (age range: 20 - 35 years, mean 25.7 years, 19 females). All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and reported no history of neurologic or psychiatric disorders. One participant was excluded from MEG measurement due to low performance during training. In total, 36 participants participated in the MEG study. Two participants&#x2019; data were excluded from analyses due to excessive eye artefacts and too many bad channels. Finally, 34 participants&#x2019; data were analysed.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>In each trial, a sequence of up to 25 white dots were presented on a black screen. Each dot was displayed for 100 ms (6 frames, refresh rate 60 Hz). The white dot was located at x, y coordinates which were sampled from one of two two-dimensional Gaussian distributions with means located at &#x00B1;25 pixels horizontal distance from the centre of the screen. The standard deviation was 70 pixels in both axes of the screen. The mean locations were the two target locations (&#x2212;25: left, 25: right). These target locations corresponded to visual angles &#x00B1;0.6&#x00B0; from the centre of the screen. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution corresponded to &#x00B1;1.7&#x00B0; from the two target locations. The stimuli used in this study consisted of a subset of stimuli used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Park et al., 2016</xref>), and additional newly created stimuli. The stimuli were chosen to increase the probability that the participants see the 5th dot within the 25 dot sequence by not responding earlier. In short, trials where &#x007E;70&#x0025; of the participants in the Park et al. study had reaction times (RT) longer than 700 ms but not timed-out were chosen from the second most difficult condition. This resulted in 28 trials from 200 trials. Then each trial was copied 6 times, with only the 5th dot location differing, ranging in &#x2018;target location &#x002B; [&#x2212;160 &#x2212;96 &#x2212;32 32 96 160] (pixels)&#x2019;. This resulted in 168 trials. These trials were mirrored to create a dataset with the same evidence strengths but with different x coordinate signs (336 trials), and finally trials which had short RTs were chosen from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Park et al., 2016</xref>) as catch trials, to prevent participants from adapting to the long RT trials (30&#x0025; of the total trials). This resulted in a total of 480 trials per experiment.</p>
<p>We originally designed this stimulus set, especially the manipulations of the 5th dot, to increase the chance of inducing sufficiently large effects in the MEG signal when observing the 5th dot. In a preliminary analysis we realised, however, that the natural variation of the stimuli already induces observable effects. Consequently, we pooled all trials for analysis.</p></sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were seated in a dimly lit shielding room during the training and the MEG measurement. Visual stimuli were presented using Presentation<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> software (Version 16.0, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neurobs.com">https://www.neurobs.com</ext-link>). The display was a semi-transparent screen onto which the stimuli were back-projected from a projector located outside of the magnetic shielding room (Vacuumschmelze Hanau, Germany). The display was located 90 cm from the participants. The task was to find out which target (left or right) was the centre of the white dot positions, but participants were instructed with a cover story: Each target represented a bee hive and the white dot represented a bee. Participants should tell which bee hive is more likely the home of the bee. They were additionally instructed to be both accurate and fast, but not too fast at the expense of being inaccurate, and not too slow that the trial times out. They went through a minimum 210 and maximum 450 trials of training, until they reached a minimum of 75&#x0025; accuracy. Feedback (correct, incorrect, too slow, too fast) was provided during the training. After training, a pseudo-main block with 200 trials without feedback preceded MEG measurement. After the pseudo-main session, the 480 trials in randomized order were presented to each participant divided into 5 blocks. The MEG measurement lasted &#x007E; 60 minutes, including breaks between blocks. Each trial started with a fixation cross (randomized, 1200 ms &#x007E; 1500 ms uniform distribution) followed by two yellow target dots. After 700 ms, the fixation cross disappeared and the first white dot appeared. The white dot jumped around the screen and stayed at each location for 100 ms, until the participant submitted a response by pressing a button using either hand, corresponding to the left / right target, or when the trial timed-out (2.5 s). In order to maintain motivation and attention throughout the measurement, participants were told to accumulate points (not shown to the participants) for correct trials and adequate (not too slow and not too fast, non-timeout) RTs. Bonus money in addition to compensation for participating in the experiment were given to participants with good performances. RTs and choices were collected for each trial for each participant. Although the trial order was randomized across participants, every participant saw exactly the same 480 trials.</p>

<title>MEG data acquisition and preprocessing</title>
<p>MEG data were recorded with a 306 channel Vectorview device (Elekta Oy, Helsinki, Finland), sampled at 1000 Hz. The MEG sensors covered the whole head, with triplet sensors consisting of two orthogonal gradiometers and one magnetometer at 102 locations. Additionally, three electrode pairs were used to monitor eye movement and heart beats at the same sampling rate. The raw MEG data was corrected for head movements and external interferences by the Signal Space Separation (SSS) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Taulu, Simola, &#x0026; Kajola, 2005</xref>) implemented in the MaxFilterTM software (Elekta Oy) for each block. The subsequent preprocessing was performed using MATLAB (Mathworks, Massachusetts, United States). The head movement corrected data was high-pass and low-pass filtered using a linear phase FIR Kaiser filter (corrected for the shift) at cut-off frequencies of 0.33 Hz and 45 Hz respectively, with filter orders of 3736 and 392, respectively. The filtered data was then down-sampled to 250 Hz. Then independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to the continuous data using functions in the EEGLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Delorme &#x0026; Makeig, 2004</xref>) to remove eye and heart beat artefacts. The data dimensionality was reduced by principal component analysis to 50 or 60 components prior to running the ICA. Components which had high temporal correlations (&#x003E; 0.3) or typical topographies with/of the EOG and ECG signals were identified and excluded. The ICA-reconstructed data for each block was combined, and epoched from &#x2212; 300 ms to 2500 ms from the first dot onset (zero). Another ICA was applied to these epoched data in order to check for additional artefacts and confirm typical neural topographies from the components. The ICA reconstructed data and original data were compared and inspected in order to ensure only artefactual trials were excluded. Before statistical analysis we used MNE-Python v0.15.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gramfort et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2014</xref>) to downsample the data to 100 Hz (10 ms steps) and perform baseline correction for each trial where the baseline value was the mean signal in the period from &#x2212;300 ms to 0 ms (first dot onset).</p>

<title>Source reconstruction</title>
<p>We reconstructed the source currents underlying the measured MEG signals using noise-normalised minimum norm estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dale et al., 2000</xref>) implemented in the MNE software. To create participant specific forward models we semi-automatically co-registered the head positions of participants with the MEG coordinate frame while at the same time morphing the participants&#x2019; head shape to that of Freesurfer&#x2019;s fsaverage by aligning the fsaverage head surface to a set of head points recorded for each participant. We defined a source space along the white matter surface of the average subject with 4098 equally spaced sources per hemisphere and an approximate source spacing of about 5 mm (MNE&#x2019;s &#x201C;oct6&#x201D; option). For minimum norm estimation we assumed a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (lambda2 &#x003D; 0.11). We estimated the noise covariance matrix for noise normalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dale et al., 2000</xref>) from the MEG signals in the baseline period spanning from 300 ms before to first dot onset in each trial. We further used fixed orientation constraints assuming that sources are normal to the cortical mantle and employed standard depth weighting with a value of 0.8 to overcome the bias of minimum norm estimates towards superficial sources. We computed the inverse solution from all MEG sensors (magnetometers and the two sets of gradiometers) returning dynamic statistical parametric maps for each participant. Before some of the subsequent statistical analyses we averaged the reconstructed source signals across all sources of a brain area as defined by the recently published HCP-MMP parcellation of the human connectome project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Standard regression analysis</title>
<p>In the standard regression analysis we defined dot-specific regressors with values changing only across trials. For example, we defined a regressor for decision evidence (x-coordinate) of the 2<sup>nd</sup> white dot position presented in the trial. For convenience we also call white dot positions (1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and so forth in the sequence of dot positions) simply &#x2018;dots&#x2019;.</p>
<p>We only report results of a standard regression analysis in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>. This analysis included the dot x&#x002D; and y-coordinates of the first 6 dots as regressors of interest (together 12 regressors). Additional nuisance regressors were: the response of the participant, a participant-specific trial count roughly measuring time within the experiment, an intercept capturing average effects and a response entropy. The latter quantified the posterior uncertainty of a probabilistic model of the responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Park et al., 2016</xref>) that the model had about the response for the stimulus presented in that trial after model parameters were adapted to fit participant responses. Specifically, the wider and flatter the posterior predictive distribution over responses of the model for a particular trial / dot position sequence was, the larger was the response entropy for that trial. The data for this analysis were the preprocessed magnetometer time courses.</p>

For each trial, these pairs of signal data and dot positions entered the expanded regression analyses.</p></caption>

<p>Expanded regression analyses were based on an expanded set of data created by dividing up the data into partially overlapping epochs centred on the times of dot position changes. For each time point after this dot onset the data contained a variable number of time points depending on how many more dots were presented in each individual trial before a response was given by the participant. For example, if a participant made a response after 880 ms in a trial, 9 dots were shown in that trial (onset of the 9<sup>th</sup> dot was at 800 ms). If we are interested in the time point 120 ms after dot onset (dot position change), this gives us 8 time points within that trial that were 120 ms after dot onset. Further excluding all time points 200 ms before the response and later, would leave us with 6 data points for this example trial. See <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref></bold> for an illustration. For each time after dot onset and for each participant we pooled all of these data points across trials and inferred regression coefficients on these expanded data sets. Note that this approach can equally be interpreted as statistical inference over how strongly the sequence of momentary evidence caused by the dot updates is represented in the signal at 100 ms wide steps with a delay given by the chosen time from dot onset.</p>
<p>These analyses included two regressors of interest: decision evidence (x-coordinate) and y-coordinate of the associated dots. We additionally included the following nuisance regressors: an intercept capturing average effects, the absolute values of x&#x002D; and y-coordinates, perceptual update variables for x&#x002D; and y-coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wyart et al., 2012</xref>) defined as the magnitude of the change from one dot position to another and accumulated values of x&#x002D; and y-coordinates. Because we found that the accumulated values can be strongly correlated with the individual x and y-coordinates (cf. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref></bold>), we only used accumulated values up to the previous dot in the regressor. For example, if a data point was associated with the y-coordinate of the 4<sup>th</sup> dot, the accumulated regressor would contain the sum of only the first three y-coordinates. This accumulated regressor is equal to the regressor resulting from Gram-Schmidt orthonormalisation of the full sum of y-coordinates with respect to the last shown y-coordinate. The accumulated evidence regressor was derived from the ideal observer model as the log posterior odds of the two alternatives, but this was almost 100&#x0025; correlated with the simple sum of x-coordinates. The small differences between model-based accumulated evidence and sum of x-coordinates after normalisation resulted from a small participant-specific offset representing the overall bias of the participant towards one decision alternative.</p>

<title>Identification of significant source-level effects</title>
<p>To identify significant correlations between regressors of interest and source signals we followed the summary statistics approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Friston, Ashburner, Kiebel, Nichols, &#x0026; Penny, 2006</xref>) and performed twosided t-tests on the second level (group-level, t-tests across participants). We corrected for multiple comparisons across time points and brain areas by controlling the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Benjamini &#x0026; Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Specifically, for identifying significant effects reported in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold> we corrected across 25,340 tests covering 70 time points (0 to 690 ms from dot onset in 10 ms steps) and 362 brain areas (180 brain areas of interest per hemisphere plus one collection of sources per hemisphere that fell between the area definitions provided by the atlas). We report all significant effects of this analysis in <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>.</p>

<p>In <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></bold> we report time courses of group-level regression coefficients aligned to trial-specific response times of participants. To estimate the impact of dot positions on the signal in primary motor cortex (area 4) we associated each time point from the response in a trial with the dot position that was visible on the screen a fixed temporal distance (delay, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref></bold>) before that time point. This delay implemented a hypothesis of when after a dot position change we would observe the effects in the signal in the form of correlations. For each time point from the response and participant and given a fixed delay we estimated regression coefficients for regressors x-coordinate, y-coordinate, perceptual updates for x and y and intercept across trials of individual participants. We further repeated this for all delays from 300 to 500 ms, because of our previous finding that evidence correlations were strong on average across the brain in this time period after dot onset. We then averaged regression coefficients across delays within participants, thus considering participant-level variation. We computed group-level statistics using two-sided t-tests over the averaged coefficients and corrected for multiple comparisons across time points and the two hemispheres with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with &#x03B1; &#x003D; 0.01. After this correction, only the evidence and intercept (response-aligned average) had group-level coefficients significantly different from 0 (evidence effects shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></bold>, significant intercept effects: 10-50 ms in left M1, &#x2212;420 ms in right M1). <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></bold> depicts the mean coefficients across participants for each time point before the trial-specific response together with a band of uncertainty with a width of twice the standard error of the mean above and below the mean.</p>

<p>In the standard regression analysis there was one regressor for each element in the sequence of dot positions (dots). This allowed us to see, when after first dot onset, correlations with the considered dot could be observed. The figure demonstrates exemplarily for the magnetometer channel with the strongest average correlations that the correlation time course exhibits roughly a stereotyped profile relative to the onset time of the dot on the second level. Dotted lines show the same quantity, but for data that we permuted over trials before the regression analysis.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Time courses from the expanded regression analysis in dot onset aligned time in source space.</title>
<p>Values are mean (across brain areas) magnitude of second-level regression coefficients (&#x03B2;). Shown are effects for all used regressors (excluding the intercept). All regressors were derived from the dot positions. Regressors derived from x-coordinates (evidence) are shown in blue while y-coordinate regressors are shown in orange. For reference we also plotted regression coefficients obtained from permuted data as dotted lines. We included 4 different measures in our analysis: &#x2018;momentary&#x2019; (evidence) are the original x&#x002D; and y-coordinates (cf. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref></bold>), &#x2018;accumulated&#x2019; corresponds to summed coordinates, but only up to the previous dot (see Methods), &#x2018;absolute&#x2019; are the absolute coordinates measuring only the displacement of the dot from 0 in both directions and &#x2018;perceptual update&#x2019; is the absolute difference between the latest and the previous dot positions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wyart et al., 2012</xref>). Only the regressors respecting the sign of the coordinates (momentary and accumulated) exhibit strong effects. Note that we shifted the effects for the accumulated regressors 100 ms to the right to account for them being defined for the previous dot position instead of the current ones as for the other regressors. Also, the effects measured with the accumulated regressors, although accumulated and momentary regressors were uncorrelated, are a mixture of effects attributable to raw x&#x002D;, y-coordinates and their cumulative sum, because accumulated regressors of dot <italic>d</italic>-1, although being uncorrelated to momentary regressors of dot <italic>d</italic>, are correlated with momentary regressors of dot <italic>d</italic>-1 and earlier.</p></caption>
