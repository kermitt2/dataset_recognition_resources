<title>Abstract</title>
<p>A pot experiment was conducted to study the effects of two different low nitrogen tolerant tartary buckwheat varieties&#x2019; (Diqing buckwheat (DQ, low nitrogen resistance) and Heifeng 1 (HF, low nitrogen sensitive) response mechanism of organic acids to low nitrogen stress. The results showed that the soil moisture of HF and DQ under low nitrogen treatment decreased 24.2&#x0025; and 14.32&#x0025;, respectively when compared with normal nitrogen treatment, and the water consumption of DQ was significantly higher than that of HF at seedling stage. Under low nitrogen treatment, the soil pH value of DQ was 1.44&#x0025; and 8.44&#x0025; lower than that of HF at seedling and flowering stages, respectively, the content of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> in DQ soil was 8.2&#x0025; lower than that of HF at maturity stage, the content of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> was significantly higher than that HF 49.2&#x0025;, 12.9&#x0025;, and 16.6&#x0025; in each growth period, respectively. Split plot analysis showed that nitrogen treatment significantly affected the organic acids content in the soil of the buckwheat. The secretion content of organic acids are different among buckwheat cultivars under low nitrogen stress. In the soil of DQ, the content of malonic acid was higher than that of HF by 34.39&#x0025; at maturity stage; the content of oxalic acid was respectively higher than that of HF by 24.86&#x0025; and 24.52&#x0025; at seedling and flowering stages; the content of propionic acid was significantly higher than that of HF by 7.36&#x0025;, 9.44&#x0025; and23.47&#x0025; in each growth period, respectively; and tartaric acid acetic acid also showed the same trend at flowering and maturity stages. In summary, tartary buckwheat may regulate the nutrient availability of rhizosphere soil through the secretion of organic acids in the root system to cope with the low nitrogen stress environment. For the cultivation of tartary buckwheat on poor soil should consider the differences cultivaring barren resistance varieties to increase efficiency in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nitrogen is one of the basic nutrients required for plant growth, which affects crop growth, yield and quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The lack of nitrogen can lead to slow plant growth, decrease yields, and reduce quality. Therefore, the soil must contain enough nitrogen to meet the normal growth of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. But nitrogen is a limiting factor in many arable soils in China. For example, the major characteristics of Loess Plateau soils are nitrogen deficiency, low phosphorus and sufficient potassium so that a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer is applied to ensure yield during planting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. However, nitrogen fertilizers have lower utilization efficiency, the loss of a large amount of nitrogen not only causes huge waste, but also causes problems such as water bodies and environmental pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Therefore, focusing on the overall objective of building a green, efficient and sustainable agricultural production system, the selection of crops with low nitrogen tolerance can not only ensure the normal growth of crops, but also control the amount of nitrogen fertilizer and improve the utilization efficiency of nitrogen and it has significance for improving the ecological environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Many scholars have conducted research on the low-nitrogen-resistant characteristics of large crops such as wheat and corn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], but there are few researches on small grains such as tartary buckwheat. Most of the buckwheat is grown in the alpine region, which has the characteristics of short fertility cycle, strong adaptability, drought tolerance and barrenness, and it has extremely high edible value and medicinal value, which is an important disaster relief and pioneer crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The research on tartary buckwheat mainly focuses on the edible medicinal value, germplasm screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]and cultivation techniques, but few studies on the underground parts of tartary buckwheat, especially the response mechanism of tartary buckwheat to low-nitrogen stress are rarely reported.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that after suffering stress from soil nutrient, plant roots first feel the stress and react quickly to adapt to the stress environment through a series changes of root physiological, especially some stress conditions can induce the plant roots to secrete large amounts of organic acids, which is a common active adaptive response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The articles on organic acids secreted by root system under, low nitrogen stress mainly focus on oats, rice and other crops, and also have different results. With the growth of oats, the total amount of organic acids gradually decreased in root exudates, and the total amount of organic acids secreted by the oat roots under nitrogen stress was significantly higher than that of nitrogen supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Low nitrogen or nitrogen deficiency to accelerate root aging, significantly decrease root secretion capacity and various organic acids of different degrees in rice maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Other studies show that there are significant differences in the types and quantities of crop root exudates of the same type of different genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], and there are different responses to environmental stresses among different cultivars of the same crop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. After the determination of various indicators of different genotypes of tartary buckwheat, studies found that the resistance to barrenness of Diqing buckwheat was strong, while the resistance to barrenness of HeiFeng 1 was weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Therefore, this paper take two different barren tartary buckwheat Diqing and Heifeng 1 as material to compare the differences of root exudation of organic acids in different tartary buckwheat under different nitrogen treatments by pot experiments, in order to explore the response mechanism of buckwheat with different barren conditions to low-nitrogen stress, so as to increase the understanding of tartary buckwheat resistance barren characteristics. It can provide a scientific basis for farmland nitrogen fertilizer optimization management in barren areas of the Loess Plateau.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Effect of Organic Acids on Soil Environment</title>
<p>As the contact surface of plants and soil, roots constantly absorb nutrients and water from the soil to maintain their growth. The root system may secretes various organic acids in rhizosphere when subjected to nutrient stress, which could affect plant growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. In this experiment, the principal component analysis showed that malonic acid, propionic acid, tartaric acid and acetic acid had a significant positive correlation with the water consumption of buckwheat, and the water consumption of two tartary buckwheat cultivars under the low N treatment was higher than that under the normal N treatment. Studies have shown that the crop will increase the growth of the main root to absorb water and nutrients deeper and further away from the root system when faced with stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Therefore, the plants may pass through a large amount of transpiration, allowing more water to carry nutrients into the body for photosynthesis to maintain growth, and at the same time some anti-stress substances are synthesized and secreted through organic acids under low nitrogen stress. However, DQ absorbed more water under normal nitrogen treatment during the mature period, probably because DQ is still undergoing photosynthesis and vegetative growth during this period, and needs to consume more water and substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Secondly, the principal component analysis showed that there was a significant negative correlation between several organic acids and the soil pH, due to the organic acids secreted by the root increase the concentration of H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in the soil and result the decrease of the pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In addition, the analysis showed that there are a positive correlation between the content of several organic acids and the available nitrogen content of soil (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>). Previous studies have shown that organic acids secreted by roots can enhance soil nutrient availability, promote the utilization of potentially effective nutrients in the soil, enhance the soil ability to adapt to nutrient-stressed environments by acidifying, chelating insoluble nutrients and ion exchange and restore effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Therefore, the secretion of organic acids from the roots may accelerate the conversion of urea in the soil and increase the availability of the available nitrogen components. Studies have shown that less phosphorus can induce plant roots to secrete large amounts of organic acids, which is of great importance to promote the utilization of insoluble phosphorus-containing compounds in soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Organic carbon and nitrogen released into soil by the exudation, of which 90&#x0025; are reabsorbed by the root, promote the material circulation and energy flow of plant nutrient elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. In addition, the low-molecular-weight organic acids secreted by roots can also provide the necessary carbon source and energy for soil microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], which can promote the decomposition and transformation of soil organic matter then release nutrients for plant absorption and utilization which could promote plant growth and development.</p>

<title>Effect of different nitrogen treatments on organic acids secreted by roots of Tartary buckwheat</title>
<p>For a long time, the coupling of plant carbon and nitrogen metabolism has been a hot issue in plant physiology and plant nutrition research, and organic acids are the bond of carbon-nitrogen metabolism coupling. On the one hand, nitrogen metabolism affects the level of organic acids in plants; on the other hand, the formation and accumulation of organic acids play an important role in nitrogen metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. It can be seen from the above studies that different nitrogen treatments have significant effects on several organic acids, but the effects are different. The content of single organic acids in the low nitrogen treatments also increases or decreases. Studies have shown that citric acid can be detected in root exudates of soybeans when the nitrogen concentration is low. Conversely, higher concentrations of nitrogen are undetectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In this experiment, higher concentrations of oxalic acid and propionic acid were detected in the soils of both buckwheat cultivars under low N treatment at seedling and flowering stages. At the same time, the content of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> in DQ soil was lower than that of normal N at seedling and flowering stage, while the content of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> in both buckwheat soils was higher than that of normal N at flowering stage under low N treatment. When subjected to nutrient stress, roots of different crops secrete a large amount of certain organic acids to adapt to the stress, and promote nutrient absorption and plant growth through the effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Under nutrient and water stress, A large number of citric acid was secreted by the roots of two-year-old Larix olgensis, followed by malic acid, oxalic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Oxalic acid and citric acid exuded from SH40 and Balenghaitang were increased largely under iron-deficiency stress, significantly increased oxalic acid and citric acid exudation is probably responsible for the tolerance of SH40and Balenghaitang to iron-deficiency stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. White lupine roots secrete a large amount of citric acid to activate the insoluble phosphate in the soil under phosphorus stress, thereby increasing the phosphorus utilization in the soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. A large amount of organic acids will be secreted by larch roots When subjected to soil nutrient stress, and the various physiological and ecological functions of seedlings will be adversely affected by these organic acids to prevent the seedling cell membrane system from being destroyed by stress conditions and thereby protecting the cell membrane system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. In summary, a large number of organic acids may be secreted by the roots of buckwheat to adapt to low N stress. At the same time, these organic acids will promote the conversion of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, which will increase the content of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> in the soil and accelerate the absorption of nitrogen. Whether this judgment is correct or not requires further study.</p>
<p>In this experiment, the contents of several organic acids detected in the soils of two buckwheat cultivars were lower than that of normal N treatment, the content of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> detected in the DQ soil was higher than that of the normal N treatment, and the content of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> detected in the two buckwheat soils was lower than that of the normal N treatment under low N treatment at maturity stage, which may be due to that plant life activity is basically completed at maturity, the demand for nutrients is reduced, and the content of various organic acids secreted by the root system is also decreased, simultaneously the nitrogen content in the soil was less at maturity. Therefore, the content of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> that can be absorbed was less under low N treatment, and then the contents of organic acids secreted by the root system also decreased. At the same time, the promotion of the conversion of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> was reduced, resulting in more NH4&#x002B; content and less NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> content in the soil. Low N or N deficiency accelerated the root senescence, the root exudation ability was significantly decreased, and the organic acids secreted by the root decreased in varying degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In the above study, the pH of DQ soil was higher than that of normal N treatment at seedling stage and flowering stage and the pH of HF soil was higher than that of normal N treatment at maturity under low N treatment. This may be due to the total amount of organic acids secreted by the root of the buckwheat were more under the normal N treatment, resulting in a lower soil pH value. Another study shows that nitrate ion is the most important form of inorganic nitrogen absorbed by plant roots. Once it enters the cell, it will be converted into ammonium ions, which in turn participate in the synthesis of amino acid. Plant cells absorb NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> and synergistically absorb H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, plants generally continue to release H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to the outside of their cells through respiration, or release the acidic substance to the environment through secretion in order to maintain intracellular pH balance(Ji et al.,2012). Available NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> is relatively less under nitrogen-deficient conditions, and thus the concentration of organic acids released to the environment is relatively low. Conversely, higher concentrations of organic acids are released to the environment under high nitrogen conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>

<title>Effects of low nitrogen stress on root exudation of organic acids in different Tartary buckwheat</title>
<p>Nitrogen is the most needed nutrient for crop growth and development and it is also a major limiting factor for crop growth. Low nitrogen has a significant effect on plant growth and fruit quality, but there are obvious genotypic differences in the degree of impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Low-nitrogen tolerant cultivars may have a stronger response mechanism, which make them less affected by low nitrogen stress. Previous studies of different barren crops under low nitrogen stress mainly focused on the differences of their morphological, physiological and root activities. With the increase of low nitrogen stress, The root length and root thickness of low N resistant maize varieties were increased and reduced respectively, and the root morphology is better, root physiological activity and tolerance to low nitrogen stress is strong in order to maintain a more stable growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Low nitrogen tolerant maize varieties could maintain high root activity under low N stress, thus the nutrient absorption and transport of root system was promoted and the carbon and nitrogen cycle was well maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Low-nitrogen-resistant buckwheat cultivars could maintain higher activities of SOD and POD and produce less MDA under low N stress. Higher root activity, NR activity and protein content making it better able to adapt to low-nitrogen environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In low phosphorus soils, some plant species can grow normally, but some plants are blocked or even die. <italic>C.ichangensis Swing.</italic> the most resistant to phosphorus deficiency, had the highest total amount of organic acid in rhizosphere soil under phosphorus starvation condition. <italic>C.aurantium L.</italic> with the least amount of organic acids in rhizosphere soil had weaker tolerance to phosphorus stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].These previous studies have shown that the ability of different genotypes to adapt to stress is different, and barren varieties are more adaptive under nutrient stress. The differences in the types and contents of organic acids secreted by different tartary buckwheat roots may be indicative of their genotypic differences.In this experiment, the water consumption of DQ was significantly higher than that of HF at seedling stage under low N treatment. The reason may not only low-nitrogen-tolerant cultivars had relatively high chlorophyll content, but also photosynthetic system II reaction center was less damaged in low nitrogen environment which could make it a good adaptation. And then photosynthesis can be carried out by absorbing a large amount of water and some anti-stress substances can be synthesized in low nitrogen environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Under low nitrogen treatment, the content of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> in DQ soil was lower than that of HF at maturity, and the content of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> in DQ soil was higher than that of HF at different growth periods. This may be due to that low-nitrogen-tolerant cultivars have a stronger ability to transform nitrogen under low N stress, and convert it from urea to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup>, then they can be rapidly transformed into NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> which is better absorbed by the plants, thus the soils of low-nitrogen-tolerant cultivars have a high content of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>. However, the content of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> in low-nitrogen-tolerant soils was lower at maturity stage, which may be due to the large amount of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x002B;</sup> converted to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In addition, the soil pH of DQ was lower than that of HF at seedling and flowering stage under low N treatment, probably because DQ secreted more organic acids. It turns out that the contents of several organic acids in DQ soil were higher than those in HF under low N stress. In summary, barren-resistant cultivars may adapt to low N stress by secreting more organic acids. Under low N stress, the difference in the secretion of organic acids between Diqing buckwheat and Heifeng 1 may be one of different barren resistance.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The organic acids secreted by the roots will decrease the soil pH value, accelerate nitrogen transformation and have an impact on the soil environment. Under low nitrogen treatment, the content of single organic acid in the soil is different, and the plant may regulate the nutrient availability of rhizosphere soil through the secretion of several single organic acids in the root system to cope with the stressful environment. In addition, the ability of different genotypes to adapt to stress is different, and the resistant varieties have stronger adaptability. Diqing buckwheat secretes more organic acids than Heifeng 1 under low nitrogen stress, which may be the reason for its strong resistance. For the cultivation of tartary buckwheat on poor soil should consider the differences, breeding barren resistance varieties to increase efficiency in the future.</p>
