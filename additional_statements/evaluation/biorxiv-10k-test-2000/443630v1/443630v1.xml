<title>Summary</title>
<p>The type VII protein secretion system (T7SS) is conserved across <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains and plays important roles in virulence and interbacterial competition. To date only one T7SS substrate protein, encoded in a subset of strains, has been functionally characterized. Here, using an unbiased proteomic approach, we identify TspA as a further T7SS substrate. TspA, encoded distantly from the T7SS gene cluster, is found across all <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains. Heterologous expression of TspA indicates that it has a toxic C-terminal domain that depolarizes membranes. The membrane depolarizing activity is alleviated by co-production of the TsaI immunity protein. Using a zebrafish hindbrain ventricle infection model, we demonstrate that the T7SS of strain RN6390 contributes to zebrafish mortality, and deletion of <italic>tspA</italic> leads to increased bacterial clearance <italic>in vivo</italic>. The toxin domain of TspA is highly polymorphic and <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains encode multiple <italic>tsaI</italic> homologues at the <italic>tspA</italic> locus, suggestive of additional roles in intra-species competition. In agreement, we demonstrate TspA-dependent growth inhibition of RN6390 by strain COL in the zebrafish infection model, that is alleviated by the presence of TsaI homologues. This is the first T7SS substrate protein shown to have activity against both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Type VII secretion system (T7SS) has been characterised in bacteria of the actinobacteria and firmicutes phyla. In pathogenic mycobacteria the ESX-1 T7SS secretes numerous proteins that are essential for virulence and immune evasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The Ess T7SS of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is also required for pathogenesis in murine models of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and a longitudinal study of persistent <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection in the airways of a cystic fibrosis patient showed that the <italic>ess</italic> T7SS genes were highly upregulated during a 13 year timespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that in addition to having anti-eukaryotic activity, the T7SS of firmicutes mediates interbacterial competition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Some strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> secrete a DNA endonuclease toxin, EsaD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, that when overproduced leads to growth inhibition of a sensitive <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, <italic>Streptococcus intermedius</italic> exports at least three LXG domain-containing toxins, TelA, TelB and TelC that mediate contact-dependent growth inhibition against a range of Gram positive species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A large integral membrane ATPase of the FtsK/SpoIIIE family, termed EssC in firmicutes, is a conserved component of all T7SSs and probably energizes protein secretion as well as forming part of the translocation channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Three further membrane proteins function alongside the ATPase to mediate T7 protein secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. EsxA, a small secreted protein of the WXG100 family, is a further conserved T7 component that is dependent on the T7SS for its translocation across the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In <italic>S. aureus</italic> the T7 structural components are encoded at the <italic>ess</italic> locus. In commonly-studied <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains including Newman, RN6390 and USA300, the T7 substrates EsxB, EsxC, EsxD and EsaD are encoded immediately downstream of <italic>essC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>) and are co-regulated with the genes coding for machinery components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. With the exception of EsaD the biological activities of these substrates are unknown, although mutational studies have suggested that EsxB and EsxC contribute to persistent infection in a murine abscess model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Despite the <italic>ess</italic> locus forming part of the core <italic>S. aureus</italic> genome, these four substrate proteins are not conserved across <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates, being found in only approximately 50&#x0025; of sequenced strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, inactivation of the T7SS in <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain ST398 shows a similar decrease in kidney abscess formation as that seen for T7 mutants in Newman and USA300<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, despite the fact that recognizable homologues of EsxB/EsxC/EsxD/EsaD are not encoded by this strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This strongly suggests that there are further <italic>S. aureus</italic> T7 substrates that are yet to be identified. Here we have taken an unbiased approach to identify T7 substrates using quantitative proteomic analysis of culture supernatants from <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN6390 wild type and <italic>essC</italic> strains. We identify a new substrate, TspA that is encoded distantly from the <italic>ess</italic> gene cluster and is found in all sequenced <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains. Further analysis indicates that TspA has a toxic C-terminal domain that depolarizes membranes. Using a zebrafish hindbrain ventricle infection model, we reveal that TspA is important for zebrafish killing and interbacterial competition <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>The <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN6390 T7SS secreted proteome</title>
<p>To identify candidate T7 substrates, RN6390 and an isogenic <italic>essC</italic> deletion strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> were cultured in the minimal medium RPMI. Both strains grew identically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>) and expressed components of the T7SS, and as expected secretion of EsxA was abolished in the <italic>essC</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). Culture supernatants were isolated when cells reached OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 1, and label-free quantitative proteomics used to assess changes in protein abundance of four biological replicates of each secretome. Following identification of 1170 proteins, 17 proteins showed, with high confidence (p &#x003C; 0.05, 2-fold change), a decrease in abundance in the secretome of the <italic>essC</italic> strain relative to the RN6390 parent strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1E</xref>; Table S1).</p>
<p>Proteomic analysis indicated that the secreted core component, EsxA, was significantly reduced in abundance in the <italic>essC</italic> secretome, as expected from the western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). Peptides from the membrane-bound T7 component EsaA, which has a large surface-exposed loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, were also less abundant in the supernatant of the <italic>essC</italic> strain, as were EsxD and EsaD, known substrates of the T7SS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (Table 1, Table S1). The EsxC substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> was also exclusively detected in the supernatant of the wild type strain, but only two EsxC peptides were detected and it did not meet the p &#x003C; 0.01 cut-off (Table S1). EsxB, another previously identified substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and EsaE, which is co-secreted with EsaD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> were not detected in any of our analysis.</p>
<p>After EsxD, the protein with the highest relative abundance in the secretome of the wild type strain was the uncharacterized protein SAOUHSC_00584. This protein harbours a predicted LXG domain which is common to some T7SS substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Other proteins enriched in the secretome of the wild type strain include a predicted superantigen (SAOUHSC_00389), the secretory antigen SsaA, two predicted membrane-bound lipoproteins (SAOUHSC_01180 and SAOUHSC_02695), two uncharacterized proteins (SAOUHSC_00406 and SAOUHSC_02448) and several predicted cytoplasmic proteins (Table 1). A small number of proteins were found to be enriched in abundance in the <italic>essC</italic> secretome (Table S1), including the heme oxygenase IsdI, which is known to be upregulated when the T7SS is inactivated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>SAOUHSC_00584/TspA localizes to the membrane dependent on EssC</title>
<p>We next constructed tagged variants of each of SAOUHSC_00389, SAOUHSC_00406, SAOUHSC_00584, SAOUHSC_02448 and SsaA to probe their subcellular locations in the wild type and &#x0394;<italic>essC</italic> strains. C-terminally HA-tagged SAOUHSC_00389, SAOUHSC_02448 and SsaA were secreted into the culture supernatant in an <italic>essC</italic>-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig S1</xref>), indicating that these proteins are not substrates of the T7SS and their reduced abundance in the <italic>essC</italic> secretome may arise for pleiotropic reasons. Overproduction of C-terminally Myc-tagged SAOUHSC_00406 caused cell lysis, seen by the presence of TrxA in the supernatant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig S1B</xref>). By contrast, a C-terminally Myc-tagged variant of SAOUHSC_00584 was detected only in the cellular fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig S1C</xref>). To probe the subcellular location of SAOUHSC_00584-Myc, we generated cell wall, membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref> shows that the tagged protein localizes to the membrane and that it appears to be destabilized by the loss of EssC. SAOUHSC_00584 was subsequently renamed TspA (<underline>T</underline>ype <underline>S</underline>even dependent <underline>P</underline>rotein A).</p>

<p>TspA is predicted to be 469 amino acids long and to have either one (TMHMM) or two (Predictprotein.org) transmembrane domains towards its C-terminal end. To determine whether it is an integral membrane protein we washed isolated membranes with urea which removes peripherally bound proteins by denaturation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref> indicates that a large fraction of TspA-Myc is displaced from the membrane to the cytoplasmic fraction by urea whereas a <italic>bona fide</italic> integral membrane protein, EssB, is not displaced by this treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We conclude that TspA-Myc peripherally interacts with the membrane. This is consistent with findings from the proteomic experiment as peptides along the entire length of TspA were detected in the secretome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig S2</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether TspA-Myc is exposed at the extracellular side we prepared spheroplasts and treated them with proteinase K. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref> shows that at low concentrations of proteinase K, TspA-Myc was proteolytically cleaved to release a smaller fragment that also cross-reacted with the anti-Myc antibody. At least part of this smaller fragment must be extracellular as it was also degraded as the protease concentration was increased. An approximately 37 kDa C-terminal fragment of TspA-Myc detected natively in the absence of added protease was also extracellular as it was sensitive to digestion by proteinase K. The likely topology of TspA is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E</xref>.</p>
<p>All <italic>S. aureus</italic> T7SS substrate proteins identified to date are found only in a subset of strains, and are linked with specific <italic>essC</italic> subtypes. However, TspA is encoded by all <italic>S. aureus</italic> genomes examined in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and is distant from the <italic>ess</italic> locus. This raised the possibility that TspA may be a further secreted core component of the T7 machinery. To examine this, we constructed an in-frame <italic>tspA</italic> deletion in RN6390 and investigated the subcellular location of the T7 secreted component EsxA and the substrate protein EsxC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref> shows that both EsxA and EsxC are secreted in the absence of TspA. We conclude that TspA is a peripheral membrane protein substrate of the T7SS whose localization and/or stability at the extracellular side of the membrane is dependent on EssC, and that it is not a core component of the T7SS.</p>

Colicin Ia has an amphipathic domain at its C-terminus that inserts into the cytoplasmic membrane from the extracellular side to form a voltage-gated channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. To investigate the function of TspA, DNA encoding full length TspA or the C-terminal domain alone (TspA<sub>CT</sub>) was cloned into a tightly-regulatable vector for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref> shows that production of TspA or TspA<sub>CT</sub> did not affect <italic>E. coli</italic> survival. However, colicin Ia shows a sidedness for channel formation because it requires a transmembrane voltage for full insertion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We therefore targeted TspA<sub>CT</sub> to the periplasm of <italic>E. coli</italic> by fusing to a Tat signal peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref> shows that this construct was toxic, and that toxicity was relieved when the Tat pathway was inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>), consistent with the C-terminal domain of TspA exerting toxic activity from the periplasmic side of the membrane.</p>
<p>To assess TspA<sub>CT</sub> activity we first used the BacLight assay to test for membrane depolarization. This uses 3,3&#x2032;-diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide DiOC<sub>2</sub>(3), a dye that exhibits green florescence in dilute solution but a red shift following membrane potential-driven accumulation in the bacterial cytosol. After sorting of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells by flow cytometry it was seen that the majority of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells harbouring the empty vector exhibited red fluorescence, which shifted to green following treatment with the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). A similar shift in fluorescence was also observed when <italic>E. coli</italic> produced the AmiAss-TspA<sub>CT</sub> fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3D</xref>), indicative of loss of membrane potential. We conclude that the C-terminal domain of TspA has membrane depolarising activity.</p>

<p>Pore-forming proteins are widely used as toxins to target either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. To determine whether TspA forms pores we used single-cell microscopy that combines the voltage-sensitive dye DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5) with the membrane-impermeable nucleic acid stain Sytox Green<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. <italic>E. coli</italic> cells incubated with Polymyxin B, which produces large ion-permeable pores in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell envelope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, showed strong labelling with Sytox Green, indicative of permeabilisation, coupled with very low DiSC<sub>3</sub> fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E-G</xref>). By contrast, cells harbouring the empty vector had high DiSC<sub>3</sub> fluorescence that was unaffected by supplementation with the inducer L-arabinose, and did not stain with Sytox Green. Cells expressing the AmiAss-TspA<sub>CT</sub> fusion following incubation with arabinose rapidly depolarised, as evidenced by the marked reduction in DiSC<sub>3</sub> fluorescence, but did not detectably stain with Sytox Green, even after prolonged periods of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig S3</xref>). Therefore, it appears that TspA acts by triggering membrane depolarisation but does so by forming ion channels rather than larger, nonselective pores in the <italic>E. coli</italic> inner membrane.</p>
<p>Bacterially-produced channel-forming toxins are often co-expressed with immunity proteins that protect the producing cell from self-intoxication; for example, protection from colicin Ia toxicity is mediated by the membrane-bound Iia immunity protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. TspA is genetically linked to a repeat region of ten genes encoding predicted polytopic membrane proteins with DUF443 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>). To assess whether the DUF443-domain protein encoded adjacent to TspA offers protection against the toxicity of the TspA C-terminal domain, we co-produced the AmiAss-TspA<sub>CT</sub> fusion alongside SAOUHSC_00585 in <italic>E. coli</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref> shows that co-production of SAOUHSC_00585 offered protection of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>).

<title>A zebrafish model for <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection and T7SS activity</title>
<p>To probe whether TspA is important for <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence, we initially developed an immunocompetent murine model of <italic>S. aureus</italic> pneumonia. Previous reports have indicated that 2-4 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> colony forming units (cfu) of strain Newman was a suitable infectious dose, and that bacterial proliferation in lung tissue could be observed after 24 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. We found that at a dose of 8 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> &#x2013; 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> of strain RN6390, the mice were asymptomatic and had almost completely cleared the bacteria from lung tissue after 48 hours, whereas a dose of 8 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> &#x2013; 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> was lethal to all mice within 12 hours. At a dose of 3 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, the mice developed symptoms which resolved within 12 hours, and therefore using this dosage we sought to test whether there was a difference in bacterial proliferation and dissemination dependent on the T7SS. However, after 24 hours of infection with 3 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> cfu of RN6390 or a cognate &#x0394;<italic>essC</italic> strain, counts recovered from the lungs and livers of mice infected with the &#x0394;<italic>essC</italic> strain were not significantly different than those from mice infected with the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that there are likely to be roles for the T7SS in bacterial competition as well as direct interaction with the host, we next developed a model where these two potentially confounding factors could be investigated. The zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), a widely used vertebrate model for development, has recently been adapted to study bacterial infection by human pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The hindbrain ventricle offers a sterile compartment that can be used to follow bacterial interactions <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We first assessed the utility of this infection model by testing the effect of dose and temperature on survival for <italic>S. aureus</italic> inoculated into the hindbrain ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig S5A</xref>) of zebrafish larvae 3 days post fertilisation (dpf). Clear dose-dependent zebrafish mortality was observed, with &#x007E;90&#x0025; of zebrafish surviving a low dose of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (7 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> cfu) whereas only &#x007E;55&#x0025; survived a higher dose (2 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> cfu; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig S5B</xref>). Although 28.5&#x00B0;C is the optimum temperature for zebrafish larvae development, <italic>S. aureus</italic> has a temperature optimum of 30 - 37&#x00B0;C for growth. In agreement with this, we observed significantly increased zebrafish mortality at 33&#x00B0;C relative to 28.5&#x00B0;C, at high dose infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig S5B</xref>).</p>
<p>We next assessed whether there was a role for the T7SS in zebrafish mortality. For these experiments, larvae at 3 dpf were inoculated in the hindbrain ventricle with 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> cfu of RN6390 or an isogenic strain, RN6390 &#x0394;<italic>ess</italic>, lacking all 12 genes (<italic>esxA</italic> through <italic>esaG</italic>) at the <italic>ess</italic> locus3, and incubated at 33&#x00B0;C. We routinely observed that zebrafish mortality was significantly reduced, at both 24 and 48 hr post inoculation (hpi), for fish infected with the RN6390 &#x0394;<italic>ess</italic> strain compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig S5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A,C</xref>). In agreement with this, total bacterial counts of infected fish revealed that following an initial period of six hours where both strains replicated in a similar manner, there was a significant decrease in recovery of the &#x0394;<italic>ess</italic> strain compared to the wild type after 9 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig S5D</xref>), suggesting that bacteria lacking the T7SS are more rapidly cleared <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also tested a second <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain, COL, in this assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig S6A</xref> shows that COL was only weakly virulent at 24 hpi, but at high dose substantial mortality was seen after 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig S6A</xref>). As before, fish mortality was at least in part dependent on a functional T7SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig S6B</xref>), although we observed no difference in bacterial burden between the wild type and &#x0394;<italic>essC</italic> strain at the timepoints sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">FigS6C</xref>). We conclude that the T7SS plays a role in virulence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in this zebrafish infection model.</p>

<p>In addition to TspA, a second T7SS secreted toxin, EsaD (also called EssD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>), has been identified in some <italic>S. aureus</italic> nuclease strains. EsaD was shown to inhibit growth of a competitor <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, but has also been directly implicated in virulence through modulation of cytokine responses and abscess formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We therefore determined whether TspA or EsaD was required for virulence in the zebrafish infection model. Infection of larvae with strain RN6390 lacking TspA resulted in levels of mortality intermediate between the wild type and &#x0394;<italic>ess s</italic>train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>), and a significantly reduced bacterial burden relative to the wild type strain at 9 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). By contrast, no difference was observed in either zebrafish mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>) or bacterial burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D</xref>) between infection with RN6390 and an isogenic <italic>esaD</italic> mutant, indicating no detectable role of EsaD in virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C, 4D</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that zebrafish infection can be used to investigate the role of T7SS effectors <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that TspA (but not EsaD) contributes to T7SS-mediated virulence.</p>

<title>T7SS dependent bacterial competition <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Although TspA is clearly required for full <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence in the zebrafish model, the observed toxicity when heterologously produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> coupled with the presence of immunity genes encoded downstream of <italic>tspA</italic> strongly suggests that secreted TspA may also have antibacterial activity. Previously, the antibacterial activity of EsaD was demonstrated using the <italic>S. aureus</italic> COL strain, and required <italic>esaD</italic> to be overproduced from a multi-copy plasmid in order to observe growth inhibition of sensitive <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. We therefore first tested whether overproduction of TspA in COL could inhibit the growth of strain RN6390 that was deleted for <italic>tspA</italic> along with the 10 genes encoding TsaI homologues. However co-culture experiments in solid or liquid growth conditions failed to demonstrate any TspA-dependent growth inhibition (data not shown).</p>
<p>Zebrafish larvae have recently been adapted to study predator-prey interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, and we reasoned that since the T7SS was active in our zebrafish infection model it may also provide a suitable experimental system to investigate the impact of T7-mediated bacterial competition <italic>in vivo</italic>. COL as the attacker strain was co-inoculated into the hindbrain ventricle, at a 1:1 ratio, with either RN6390 or an isogenic strain lacking immunity proteins for EsaD and TspA (FRU1; RN6390 &#x0394;<italic>saouhsc00268-00278</italic>, &#x0394;<italic>saouhsc00585-00602</italic>). A significant reduction in recovery of the target strain lacking immunity genes was observed compared to the isogenic parental strain at 15 hr post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref>). Conversely, there was significantly greater fish mortality at 24 hr after co-inoculation of COL with the wild type RN6390 than the immunity mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>). Since COL is almost completely avirulent at this time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig S5</xref>) we infer that the mortality arises from RN6390, and as the wild type strain survives better when co-inoculated with COL than the immunity deletion strain co-inoculated with COL, this accounts for the greater fish mortality.</p>

<p>To confirm that the reduced growth of the RN6390 immunity mutant strain was dependent upon a functional T7SS in the attacking strain, we repeated the co-inoculation experiments using a T7 mutant strain of COL (COL&#x0394;<italic>essC</italic>). The RN6390 immunity mutant strain showed significantly higher recovery after 15 hours in the presence of the COL T7 mutant strain than wild type COL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C</xref>) and accordingly this was linked with poorer survival of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref>). Collectively these data highlight the utility of zebrafish for investigating <italic>S. aureus</italic> competition <italic>in vivo</italic>, and demonstrate that bacterial competition and zebrafish mortality is dependent on a functional T7SS in the attacking strain and the absence of immunity proteins against EsaD and TspA in the prey strain, highlighted in the schematic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated which of the EsaD and TspA toxins was responsible for inter-strain competition by using variants of COL deleted for either <italic>tspA</italic> or <italic>esaD</italic> as the attacking strain. It was seen that in the absence of either TspA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5F</xref>) or EsaD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5H</xref>) there was a significant increase in recovery of the RN6390 &#x0394;<italic>saouhsc00268-00278</italic>, &#x0394;<italic>saouhsc00585-00602</italic> prey strain, indicating that each of these toxins has activity against the target strain. However, there was a more pronounced increase in zebrafish mortality when the attacker strain lacked <italic>esaD</italic> than <italic>tspA</italic> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figs 6G and I</xref>), suggesting that EsaD has the more potent antibacterial activity in these conditions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have taken an unbiased approach to discover substrates of the T7SS in <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN6390, identifying the LXG-domain protein, TspA. TspA localizes to the cell envelope and has a toxic C-terminal domain that has membrane-depolarizing activity. While all other previously-identified T7 substrates are encoded at the <italic>ess</italic> locus and are associated with specific <italic>essC</italic> subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, TspA is encoded elsewhere on the genome, and is conserved across all <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains. This suggests TspA plays a key role in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and indeed we show that it contributes to T7SS-mediated virulence in a zebrafish infection model. Pore- and channel-forming toxins are key virulence factors produced by many pathogenic bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, that can act both extracellularly to form pores in eukaryotic cells, like some bacterial hemolysins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, or intracellularly for example by altering permeability of the phagosome, like the pore-forming toxin Listeriolysin-O, or the Type III secretion system effector VopQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>6. It should be noted that the T7SS of strain USA300 has been shown to play a role in release of <italic>S. aureus</italic> during intracellular infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, however RN6390 is only poorly invasive in bronchial epithelial cell lines, and intracellular survival and bacterial release is independent of the T7SS (data not shown). The precise mechanism by which TspA interacts with host cells remains to be determined.</p>
<p>TspA is a highly unusual toxin because it also has antibacterial activity, leading to growth inhibition of a target <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain <italic>in vivo</italic>. Protection from TspA intoxication is mediated by a genetically-linked immunity protein, TsaI. It is interesting to note that the C-terminal domain of TspA is polymorphic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Fig S7</xref>) and that clusters of <italic>tsaI</italic> homologues are encoded at the <italic>tspA</italic> locus, indicative of intraspecies competition with strains accumulating multiple <italic>tsaI</italic>-encoding genes as a likely protective mechanism from TspA sequence variants.</p>
<p>In conclusion we have identified an extracellular toxin that can target across the domains of life under the same <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. To our knowledge it is only the second bacterial exotoxin identified to have such dual-targeting activity, after VasX from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, and the first from Gram positive bacteria.</p>

<p><italic>S. aureus</italic> strains were cultured in RPMI medium for proteomic analysis, as detailed below. For all other experiments <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains were grown in TSB medium at 37&#x00B0;C with vigorous agitation. Chloramphenicol was used 10 &#x03BC;g/ml final concentration for plasmid selection. Anhydrotetracycline (ATC) was added to <italic>S. aureus</italic> cultures at 1 &#x03BC;g/ml during allelic gene replacement. For induction of plasmid-encoded proteins, 500 ng/ml ATC was added to cultures at OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4, and cells were harvested at OD<sub>600</sub> of 2.0. <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown aerobically in LB at 37&#x00B0;C, supplemented with ampicillin (100 &#x03BC;g/ml), kanamycin (50 &#x03BC;g/ml) or chloramphenicol (25 &#x03BC;g/ml) where appropriate. D-glucose and L-arabinose were used to control expression of cloned genes from the pBAD18-Cm vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. For toxicity assays single colonies of MG1655 freshly transformed with the appropriate pBAD18-Cm construct growing on LB agar containing 0.2&#x0025; D-glucose were picked and re-suspended in LB to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0. Serial dilutions to 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup> were prepared and 5 &#x03BC;L of each spotted onto LB agar supplemented with 0.2&#x0025; D-glucose, 0.02&#x0025; L-arabinose or 0.2&#x0025; L-arabinose and incubated overnight at 37&#x00B0;C.</p>

<title>Preparation of culture supernatants for proteomic analysis</title>
<p><italic>S. aureus</italic> strains were grown overnight in 2 mL TSB after which cells were harvested, washed three times with 10 mL of RPMI medium, resuspended in 2 mL of RPMI and used to inoculate 200 mL RPMI in 2 L baffled flasks. Cultures were grown at 37&#x00B0;C with vigorous agitation until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0 was reached, after which cultures were cooled to 4&#x00B0;C, cells pelleted and supernatant proteins precipitated with 6&#x0025; trichloroacetic acid (TCA) on ice overnight. The precipitated protein samples were harvested by centrifugation (15 min at 18000 <italic>g</italic>) re-suspended in 80&#x0025; acetone (&#x2212;20&#x00B0;C) and washed twice with 80&#x0025; acetone.

<title>Mass spectrometry data analysis and label-free quantitation</title>
<p>Sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis was performed similar to previously described work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Precipitated proteins were re-dissolved in 1&#x0025; sodium 3-[(2-methyl-2-undecyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy]-1-propanesulfonate (commercially available as RapiGest, Waters), 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM TCEP. Cysteines were alkylated by addition of 20 mM Iodoacetamide and incubation for 20 min at 25&#x00B0;C in the dark and the reaction quenched by addition of 20 mM DTT. Samples were diluted to 0.1&#x0025; Rapigest with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and Trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) was added at a 1:50 ratio. Proteins were digested overnight at 37&#x00B0;C under constant shaking.</p>
<p>Samples from four biological replicates (0.5 &#x03BC;g of digest for the secretome analyses) were injected in an interleaved manner onto a 2 cm &#x00D7; 100 &#x03BC;m trap column and separated on a 50 cm &#x00D7; 75 &#x03BC;m EasySpray Pepmap C18 reversed-phase column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a Dionex 3000 Ultimate RSLC. Peptides were eluted by a linear 3-hour gradient of 95&#x0025; A/5&#x0025; B to 35&#x0025; B (A: H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.1&#x0025; Formic acid (FA); B: 80&#x0025; ACN, 0.08&#x0025; FA) at 300 nl/min into a LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Data was acquired using a data-dependent &#x201C;top 20&#x201D; method, dynamically choosing the most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (400- 1600 Th, 60,000 resolution, AGC target value 106). Precursors above the threshold of 2000 counts were isolated within a 2 Th window and fragmented by CID in the LTQ Velos using normalised collision energy of 35 and an activation time of 10 ms. Dynamic exclusion was defined by a list size of 500 features and exclusion duration of 60 s. Lock mass was used and set to 445.120025 for ions of polydimethylcyclosiloxane (PCM).</p>
<p>Label-free quantitation was performed using MaxQuant 1.5.7.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Data were searched against the Uniprot database of <italic>S. aureus</italic> NCTC8325 (downloaded on 29.03.17) containing 2,889 sequences and a list of common contaminants in proteomics experiments using the following settings: enzyme Trypsin/P, allowing for 2 missed cleavage, fixed modifications were carbamidomethyl (C), variable modifications were set to Acetyl (Protein N-term), Deamidation (NQ) and Oxidation (M). MS/MS tolerance was set to 0.5 Da, precursor tolerance was set to 6 ppm. Peptide and Protein FDR was set to 0.01, minimal peptide length was 7, and one unique peptide was required. Re-quantify and retention time alignment (2 min) were enabled. If no intensities were detected in one condition and the other condition had intensities in at least in 3 out of 4 replicates, values were imputed in Perseus v1.5.1.1 using default parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. A student&#x2019;s t-test (two-tailed, homoscedastic) was performed on the LFQ intensities and only proteins with p&#x003C;0.05 and a fold-change &#x003E;2-fold were considered significant.</p>

<title>Cell fractionation and western blotting</title>
<p>Preparation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell and supernatant samples for western blotting, and subcellular fractionation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> into cell wall, membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.

Membranes were harvested by ultracentrifugation (227 000 &#x00D7; <italic>g</italic>, 30 min). The supernatant was retained as the urea-treated cytoplasmic fraction and the membrane pellet resuspended in 1 &#x00D7; PBS, 0.5 &#x0025; Triton X-100. For spheroplast preparation, the method of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> was adapted. Briefly, strains were cultured as described above, cells were harvested at OD<sub>600</sub> of 2.0 and resuspended in Buffer A (0.7M sucrose, 20mM maleate, 20mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 6.5). Lysostaphin and lysozyme were added at 20 &#x03BC;g/ml and 20 mg/ml final concentration, respectively, and cells incubated at 37&#x00B0;C for 1 hour.

<title>Bacterial membrane potential detection</title>
<p>To assess bacterial membrane potential, the method of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> was adapted, using the BacLight bacterial membrane potential kit (Invitrogen). In brief, overnight cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 harbouring pBAD18-Cm derivatives were sub-cultured into LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 and cultured aerobically to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5, before supplementation with 0.2&#x0025; L-arabinose. Cells were cultured for a further hour then diluted to 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> cells per ml in sterile PBS, and a 1ml aliquot of bacterial suspension was added to each flow cytometry tube. For the depolarized control, 25 &#x03BC;L of 500 &#x03BC;M carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), provided in the BacLight bacterial membrane potential kit, was added. Next, 3 &#x03BC;L of 3mM DiOC<sub>2</sub>(3) was added to each sample, which was mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cells were subsequently sorted using an LSRFortessa cell analyser (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The DiOC<sub>2</sub>(3) dye was excited at 488 nm, with fluorescent emissions detected at 530 and 685 nm. In total, 20000 events were collected for each sample, with forward- and side-scatter parameters used to gate the bacteria. The forward scatter, side scatter, and fluorescence were collected with logarithmic signal amplification. The gated populations were then analysed with FlowJo software by generating a dot plot of red versus green fluorescence.</p>
<p>To assess changes in membrane potential and permeabilisation, the same <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were grown as described above. An &#x2018;uninduced&#x2019; sample of <italic>E. coli</italic> harbouring each of pBAD18-Cm (empty), pAmiAss-TspA<sub>CT</sub> and pAmiAss-TspA<sub>CT</sub>-TsaI was collected and adjusted to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2 before the addition of 2 &#x03BC;M DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5) and 200 nM Sytox Green. A permeabilised control sample of cells harbouring empty vector and containing 10 &#x03BC;g/ml Polymyxin B was also prepared and supplemented with both dyes. All samples were then incubated at 37&#x00B0;C for 5 minutes before being analysed by microscopy. To induce protein production from the pBAD18- Cm vector, cell suspensions were adjusted to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2 and supplemented with 0.2&#x0025; L-arabinose for the indicated period of time (10-60 min) before incubating with DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5) and Sytox Green, as above. Imaging of DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5) and Sytox Green stained cells was carried out Nikon Eclipse Ti equipped with Sutter Instrument Lambda LS light source, Nikon Plan Apo 100&#x00D7;/1.40 NA Oil Ph3 objective, and Photometrics Prime sCMOS, and Cy5 and GFP filters, respectively. The images were captured using Metamorph 7.7 (Molecular Devices) and analysed using ImageJ. For the analysis, the phase contrast images acquired in parallel to the fluorescence images were used to identify cells as regions of interest, for which average DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5) and Sytox Green fluorescence intensity was measured from the corresponding background-subtracted fluorescence images. Data was then plotted as a scatter plot for DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5) and Sytox Green fluorescence with each point representing an individual cell.</p>
