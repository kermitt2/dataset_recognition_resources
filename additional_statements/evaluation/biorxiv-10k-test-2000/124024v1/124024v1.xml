<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) are key metabolic enzymes that are mutated in a variety of cancers to confer a gain-of-function activity resulting in the accumulation and secretion of an oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Accumulation of 2-HG can result in epigenetic dysregulation and a block in cellular differentiation, suggesting these mutations play a role in neoplasia. Based on its potential as a cancer target, a number of small molecule inhibitors have been developed to specifically inhibit mutant forms of IDH (mIDH1 and mIDH2). Here, a panel of mIDH inhibitors were systematically profiled using biochemical, cell-based, and tier-one ADME techniques. We quantified the biochemical effect of each inhibitor on mIDH1 (R132H and R132C) and mIDH2 (R172Q). The effect of these inhibitors on 2-HG concentrations in seven cell lines representing five different IDH1 mutations in both 2D and 3D cell cultures was assessed. Target engagement of these inhibitors was analyzed utilizing cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA), the effects of inhibitors on reversing 2-HG-induced block on leukemic cellular differentiation. We conclude from our mIDH1 assay panel that AG-120 and a Novartis inhibitor exhibited excellent activity in all biochemical and most cellular assays. While AG-120 has superior DMPK properties, it lacks efficacy a leukemic differentiation model. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive suite of <italic>in vitro</italic> preclinical drug development assays that can be used as a tool-box to identify lead compounds for mIDH drug discovery programs, as well as what we believe is the most comprehensive publically available dataset on the top mIDH inhibitors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mutant isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 (mIDH1) and 2 (mIDH2) represent a remarkable example of the rapidity with which target identification can translate to small-molecule drug discovery and clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Wild type IDH1 protein forms a homodimer that catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to &#x03B1;-ketoglutarate (&#x03B1;-KG, also termed 2-oxoglutarate, 2-OG), using the co-factor NADP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Studies in 2009/10 demonstrated that a subset of acute myelogenous leukemias (AML) and gliomas harbored heterozygous mutations at the R132 position of IDH1 and R140 or R172 of IDH2 (mutations in the two genes are mutually exclusive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Subsequently, it has been shown that &#x003E;75&#x0025; of low-grade gliomas and 20&#x0025; of AML have mutations in IDH1 or IDH2, and mutations are also found in other solid tumors such as chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, colon, pancreatic and prostate cancer to varying extents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>While the R132 mutation reduces normal enzymatic activity, it also confers a neomorphic (gain-of-function) activity. Metabolic profiling showed that the wild type IDH1 product, &#x03B1;-KG, is the substrate of mIDH1, producing D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in a NADPH-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). 2-HG is detected at low concentrations in normal cells, yet is significantly elevated in tumor cells (up to 10 mM) and plasma of patients bearing IDH1/2 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Considerable evidence now exists demonstrating that the 2-HG &#x2018;oncometabolite&#x2019; produced by mIDH1 plays a role in tumorigenesis and cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). 2-HG is structurally similar to &#x03B1;-KG and has been shown to inhibit &#x03B1;-KG-dependent enzymes, modifying the endogenous cellular biochemical balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Consequently, inhibition of &#x03B1;-KG-dependent histone and DNA demethylases by 2-HG leads to elevated methylation of these substrates, altered gene expression, and a block to cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Inhibition of oncogenic mIDH1/2 represents an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. As a target, mIDH1/2 contains a distinct genetic modification allowing personalized medicine using tumor gene sequencing and oncometabolite detection as biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Ideally, specific inhibition of mIDH1 or mIDH2 would have few clinical side-effects, as no endogenous biochemistry would be disrupted by pharmacologic modulation (analogous to the oncogene BCR-ABL). mIDH1 and mIDH2 have therefore received significant attention for the development of small molecule inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>Several biotech and pharmaceutical discovery campaigns for mIDH1/2 inhibitors have been disclosed. Many of these inhibitors are in clinical trials for patients with AML or solid tumors demonstrating the rapid advancement from the first report of the IDH1 mutation seven years ago to current late phase clinical trials. Agios Pharmaceuticals has reported the mIDH1 inhibitor AG-5198 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), optimized from a phenyl-glycine hit from a biochemical screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), along with a similar lead, the phenyl-glycine analog ML309, in collaboration with NCATS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Agios has subsequently revealed their mIDH1 inhibitor clinical candidate, AG-120, currently in phase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Likewise, Novartis has reported multiple probe molecules and their clinical candidate, IDH305 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), is currently in Phase I. Similarly, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline have reported their own mIDH1 probe molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Agios has also developed mIDH2 inhibitors, derived from biochemical screens to produce the heterocyclic urea sulfonamide probe, AGI-6780 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), and two clinical candidates, AG-221 (Phase III) and AG-881 (Phase I, pan-mutant IDH1/2 inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Along with these published peer-reviewed reports, additional chemotypes have been disclosed in patents, which have led to the development of several commercially available inhibitors with limited characterization.</p>
<p>While multiple inhibitors have been reported, some of which are available to research laboratories, the clinical development and proprietary nature of mIDH inhibitors has meant that limited characterization is publically available. In addition, the scope of activity of many of these mIDH inhibitors as pre-clinical chemical probes or tool molecules has not been assessed, and no insight into relative utility is currently available. To remedy this situation, we comprehensively characterized the activity of nine chemically diverse mIDH1 inhibitors in a panel of <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical as well as functional cellular assays. Specifically, inhibitor activity was assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> against mIDH1 enzymes containing multiple clinically-relevant mutations. Cell-based activity was assessed by measurement of 2-HG production, via mass-spectrometry as well as an in-house developed high-throughput fluorescence assay, in cell lines harboring somatic or engineered mIDH1. Inhibitor target engagement was confirmed by utilizing the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Rescue of the 2-HG induced blockade on leukemic differentiation was assessed to compare compound efficacy in an <italic>in vitro</italic> AML model. Three-dimensional (3D) culture of mIDH1 lines was developed as an <italic>in vitro</italic> solid tumor model to compare inhibitor activity via 2-HG production and cell growth. Finally, physicochemical and <italic>in vitro</italic> drug metabolism parameters (i.e. solubility, PAMPA permeability, Caco-2 cell transwell permeability, plasma protein binding, and liver microsomal stability) were determined. Altogether, these assays provide a comprehensive assessment of the comparative activity of the mIDH1 inhibitor landscape and a platform that could be implemented for future mIDH1 inhibitor discovery campaigns. This effort also illustrates a rigorous and general approach to addressing reproducibility in preclinical drug discovery through construction of a hierarchy of biological assays to assess compound suitability for clinical development. Reproducibility and target validity is assessed based on replication of activity not of a single compound in a single assay, but rather of many compounds tested repeatedly across multiple assays with diverse readouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>

<title>Biochemical characterization of mIDH1inhibitors</title>
<p>We characterized the activity of 9 mutant IDH1 inhibitors ( Supplemental Figure 1, A-I) and 3 control mIDH2 inhibitors (Supplemental Figure 1, J-L) against purified recombinant R132H and R132C mIDH1 enzymes, as well as the purified wild type IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes. Each enzyme was coupled to a diaphorase/resazurin readout for a red-shifted fluorescence detection of cofactor turnover to avoid compound fluorescence interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). All mIDH1 inhibitors were more potent against both R132H and R132C mIDH1 enzymes than wild type IDH1, and were inactive against wild type IDH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The most potent inhibitors against both mIDH1 enzymes were AG-120 and Novartis 530 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 40-50 nM. Additionally, AG-120 and Novartis 530 revealed an 85 &#x2013; 106 and 70 - 88 fold separation in potency, respectively, relative to wild type IDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). A strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 0.85) was found for cross-inhibition of the R132H and R132C enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Sanofi&#x2019;s compound 1 demonstrated weak activity (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x003E;13 &#x03BC;M) against all enzymes, and was excluded from subsequent cell-based studies. Control mIDH2 inhibitors demonstrated weak activity (&#x003E;10 &#x03BC;M) against mutant and wild type IDH1 enzymes, and wild type IDH2 enzyme (Supplemental Table 1).</p>

<p>Given the difficulty of predicting the physiological substrate and co-factor concentrations in target tissues and the fact that these are in constant flux within the cell, at times it can be beneficial to pursue non-competitive mechanisms of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). To determine if any of the mIDH1 inhibitors demonstrated competitive inhibition with the mIDH1 substrate &#x03B1;-KG, enzyme inhibition was assessed in the presence of high (10 mM), medium (600 &#x03BC;M), and low (250 &#x03BC;M) concentrations of &#x03B1;-KG. ML309 and AGI-5198 revealed a &#x003E;10-fold loss of activity in the presence of high &#x03B1;-KG, whereas the strongest inhibitors, AG-120 and Novartis 530 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), demonstrated only a 3-4 fold IC<sub>50</sub> shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-G</xref>).</p>

<p>Cellular inhibition of mIDH1 was assessed in four human cell lines derived from various malignancies known to harbor somatic IDH1 mutations - HT1080 (R132C) fibrosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>); SNU1079 (R132C) cholangiocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>); RBE (R132S) cholangiocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>); JJ012 (R132G) chondrosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) - and two cell lines engineered to express mIDH1 - U87 (R132H) glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and THP-1 (R132H) AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) (Supplementary Table 2). Inhibition of the target was assessed by quantitative measurement of 2-HG levels in extracellular media of monolayer (or 2-dimentional, 2D) cultures following incubation (48 hrs) with inhibitors. Baseline media 2-HG concentrations after 48 hours of incubation ranged from 167 &#x03BC;M (U87-R132H) to 13 &#x03BC;M (THP1-R132H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). mIDH1 inhibitors were found to be active across all cell lines, demonstrating similar IC<sub>50s</sub> for all cell backgrounds. Consistent with biochemical activity, the most potent inhibitors in all six cell lines (representing four different R132 mutations) were AG-120 and Novartis 530, with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the range of 50-220 nM. Interestingly, Agios probe AGI-5198 reproducibly demonstrated potent, selective inhibition in the two R132H cell lines (U87 IC<sub>50</sub> &#x003D; 40 nM and THP-1 IC<sub>50</sub> &#x003D; 50 nM) compared with other cell lines (&#x003E;1 &#x03BC;M, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B-F</xref>, Supplemental Figure 2B-C, and Supplemental Table 1).</p>
<p>Among the 6 cell lines tested, two harbored the R132H mutation and two others possessed the R132C mutation, allowing for a comparison of inhibitor activity against a specific R132 mutation in different cellular backgrounds. A strong correlation was observed between inhibition in THP-1 and U87 cells (R132H, R<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 0.81) and between SNU1079 and HT1080 cells (R132C, R<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 0.93). Hierarchical clustering of cell line sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub>) further supports this strong correlation by mutation type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

<title>Diaphorase-coupled high-throughput assay for measuring 2-HG levels</title>
<p>Quantitative 2-HG measurement relies primarily on mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, which is time-consuming and can be cost-prohibiting. To address this, we optimized a high-throughput method to quantify the effects of small molecule mIDH1 inhibitors on 2-HG production levels in HT1080 mIDH1 R132C fibrosarcoma cells. Previous work has shown that D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH) from <italic>Acidaminococcus fermentans</italic> catalyzes the oxidation of 2-HG to &#x03B1;-KG, as well as the reduction of the cofactor NAD&#x002B; into NADH as a product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). By modifying reaction conditions previously developed for this bacterial enzyme, we developed a system to rapidly enable deproteination of spent cell media, and enzymatically-couple the D2HGDH reaction with diaphorase activity through NADH to provide a fast and inexpensive high-throughput fluorescence assay to quantify 2-HG production in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison of cellular target engagement of mIDH1 inhibitors</title>
<p>A challenging hurdle for small molecule probe/drug development is the determination of cellular target engagement. Cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA) provide a label free biophysical method that facilitates the direct measurement of cellular target engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In order to assess and compare the cellular target engagement of mIDH1 inhibitors, we utilized the engineered U87 (R132H) glioblastoma cell line. An initial cellular thermal melt analysis performed over the temperature range of 37 &#x2013; 73&#x00B0;C found an optimal isothermal melting temperature of 59&#x00B0;C for mIDH1 R132H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>).

Mutant or wild type IDH1 gene expression was induced with doxycycline (0.5 &#x03BC;M) for four days prior to the induction of monocytic differentiation with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (50nM), ultimately resulting in cellular adherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows a schematic representation of the experiment and results). Differentiation was determined by imaging and quantifying the number of cells that adhered to each well in a 96-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-C</xref>). After treatment with PMA, THP1 (R132H) cells were found to have reduced levels of adherent cells compared to THP1 (WT), indicating that high 2-HG levels may block cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Parallel artificial membrane permeability assays (PAMPA) were used to model passive, transcellular permeability across the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).

Hepatic microsomal stability half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) values in three species (mouse, rat and human) were determined using a multiple time-point metabolic stability assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). AG-120 had the highest metabolic stability, while the rest of the mIDH1 inhibitors were classified as low stability compounds with t<sub>1/2</sub> less than 10 min (Supplemental Table 1). Human plasma protein binding revealed a very high (&#x003E;96&#x0025;) protein binding for most mIDH1 inhibitors, while AG-120 and Novartis 556 demonstrated the greatest unbound fractions (&#x223C; 10&#x0025; unbound) (Supplemental Table 1). Caco-2 permeability was measured to gain insight into potential interactions with membrane transporters. While Agios 135 and AGI-5198 had increased efflux ratios suggesting potential interactions with membrane transporters, AG-120 demonstrated the highest efflux ratio at 56 with very low apical to basal transport (Supplemental Table 1).</p>
<p>The apparent basal to apical transport of AG-120 in Caco-2 cells was suggestive of an active drug transporter such as the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1, <italic>ABCB1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). AG-120 is in human clinical trials, where P-glycoprotein at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) might limit drug uptake in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). To investigate this, transwell transport of AG-120 was also assessed in MDCK cells transfected with P-gp. AG-120 demonstrated strong basolateral to apical transport and almost no apical to basolateral transport.

Agios has made the most progress, advancing its mIDH2 inhibitor, AG-221 (Enasidenib), into a phase III open-label clinical trial in 14 countries for late stage AML harboring an IDH2 mutation (NCT02577406). Agios has also advanced its mIDH1 inhibitor, AG-120 (Ivosidenib), into a phase III clinical trial for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (NCT02989857). Additionally, Agios is pursuing a brain-penetrant dual mIDH1/2 inhibitor, AG-881, currently in phase I for advanced solid tumors including gliomas containing an IDH1/2 mutation (NCT02481154). Bayer (BAY1436032), Novartis (IDH305), and Forma Therapeutics (FT-2102) all have mIDH1 inhibitors currently in phase I clinical trials for either solid tumors or refractory AML (NCT02746081, NCT02381886, and NCT02719574). Recently, Bayer disclosed the structure of their clinical mIDH1 inhibitor BAY 1436032, showing favorable oral pharmacokinetic properties, reasonable brain barrier penetration, and a direct interaction with the mutational residue His132 of the mutant IDH1 R132H enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Novartis also recently published an optimized mutant IDH1 inhibitor (IDH889) similar to the chemotype studied here, with favorable oral pharmacokinetic properties and brain barrier penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Several inhibitor classes were not available to us at the time this study was undertaken, including the Bayer (BAY1436032), Forma (FT-2102), and Novartis (IDH305 and IDH889) inhibitors previously mentioned.</p>
<p>This assessment of multiple mIDH inhibitors across many <italic>in vitro</italic> assay platforms characterizes the comparative activities of these mIHD1/2 inhibitors. AG-120 and Novartis 530 rank the highest when observing biochemical potencies, reduction of 2-HG in all six cell lines, and when measuring isothermal dose response using CETSA.</p>
<p>Novartis 530 and 224 show the best activity in reversing 2-HG dependent differentiation of THP1 leukemic cells, while AG-120&#x2019;s activity is much weaker in this assay. AG-120 has the best <italic>in vitro</italic> physicochemical and drug metabolism profile of all the compounds tested, yet it is a substrate for P-gp transporters preventing its passage through the BBB. This study identifies appropriate inhibitors for studying mIDH1/2 enzymes and their role in the pathophysiology of certain diseases. It also provides an opportunity to confirm that the biochemical and cell-based models utilized in previous studies are comparable. This is not necessarily clear from the literature, where individual lines have been used when reporting specific inhibitor activities. ML309 and initial Agios probes were characterized biochemically using mIDH1 R132H and mR132C homodimer protein, and in U87 (R132H) cells and HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). HT1080 cells were one of the first cell lines reported to carry a somatic IDH1 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Even though the prevalence of IDH mutations are very high in gliomas, mIDH1 or mIDH2 low-grade glioma cell lines have been difficult to generate (the TS603 oligodendroglioma harbors an IDH1 R132H mutation and grows as neurospheres rather than monolayer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), leading to the use of a variety of transfected GBM cell lines. AGI-5198 activity was reported against mutant/wild type IDH1 heterodimer protein and the aforementioned TS603 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The GSK321 inhibitor was assessed against three mutant forms of protein (R132H, C and G), and in HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The Sanofi inhibitor was assessed against a range of mIDH1 homo- and hetero-dimer protein, and in HEK293 cells transfected with mIDH1 (R132H)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The mIDH2 inhibitor AGI-6780 was assessed in HEK cells transfected with R140Q IDH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Here, we report the first side-by-side comparison of a diverse set of mIDH1 inhibitors across multiple <italic>in vitro</italic> assay platforms.</p>
<p>Comparative efficacy of multiple chemotypes against an individual target is not commonly undertaken, but given the strong interest in mIDH as an oncotarget and rapid emergence of multiple parallel inhibitor development programs, we were interested in how these chemotypes compared in assays that reported on target activity from biochemical to cellular. A side-by-side comparison of available small molecules against multiple cell lines may appear to be designed to identify the &#x2018;best&#x2019; inhibitor. However, it is important to comprehensively evaluate these compounds to better understand their respective limitations; the availability of multiple mIDH1 and mIDH2 inhibitors will help ensure that observed phenotypes for individual compounds are truly on-target. The majority of inhibitors demonstrated activity in line with published reports, though in our hands the Sanofi inhibitor was not as efficacious. The AG-120 and Novartis 530 were the most active across a majority of assay platforms.</p>
<p>We found that inhibition across multiple IDH1 mutations was generally consistent, and that this translated to cellular inhibition of mIDH1, both in engineered and somatic cell lines. In addition, we miniaturized a D2HGDH florescence-based assay to determine 2-HG concentrations in cell medium. This assay provides an accessible platform for research laboratories to measure 2-HG without the need for quantitative MS. We utilized the assay developed by Jorg Balss and colleagues that coupled the D2HGDH enzyme to resazurin to measure intracellular and extracellular 2-HG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Adnan Elhammali and colleagues subsequently reported an HTS screen using a similar approach in which they showed that Zaprinast reduces 2-HG by perturbing glutamine metabolism, although the HTS assay utilized <italic>E. coli</italic> PHGDH, whose primary substrate is 3-phosphoglycerate limiting its utility as a specific reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). The D2HGDH-coupled assay used here was cost effective, readily scaled down and semi-automated with liquid-handling, providing a high-throughput convenient method to quickly analyze 2-HG containing media samples from cells.</p>
<p>CETSA is a relatively new assay used to interrogate target engagement independent from function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), and we found it to be generally informative of mIDH1 engagement and correlated to cellular inhibition of mIDH1. Given the opportunity to use 2-HG as a biomarker <italic>in vivo</italic> (along with MRI modalities), mIDH1 may provide a strong opportunity to correlate xenograft target engagement using CETSA with target inhibition. The development of 3D tumor spheroids generated from cell lines (reported here) demonstrated that 2-HG production is measureable, and inhibitor efficacy was retained in solid tumor models and correlated with activity in monolayer cells. Interestingly, the greatest divergence from ranked activity was observed in the differentiation assay where AG-120 had reduced efficacy in rescuing the differentiation phenotype. While AG-120 demonstrated superior physicochemical and drug metabolism properties, its susceptibility to transport by P-gp may limit activity in drug-resistant mIDH1 cells, and may restrict brain penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Our panel of assays, some of which are novel and amenable for high-throughput, provide a comprehensive platform for drug discovery campaigns to identify additional mIDH1 inhibitors.</p>
