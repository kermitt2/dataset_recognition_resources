<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Bamenda, Santa and Tiko Health Districts are in the highest malaria transmission strata of Cameroon. The purpose of this study was to explore the indicators of ownership and utilisation as well as maintenance of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in three health districts in Cameroon.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A cross-sectional household survey involving 1,251 households was conducted in the Tiko Health District (THD) in July and June 2017 and in Bamenda and Santa Health Districts in March to May 2018. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on LLIN ownership, utilisation and maintenance as well as demographic characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The average number of LLINs per household was higher in the Bamenda Health District (BHD) compared to the Tiko Health District (THD) (2.5&#x00B1;1.2 vs. 2.4&#x00B1;1.6) as well as the household ownership at least one LLIN (93.30&#x0025; vs. 89.00&#x0025;). The proportion of the <italic>de</italic>-<italic>facto</italic> population with universal utilisation was higher in BHD compared to THD (13.1&#x0025; vs 0.2&#x0025;). In multinomial regression analysis, households in the SHD (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.007, OR; 2.8, 95&#x0025; C.I; 1.3 &#x2013; 5.8), were more likely to own at least one LLIN compared to those in THD.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ownership of LLINs was low in SHD and THD in comparison to the goal of one for every two household members. Overall LLINs coverage and accessibility was still low after the free MDCs, as only 14.6&#x0025; of children 0 &#x2013; 5 years and 16.1&#x0025; of the entire population used LLIN the night before the survey.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria is a preventable and curable disease transmitted by the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and it is a serious global public health problem with an estimated 216 million cases in 91 countries in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Africa is the most affected region, with 90&#x0025; of all estimated malaria cases and 91&#x0025; of deaths in 2016 and 15 African countries alone contributing 80&#x0025; of all cases, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), being the top two contributors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Cameroon, bordered by the Gulf of Guinea and Nigeria to the west; Chad and the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the DRC to the south, through the Ministry of Health (MOH), completed her second national universal long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) campaign in 2016. With support from the Global Fund, the MOH has made provision of free LLINs to pregnant women at antenatal care (ANC) clinics since 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In 2011, the Cameroon MOH undertook a nationwide free LLINs distribution campaign from health facilities to all households, with the objective to provide a LLIN with a lifespan of five years, to all household beds or a LLIN for every two individuals per household, to a maximum of three LLINs per household [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Malaria continues to be endemic in Cameroon, with an estimated mortality rate of 11.6&#x0025;, surpassing that of the African region of 10.4&#x0025; as well as neighbouring countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. It is the first major cause of morbidity and mortality among the most vulnerable groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]: children under five years and pregnant women, accounting respectively for 18&#x0025; and 5&#x0025; of the total population estimated at 19 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The main contemporary malaria control interventions are insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Alliance for Malaria Prevention has been instrumental in keeping long-lasting insecticide net (LLIN) campaigns on track: between 2014 and 2016 about 582 million LLINs were delivered globally and in 2017 where there was the successful delivery of over 68 million nets to targeted recipients in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and beyond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Over 80&#x0025; of all households have at least one mosquito net, up from 57&#x0025; in 2011, still, only about 60&#x0025; of these households have enough nets to cover everyone at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. The proportion of people in SSA sleeping under a LLIN rose from less than 2&#x0025; to over 50&#x0025; between 2000-2015, preventing an estimated 450 million malaria cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Most studies in Cameroon have focused on various aspects of net ownership and utilisation. Effective LLIN use in the prevention of malaria in parts of Mezam Division, North West Region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection in Rural and Semi-Urban Communities in the South West Region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], predictive factors of ownership and utilisation in the Bamenda Health District (BHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] and socio-demographic factors influencing the ownership and utilization among malaria vulnerable groups in the Buea Health District [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. However, there is paucity information on the indicators of LLIN ownership and utilisation. This study examines the indicators of net ownership and utilisation as well as maintenance, through analysis of household survey data collected in three health districts in Cameroon and discuss their implications for programmatic interventions designed to increase LLINs ownership and use.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study area</title>
<p>The study area consisted of the BHD with an estimated 350,000 residents and the Santa Health District (SHD), 35 Km from the BHD with 73,406 residents in the North West Region and the Tiko Health District (THD), 351 Km from the BHD with an estimated 134,649 residents in the South West Region of Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Generally, malaria in Cameroon is caused mainly by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum,</italic> with <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> as the major vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The BHD (a semi-urban community) and the SHD (a rural community) are in the high western plateau altitude malaria geographical strata of Cameroon, where malaria transmission is permanent, occurring all year long, sometimes lessened by altitude though never totally absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. It is one of the most densely populated regions of Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The THD (urban and rural communities) is in the coastal strata, zone of dense hygrophile forest and mangrove swamp with the highest transmission of malaria in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Like the Buea health district, the THD has a constant variation in the trends of malaria prevalence all-round the year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>

<title>Sampling design</title>
<p>This cross-sectional household survey conducted in the THD from June to July 2017 and BHD and SHD from March to May 2018 utilised a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling design. A study sampling frame included all health areas (HAs) in the study area, except those that were inaccessible for security reasons. Within each HA: urban, rural or semi-urban localities were sub-divided into quarters (the primary sampling units or clusters in our study). On average, each HA had about five quarters. Sampled HAs in the THD had about 2,089 (35.58&#x0025;) of the sampled population.</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>First stage</title>
<p>we randomly selected four HAs in the THD and by probability proportionate to size (PPS) and conveniently sampled one each from the BHD and SHD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<title>Second stage</title>
<p>within each selected HA we randomly selected at least three quarters and at most eight quarters also by PPS, thus totalling 31 quarters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in the sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b3">
<title>Third stage</title>
<p>within each selected quarter, the survey team mapped and enumerated all households and selected households in each cluster by systematic random sampling (that is, a random start and interval to cover the entire quarter). The estimated number of households in each quarter was obtained from the quarter leader to determine the sampling interval to select the households.</p>

<title>Characteristics of the study participants</title>
<p>A total of 1,251 household heads was sampled with 5,870 <italic>de</italic>-<italic>facto</italic> residents across six health areas in three health districts. Of the total household residents counted, 1,267 (21.6&#x0025;) were children 0 &#x2013; 5 years old and 93 (1.6&#x0025;) were expectant mothers. There were generally more female (68.0&#x0025;) household heads than males, with mean (&#x00B1;SD) age of participants of 36.1&#x00B1;10.8. The overall mean household (or family) size was 4.7&#x00B1;2.1 members: 4.6&#x00B1;2.1 in BHD and 5.0&#x00B1;2.5 in THD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Majority of the houses, 804 (64.3&#x0025;) were made of cement, while households with 1 - 2 bedrooms; mean number of bedrooms 2.0&#x00B1;1.1 were about 1,141 (91.2&#x0025;). 1,116 (89.2&#x0025;) of the households were located near mosquito breeding sites: farms/ gardens, bushes or pools of water.</p>

<p>Of the 1,251 households sampled, 520 (41.6&#x0025;) and 256 (20.5&#x0025;) were those in which all children 0 &#x2013; 5 years and those in which all who slept home last night used bednets, respectively representing 859 (14.6&#x0025;) and 942 (16.0&#x0025;) of the 5,870 <italic>de facto</italic> population that slept home last night (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Bednet utilisation in households by all children 0 &#x2013; 5 years and the entire family (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>), was associated to age and health district where more households with household heads in the 21 &#x2013; 30 years age group (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.021) and in the BHD (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001) significantly used nets than the other groups. The household utilisation of bednets by all children 0 &#x2013; 5 years old (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>), was also associated to the gender and educational status of the household head where more households with female heads and those with primary and secondary educational status significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05) used the nets last night than the other groups. Bednet utilisation by the entire family (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>) was associated to the composition of the household, where more households with no children &#x003C; 5 and with fewer members (1 &#x2013; 4) significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05) used nets than the other groups.</p>

<p>Of the 1,251 households sampled, 484 (38.7&#x0025;) regularly used bednets on all nights of the week, while 350 (28.0&#x0025;) had their household heads using bednets last night (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The use of bednets on all nights of the week and consequently last night (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>) by the household head was associated to the age of the household head as well as to the health districts, where more household heads in the 21 &#x2013; 30 and 31 &#x2013; 40 age groups, and 20 and 41 &#x2013; 50 age groups significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05) used bednets regularly and last night than the other age groups. Also, more household heads in the SHD and BHD significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05) used bednets on all nights of the week and last night respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). After adjustments of all utilisation indicators with educational and marital status, significance was maintained.</p>

<title>Care and maintenance of LLINs</title>
<p>Out of the 1,251 household heads sampled, 1,089 (87.1&#x0025;) said, LLINs can be washed, while 627 (50.1&#x0025;) affirmed the recommended LLINs washing frequency of 2 &#x2013; 4 times a year. The question of washing bednets or not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">Table 7</xref>), was associated to the gender of the household head, where households with females heads significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.027) washed them compared to those headed by males. The WHO recommended washing frequency was associated to age of the household head and health district, where households with heads in the 31 &#x2013; 40 years age group (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.018) and those in the BHD (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001) abided more significantly to the recommended washing frequency than those in the other age groups and health districts respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the indicators of LLIN ownership, utilization and maintenance in the Bamenda, Santa and Tiko Health Districts. Overall, 92.5&#x0025; and 20.5&#x0025; of households interviewed owned at least one LLIN per household and utilisation by entire household last night respectively.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Indicators of household LLINs ownership</title>
<p>Currently, targets in national strategic plans for all three LLINs coverage indicators are usually set for all people at risk of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], to &#x2265; 80&#x0025;. Household ownership of at least one LLIN per household in this study is higher than rates reported elsewhere in Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and out of Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. It was however, lower than proportions reported in Uganda and Myanmar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] and in line with the 93.5&#x0025; reported in Madagascar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. The high proportion of owning at least a LLIN per household in these health districts could be attributed to the free LLINs mass distribution campaigns (MDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The universal household coverage of 66.8&#x0025; (overall LLIN: Person ratio of 0.50) though within the WHO range of 39 &#x2013; 75 &#x0025; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], was lower than rates reported elsewhere in Cameroon and Myanmar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. It was however, higher compared to rates in Madagascar and Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] as well as a host of eight African countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Access to LLINs in the household of 69.1&#x0025; in this study was lower compared to results reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], higher than 21&#x0025; reported in Batwa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], within the 57.3 &#x2013; 78.8&#x0025; in eight African countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and 32.3 &#x2013; 81.3&#x0025; reported in a multi-country study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. The low household universal coverage and (versus) accessibility in this study, could be attributed to the significant differences amongst the health districts: 86.4&#x0025; vs 83.5&#x0025; for the BHD, 55.6&#x0025; vs 55.6&#x0025; for the SHD and 56.2&#x0025; vs 66.3&#x0025; for the THD; <italic>&#x03C7;<sup>2</sup></italic> (2, N &#x003D; 1,251) &#x003D; 120.457, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001 vs <italic>&#x03C7;<sup>2</sup></italic> (2, N &#x003D; 1,251) &#x003D; 77.969, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001 and differences in family size vs gender of household head.</p>

<title>Household utilisation of LLINs</title>
<p>Household universal LLINs utilisation of 20.5&#x0025; (16.0&#x0025; of the <italic>de facto</italic> population) was very low compared to to previous studies elsewhere in Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and out of Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. This was however high compared to the 6.9 &#x2013; 15.3&#x0025; reported in Myanmar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The very low household LLINs utilisation could be attributed to the significant differences amongst the health districts: 43.1&#x0025; in the BHD, 1.0&#x0025; in the SHD and 14.1&#x0025; in the THD; <italic>&#x03C7;<sup>2</sup></italic> (2, N &#x003D; 1,251) &#x003D; 240.400, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001 as well as household composition and the installation of LLINs on all beds in the household (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05). It could also be due to inadequate education on LLINs utilisation, the socio-political tensions and differences in the different study designs.</p>
<p>Bednet utilisation by all children 0 &#x2013; 5 years and expectant mothers in the household of 14.6&#x0025; and 63.4&#x0025; respectively, is low compared to 63&#x0025; vs 60&#x0025; reported in the BHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], 52&#x0025; vs 58&#x0025; in the national territory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] and elsewhere in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. The low LLIN utilisation by all children 0 &#x2013; 5 years old could be attributed to significant differences in the health districts, age and gender of household heads, educational status of household head as well as the presence or absence of bushes or water pools around dwellings (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05).</p>
<p>Use of LLINs by household head last night of 28.0&#x0025; was low compared to 58.3&#x0025; reported in Rural and Semi-Urban communities in the South West Region of Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] and 47.2&#x0025; in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Meanwhile the regular use of LLINs of 38.7&#x0025; was low compared to 48.0&#x0025; reported in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. The low use of LLINs last night by household head and regular use of LLINs, could significantly be attributed to differences in the health districts and ages of the household heads (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05).</p>
<p>LLIN misuse of 2.3 &#x2013; 22.7&#x0025; was also similar to the 18.2&#x0025; reported in Mezam Division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and 21&#x0025; in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The use of LLINs for other purposes, other than the prevention of mosquito bites could be attributed to: inadequate education on utilisation, lack of good playgrounds, as 2.8&#x0025; (95&#x0025; C.I, 2.0 &#x2013; 3.9) of the households admitted that children used as football goal post nets.</p>

<title>Care and maintenance of LLINs</title>
<p>Out of the 1,251 household heads sampled, 1,089 (87.1&#x0025;) said, LLINs can be washed, while 627 (50.1&#x0025;) affirmed the recommended LLIN washing frequency of 2 &#x2013; 4 times a year. The recommended LLIN wash frequency reported in this study was similar to the 52.0&#x0025; reported in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The optimal LLIN washing frequency could be attributed to the age of the household head as well as the health district.</p>

<sec id="s5">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>The populations of the three health districts should be properly educated by community health workers and stakeholders on the regular utilisation of LLINs and by all household occupants.</p>
<p>The MOH should sustain another free MDC since those distributed in 2015 &#x2013; 2016 will be worn out and ineffective in preventing malaria by 2019.</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations of the Study</title>
<sec id="s6a">
<title>Strengths</title>
<p>The data used in this study was collected by trained surveyors, who had mastery of all the HAs as they are responsible for the coding of houses during the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and MDC campaigns. All the health district offices were consulted for the mapping of the HAs, quarters and census list of households used in the last MDC and EPI campaigns. In Cameroon, the MOH carries out seasonal EPI campaigns. The quality of data collected was assured through the multistage sampling strategy to minimize bias and pretesting of questionnaires.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6b">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This was a cross sectional study, representing the snapshot of the population within the study period and does not show cause and effect since the predictor and outcome variable were measured at the same time. Data was collected through self-reporting and thus there is a possibility of bias where the respondent provides socially acceptable answers. Recall bias can also affect some of the responses and subsequently the results of the study. In this study however, respondents were required to only recall whether they and occupants of their households slept under a LLIN the previous night, as well as the source and number of LLINs in the household.</p>
<p>Ownership and number of LLINs in the household was not evaluated. Ownership, utilisation and maintenance of LLINs in the three health districts in 2017 and 2018 could not be attributed solely to the 2015 &#x2013; 2016 MDC, as other sources of LLINs: ANC for pregnant women and free gift from a relation, and our study design could not capture the contribution of each intervention.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="s7">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our findings highlighted low rates of household universal coverage, accessibility and utilisation indicators as well as maintenance amidst high ownership of at least one LLIN per household and the free MDC. However, efforts had reached vulnerable populations in all health districts. Quelling the on-going socio-political crisis and scaling up efforts can lead to increased coverage which may systematically contribute to household universal utilisation and thus reduce malaria morbidity and mortality. Our finding that health districts are strongly associated with LLINs ownership, utilisation and maintenance suggests that MDCs should be complemented by education and behaviour change communication emphasizing that malaria is transmitted by mosquito bites and it can be prevented by sleeping under LLINs.</p>
