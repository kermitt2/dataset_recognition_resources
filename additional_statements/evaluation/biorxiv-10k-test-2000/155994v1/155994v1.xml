<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>Differentiation induces reorganization of microtubules (MTs) into non-centrosomal arrays in a variety of tissues. The physiological functions of these microtubule arrays are just beginning to be understood as few tools currently exist to genetically perturb microtubule organization <italic>in vivo</italic>, particularly in mammals. We developed a genetic toolkit that can be broadly applied to the study of microtubule dynamics and function in many cell types. Using a TRE-EB1-GFP mouse we demonstrate that distinct differentiation transitions in the epidermis cause a decrease in microtubule growth rates and microtubule growth lifetimes, resulting in strong suppression of dynamics. To understand the physiological functions of these stable, non-centrosomal microtubules, we generated a TRE-spastin mouse, which can be used to perturb microtubule organization in a wide-variety of tissues <italic>in vivo.</italic> Unexpectedly, microtubule perturbation exclusively in post-mitotic keratinocytes had profound consequences on epidermal morphogenesis. We uncoupled novel cell-autonomous roles for MTs in differentiation-driven cell flattening from non-cell autonomous functions in regulating proliferation, differentiation, and tissue architecture. Taken together, we have created tools that will be broadly useful for the study of microtubule dynamics and function in mammalian tissue physiology and have used them to uncover previously unknown functions for non-centrosomal microtubules during mammalian epidermal development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many studies conducted over the last several decades have provided significant insight into microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and their effects on microtubule dynamics and organization in cultured cells. The functions for microtubules in intact tissues, as well as their organization and dynamics, are comparatively less well-understood. There are multiple reasons for this: a) many cell types will not fully differentiate when cultured outside of the organism, b) non-specific effects resulting from using drug-induced microtubule disassembly assays, including secondary effects due to mitotic arrest and apoptosis, c) lack of information about which microtubule regulators are essential for microtubule organization in many differentiated cell types, and d) lack of genetic tools for specific perturbation of microtubules in differentiated cell types. While differentiation induces loss of centrosomal microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) activity in many cells, there are only a few examples where both the changes in microtubule organization and dynamics and the functions of the resulting networks have been assayed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Lacroix et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Le Droguen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Oddoux et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The mammalian epidermis develops from a single layer of proliferative basal cells that adheres to an underlying basement membrane. As stratification proceeds, cells transit outward and progressively differentiate, first into spinous cells, then into granular cells, and finally into corneocytes, which are required for epidermal barrier activity. While microtubules are organized in a centrosomal array in basal cells, differentiation results in loss of centrosomal MTOC activity, and MTs eventually organize into cortical arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Muroyama et al., 2016</xref>). The functions for MTs in the differentiated cells remain unknown, although they have been implicated in formation and function of cell-cell adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Nekrasova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Simard-Bisson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Sumigray et al., 2012a</xref>). Here we characterize both the dynamics and the functions of epidermal microtubules using novel transgenic mouse lines that reveal differentiationinduced alterations in MT dynamics as well as unexpected functional roles for noncentrosomal MT arrays in these cells.</p>

<title>Visualizing microtubule dynamics during differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> with the TRE-EB1 mouse</title>
<p>To visualize and quantify microtubule dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a transgenic mouse containing a cassette encoding a GFP-tagged copy of the microtubule plus-tip tracking protein EB1 under the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). With this line, EB1-GFP expression can be temporally controlled through doxycycline exposure and spatially controlled via cell- or tissue-specific tTA/rtTA lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Urlinger et al., 2000</xref>) or tissue-specific Cre lines paired with the Rosa-rtTA line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Hochedlinger et al., 2005</xref>). After screening founders by assaying EB1-GFP induction in primary keratinocytes, we chose a line with mosaic expression (hereafter referred to as TRE-EB1) to allow precise resolution of single cells in a complex tissue field.

<p>We generated CMV-rtTA; TRE-EB1 embryos to visualize microtubule dynamics in keratinocytes during progressive differentiation transitions with sub-cellular resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, we did not observe any cell morphology or tissue architecture phenotypes associated with EB1-GFP expression using this system. Microtubules in basal keratinocytes grew from the cell center to the periphery in a roughly radial orientation, in agreement with previous data that the centrosome is the primary MTOC in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Movie S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>). In spinous cells, clear radial organization was lost, and microtubules were observed growing in all directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Movie S2). Despite the reorientation of microtubule growth in spinous cells, EB1 density was unaffected by this initial differentiation transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similar to spinous cells, microtubules in granular cells grow throughout the cyoplasm in all directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and Movie S3). However, the density of EB1-GFP puncta was higher in granular cells, and projections over time revealed that microtubules in these cells exhibited greatly reduced dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Treatment of embryos with nocodazole eliminated the GFP puncta, strongly suggesting that these EB1-GFP comets mark plus-ends of very slowly growing and/or paused microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Quantification of microtubule growth distances revealed a gradual decrease in motility over keratinocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>). Surprisingly, this gradual decrease in microtubule growth distance was due to two changes in microtubule behavior that occurred at distinct differentiation transitions. At the basal to spinous cell transition, microtubule growth speed was relatively unaffected, although there was a minor increase in growth speed in spinous cells (basal mean growth speed 11.1&#x00B1;3.1&#x03BC;m/min versus spinous mean growth speed 12.2&#x00B1;3.3&#x03BC;m/min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>). These growth rates were similar to those observed <italic>in vivo</italic> in cells of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying apparatus and in mouse muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Lacroix et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Oddoux et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, microtubule growth speeds were strongly suppressed as spinous cells differentiated into granular cells (granular mean growth speed 7.1&#x00B1;3.7&#x03BC;m/min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, examination of the persistence of a single EB1-GFP puncta revealed that growth duration was significantly shorter in spinous versus basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The growth duration was unchanged between spinous and granular cells. The short growth periods likely reflect pause and/or catastrophe events that cannot be discriminated because EB1-GFP marks only growing microtubules. While there was no correlation between the growth speed and duration (R<sup>2</sup>=0.002-0.19) or the growth speed and duration (R<sup>2</sup>=0.004-0.2), there was a clear correlation between the length of time an EB1-GFP puncta moved and how far it traveled in basal (R<sup>2</sup>=0.87) and spinous cells (R<sup>2</sup>=0.85), as would be expected for microtubules polymerizing at a constant speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, this correlation is greatly reduced in granular cells (R<sup>2</sup>=0.23), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the importance of quantifying microtubule dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared the microtubule dynamics we observed during differentiation in intact embryos to dynamics in cultured primary keratinocytes. Primary keratinocytes begin to stratify when cultured, forming a proliferative basal layer and a single, post-mitotic, &#x201C;suprabasal&#x201D; layer, which recapitulates some of the features of spinous cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Muroyama et al., 2016</xref>). Absolute polymerization rates were dramatically increased in isolated cells, suggesting that microtubule dynamics are altered as primary cells initiate a wound-healing response in culture, as has been noted for cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Foote et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, although the absolute polymerization rate was greatly increased, the overall trends across all three measured parameters consistently mirrored the trends seen at the basal to spinous transition <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-G</xref>). These data highlight that while there is some utility in assessing microtubule dynamics in cultured cells, they do not fully recapitulate the physiological setting.</p>
<p>Taken together, we have established the TRE-EB1-GFP mouse line as a tool to visualize and quantify microtubule behavior in single cells <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice. We used this line to make qualitative observations about microtubule organization during differentiation that confirmed that microtubules reorganize into non-centrosomal arrays as basal cells differentiate. Interestingly, by following microtubule dynamics over distinct differentiation transitions, we demonstrate that pause/catastrophe events are initially increased as basal cells differentiate into spinous cells. As spinous cells mature into granular cells, microtubule polymerization rates are strongly suppressed and the occurrence of very slow growing microtubules increases significantly. To determine the functions of these distinct populations of microtubules, we next created a transgenic tool to disrupt their organization.</p>

<title>Development of TRE-spastin to genetically perturb MTs <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Because loss-of-function approaches that specifically target differentiated cells are not always feasible in tissues that rapidly turn over, we pursued a gain-of-function strategy to disrupt microtubule organization via spastin overexpression (OE). Spastin is a single-subunit microtubule severing protein whose overexpression is sufficient to dramatically perturb microtubule organization in numerous cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Le Droguen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Quintin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Sherwood et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we placed the highly active M85 spastin isoform with an N-terminal HA tag under the TRE promoter, hereafter referred to as TRE-spastin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Solowska et al., 2008</xref>).

<graphic xlink:href="155994_fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>We validated the utility of this method in keratinocytes transfected with K14-rtTA and TRE-spastin plasmids. Spastin expression was only detected upon doxycycline administration, demonstrating that TRE-spastin can be temporally controlled in cultured cells. Importantly, all cells containing detectable spastin expression showed almost complete loss of microtubules, demonstrating that even low-levels of spastin OE are sufficient to severely compromise microtubule organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we generated TRE-spastin transgenic mice to genetically perturb MT organization <italic>in vivo</italic>. To validate that spastin OE can 1) be temporally controlled and 2) disrupt microtubules in tissue, we globally induced spastin OE by administering doxycycline to CMV-rtTA; TRE-spastin mice. We detected robust spastin OE in CMV-rtTA; TRE-spastin mice within 24 hours of doxycycline administration, and we did not detect HA expression in doxycycline-treated TRE-spastin mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). CMV-rtTA; TRE-spastin mice rapidly lost weight and had macroscopic alterations to some organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and data not shown). Importantly, spastin OE greatly reduced &#x03B1;-tubulin signal in all tissues assayed; often only small fragments of MTs remained following spastin induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). In addition to cytoplasmic microtubules, spastin OE also dramatically shortened cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Therefore, the TRE-spastin mouse can be used to genetically perturb microtubule organization <italic>in vivo</italic> to assess the functional roles for microtubules in numerous tissues.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Microtubule disruption in proliferative cells of the mammalian epidermis</title>
<p>Next, we used the TRE-spastin mouse to understand how microtubules in distinct cell populations influence epidermal development. We generated K14-rtTA; TRE-spastin mice and induced spastin OE in proliferative basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Between 20-40&#x0025; of basal cells overexpressed spastin using this strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Spastin OE perturbed microtubule organization in basal cells and, as expected, induced a dramatic increase in mitotically arrested cells in mutant tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-E</xref>). Only spastin&#x002B; cells in mutant tissue had uniformly unaligned, condensed chromosomes, demonstrating that spastin OE in basal keratinocytes caused a mitotic arrest in a cell-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Consequently, we observed increased apoptosis, presumably due to mitotic catastrophe, and a tissue-wide hyper-proliferative response to maintain progenitor number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). At this level of induction, the tissue remained architecturally normal with no detectable barrier defects, demonstrating that the epidermis is highly robust to perturbations in basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>Interestingly, we noted spastin&#x002B; cells in the upper layers of the epidermis after several days of induction in the K14-rtTA; TRE-spastin line. These suprabasal spastin&#x002B; cells expressed keratin 5/14, which are normally exclusively expressed in basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). As we have not detected any mis-expression of the K14-rtTA transgene, this result suggests that spastin&#x002B; cells delaminated from the basement membrane. Indeed, we identified many mitotically arrested cells that appeared to be in the process of delaminating, suggesting that spastin&#x002B; cells in the suprabasal layers were generated, at least partially, through delamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus, the epidermis eliminates mitotically arrested cells from the proliferative niche either through apoptosis or delamination. Areas with numerous suprabasal spastin&#x002B; cells displayed local thickening, suggesting that disruption of microtubules in suprabasal keratinocytes may more severely disrupt epidermal architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Therefore, we next sought to specifically perturb microtubule organization in post-mitotic suprabasal cells, where their functions are unknown.</p>

<title>Generation of K10-rtTA to specifically induce expression in suprabasal keratinocytes <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Few tools currently exist to control transgene expression specifically in the suprabasal layers of the mammalian epidermis. Therefore, we generated a BAC transgenic in which rtTA is expressed from a large region of the keratin 10 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Using TRE-H2B-GFP mice, we validated that K10-rtTA faithfully recapitulates endogenous K10 expression in both embryos and adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). K10-rtTA induction was observed in e14.5 epidermis, as stratification commences, and was robustly and uniformly induced by e15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Tumbar et al., 2004</xref>). Robust expression was observed in all K10-expressing tissues assayed, with the exception of the embryonic dorsal tongue, which only exhibited minimal induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Importantly, H2B-GFP expression was only detected in cells that endogenously express K10, demonstrating that our K10-rtTA line is a powerful tool to reliably control expression exclusively in post-mitotic suprabasal cells, thereby bypassing any potential mitotic abnormalities that may result from perturbation utilizing the widely adopted K14-rtTA and K5/14-CRE systems.

<title>Disruption of MTs in differentiated cells induces epidermal hyperproliferation and profound architecture defects</title>

<p>We found that the increased thickness of the mutant epidermis was associated with an increase in the number of cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This increase in cell number was due to a specific hyperproliferation of basal progenitor cells, as no proliferation was noted in the suprabasal cell compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These data demonstrate a non-cell autonomous response of the progenitor cells to microtubule loss in their differentiated progeny. Hyperproliferation was not caused by elevated apoptosis, as apoptosis was not significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 5-figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Stratification occurred normally, as K5/14&#x002B; basal cells remained in a single layer above the basement membrane, but there was a dramatic thickening of the K10&#x002B; layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 5-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that spastin OE in differentiated keratinocytes causes dramatic hyperproliferation within the basal layer, leading to a severe thickening of all of the differentiated layers of the tissue. While barrier defects are known to induce compensatory proliferation of basal cells, we show below that the effects seen here are independent of barrier loss.</p>

<title>Microtubules are required for differentiation-induced cell-shape changes</title>
<p>While hyperproliferation contributes to the epidermal thickening in mutant tissue, closer examination revealed that thickening was additionally driven by changes to cell shape. As keratinocytes transition from spinous to granular cells, they adopt a flattened shape that, when viewed in cross-section, is highly anisotropic (spinous mean aspect ratio (AR)=1.84; granular mean AR=4.56). Currently, little is known about how this cell-shape change is controlled. Strikingly, differentiating spastin-positive cells were incapable of properly flattening (spinous AR=1.69 versus granular AR=2.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). Cell-shape defects were cell-autonomous, as wild-type cells in K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin epidermis were still able to flatten, although were sometimes distorted by their spastin-positive neighbors. These cell-shape changes were not due to gross loss of adherens junctions, as we noted no obvious disruptions to cortical E-cadherin localization in mutant tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>). This is consistent with E-cadherin loss-of-function mutants, which are still able to undergo squamous morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Tinkle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, granular cell markers were still induced in the proper layers, indicating that inability to flatten is not due to a general block in differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 5-figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data reveal an unexpected role for microtubules in differentiation-induced cell flattening in the epidermis. Interestingly, these phenotypes were not observed upon deletion of type II myosins or core actin regulators such as the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sumigray et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that changes in granular cell morphology are not driven by alterations in acto-myosin contractility and demonstrating a role for MTs in this process.</p>
<p>To address whether MTs are required for initial flattening and/or maintenance of flattening, we first performed short-term treatment of K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin embryos (e18.5-P0) and measured the aspect ratio of granular cells, reasoning that many of the granular cells we observed in these back skins were flattened prior to spastin OE. Indeed, many flattened spastin&#x002B; granular cells were observed in the upper granular layers in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Additionally, we treated isolated granular cells with nocodazole and noted no change in cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Therefore, microtubules are required for the cell flattening at the spinous to granular transition but are dispensable for maintaining the established flattened shape.</p>
<p>While adherens junctions appeared normal in the mutant epidermis, we were also interested in whether desmosomes, which are known upstream regulators of microtubule organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Sumigray et al., 2011</xref>), were perturbed and could underlie the cell-shape defects observed in K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin suprabasal cells. While some data in cultured cells suggests MTs are required for desmosome assembly, other studies have found little to no effect of MT disruption on desmosome formation in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Nekrasova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Pasdar et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Simard-Bisson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Sumigray et al., 2011</xref>). We found a significant loss of cortical desmosomal protein staining (including Dsg1, desmoplakin, and Dsc2/3) in the spastin OE epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Ultrastructural analysis confirmed that desmosomes were smaller in K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin epidermis compared to control tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Surprisingly, however, loss of cortical desmosomal components was non-cell autonomous; line-scan analysis confirmed that cortical localization of desmoplakin and Dsc2/3 was similarly disrupted between two spastin-positive, one spastin and one control, and two control cells in K10-rtTA; TREspastin epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>).

<p>To determine whether microtubule disruption could intrinsically influence desmosome assembly, we examined pairs of spastin-positive cells surrounded by wild-type neighbors. Desmoplakin localization was normal between these single spastin OE pairs, arguing that microtubule disruption does not autonomously alter desmosome assembly in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Instead, the observed desmosome defects are not a primary effect of microtubule disruption, but rather are a tissue-wide response to it. Examination of spastin-positive cell pairs also clearly demonstrated that the cell-shape changes are not secondary to desmosome dysfunction, as these spastin OE cells with normal cortical desmoplakin levels also fail to flatten (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Finally, because basal cell hyperproliferation is not seen in desmoplakin-mutant skin, the progenitor hyperproliferation we observe in K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin epidermis is not likely to be secondary to desmosome disruption.</p>
<p>Strikingly, microtubule disruption resulted in a remarkable number of entosis-like structures in both the spinous and granular layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K,L</xref>). Canonical entosis is an active invasion of one cell into the cytoplasm of another as it loses substrate attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>). We observed invading cells with elevated pMLC-2, consistent with an active actin-based entotic invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). Additionally, we observed F-actin based protrusions that appeared to be invading into neighboring cells, potentially reflecting the initial stages of entosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>). Entotic events ranged from entosis of a single spastin&#x002B; cell to what appeared to be concentric rings of cells, suggesting multiple layers of entosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>). We did not observe any examples of a wild-type cell within a spastin&#x002B; cell. Taken together, our data demonstrate that microtubules prevent entosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. We propose that, without microtubules, differentiated keratinocytes cannot flatten and consequently invade one another, potentially due to imbalances in membrane tension. This phenotype was not noted in desmoplakin-null epidermis, again suggesting that this is not secondary phenotype associated with adhesion defects.</p>
<p>The phenotypes described above &#x2013; thickening of the epidermis and cell-shape defects &#x2013; were also found upon disruption of microtubules in the adult epidermis, demonstrating that these phenotypes are not specific to embryonic development. Rather, microtubules are similarly essential for the homeostasis of the epidermis throughout life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5-figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Non-centrosomal microtubules are required for proper corneocyte formation but are dispensable for barrier function</title>
<p>Next, we wanted to assess whether the profound disruptions to epidermal architecture upon microtubule loss resulted in impaired barrier function. Epidermal barrier function is conferred through both tight junctions, which form in the granular layer, and the cornified envelopes, which are composed of enucleated, highly cross-linked corneocytes. Immunostaining for the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin did not reveal any defects in spastin-positive cells or K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin tissue, demonstrating that microtubules are not required for localization of tight junction proteins in the mammalian epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Additionally, tight junctions halted biotin diffusion in mutant tissue, demonstrating that tight junction function is not observably impaired upon microtubule disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 7-figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>We noted that microtubule perturbation in K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin embryos caused formation of an abnormally thick cornified envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). By TEM, the thickened mutant CE was electron dense and many cytoplasmic remnants were observed, demonstrating a defect in corneocyte formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We confirmed that a subset of cytoplasmic proteins was retained in corneocytes in mutant back skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Retention of cytoplasmic components appeared to be cell autonomous, as we observed clear co-localization of the irregular staining with spastin&#x002B; corneocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Isolation of the cornified envelopes confirmed that spastin OE caused severe defects in corneocyte morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>).

<p>Because of the numerous cornified envelope defects, we performed a barrier assay to test epidermal exclusion of X-gal. Surprisingly, despite the numerous morphological defects in corneocytes, K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin embryos formed a fully functional barrier by e18.5, consistent with the fact that these mice survive postnatally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). We speculate that the thickening of the stratum corneum compensates for abnormal corneocyte formation. That said, our data reveal a previously unrecognized role for microtubules in the proper formation of the cornified envelope, which could either be a direct effect on corneocyte assembly or secondary to cell shape defects in granular cells.</p>

<title>Microtubule disruption causes premature epidermal differentiation and barrier formation</title>
<p>Having identified cell-autonomous and non-autonomous functions for microtubules late in embryonic development, we turned to understand how microtubules influence the earlier stages of epidermal differentiation. We analyzed K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin embryos where spastin induction began at e14.5 as stratification commences. Surprisingly, the epidermis in mutant embryos was severely thickened even by e16.5, demonstrating that basal cell hyperproliferation is a rapid response to suprabasal microtubule disruption, even before the barrier normally forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Concurrent with thickening, mutant epidermis exhibited signs of premature differentiation, including robust expression of the granular marker filaggrin, ZO-1, and the presence of cornified envelopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> and data not shown). Premature differentiation was not confined to spastin&#x002B; cells; wild-type cells in K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin also expressed filaggrin in the upper layers of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). We performed the X-gal exclusion assay on e16.5 embryos to determine if premature differentiation in K10-rtTA; TRE-embryos resulted in premature barrier formation. Interestingly, while control embryos had no barrier function at this stage, the back skin of K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin embryos had already formed a functional barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Therefore, microtubule disruption in suprabasal cells during early epidermal stratification unexpectedly induces premature differentiation and barrier formation, potentially through dramatic tissue thickening.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We generated a TRE-EB1-GFP mouse line, which permits <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of microtubule dynamics in various cell types. Using this mouse, we performed live imaging of EB1-GFP in the developing epidermis of intact mouse embryos and demonstrate that microtubule growth is suppressed as keratinocytes differentiate. To our knowledge, only one other quantification of MT dynamics over differentiation in an intact tissue&#x2014;the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg laying apparatus&#x2014;has been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Lacroix et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, specific growth parameters were tuned at distinct transitions during keratinocyte differentiation. As basal cells differentiate into spinous cells, pause/catastrophe frequency was increased, as inferred by a decrease in EB1-GFP persistence. As spinous cells matured, polymerization rates were strongly suppressed. These data raise the intriguing possibility that specific subsets of MAPs that underlie these dynamic differences may be expressed at distinct stages of keratinocyte differentiation. Mining of published transcriptional databases reveals that epidermal differentiation induces extensive alterations to the expression of microtubule-related proteins, including tubulin isoforms (&#x03B1;,&#x03B2;,&#x03B3;), MAPs, and microtubule-modifying enzymes. A clear area of future work will be to determine which MAPs are responsible for the observed changes in microtubule growth parameters, with a special focus on determining how specifically tuned microtubule dynamics influence epidermal development. Furthermore, we anticipate that the TRE-EB1 mouse will be useful for performing similar measurements <italic>in vivo</italic> across differentiation lineages in other tissues.</p>
<p>We developed the TRE-spastin mouse to understand the functions for microtubules in diverse and distinct cell populations <italic>in vivo</italic>. This provides both the first experimental examination of microtubule function in intact epidermis and provides a microtubule &#x201C;null&#x201D; phenotype that is essential for future comparisons to perturbations that affect microtubule organization and/or dynamics. The dramatic consequences of microtubule disruption in the epidermis suggest that more subtle changes to dynamics/organization may have phenotypic consequences. Ablation of microtubules in different epidermal compartments revealed distinct requirements for microtubules in epidermal morphogenesis. We found that the epidermis eliminates mitotically arrested cells through both apoptosis and delamination but is quite robust in responding to microtubule defects in a substantial number of cells. The elimination of basal cells by delamination/differentiation allows the epidermis to make use of these defective progenitors.</p>
<p>By overexpressing spastin in suprabasal keratinocytes using a novel K10-rtTA mouse, we demonstrate that stable non-centrosomal microtubules regulate overall tissue architecture. While there are pleiotropic phenotypes downstream of microtubule loss in differentiated keratinocytes, defects in cell-shape appear to be one clear cell-autonomous consequence of microtubule disruption. In the absence of MTs, epidermal cells do not undergo squamous morphogenesis, the mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. Differentiation-induced flattening occurs in the absence of E-cadherin, type II myosins and the Arp2/3 complex, which clearly impact cell shape in numerous other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Sumigray et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Tinkle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). How could microtubules promote cell flattening? One possibility is that microtubules influence cell shape indirectly through other cell adhesions, such as desmosomes. However, our data strongly argue that the flattening defects we observe are independent of desmosomes, as single spastin-positive cells with normal cortical desmoplakin fail to flatten. An intriguing possibility is that kinesin-dependent microtubule sliding provides a force to drive cell-shape changes, similar to what has been reported in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Winding et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, our data also indicate that, while microtubules are required for initiating flattening, they are dispensable for maintaining the flattened granular shape, which could be controlled by other cytoskeletal elements like keratins.</p>
<p>One of the clear strengths of the TRE-spastin mouse is the ability to distinguish between cell-autonomous and tissue-wide effects of microtubule disruption. Spastin OE in suprabasal keratinocytes uncovered numerous unexpected non-cell autonomous defects associated with loss of microtubules in differentiated cells. These included desmosome perturbation, basal hyperproliferation, cornified envelope defects, and premature differentiation. The mechanisms underlying these effects are a clear area for future study. Particularly, it remains important to identify how cells sense microtubule loss, whether the signal is mechanical in nature or more directly involves sensing tubulin/microtubule levels or organization. The work presented here highlights the value of examining phenotypes associated with microtubule disruption <italic>in vivo</italic>, and these tools should be of broad utility to the study of microtubules during mammalian development and homeostasis.</p>

<title>Mice and tissues</title>
<p>All mice were maintained in accordance with Duke IACUC-approved protocols. To generate the TRE-EB1-GFP transgenic mouse line, EB1-GFP was digested out of K14-EB1-GFP with SacII and NotI and ligated into pTre2 cut with the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Muroyama et al., 2016</xref>). The XhoI site next to the SapI site in pTre2 was mutated using site-directed mutagenesis (pTre XhoI mut). Proper doxycycline-dependent expression of the TRE-EB1-GFP vector was verified in cultured keratinocytes co-transfected with a K14-rtTA plasmid and placed in doxycycline-containing media for 16 hours. TRE-EB1-GFP was linearized using XhoI and was used by the Duke Transgenic Core to generate transgenics via pronuclear injection.</p>
<p>To generate the TRE-spastin mouse line, the spastin M85 sequence was obtained from the pEGFP-C1 spastin M85 plasmid (kind gift of Dr. Peter Baas). First, the XhoI site within spastin M85 was mutated using site-directed mutagenesis (CTCGAG to CTAGAG) to generate a synonymous arginine mutation (amino acid 345) (CGA to AGA). An HA tag (TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCT) was inserted at the N-terminus of the spastin M85 followed by a 4x glycine linker separating the HA tag and the start codon of spastin using PCR primers. SacII and BamHI sites were inserted on the 5&#x2019; and 3&#x2019; ends of the HA-spastin cassette, respectively. HA-spastin was PCR amplified, digested with SacII and BamHI, and inserted into pTre2 XhoI mut cut with the same. Doxycycline-dependent expression of the HA-spastin cassette was verified in cultured keratinocytes co-transfected with a K14-rtTA plasmid. The vector was linearized using XhoI and was used by the Duke Transgenic Core to generate transgenics via pronuclear injection.</p>
<p>To generate the K10-rtTA transgenic mouse line, the rtTA sequence was cloned behind the mouse keratin 10 promoter (BAC RP23-1D9) by the Duke Recombineering Core. Linearized DNA was used by the Duke Transgenic Core to generate transgenics via pronuclear injection.</p>

<title>Image acquisition</title>
<p>Images of the K14-rtTA; TRE-spastin keratinocytes and mice were acquired on a Zeiss Axio Imager microscope with Apotome attachment with the following objective lenses: 20x Plan-Apo 0.8 NA lens, 40x Plan-Neofluar 1.3 NA oil lens, and 63x Plan-Apo 1.4 NA oil lens. Images were acquired using AxioVision software. All images of the K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin mice were acquired on a Zeiss Axio Imager microscope with Apotome 2 attachment and Axiocam 506 mono camera with the same objectives. When making intensity measurement comparisons, all images within one experiment were taken with identical exposure times.</p>
<p>Movies of EB1-GFP in CMV-rtTA; TRE-EB1 embryos were acquired on an Andor XD revolution spinning disc confocal microscope at 37&#x00B0;C and 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> using a 60x Plan-Apo 1.2 NA water objective. Briefly, embryos (e11.5 (for basal), e15.5 (for spinous), or e17.5 (for granular)) were dissected and placed onto glass-bottom dishes (MatTek) in E media for imaging. EB1-GFP movies were acquired with at 1 frame per second. Embryos were used for a maximum of one hour after isolation. Images on the spinning disc microscope were acquired using MetaMorph software. For imaging EB1-GFP in isolated, primary keratinocytes, epidermis was isolated from P0 back skin by overnight incubation in dispase (1U/ml). Keratinocytes were isolated by incubation in 1:1 0.25&#x0025; trypsin-EDTA:versene and plated onto glass-bottom dishes in E no Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> media supplemented with 0.5mM Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> for 48 hours before imaging. Images of EB1-GFP in isolated, primary keratinocytes were acquired on a Leica DMI6000 microscope at 37&#x00B0;C and 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> using a 63x Plan-Apo 1.4-0.6 NA oil objective. These images were acquired using SimplePCI software. For DMSO and nocodazole experiments, embryos were first screened for EB1-GFP expression on the Leica DMI6000 microscope and then placed into E media with 10mg/ml nocodazole or DMSO for 30 minutes at 37&#x00B0;C and then imaged on the spinning disc microscope.</p>

<title>Image quantification</title>
<p>All image quantification was done using FIJI software. EB1-GFP comets were tracked manually by marking the starting and ending positions of an EB1 comet and noting the number of frames during which the comet was visible. All EB1 tracks were considered to be straight lines, and any that deviated sharply or curved were excluded from the analysis. For quantifying EB1 comet density, the number of EB1 comets was counted and the cell cytoplasm was manually outlined to calculate the cellular area. For quantification of &#x03B1;-tubulin intensity in K14-rtTA; TRE-spastin keratinocytes, each cell was outlined and the average HA and &#x03B1;-tubulin intensities were obtained for each cell. The mean intensities for each cell were then normalized to the maximum value in the picture (HA from spastin&#x002B; cells and &#x03B1;-tubulin from control cells). Aspect ratios for the differentiation-induced cell shape changes were calculated by tracing individual cells and using the measurement option in FIJI. Line-scan analysis of desmoplakin and desmocollin2/3 was performed by manually drawing 5 pixel-wide lines across cell-cell boundaries and calculating the mean fluorescence intensities at each point along the lines. Maxima were aligned and the ends were trimmed to yield the final line scan. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software.</p>
