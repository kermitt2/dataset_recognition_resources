<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> parasites rapidly exit their host cell when exposed to calcium ionophores. The calcium-dependent protein kinase 3 (<italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3) was previously identified as a key mediator in this process, as <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 knockout (&#x0394;<italic>cdpk3</italic>) parasites fail to egress in a timely manner. Phosphoproteomic analysis comparing WT with &#x0394;<italic>cdpk3</italic> parasites revealed changes in the <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3-dependent phosphoproteome that included proteins important for regulating motility, but also metabolic enzymes, indicating that <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 controls processes beyond egress. Here we have investigated a predicted direct target of <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3, a putative transporter of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and show that it is rapidly phosphorylated after induction of calcium signalling. Conditional knockout (KO) of the transporter reveals an essential role in the lytic cycle during intracellular growth with a transcriptome signature of amino acid-starved parasites. Using a combination of metabolomics and heterologous expression, we confirmed a primary role in tyrosine import. Complementation with phosphorylation site mutants shows that phosphorylation of serine 56 (S56) by <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 gives the parasites a growth benefit in competition assays. Collectively, these findings validate an important, albeit non-essential role for <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 in the regulation of metabolic processes, in addition to motility.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an obligate intracellular parasite. To survive and spread throughout the host it must repeatedly infect, replicate within and exit, host cells. These recurring cycles of infection and egress rely on signalling pathways that allow the parasites to sense and respond rapidly to their environment. While some key kinases and secondary messengers within these pathways have been identified, functional analysis of non-kinases has been very limited. This is especially true for candidates that are not predicted to play a role in active motility or are not known to function in established signalling pathways. Here we have followed up on an unexpected target of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> calcium-dependent kinase 3 (<italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3), a plant-like calcium dependent kinase, that was previously shown to play an important role in calcium-mediated exit from the host cell. We show that, in addition to controlling motility of the parasite (as previously shown), <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 phosphorylates an essential tyrosine transporter in the plasma membrane. Mutational analysis of the phosphorylation sites demonstrates an important role in maintaining parasite fitness, thus demonstrating that <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 plays a pleiotropic role in controlling both egress and metabolism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fast growing tachyzoite stage of the protozoan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> requires cycles of host cell invasion, replication, and lysis for its successful proliferation within the host. Each step of this lytic cycle involves tightly regulated signalling pathways, the intricacies of which remain largely unknown. Paramount to parasite survival is the ability to sense and respond to changes in the environment for which the divalent calcium ion (Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>) acts as an important secondary messenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Changes in free intracellular [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels, via release of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> from organellar Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> stores, can be induced by the addition of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ionophores, such as A23187 or phosphodiesterase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> flux regulates key processes including secretion of micronemes prior to host cell entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), parasite motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), and host cell egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Inversely, these processes can all be inhibited by Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> immobilisers or chelators, such as BAPTA-AM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> release leads to the activation of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> binding proteins such as calmodulins, calcineurin B-like kinases and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). <italic>T. gondii</italic> calcium-dependent protein kinase 3 (<italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3), for example, has been implicated in the regulation of ionophore induced egress, IIE (i.e. the rapid exit of tachyzoites from a host cell on addition of ionophore) and ionophore induced death, IID (i.e. the loss of infectivity of EC parasites after prolonged exposure to ionophore) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). <italic>TgCDPK3</italic> KO (&#x0394;<italic>cdpk3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), and chemically inhibited <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) all show a deficiency in IIE and IID. <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to a large family of CDPKs also found in plants and ciliates, but absent in humans. It is anchored to the parasite plasma membrane, via N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), facing the lumen of the parasite. Like all CDPKs, <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 possesses a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain consisting of 4 EF hands, known as the CDPK activation domain, as well as upstream autoinhibitory and catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Binding of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> to the EF hands causes a structural rearrangement that frees up the active site of the kinase domain, allowing for substrate phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). A quantitative phosphoproteome study revealed 156 phosphorylation sites that are differentially phosphorylated between WT and <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 mutant parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). The <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3-dependent phosphoproteome includes phosphorylation sites on proteins involved in parasite motility, such as the cyclase-associated protein and myosin A (Myo A), but also, and perhaps surprisingly, those involved in metabolic processes such as the &#x03B1;-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) subunit, E1&#x03B1;, required for the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and conversion of pyruvate to the TCA driver acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The link to proteins not obviously involved in egress and motility, as well as changes in the phosphoproteome regardless of the presence of ionophore, suggests that <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 function extends beyond egress.</p>
<p>The phosphorylation site that appeared to have one of the most marked reductions in phosphorylation state in <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 mutants compared to WT parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), is situated within a putative transporter of the MFS family (TGGT1&#x005F;257530, named ApiAT5-3 as per (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>)) that has moderate homology to a BCAA transporter. Given the additional evidence from the phosphoproteomic dataset that <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 putatively regulates BCAA catabolism via BCKDH, we hypothesised that <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 might be involved in BCAA uptake and metabolism via phosphorylation of ApiAT5-3 in addition to regulating motility. Here, we have assessed the function of ApiAT5-3 and the role of <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3-mediated phosphorylation. We show that ApiAT5-3 is rapidly phosphorylated at serine 56 (S56) during the first minute of induced egress. Using a conditional KO approach, we show that ApiAT5-3 is essential, and that deletion leads to a delayed death phenotype that is accompanied by a transcriptional response relating to translational stress. In growth competition assays performed with parasite lines that rely on phosphomutants or phosphomimetics, we show that phosphorylation of S56 appears to be important, but not essential, for parasite fitness. Finally, using a combination of metabolic analysis and heterologous expression in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes we confirm that ApiAT5-3 transports tyrosine but has only limited capacity to transport BCAAs. This data confirms that <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 phosphorylates several targets in its vicinity, controlling diverse processes at the plasma membrane and thus contributing to a range of biological processes in the parasite.</p>

<title>ApiAT5-3 is located at the parasite periphery and phosphorylated during ionophore induced egress in a <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3-dependent manner</title>
<p>ApiAT5-3 was previously identified to be phosphorylated at Serine 56 in a <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). BLAST analysis using the Transporter Classification Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tcdb.org/">http://www.tcdb.org/</ext-link>) predicts that ApiAT5-3 possesses a modest level of homology to a BCAA transporter. This was interesting, as deletion of <italic>TgCDPK3</italic> was previously shown to lead to upregulation of the BCKDH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), involved in BCAA catabolism. This indicated that <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 may directly control BCAA transport by phosphorylating ApiAT5-3.</p>
<p>Topology prediction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/TMPRED&#x005F;form.html">https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/TMPRED&#x005F;form.html</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>)) places the N-terminal regions of ApiAT5-3 at the luminal side of the parasite, potentially allowing for direct interaction with <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3, which also localises to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). ApiAT5-3 contains several phosphorylation sites at its N-terminus, of which S56 was the only one previously identified as being <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, upper panel). It is entirely plausible, however, that kinases other than <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 act during egress to phosphorylate additional residues on the ApiAT5-3 N-terminus. To investigate this, we queried a dataset recently generated in our laboratory in which we have quantified, using tandem-mass-tag technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), phosphorylation site abundance on <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteins across 4 time points (0, 15, 30 and 60 s) following ionophore-treatment (Caia Dominicus, in preparation). From the &#x007E;850 phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated or de-phosphorylated during egress, we identified S56 of ApiAT5-3 as increasingly phosphorylated over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, lower panel). We also identified several proteins already known to be more phosphorylated in response to Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> signalling including MyoA, Myosin F and DrpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). None of the other phosphorylation sites on the ApiAT5-3 N-terminus increased in phosphorylation state prior to, or during egress. However, S14 of ApiAT5-3 was dephosphorylated during ionophore-treatment. Collectively these data indicate that S56 is phosphorylated in a <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3-dependent manner upon Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> stimulation, and that a phosphatase is acting on S14 during the same period, while the other phosphorylation sites appear unaffected.</p>

<p>To localise ApiAT5-3 in <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites we generated an RH parasite line (ApiAT5-3::HA) that expressed a C-terminally HA-epitope tagged version of ApiAT5-3 under control of its endogenous promotor (i.e. 1000 bp upstream of the start ATG). Western Blotting confirmed expression of a 42 KDa protein close to the predicted size (56 KDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA) showed ApiAT5-3 predominantly at the periphery of the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). No ApiAT5-3::HA could be detected in nascent daughter cells, a hallmark of most inner membrane complex proteins. Together, these data suggest that ApiAT5-3 localises, like <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3, to the plasma membrane, and thus, could be a <italic>bona fide</italic> target of <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>apiAT5-3</italic> deletion causes delayed parasite death</title>
<p>ApiAT5-3 depletion is predicted to have a high fitness cost (Toxo DB 7.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)). Accordingly, we generated a conditional KO using the dimerisable cre recombinase (DiCre) strategy. We replaced the endogenous copy of <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> with a recodonised version in RH &#x0394;<italic>ku80</italic><sup>DiCre</sup> parasites, by double homologous recombination, using a double-guide strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We initially placed a loxP site adjacent to the Kozac sequence of ApiAT5-3 but were unable to obtain correct integration. We hypothesised that the loxP sequence might be interfering with promotor elements and moved it 100 and 200 bp upstream of the predicted start ATG, respectively. Both of these constructs correctly integrated into the genome. Subsequent analyses were performed with the resulting ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP, with the loxP at ATG &#x2212;100bp. Integration was confirmed by PCR amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>, left panel). To test whether ApiAT5-3 is an essential gene we treated parasites for 4h with either rapamycin (RAP) or DMSO. PCR analysis showed a near complete excision of the floxed gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>, right panel). Correct excision of the ApiAT5-3 open reading frame resulted in YFP positive parasites that could be readily distinguished from WT by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Upon performing plaque assays it became evident that RAP, but not DMSO-treatment, resulted in a complete block in plaque formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). A small number (&#x003C;0.5&#x0025;) of plaques could be identified in RAP-treated cultures, however, parasites contained in these plaques where YFP(&#x2212;), indicating that they arose from non-excised parasites (data not shown). Over time these non-excised parasites within the RAP-treated population outgrew the KOs (Fig. S1), further reinforcing the fact that ApiAT5-3 is essential for parasite survival. These non-excising parasites (termed ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP<sup>dDiCre</sup>), which presumably possess a non-functioning diCre recombinase, were isolated and used as controls for subsequent experiments, as detailed below.</p>

</fig>
<p>To visualise at which time points ApiAT5-3 is important, we followed replication of live RAP-treated ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP parasites over 3 lytic cycles, where each lytic cycle is defined as growth over 36 hrs, before passage into a fresh culture dish containing host cells. This analysis revealed that in the first cycle, RAP-treated (<italic>apiAT5-3</italic> KO) parasite numbers and replication rate remained comparable to DMSO-treated (WT) parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>). However, by 36 hrs into the second replicative cycle there was a 60.7&#x0025; decrease in the number of vacuoles with more than 16 parasites compared to the DMSO control. By the end of the 3<sup>rd</sup> cycle the <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> KO parasites consisted largely of 2 or fewer parasites/vacuole, even after the WT had successfully egressed (48 hrs into cycle). To better identify phenotypic consequences of <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> deletion, we followed replication over time using live-video microscopy. We started recording 29 hrs into the third lytic cycle post RAP-treatment, by which time <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> KO parasites display a marked growth defect. To facilitate a more accurate comparison between <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> KO and WT parasites, tdTomato expressing RH parasites (RH Tom) were spiked into the imaging wells at a 1:1 ratio. These analyses revealed that <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> KO does not lead to early egress or an inability to invade, but rather a lack of replication, often with the ability to undergo a first division, but failing to go beyond 2 parasites/vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>, Movies S1A and B).</p>
<p>As we showed that ApiAT5-3 is phosphorylated directly after ionophore-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>), we postulated that it may be required for ionophore induced egress. To assess this, we performed egress assays of the DMSO- and RAP-treated lines in the presence of 8 &#x03BC;M Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ionophore. However, there was no significant difference between the KO and WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>) suggesting that phosphorylation of ApiAT5-3, in response to elevated Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> levels, plays a role in processes other than egress.</p>

<title><italic>apiAT5-3</italic> KO parasites display a transcriptional response related to amino acid starvation</title>
<p>Deletion of a transporter may lead to up-regulation of alternative transporters or may manifest as a stress response that carries a detectable signature. To investigate this, we measured transcript levels using RNAseq, comparing RAP-treated ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP with ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP<sup>dDiCre</sup> parasites, which, as mentioned previously, do not excise the endogenous locus, even when treated with RAP. RNA was isolated in biological triplicate at 4 hrs post RAP-treatment, the time point at which we did not expect to see major changes in the transcriptome, and 60 hrs post treatment, by which time point the RAP-treated ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP parasites are still viable but start to display a growth defect. Indeed, at 4 hrs transcripts from the <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> gene were only slightly reduced in the RAP-treated ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP parasites compared to the RAP-treated ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP<sup>dDiCre</sup> parasites (17.1&#x0025;). In contrast, at 60 hrs post RAP-treatment, a 64.7&#x0025; reduction was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Unexpectedly, only 435 transcripts showed a statistically significant differential expression between the WT and <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> KO parasites at the 60 hrs time point, compared to the 4 hrs time point, indicating a modest transcriptional response to <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). GO-term analysis of the differentially transcribed genes showed most enrichment (5.41-fold) for genes important for translation. Among this enriched group, these genes encode almost exclusively genes for ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>, Table S3). No single transporter was specifically up-regulated, indicating that there is no rapid transcriptional compensation when <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> is deleted.</p>

<p>To compare fitness between the WT, the phosphomimetic (S56D), and the phosphomutant (S56A) complemented lines in the absence of <italic>apiAT5-3</italic>, we deleted the endogenous copy using RAP-treatment. This results in parasite strains that solely rely on the complemented copy of the gene. We confirmed correct excision of <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> by virtue of YFP expression post RAP-treatment, and PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>, Fig. S2A). RAP-treated parasite lines were viable and allowed us to isolate clones by limiting dilution, all of which restored growth in plaque assays (Fig. S2B). This shows that i) complementation of <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> by expression at the <italic>uprt</italic> locus fully restores ApiAT5-3 function and ii) that neither the introduction of phosphomimetics nor phosphomutants of S56 are lethal to parasite growth. This is not surprising as deletion of <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3, the kinase putatively responsible for ApiAT5-3 phosphorylation during egress, does not lead to a severe growth phenotype. Accordingly, phosphomutants would not be expected to display drastic differences in growth. We therefore performed competition assays in which we compared growth of YFP expressing complementation lines that fully rely on the complementation variant for growth (&#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3/S56A/S56D</sup>) mixed in a 1:1 ratio with their non-excised, colourless counterpart (ApiAT5-3<sup>ApiAT5-3/S56A/S56D</sup>). Using the ratio of 4&#x2019;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stained parasites (DAPI labels the DNA of all parasites) and YFP expressing parasites (YFP is expressed only in the complementation lines) we followed growth over 14 days in biological triplicates.

<title>ApiAT5-3 is a primary transporter of tyrosine, but not branched chain amino acids</title>
<p>The predicted homology of ApiAT5-3 to a BCAA transporter and the profound up-regulation of the BCKDH complex in &#x0394;<italic>cdpk3</italic> parasites suggested a direct role for ApiAT5-3 in BCAA transport. To test this, we expressed <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> in the heterologous expression system, <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes.

We therefore tested BCAA import and replicated the tyrosine uptake capacity of ApiAT5-3 in oocytes expressing WT ApiAT5-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<p>To verify the role of ApiAT5-3 in tyrosine transport in our conditional KO parasites, we measured intracellular <sup>13</sup>C-tyrosine levels in RAP-treated &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3</sup> (WT) and ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP (KO) parasites (74 hrs post excision), after 1 hr in the presence of growth media containing <sup>13</sup>C-tyrosine. In an analogous manner, we also measured <sup>13</sup>C-isoleucine uptake in order to verify if ApiAT5-3 is also a BCAA transporter. &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3</sup> was used instead of DMSO-treated ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP to control for any potential effects of rapamycin on parasite metabolism. This analysis verified a reduction of <sup>13</sup>C-labelled tyrosine uptake (40.5&#x0025; compared to &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3</sup>), but not isoleucine uptake (4.3&#x0025; compared to &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). We also measured the intracellular abundance of all detectable amino acids when labelling with <sup>13</sup>C-tyrosine. We observed a reduction of intracellular tyrosine abundance (63.2&#x0025;) in the &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3</sup> cells (as expected), but not phenylalanine which was slightly increased in relative abundance (17.45&#x0025;), suggesting that while ApiAT5-3 is able to transport phenylalanine in oocytes, it is not the major phenylalanine transporter in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (Fig. S3B). It is important to note that our metabolome analysis was performed at the end of cycle 2 after RAP-treatment, when &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3</sup> parasites are still viable but start to display a reduction of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Therefore, we predict that low levels of ApiAT5-3<sup>ApiAT5-3</sup> present at this stage are responsible for the residual transport of tyrosine. Interestingly, we also observed a reduction in intracellular aspartate (38.5&#x0025;) and glycine (28.3&#x0025;) in &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3</sup> cells (Fig. S3B). Since <italic>T. gondii</italic> is not known to be auxotrophic for these amino acids we reasoned that the observed death phenotype is unlikely caused by a defect in glycine or aspartate import, and instead focussed our subsequent analysis on tyrosine. We also observed an increase in the abundance of glutamine, valine, isoleucine and proline, indicating potential wider metabolic effects.</p>
<p>To test whether exogenous tyrosine can complement the loss of ApiAT5-3 we grew parasites in media with 5&#x00D7; the normal amount of tyrosine (2 mM). Despite various attempts to restore normal growth or generate &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic> clonal lines, we could not obtain viable parasites in high tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). In other organisms, phenylalanine can be converted into tyrosine. Therefore, we tested whether phenylalanine supplementation (2 mM) can rescue the growth phenotype of <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> KO parasites. No growth rescue could be observed (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that ApiAT5-3 is the only transporter of tyrosine in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and that phenylalanine cannot be readily converted into tyrosine in <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites.</p>
<p>To identify whether differences in phosphorylation state of ApiAT5-3 affected tyrosine transport, we performed isotopic tyrosine labelling of extracellular parasites using the &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3&#x005F;S56A</sup> and &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3&#x005F;S56D</sup> phosphomutant strains. No significant differences could be observed in these assays indicating that, if tyrosine import is affected, differences may be obstructed by the intrinsic variability of the assay (data not shown).</p>
<p>The fitness phenotype of mutating S56 to alanine is modest in a single lytic cycle and thus not predicted to have substantial impact on the import of tyrosine. Because we could not measure differences in tyrosine import in our phosphorylation site mutants we turned to heterologous assays where we expressed ApiAT5-3 WT, S56A and S56D in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes and tested tyrosine uptake. Although there was a trend towards a reduction in tyrosine uptake in the S56A expressing oocytes (average 19.5&#x0025; reduction in S56A relative to WT ApiAT5-3 expressing oocytes), this difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>). The S56D expressing oocytes display a marginal increase in tyrosine uptake of 14.0&#x0025;, that again was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Collectively these data show that conditional deletion of ApiAT5-3 causes a lethal reduction in tyrosine import that cannot be compensated for by amino acid supplementation. We also show that while phosphorylation of ApiAT5-3 at S56 is not required for tyrosine transport, mutating that site to alanine does lead to a subtle decrease in tyrosine transport in a heterologous assay.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 has previously been implicated in controlling distinct biological processes such as gliding motility and metabolism. How these are linked, however, has been unclear. Mutants that display only IIE and IID phenotypes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), arguing that <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 may be an upstream regulator of both processes. Here we show that upon activation by the Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ionophore A23187, <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 leads to an increase in ApiAT5-3 phosphorylation at S56. This occurs at the same time, and to a similar intensity, as other previously identified targets of <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 (e.g. serine 21/22 of MyoA) and other kinases involved in signalling (e.g. <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK1). MyoA and ApiAT5-3 are both located at, or close to, the plasma membrane. It is conceivable that, upon activation, <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 phosphorylates proteins at the plasma membrane, some of which are important for motility and others (e.g. transporters) that prepare the parasite for the extracellular milieu. In this study we have identified a function for the phosphorylation of S56, which becomes rapidly phosphorylated prior to egress in a <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3-dependent manner. Interestingly, ApiAT5-3 possesses several other phosphorylation sites in its N-terminus, aside from S56, that either do not change in phosphorylation state or, in the case of S14, appear dephosphorylated during induced Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> signalling. How S14 dephosphorylation and S56 phosphorylation are controlling ApiAT5-3 function requires further investigation, however it is evident that mutating S56 to a non-phosphorylatable residue substantially reduces parasite fitness. Phosphorylation of transporters has been shown to regulate affinity, specificity and flux of cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Accordingly, the observed fitness cost in S56A mutants could be indicative of a reduction in tyrosine import, for which the parasite is auxotrophic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>While we observed a clear role for ApiAT5-3 in tyrosine transport, expression of the ApiAT5&#x005F;S56A phosphomutant only led to a modest reduction in tyrosine import in oocytes, which was not statistically significant. One explanation could be that the effect on tyrosine import is beyond the limit of detection in our assays. We observed an 84.0&#x0025; reduction in growth of &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup>ApiAT5-3&#x005F;S56A</sup> mutants compared to WT parasites over 14 days. This translates into a reduced replication rate of &#x007E;6.74&#x0025; per 24 hrs. Tyrosine uptake assays in oocytes, as well as in extracellular parasites are, for reasons of cell viability, performed in &#x003C;1 hr, and may therefore not pick up the subtle differences predicted to occur if tyrosine is the only limiting factor in these assays. Furthermore, as indicated above, ApiAT5-3 shows a complex phosphorylation pattern at its N-terminus and other phosphorylation sites could contribute to ApiAT5-3 regulation. Mimicking these conditions in a heterologous assay, or in parasites, without prior knowledge of the abundance of the phosphorylation on each of these residues becomes hard to interpret and should be the subject of further studies.</p>
<p>Apart from regulating amino acid transport, phosphorylation of transporters has also been shown to regulate trafficking to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). However, a role for S56 in trafficking is less likely for two reasons: i) we did not observe any obvious defects in surface translocation of the transporter in parasites and ii) <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 phosphorylates S56 shortly before, or during egress, at which state the transporter is already on the surface. If S56 phosphorylation was important for surface translocation, we would expect this to occur at an earlier stage. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that minor differences in trafficking capacity impact tyrosine transport, resulting in the growth phenotype.</p>
<p>Whatever the molecular explanation for the phenotype, it is evident that <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3-mediated phosphorylation of ApiAT5-3 is important for parasite fitness.</p>
<p>Interestingly we haven&#x2019;t been able to rescue the effect of <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> loss in our conditional KO parasites through growth in high tyrosine concentrations. These results differ from those in Parker, K., <italic>et al</italic> whereby growth can, at least partially, be rescued in high tyrosine medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). One mechanism to counter low tyrosine levels that most organisms possess, is the ability to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine, via the enzyme phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (AAH). However, the lack of tyrosine import in ApiAT5-3 conditional KO&#x2019;s cannot be overcome in the presence of high levels of phenylalanine, indicating that this pathway is not available. Indeed, both isoforms of AAH (AAH1 and AAH2) have recently been shown to be secreted into the host cell during <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection, where they would be unable to rescue a tyrosine transporter defect in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Another explanation as to why Parker, K., <italic>et al</italic>. have successfully rescued the effects of <italic>apiAP5-3</italic> deletion through addition of excess tyrosine, could be via the upregulation of alternative transporters. Although a small amount of tyrosine appears to be imported in our <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> KO line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>), this is likely due to the presence of residual ApiAT5-3 protein in the plasma membrane after RAP-treatment. Along with our inability to rescue growth upon tyrosine supplementation, we conclude that this residual tyrosine import is unlikely due to an alternative transporter. Further to this, our transcriptomic analysis argues against a rapid sensing and transcriptional compensation for the lack of tyrosine import, so if upregulation of alternative transporters occurs, it will be a slow process. Another explanation may be that slight differences in the genetic background or passage history, and potential epigenetic changes in the parental strains, leads to a difference in capacity for amino acid transport. There is some indication that this may be the case as, in our metabolomics experiments, the ApiAT5-3 deletion showed reduced levels of glycine and aspartic acid in addition to tyrosine, while in Parker et al., other amino acids where observed to be less abundant in addition to tyrosine. We also saw an increase in abundance of some amino acids that differ from Parker, K <italic>et al</italic>. It may be interesting in the future, to compare our <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> KO with that of Parker, K., <italic>et al</italic>. and identify any compensatory mechanisms the parasites can use to adjust to tyrosine starvation. Interestingly, deletion of <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> leads to a growth arrest that is not accompanied by major transcriptional responses. This is reminiscent of the hibernation state in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, whereby depletion of isoleucine, an essential amino acid for this parasite, leads to arrest in growth without a major stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). This would suggest that translational arrest may be a common response among apicomplexan parasites during amino acid starvation.</p>
<p>In summary we show that ApiAT5-3, a novel <italic>T. gondii</italic> tyrosine transporter, is rapidly phosphorylated in a <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 dependent manner at S56 prior to, and during egress from the host cell. The phosphorylation of S56 appears important for parasite fitness. These results, together with previous studies, support the notion that <italic>Tg</italic>CDPK3 simultaneously targets several proteins in, or at, the plasma membrane, controlling very divergent biological processes, such as motility and metabolism. The phenotypes observed in &#x0394;<italic>cdpk3</italic> parasites may therefore be an accumulation of effects on various proteins, which is likely true for other kinases as well.</p>

To introduce an ectopic copy of <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> into the <italic>uprt</italic> gene locus, the <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> gene, and associated 5&#x2019; UTR, were PCR-amplified from gDNA using primers 18 and 19 which was then inserted into the BamHI/ PacI digested pUPRT::DHFR-D vector (Addgene plasmid #58258 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>)) using Gibson assembly. To generate the pUPRT::ApiAT5-3&#x005F;S56A::HA and pUPRT::ApiAT5-3&#x005F;S56D::HA vectors, the pUPRT::ApiAT5-3::HA vector was modified by site directed mutagenesis using the primers 20 and 21 (S56A) or 22 (S56D). pUPRT::ApiAT5-3::HA, pUPRT::ApiAT5-3&#x005F;S56A::HA and pUPRT::ApiAT5-3&#x005F;S56D::HA were linearised with PciI prior to the co-transfection of 2 &#x03BC;g into RH <italic>&#x0394;ku80&#x0394;hxgprt</italic> ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP with pSag1::Cas9-U6::sgUPRT (Addgene 54467 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>)) in a molar ratio of 1:10. Transgenic parasites were selected by the addition of 5 &#x03BC;M 5&#x2019;-fluo-2&#x2019;-deoxyuridine to culture medium, 16-20 hrs post-transfection. Integration into the genome was confirmed using primer pairs 24 and 25, and 26 and 27 respectively. Absence of <italic>uprt</italic> was confirmed using primers 28 and 29.</p>

<p><bold>S1 Fig. ApiAT5-3&#x005F;loxP parasites that survive RAP-treatment retain the <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> gene</bold>.</p>
<p>PCR analysis using primers spanning the floxed <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> gene show that the small proportion of non-excised parasites present after RAP-treatment outgrow the excised &#x0394;<italic>apiAT5-3</italic> parasites within 2 weeks.</p>
<p><bold>S2 Fig. Verification of ApiAP5-3 complementation lines</bold>.</p>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Addition of RAP to the complemented parasite lines leads to correct recombination of the loxP sites and deletion of the endogenous <italic>apiAT5-3</italic> gene. <bold>(B)</bold> Plaque assay showing restoration of plaquing efficiency upon RAP-treatment of the ApiAT5-3-loxP line complemented with the WT or phosphomutant versions of the gene.</p>
