<title>Abstract</title>
<sec><title>Background</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a worldwide health problem. Despite growing evidence that members of the gut microbiota can drive tumorigenesis, little is known about what happens to the microbiota after treatment for an adenoma or carcinoma. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment for adenoma or carcinoma alters the abundance of bacterial populations associated with disease to those associated with a normal colon. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes in the feces of 67 individuals before and after treatment for adenoma (N &#x003D; 22), advanced adenoma (N &#x003D; 19), and carcinoma (N &#x003D; 26).</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Results</title>
<p>There were large changes to the bacterial communities associated with treatment across the three groups. The communities from patients with carcinomas changed significantly more than those with adenoma following treatment (P-value &#x003C; 0.001). There was no significant change in the microbiota between patients with adenoma and advanced adenoma, or between patients with advanced adenoma and carcinoma (P-value &#x003E; 0.05). Although treatment was associated with intrapersonal changes, the change in the abundance of individual OTUs to treatment was not consistent within diagnosis groups (P-value &#x003E; 0.05). Because the distribution of OTUs across patients and diagnosis groups was irregular, we used the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to identify groups of OTUs that allowed us to successfully distinguish between pre and post-treatment samples for each of the diagnosis groups. Although the three models successfully differentiated between the pre and post-treatment samples, there was little overlap between the OTUs that were indicative of treatment. Next, we used a larger cohort that contained individuals with normal colons and those with adenomas, advanced adenomas, and carcinomas to determine whether individuals who underwent treatment were more likely to have OTUs associated with normal colons. We again built Random Forest models and measured the change in the positive probability of having one of the three diagnoses. Only patients who had carcinomas experienced a significant decrease in positive probability of having a lesion after treatment (P-value &#x003C; 0.05), indicating that the microbial milieu of the colon more closely resembled that of a normal colon. Finally, we tested whether the type of treatment impacted the microbiota of those diagnosed with carcinomas and were unable to detect any significant differences in characteristics of these communities between individuals treated with surgery alone and those treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy and radiation (P-value &#x003E; 0.05).</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>By better understanding the response of the microbiota to treatment for adenomas and carcinomas, it is likely that biomarkers will be validated that can be used to quantify the risk of recurrence and the likelihood of survival.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Background</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Disease mortality has significantly decreased, predominately due to improvements in screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Despite these improvements, there are still approximately 50,000 CRC-related deaths per year in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Current estimates indicate that 20-30&#x0025; of those who undergo treatment will experience recurrence and 35&#x0025; of all patients will die within five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Identification of methods to assess patients&#x2019; risk of recurrence is of great importance to reduce mortality and healthcare costs.</p>
<p>There is growing evidence that the gut microbiota is involved in the progression of CRC. Mouse-based studies have identified populations of <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> that alter disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, studies that shift the structure of the microbiota through the use of antibiotics or inoculation of germ free mice with human feces have shown that varying community compositions can result in varied tumor burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Collectively, these studies support the hypothesis that the microbiota can alter the amount of inflammation in the colon and with it the rate of tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Building upon this evidence, several human studies have identified unique signatures of colonic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. One line of research has identified community-level differences between those bacteria that are found on and adjacent to colonic lesions and have supported a role for <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Others have proposed feces-based biomarkers that could be used to diagnose the presence of colonic adenomas and carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. These studies have associated <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> and other oral pathogens with colonic lesions (adenoma, advanced adenoma, and carcinoma). They have also noted that the loss of bacteria generally thought to produce short chain fatty acids, which can suppress inflammation, is associated with colonic lesions. This suggests that gut bacteria have a role in tumorigenesis with potential as useful biomarkers for aiding in the early detection of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite advances in understanding the role between the gut microbiota and colonic tumorigenesis, we still do not understand how treatments including resection, chemotherapy, and/or radiation affect the composition of the gut microbiota. If the microbial community drives tumorigenesis then one would hypothesize that treatment to remove a lesion would affect the microbiota and risk of recurrence. To test this hypothesis, we addressed two related questions: Does treatment affect the colonic microbiota in a predictable manner? If so, does the treatment alter the community to more closely resemble that of individuals with normal colons?</p>
<p>We answered these questions by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes amplified from fecal samples of individuals with adenoma, advanced adenoma, and carcinomas pre and post-treatment. We used classical community analysis to compare the alpha and beta-diversity of communities pre and post-treatment. Next, we generated Random Forest models to identify bacterial populations that were indicative of treatment for each diagnosis group. Finally, we measured the predictive probabilities to assess whether treatment yielded bacterial communities similar to those individuals with normal colons. We found that treatment alters the composition of the gut microbiota and that, for those with carinomas, the gut microbiota shifted more towards that of a normal colon after treatment. In the individuals with carcinomas, no difference was found by the type of treatment (surgery alone versus surgery with chemotherapy). Understanding how the community responds to these treatments could be a valuable tool for identifying biomarkers to quantify the risk of recurrence and the likelihood of survival.</p>

<sec id="s2a"><title>Treatment alters the bacterial community structure of patients diagnosed with colonic lesions</title>
<p>Within our 67-person cohort we tested whether the microbiota of patients with adenoma (N &#x003D; 22), advanced adenoma (N &#x003D; 19), or carcinoma (N &#x003D; 26) had any broad differences between pre and post-treatment samples [<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>]. The structure of the microbial communities of the pre and post-treatment samples differed, as measured by the <italic>&#x03B8;</italic><sub>YC</sub> beta diversity metric [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>]. We found that the communities obtained pre and post-treament among the patients with carcinomas changed significantly more than those patients with adenoma (P-value &#x003C; 0.001). There were no significant differences in the amount of change observed between the patients with adenoma and advanced adenoma or between the patients with advanced adenoma and carcinoma (P-value &#x003E; 0.05). Next, we tested whether there was a consistent direction in the change in the community structure between the pre and post-treatment samples for each of the diagnosis groups [<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>]. We only observed a consistent shift in community structure for the patients with carcinoma when using a PERMANOVA test (adenoma P-value &#x003D; 0.999, advanced adenoma P-value &#x003D; 0.945, and carcinoma P-value &#x003D; 0.005). Finally, we measured the number of observed OTUs, Shannon evenness, and Shannon diversity in the pre and post-treatment samples and did not observe a significant change for any of the diagnosis groups (P-value &#x003E; 0.05) [Table S1].</p>

<sec id="s2b"><title>The effects of treatment are not consistent across treatment groups</title>
<p>We used two approaches to identify those bacterial populations that change between the two samples for each diagnosis group. First, we sought to identify individual OTUs that could account for the change in overall community structure. However, using a paired Wilcoxon test we were unable to identify any OTUs that were significantly different in the pre and post-treatment groups (P-value &#x003E; 0.05). It is likely that high inter-individual variation and the irregular distribution of OTUs across individuals limited the statistical power of the test. To overcome these problems we developed Random Forest models to identify collections of OTUs that would allow us to differentiate between pre and post-treatment samples from each of the diagnosis groups. To limit the likelihood that the models would overfit the data because of the relatively small number of subjects in each group, we restricted our models to only incorporate 10 OTUs. Despite this restriction, the models performed well (adenoma AUC range &#x003D; 0.69 &#x2212; 0.92, advanced adenoma AUC range &#x003D; 0.80 &#x2212; 1.00, carcinoma AUC range &#x003D; 0.82 &#x2212; 0.98). Interestingly, the 10 OTUs that were used for each model had little overlap with each other [<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>]. These results support the earlier community-wide analysis where we observed that the treatment had an impact on the overall community structure; however, the effect of treatment was not consistent across patients and diagnosis groups.</p>

<sec id="s2c"><title>Post-treatment samples from patients with carcinoma more closely resemble those of a normal colon</title>
<p>Next, we determined whether treatment changed the microbiota in a way that the post-treatment communities resembled that of patients with normal colons. To test this, we used an expanded cohort of 423 individuals that were diagnosed under the same protocol as having normal colons or colons with adenoma, advanced adenoma, or carcinoma [<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]. We then constructed Random Forest models to classify the study samples, with the 3 diagnosis groups (adenoma, advanced adenoma, or carcinoma), or having a normal colon. The models performed well (adenoma AUC range &#x003D; 0.62 &#x2212; 0.72, advanced adenoma AUC range &#x003D; 0.68 &#x2212; 0.77, carcinoma AUC range &#x003D; 0.84 &#x2212; 0.90; Figure S1). The OTUs that were incorporated into the adenoma and advanced adenoma models largely overlapped and those OTUs that were used to classify the carcinoma samples were largely distinct from those of the other two models [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>]. Among the OTUs that were shared across the three models were those populations generally considered beneficial to their host (e.g. <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Dorea</italic>, <italic>Anaerostipes</italic>, and <italic>Roseburia</italic>) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref>]. Although many of these OTUs were also included in the model differentiating between patients with normal colons and those with carcinoma, this model also included OTUs affiliated with populations that have previously been associated with carcinoma (<italic>Fusobacterium</italic>, <italic>Porphyromonas</italic>, <italic>Parvimonas</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] [Figure S2] with some individuals showing are marked decrease in relative abundance [Figure S3]. Finally, we applied these three models to the pre and post-treatment samples for each diagnosis group and quantified the change in the positive probability of the model. A decrease in the positive probability would indicate that the microbiota more closely resembled that of a patient with a normal colon. There was no significant change in the positive probability for the adenoma or advanced adenoma groups [<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>]. The positive probability for the pre and post-treatment samples from patients diagnosed with carcinoma significantly decreased with treatment, suggesting a shift toward a normal microbiota for most individuals. Only, 6 of the 26 patients (23.08&#x0025;) who were diagnosed with a carcinoma had a higher positive probability after treatment; one of those was re-diagnosed with carcinoma on the follow up visit. These results indicate that, although there were changes in the microbiota associated with treatment, those experienced by patients with carcinoma after treatment yielded gut bacterial communities of greater similarity to that of a normal colon.</p>

<sec id="s2d"><title>Difficult to identify effects of specific treatments on the change in the microbiota</title>
<p>The type of treatment that the patients received varied across diagnosis groups. Those with adenomas and advanced adenomas received surgical resection (adenoma, N &#x003D; 4; advanced adenoma, N &#x003D; 4) or polyp removal during colonoscopy (adenoma, N &#x003D; 18; advanced adenoma, N &#x003D; 15) and those with carcinomas received surgical resection (N &#x003D; 12), surgical resection with chemotherapy (N &#x003D; 9), and surgical resection with chemotherapy and radiation (N &#x003D; 5). We focused on the patients with carcinoma and pooled those patients that received chemotherapy with those that received chemotherapy and radiation to improve our statistical power. We did not observe a significant difference in the effect of these treatments on the number of observed OTUs, Shannon diversity, or Shannon evenness (P-value &#x003E; 0.05). Furthermore, there was not a significant difference in the effect of the treatments on the amount of change in the community structure (P-value &#x003D; 0.298). Finally, the change in the positive probability was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (P-value &#x003D; 0.999). Due to the relatively small number of samples in each treatment group, it was difficult to make a definitive statement regarding the specific type of treatment on the amount of change in the structure of the microbiota.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study focused on comparing the microbiota of patients diagnosed with adenoma, advanced adenoma, and carcinoma before and after treatment. For all three groups of patients, we observed changes in their microbiota. After treatment, the microbiota of patients with carcinoma changed significantly more than the other groups. This change resulted in communities that more closely resembled those of patients with a normal colon. This may suggest that treatment for carcinoma is not only successful for removing the carcinoma but also at reducing the associated bacterial communities. Understanding the effect of treatment on the microbiota of those diagnosed with carcinomas may have important implications for reducing disease recurrence. It is intriguing that it may be possible to use microbiome-based biomarkers to not only predict the presence of lesions but to assess the risk of recurrence.</p>
<p>Patients diagnosed with adenoma and advanced adenoma, however, did not experience a shift towards a community structure that resembled those with normal colons. This may be due to the fundamental differences between the features of adenomas and advanced adenomas and carcinoma. Specifically, carcinomas may create an inflammatory milieu that would impact the structure of the community and removal of that stimulus would alter said structure. It is possible that the difference between the microbiota of patients with adenoma and advanced adenoma and those with normal colons is subtle. This is supported by the reduced ability of our models to correctly classify patients with adenomas and advanced adenomas relative to those diagnosed with carcinomas [Figure S1]. Given the irregular distribution of microbiota across patients in the different diagnosis groups, it is possible that we lacked the statistical power to adequately characterize the change in the communities following treatment.</p>
<p>There was a subset of patients (6 of the 26 with carcinomas) who demonstrated an elevated probability of carcinoma after treatment. This may reflect an elevated risk of recurrence. The 23.08&#x0025; prevalence of increased carcinoma probability from our study is within the expected rate of recurrence (20-30&#x0025; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]). We hypothesized that these individuals may have had more severe tumors; however, the tumor severity of these 6 individuals (3 with Stage II and 3 with Stage III) was similar to the distribution observed among the other 20 patients. We also hypothesized that we may have sampled these patients later than the rest and their communities may have reverted to a carcinoma-associated state; however, there was not a statistically significant difference in the length of time between sample collection among those whose probabilities increased (358 (336 &#x2212; 458) days) or decreased (334 (256 &#x2212; 399) days) (Wilcoxon Test; P-value &#x003D; 0.56) (all days data displayed as median (IQR)). Finally, it is possible that these patients may not have responded to treatment as well as the other 20 patients diagnosed with carcinoma and so the microbiota may not have been impacted the same way. Again, further studies looking at the role of the microbiota in recurrence are needed to understand the dynamics following treatment.</p>
<p>Our final hypothesis was that the specific type of treatment altered the structure of the microbiome. The treatment to remove adenomas and advanced adenomas was either polyp removal or surgical resection whereas it was surgical resection alone or in combination with chemotherapy or with chemotherapy and radiation for individuals with carcinoma. Because chemotherapy and radiation target rapidly growing cells, these treatments would be more likely to cause a turnover of the colonic epithelium driving a more significant change in the structure of the microbiota. Although, we were able to test for an effect across these specific types of treatment, the number of patients in each treatment group was relatively small. Finally, those undergoing surgery would have received antibiotics and this may be a potential confounder. However, our pre-treatment stool samples were obtained before the surgery and the post-treatment samples were obtained long after any effects due to antibiotic administration on the microbiome would be expected to occur (344 (266 &#x2013; 408) days).</p>
<p>This study expands upon existing research that has established a role for the microbiota in tumorigenesis and that demonstrated the utility of microbiome-based biomarkers to predict the presence of colonic lesions. The most exciting future direction from the current study is the possibility that markers within the microbiota could be used to evaluate the effect of treatment and predict recurrence for those diagnosed with carcinoma. If such an approach is effective, it might be possible to target the microbiota as part of adjuvant therapy. Our data provides additional evidence on the importance of the microbiota in tumorigenesis by addressing the recovery of the microbiota after treatment and opens interesting avenues of research into how these changes may affect recurrence.</p>

<sec id="s4a"><title>Study Design and Patient Sampling</title>
<p>Sampling and design have been previously reported in Baxter, et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Briefly, study exclusion involved those who had already undergone surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, had colorectal cancer before a baseline fecal sample could be obtained, had IBD, a known hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, or familial adenomatous polyposis. Samples used to build the models for prediction were collected either prior to a colonoscopy or between one and two weeks after initial colonoscopy. The bacterial community has been shown to normalize back to a pre-colonoscopy community within this time period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Our study cohort consisted of 67 individuals with an initial sample as described and a follow up sample obtained between 188 &#x2013; 546 days after treatment of lesion [<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>]. Patients were diagnosed by colonoscopic examination and histopathological review of any biopsies taken. Patients were classified as having advanced adenoma if they had an adenoma greater than 1 cm, more than three adenomas of any size, or an adenoma with villous histology. This study was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. All study participants provided informed consent and the study itself conformed to the guidelines set out by the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b"><title>16S rRNA Gene Sequencing</title>
<p>Sequencing was completed as described by Kozich, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. DNA extraction used the 96-well Soil DNA isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories) and an epMotion 5075 automated pipetting system (Eppendorf). The V4 variable region was amplified and the resulting product was split between four sequencing runs with normal, adenoma, and carcinoma evenly represented on each run. Each group was randomly assigned to avoid biases based on sample collection location. The pre and post-treatment samples were sequenced on the same run.</p>

<p>The mothur software package (v1.37.5) was used to process the 16S rRNA gene sequences and has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The general workflow using mothur included merging paired-end reads into contigs, filtering for low quality contigs, aligning to the SILVA database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], screening for chimeras using UCHIME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], classifying with a naive Bayesian classifier using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], and clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using a 97&#x0025; similarity cutoff with an average neighbor clustering algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The number of sequences for each sample was rarefied to 10523 to minimize the impacts of uneven sampling.</p>

<sec id="s4d"><title>Model Building</title>
<p>The Random Forest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] algorithm was used to create the three models used to classify pre and post-treatment samples by diagnosis (adenoma, advanced adenoma, or carcinoma). The total number of individuals in the pre versus post-treatment models was 67 individuals. There were a total of 22 individuals in the pre versus post-treatment adenoma model, 19 individuals in the pre versus post-treatment advanced adenoma model, and 26 individuals in the pre versus post-treatment carcinoma model [<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>].</p>
<p>Similarily, the Random Forest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] algorithm was also used to create the three models used to classify normal versus diagnosis. The total number of individuals in the normal versus diagnosis models was 423 individuals [<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]. There were a total of 239 individuals in the normal versus adenoma model, 262 individuals in the normal versus advanced adenoma model, and 266 individuals in the normal versus carcinoma model [<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>].</p>
<p>All models included only OTU data obtained from 16S rRNA sequencing and were processed and cleaned using the R package caret (v6.0.73). Optimization of the mtry hyper-parameter involved making 100 different 80/20 (train/test) splits of the data where the same proportion was present within both the whole data set and the 80/20 split. For each of the different splits, 20 repeated 10-fold cross validation was performed on the 80&#x0025; component to optimize the mtry hyper-parameter by maximizing the AUC (Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operator Characteristic). The resulting model was then tested on the hold out data obtained from the 20&#x0025; component. For all pre versus post-treatment models the optimized mtry was 2 and for all normal versus diagnosis models the optimized mtry was 2. The hyper-parameter, mtry, defines the number of variables to investigate at each split before a new division of the data was created with the Random Forest model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>
<p>For each of the pre versus post-treamtent models assessment of the most important OTUs was then made by taking the top 10 OTUs by mean decrease in accuracy (MDA). These were then used to build each respective reduced OTU pre versus post-treatment model by diagnosis group to help avoid model overfitting. These reduced models were then put through the same process mentioned in the previous paragraph and were what was used for the final pre versus post-treatment models. For the normal versus diagnosis models the important OTUs were obtained by counting the number of times an OTU was present in the top 10&#x0025; of MDA for each of the 100 different splits. This was then followed with filtering of this list to variables that were only present in more than 50&#x0025; of these 100 runs. These corresponding reduced OTU normal versus diagnosis models were then put through the same process mentioned in the previous paragraph and were what was used for the final normal versus diagnosis models. For the pre versus post-treatment models the final optimized mtry was 2 and for the normal versus diagnosis models the final optimized mtry was 2.</p>
<p>Each model was then applied to our 67-person cohort [<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>] based on diagnosis: adenoma (pre-treatment adenoma (adenoma n &#x003D; 22 and disease free n &#x003D; 0) versus post-treatment adenoma (adenoma n &#x003D; 0 and disease free n &#x003D; 22)), advanced adenoma pre-treatment advanced adenoma (advanced adenoma n &#x003D; 19 and disease free n &#x003D; 0) versus post-treatment advanced adenoma (advanced adenoma n &#x003D; 0 and disease free n &#x003D; 19), and carcinoma (pre-treatment carcinoma (carinoma n &#x003D; 26 and disease free n &#x003D; 0) versus post-treatment carcinoma (carcinoma n &#x003D; 1 and disease free n &#x003D; 25)). The application of the pre versus post-treatment models generated the probabilites that the sample was a pre-treatment sample. The application of the normal versus diagnosis models generated the probabilities that the sample was that specific diagnosis (adenoma, advanced adenoma, or carcinoma).</p>

<sec id="s4e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The R software package (v3.3.2) was used for all statistical analysis. Comparisons between bacterial community structure utilized PERMANOVA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] in the vegan package (v2.4.1). Comparisons between probabilities as well as overall differences in the median relative abundance of each OTU between pre and post-treatment samples utilized a paired Wilcoxon ranked sum test. Where multiple comparison testing was appropriate, a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] and a corrected P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The P-values reported are those that were BH corrected. Model rank importance was determined by obtaining the median MDA from the 100, 20 repeated 10-fold cross validation and then ranking from largest to smallest MDA.</p>
