<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Protein kinases are at the heart of cell signalling processes, constitute one of the largest human domain families and are often mutated in disease. Kinase target recognition at the active-site is in part determined by a few amino-acids around the phosphoacceptor residue. These substrate preferences vary across kinases and despite the increased knowledge of target phosphosites little is known about how most preferences are encoded in the kinase sequence. Here, we used alignment-based approaches to identify 30 putative target sequence determinant residues (SDRs) for 16 substrate preferences that were further studied using structural models and 2 validated through activity assays of mutant kinases. Mutation data from patient cancer samples revealed that SDRs are often targeted in cancer to a higher extent than catalytic residues. Throughout evolution we observed that kinase specificity is strongly conserved across 1-to-1 orthologs but can diverge after gene duplication as illustrated by a reconstruction of the evolution of the G-protein coupled receptor kinase family. The identified SDRs can predict kinase specificity from sequence and aid in the interpretation of evolutionary or disease related genomic variants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) constitute one of the fastest mechanisms of control of protein function. Among these, protein phosphorylation is the most extensive and well characterized PTM, with over 90,000 phosphosites discovered to date for human proteins alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lawrence et al., 2016</xref>). Protein kinases catalyse the phosphorylation of their target substrates, including other kinases, working in complex signalling networks that are capable of information processing and decision making. These signalling networks are involved in almost all cellular processes and mutations in protein kinases are often associated with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brognard and Hunter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lahiry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Stenberg et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, cross-species studies have shown that protein phosphorylation and kinase-substrate interactions can diverge at a very fast pace, suggesting that changes in post-translational control can be a driver of phenotypic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beltrao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Freschi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Studer et al., 2016</xref>). Understanding kinase signalling networks remains a difficult challenge, in particular because only a small fraction of the known phosphorylation sites can be assigned to their effector kinases.</p>
<p>There are 518 known human protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Manning et al., 2002</xref>), and their specificity of substrate recognition is shaped by the structural and chemical characteristics of both kinase and substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007</xref>). The general structure or fold of different kinases is quite similar and their specificity is, in part, determined by changes near the binding pocket. Kinases are thought to recognise a contiguous motif around the phosphosite (four/five amino acids on either side of the P-site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amanchy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Knighton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pearson and Kemp, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pinna and Ruzzene, 1996</xref>) usually termed the kinase target motif. These target motif preferences are most often very degenerate with only a small number of key residues strongly contributing to the recognition. While these sequence preferences are thought to be important for target recognition, additional mechanisms contribute to specificity including: docking motifs; interaction with protein scaffolds; co-expression and co-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biondi and Nebreda, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Holland and Cooper, 1999</xref>). Sequence analysis has identified 9 kinase groups (AGC, CAMK, CMGC, RGC, TK, TKL, STE, CKI and other) but only a few kinase groups have clear differences in target preferences that are shared with most members of the group. For example the CMGC kinases tend to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues that have proline at position &#x002B;1 relative to the phosphoacceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kannan and Neuwald, 2004</xref>). However, for most kinase groups the preferences for residues around the target phosphoacceptor cannot be easily predicted from the primary sequence.</p>
<p>In previous studies of kinase specificity, the analysis of protein structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brinkworth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Saunders et al., 2008</xref>) and machine learning methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Creixell et al., 2015a</xref>) have been used to identify positions within the kinase domain that determine kinase specificity &#x2013; so called specificity determinant residues (SDRs). However, these approaches do not attempt to study the structural basis by which specific target preferences are determined. Methods based on comparative protein kinase alignments can achieve this, but have only been used to study a few kinase substrate preferences so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al.,2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kannan and Neuwald, 2004</xref>), or have been restricted to a single model organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mok et al., 2010</xref>). Here we have combined alignment and structure based methods to identify and rationalize determinants of kinase specificity. We have identified SDRs for 16 target site preferences and show that these can be used to accurately predict kinase specificity. SDRs for two target preferences were further studied by mutagenesis and kinase activity assays. We provide detailed structural characterizations for many determinants and study how these are mutated in cancer or during evolution. Finally, we show how the knowledge of SDRs can be combined with ancestral sequence reconstruction to study the evolution of kinase specificity using as an example the G-protein coupled receptor kinase family.</p>

<title>Identification of kinase specificity-determining residues and modelling of the kinase-substrate interface</title>
<p>To study kinase target preferences we compiled a list of 9005 experimentally validated and unique kinase-phosphosite relations for human, mouse and yeast kinases. Protein kinase specificities were modelled in the form of position probability matrices (PPMs) for 179 kinases, representing a fraction of the kinome of these species (human: 126/478, mouse: 35/504, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>: 18/116). For further analysis, we selected 135 high-confidence PPMs (87 human, 30 mouse, 18 yeast) that could successfully discriminate between target and non-target phosphorylation sites (see Methods). Throughout the text we may refer to the substrate amino-acids in single amino-acid letters and their position in the substrate relative to the target phosphoacceptor amino-acid (-5 to &#x002B;5, where 0 is the target phosphoacceptor residue). For example, a proline residue at the &#x002B;1 position may be abbreviated as P&#x002B;1 or an arginine residue at the -3 position as R-3. For serine/threonine kinases, consistent evidence of active site selectivity is broadly apparent for the -3 and &#x002B;1 positions relative to the phosphoacceptor amino-acid, and to a lesser extent the -2 position (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). These constraints correspond mainly to the well-established preferences for basic side chains (arginine or lysine) at the -3 and/or -2 position, and in most CMGC kinases for proline at the &#x002B;1 position. Tyrosine kinases however show little evidence of strong and consistent sequence constraint at the active site, and were excluded from further analysis as there were too few predictive PPMs (16) for the reliable detection of tyrosine kinase SDRs. These general trends only describe the most common modes of recognition shared across all kinases. Individual kinases can show preference for individual positions beyond these sites. All 135 high confidence kinase specificity models are summarized in <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>.</p>

The first step involves the construction of many kinase PPMs from known target phosphorylation sites. Vectors corresponding to a substrate position of interest (e.g. &#x002B;1) are then retrieved from each PPM. An unsupervised learning approach (i.e. clustering) then identifies kinases with a common position-based preference (e.g. for proline at P&#x002B;1). Alignment positions that best discriminate kinases belonging to one cluster from all others are then identified using automated tools for SDR detection.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>With the information on kinase specificities, we then attempted to understand more broadly the relationship between protein kinases and substrates at the active site by combining structural models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>) and kinase sequence alignments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). We compiled 12 serine/threonine non-redundant experimental kinase models in complex with substrates in addition to 4 serine/threonine autophosphorylation complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) (see full list in <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>). Kinase-substrate homology models for kinases of interest not present in this compilation of experimental models were also generated. A structural profile of substrate binding from position -5 to position &#x002B;4 is given in <bold>Supplementary Figure 1</bold>. The kinase positions most frequently in contact with the target peptide are highlighted also in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>. When referring to specific amino acids of the kinase, the single-letter code is used followed by the position of the residue based on the Pfam domain model that corresponds to the conserved catalytic domain (PF00069).</p>
<p>We developed a sequence alignment-based protocol for the automated detection of putative SDRs (<bold>Methods</bold>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Briefly, the target preferences described as PPMs were clustered to identify groups of kinases with shared preferences at a position of interest. Putative SDRs are then inferred as those residues that discriminate all kinases with the common substrate preference (e.g. P&#x002B;1) from those kinases without the same preference (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Using this approach we identified 30 positions that were predicted as SDRs for 16 preferences represented by more than 5 kinase PPMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). These SDR positions are found across the whole sequence/structure of the kinase domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>) but not surprisingly cluster near the substrate-binding pocket (10 SDRs are within 4 Angstroms of the substrate peptide) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Most of these determinants have not been described before and can be further studied by analysis of structural models. To assess the accuracy of these putative SDRs we tested if these could be used to predict the specificity of kinases from their sequence alone. For this we built sequence-based classifiers to predict the kinase specificity for the five preferences supported by at least 20 positive examples in the study dataset &#x2013; P&#x002B;1, P-2, R-2, R-3, and L-5. We used a cross-validation procedure where kinase sequences left out from the model training were later used for testing (<bold>see Methods</bold>). These models showed very strong performance with respective cross-validation tests, as measured by the area under the ROC curves: 0.99, 0.91, 0.82, 0.96, and 0.82 (<bold>Supplementary figure 2</bold>). This shows that, for these 5 specificities, the determinant residues can correctly predict the specificity of unseen kinases from their sequence alone, suggesting that the SDRs we have identified are broadly accurate.</p>

<title>Structural characterization of kinase SDRs</title>
<p>To further validate and study the putative SDRs we have used available co-crystal coordinates where possible. Models of relevant kinase-substrate complexes were alternatively generated using empirical complexes as a template (<bold>see Methods</bold>). Using these models we could suggest a structural rationale for SDRs of 8 target site preferences that are detailed in <bold>Supplementary Figure 3</bold>. These include the preferences for arginine at positions -3 and -2; proline at positions -2 and &#x002B;1; leucine at positions &#x002B;4 and -5 and for aspartate/glutamate at position &#x002B;1 for AGC and CMGC kinases. Some of the SDRs have been previously identified in other studies underscoring the validity of our approach. For example, the specificity for proline at the &#x002B;1 position is a well-studied preference and in our compilation it was found for 35 kinases of the CMGC group. Four of the six putative SDRs identified here map to the kinase pocket for the proline at the &#x002B;1 position (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3</bold>) and match previously described determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kannan and Neuwald, 2004</xref>) attesting to the accuracy of the methods used here.</p>
<p>We highlight in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref> SDRs for 3 preferences that are less well studied: proline at position -2 (P-2) and leucine at positions &#x002B;4 (L&#x002B;4) and -5 (L-5). There are 25 kinases with a modest P-2 preference including MAPK1, CDK2, and DYRK1A. We identified 5 positions that are putative SDRs for P-2, two of which (161 and 162) are proximal to the residue in interaction models. In position 162, P-2 kinases usually contain a bulky hydrophobic residue (Y or W) not usually found in non-proline-directed kinases (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3</bold>). Both residues at these positions appear to form hydrophobic contacts with P-2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). The domain position 161 was also implicated in the preference for the P&#x002B;1 specificity mentioned above. The three other putative determinants &#x2013; 82, 188, and 196 &#x2013; are unlikely to be direct determinants given their distal position in the protein structure, although we note that 196 was implicated in a previous alignment-based study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mok et al., 2010</xref>). These distal positions may influence the kinase preference through more complex mechanisms such as affecting the dynamics or conformation of the kinase.</p>

</fig>
<p>We identified 21 kinases (14 CAMK; 5 AGC; 1 CMGC; 1 PRK) with a moderate L-5 preference. Positions 86 and 189 were predicted as determinants where L-5 kinases are marked by hydrophobic amino acids at position 86 and the absence of glutamate at 189. These residues can be observed to line the hydrophobic -5 position pocket of the MARK2 kinase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Position 189 was also recently predicted to be an L-5 determinant from a comparative structural analysis of L-5 and R-5 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). For the leucine preference at the &#x002B;4 position we identified six kinases - MARK2, CAMK1, PRKAA1, PRKAA2 (human), PRKAA1 (mouse), and Snf1 (yeast) - and the domain position 164 as the sole putative SDR. This residue is an alanine in five of the kinases listed above (valine in CAMK1). In the MARK2 cocrystal structure, the substrate peptide forms a turn at the &#x002B;2 position so that the &#x002B;4 hydrophobic side chain projects towards the kinase pocket of the &#x002B;1 position and stacks against the &#x002B;1 residue (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). The substitution for alanine in place of residues with aliphatic side chains at position 164 in these kinases therefore seems to generate a small binding pocket that allows the L&#x002B;4 to functionally substitute for the kinase position 164 by stacking against the &#x002B;1 position.</p>
<p>We have selected two of the above described SDRs for experimental characterization (L-5 and L&#x002B;4). To test these SDRs we performed kinase activity assays for SNF1 and two mutant versions: A218L (the 164 kinase position, an L&#x002B;4 SDR) and V244R (the 189 kinase position, an L-5 SDR). These 3 kinases were separately incubated with a SNF1 target peptide of 15 amino acids that contains leucine at &#x002B;4 and -5 as well as mutant versions with A&#x002B;4 or D-5. The <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase reactions were stopped at 0, 2, 7 and 20 mins and the amount of phosphorylation was measured by mass spectrometry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). As predicted the A218L SNF1 showed an increased preference for the A&#x002B;4 peptide but not for the D-5. The reverse was observed for the V244R SNF1 mutant. However, we noted that both mutant kinases showed a very strong decrease in overall kinase activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). This could be due to either a potential destabilization of the kinase or a partial disruption of the activation mechanism by the two mutations.</p>
<p>The identification of previously known SDRs, the structural rationale for several of the novel SDRs and the experimental validation of two SDRs, further suggests that we have here identified positions that are crucial for the recognition of kinases with specific preferences. The SDRs identified here can therefore be used to infer the specificity of other kinases from sequence and as we show below to study the consequences of mutations within the kinase domain.</p>

<title>Specificity determinant residues are often mutated in cancer</title>
<p>Some kinase SDRs have been observed to be mutated in cancer and congenital diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berthon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Creixell et al., 2015b</xref>) and an enrichment of non-cancerous disease SNPs in regulatory and substrate-binding regions has previously been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dixit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Torkamani et al., 2008</xref>). Using mutation data from tumour patient samples from TCGA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link>), we have tested for the enrichment of tumour mutations in four categories of non-overlapping kinase residues: catalytic, regulatory, SDR (proximal to substrate), and &#x0027;other&#x0027; (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Two of the five most commonly mutated residues are proximal to the primary activation loop phosphate. SDR residues close to the substrate show also a significant enrichment of mutations relative to &#x0027;other&#x0027; residues (Wilcoxon p = 0.0017, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). This enrichment is greater than that observed for catalytic and regulatory sites highlighting their functional relevance.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next sought to determine if there was evidence of recurrent mutations mapping to the relevant SDRs of human kinases with a common peptide preference. Given that the specificity models only cover &#x223C;25&#x0025; of all kinases we used the SDRs of the 5 most common preferences - P&#x002B;1, P-2, R-2, R-3, and L-5 - to train sequence based predictors of kinase specificity as described above. Using these models we annotated all human kinases having a high probability for one of these specificities (<bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). We then compared the frequency of mutations per position for different kinase specificities and found significant differences in the relative mutation frequencies for kinase domain positions of the two most common preferences &#x2013; P&#x002B;1 and R-3 (represented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). Interestingly, domain position 164 and 161 of the &#x002B;1 position loop exhibit high levels of differential mutation in the proline-directed kinases. For position 161, the MAP kinases in particular are recurrently mutated in independent samples (MAPK1: 3, MAPK8: 3, MAPK11: 2, MAPK1: 1).This position is known to bind to the phosphotyrosine at 157 that exists in MAPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Varjosalo et al., 2013</xref>). For the predicted R-3 kinases, the glycine 159 residue of the &#x002B;1 position pocket is found to be commonly mutated, although this relates not to R-3 specificity <italic>per se</italic> but for &#x002B;1 position binding of most non-CMGC kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>). Residues 159 and 164 in particular are critical for specificity and highly conserved within the kinase subgroups, such that mutation to any other amino acid would be expected to abrogate &#x002B;1 binding. These results suggest that there is a significant recurrence of cancer mutations targeting kinase specificity and not just kinase activity.</p>

<title>Evolution of G-protein coupled receptor kinase family specificity</title>
<p>The identification of the SDRs for specific target preferences allows us to study the evolution of kinase specificity. We first compared the changes in these residues across orthologs. We focused our analysis on the 5 specificities we can reliably predict from sequence as described above - P&#x002B;1, P-2, R-2, R-3, and L-5. We observed that the five modelled preferences are highly conserved between orthologs, even for distantly related species. In P&#x002B;1 kinases, for example, we predict divergence only for some fungal and plant orthologs of CDC20 but not for any other orthologs. For the 5 specificity classes and for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> orthologs of human kinases we predict only 7 out of 245 (2.9&#x0025;) cases where divergence of specificity is expected. These results show that orthologs most often have conserved specificities for hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>We then selected the GRK (G-protein coupled receptor kinase) kinase family as specific detailed case study of the evolution of target specificity. The GRK family is one of 15 families belonging to the AGC group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Manning et al., 2002</xref>). However, they have diverged from the characteristic basic residue preferences at positions -2/-5 and -3 of the AGC group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lodowski et al., 2006</xref>). GRK2 for example is specific for aspartate/glutamate at position -3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lodowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Onorato et al., 1991</xref>), and in the GRK5 model presented here the R-3 signature is absent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). The GRK family is adrenergic receptor kinase) subfamily &#x2013; comprising GRK2 (ADRBK1) and GRK3 (ADRBK2) in human &#x2013; and the GRK subfamily -- comprising GRK1 (rhodopsin kinase), GRK4, GRK5, GRK6, and GRK7. We have taken a taxonomically broad sample of 163 GRK kinase sequences to generate a comprehensive phylogeny (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, Methods). From this, a maximum-likelihood reconstruction of ancestral sequence states has been performed (Methods) in order to study the evolution of substrate preferences on the basis of our detailed understanding of kinase SDRs.</p>

</fig>
<p>The topology of the tree is in general agreement with a previously published GRK phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mushegian et al., 2012</xref>). Focusing on the specificity at the -2 and -3 positions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref> <bold>and Supplementary Figure 4</bold>), two substitutions between the ancestor of RSK and GRK kinases and the ancestor of all GRK kinases likely caused a reduced preference for arginine at -3 and -2 positions. The substitution of glutamate for glycine at position 162 &#x2013; an R-3 and R-2 determinant (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3</bold>) -- and the substitution of phenylalanine at position 86 &#x2013; most likely either to histidine or to lysine. From this ancestral node towards the Rhizarian lineage an additional substitution of glutamate at 189 for arginine likely drove the complete switch from R-2/R-3 to a novel aspartate/glutamate preference at the -2 position. This 86K/189R pair is analogous to the 127E/189E pair found in basophilic kinases. In the heterokont lineages, the histidine/lysine at position 86 in the ancestror of GRK kinases was substituted for serine and while these kinases retained the 86E/189E pair, the R-2 and R-3 specificities are likely to be attenuated or eliminated given the substitutions at 86 and 162. The BARK kinases had two charge altering substitutions - - E127A and E189K &#x2013; that likely caused the preference for aspartate/glutamate at the -2 and -3 positions as observed today in GRK2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). Finally, in the GRK subfamily, a lysine residue (or arginine in GRK1) is usually found at position 86. Notably, no R-2/R-3/R-5 preference is evident for GRK5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>), suggesting that the described substitutions (E162G and E189K) are sufficient to eliminate this specificity.</p>
<p>The GRK family illustrates how the target preference of a kinase can change after kinase duplication via the substitution of a few key residues. It also illustrates one example where distantly-related kinase orthologs may have diverged when comparing the metazoan GRKs to their rhizaria homologs that diverged around 1700 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have here addressed the challenge of identifying which residues determine kinase preferences towards specific amino-acids at specific positions around the target phosphosite. Initial studies of kinase determinants used structures of kinases in complex with target peptides to identify SDR residues as those important for substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brinkworth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>). A more recent work has used a machine learning approach to identify SDR residues as those that globally maximized the specificity predictive power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Creixell et al., 2015a</xref>). These approaches have identified SDR positions but do not assign positions and residues according to specific target preferences (e.g. R-3 or P&#x002B;1). Alternatively, alignment-based approaches can be used to identify residues that contribute to particular preferences but so far have been restricted to a few kinase groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kannan and Neuwald, 2004</xref>), or have lacked structural characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mok et al., 2010</xref>). Here we have combined a statistical analysis of known kinase targets with alignment and structure based approaches to identify and study SDRs. The primary goal of this study was to identify and rationalize SDRs for particular preferences. Importantly, our analyses clearly show how different positions contribute in unique ways to target site recognition. Many SDR positions were found distal to the substrate binding site. These are harder to rationalize structurally and additional work will need to be done to establish how they relate to target site preference. The SNF1 mutations of SDRs validated two positions contributing to the expected target preferences but also showed a very drastic reduction in activity. This reduction in activity could be due to destabilization of the kinase or a partial disruption of the kinase activation mechanism. Additional mutant studies would be needed to characterize the interplay between activity and specificity and the mutational trajectories that allow for specificity switching.</p>
<p>The study of cancer mutations has revealed that SDRs are commonly mutated as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Creixell et al., 2015b</xref>). In addition to previous studies, we observed that SDR mutation burden in cancer can reflect kinase specificities with specific residues being targeted depending on the kinase preferences. These SDR mutations may still have a large impact on the kinase activity as was the case for the SNF1 SDR mutants, perhaps by interfering with the activation mechanism of these kinases. Understanding the impact of mutations in kinases will facilitate the classification of cancer mutations into drivers or passenger depending on their functional consequences. Our results suggest that grouping all SDR positions regardless of the kinase specificity will tend to overestimate the impact of mutations since many SDR positions are only relevant for one or few specificities.</p>
<p>The identification of the SDRs allows us to study the evolution of kinase preferences by ancestral sequence reconstruction. The protein kinase domain has been extensively duplicated throughout evolution but very little is known about the process of divergence of kinase target preference. Our results strongly suggest that kinase orthologs tend to maintain their specificity. This would be expected as they can regulate up to hundreds of targets (Imamura <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014; Manning and Cantley, 2007) and a change in specificity would drastically alter the regulation of a large number of proteins. This high conservation of kinase specificity contrasts to the larger divergence rate of kinase target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beltrao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Freschi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Studer et al., 2016</xref>). The fast evolutionary plasticity of kinase signaling therefore relies primarily on the turnover of target sites that can occur without the need for gene duplication.</p>
<p>Divergence of specificity within kinase families is more likely to occur after gene duplication. A previous study has shown how the Ime2 kinases (RCK family) have diverged from the other CMGC kinases in their typical preference for proline at the &#x002B;1 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Howard et al., 2014</xref>). Here we have traced the putative evolutionary history of the GRK family preference at the -2/-3 positions, which illustrate a divergence of kinase specificity between paralogs and also distantly-related orthologs. An understanding of kinase SDRs will allow for further studies of how the variety of target peptide preferences has come about during evolution and the rate at which kinase can switch their preferences after gene duplication.</p>
<p>Kinase target recognition within the cell is complex and the specificity at the active site is only one of several mechanisms that can determine kinase-substrate interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007</xref>). Much additional work is needed to establish a global comprehensive view of kinase target specificity and its evolution.</p>

<title>Kinase specificity models</title>
<p>Known kinase target phosphosites for human, mouse and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were retrieved from HPRD, PhosphoSitePlus, Phospho.ELM and PhosphoGRID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dinkel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prasad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sadowski et al., 2013</xref>). PhosphoGRID target sites supported exclusively by kinase perturbation followed by MS were excluded and homologous sequences above 85&#x0025; identity were removed with CD-HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006). Phosphosites mapping to the kinase activation segment were also removed as kinase autophosphorylation sites often conform poorly to kinase consensus motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pike et al., 2008</xref>). Specificity matrices for each kinase with at least ten target sites were constructed in the form of a position probability matrix (PPM) - 20 x 11 matrices with the columns representing substrate positions -5 to &#x002B;5; each value representing the empirical residue frequencies for a given amino-acid at a substrate position. For the purpose of scoring only, the PPMs were converted into PWMs by accounting for background amino acid frequencies in the proteome. Cross-validation was used to assess kinase model performance and PWMs with an average area under the curve (AUC) value &#x003C; 0.6 were excluded from further analysis. Too few tyrosine kinase PPMs remained after these filtering steps and we excluded them for further analysis. Kinase group/family/subfamily classifications were based on the KinBase data resource unless otherwise specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Manning et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Position-based clustering of specificity models and sequence alignment-based detection of putative specificity determining residues (SDRs)</title>
<p>Clustering of the PPMs was performed in a position-based manner for each of the five sites N- and C-terminal to the phosphoacceptor amino acid (-5, -4, -3, -2, -1; &#x002B;1, &#x002B;2, &#x002B;3, &#x002B;4, &#x002B;5) using the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Frey and Dueck, 2007</xref>) as implemented in the APCluster R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bodenhofer et al., 2011</xref>). Non-specific clusters or clusters with fewer than 6 constituent kinases were excluded and the clusters were further modified to account for potential false positive and false negative cases (see extended Supplementary Methods). The MAFFT L-INS-i method was used to generate kinase MSAs for this analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Katoh et al., 2005</xref>) and the <italic>trim</italic>Al tool was used remove MSA positions containing more than 20&#x0025; &#x0027;gap&#x0027; sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Capella-Guti&#x00E9;rrez et al., 2009</xref>). Kinases were then grouped by specificity according to the clustering of their specificity models, as described above, and then iteratively we predicted SDRs for each cluster (e. g. preference for proline at &#x002B;1 position). To identify putative SDRs, three high-performing methods alignment-based methods were selected (GroupSim, Multi-Relief 3D, SPEER) from previous benchmarking tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chakraborty and Chakrabarti, 2015</xref>). Incorporating predictions from the three methods is expected to achieve higher specificity than any single method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chakrabarti and Panchenko, 2009</xref>). As the GroupSim, Multi-Relief 3D, and SPEER methods use distinct schemes for position scoring we selected as putative SDRs those residues lying within a three-way intersection of the top 15 ranked sites for the single methods, as proposed by <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chakrabarti and Panchenko 2009</xref></italic>.</p>

<title>Kinase-substrate structures</title>
<p>Empirical kinase structures alone and in complex with putative target sequences were retrieved from the PDB (see extended Supplementary Methods). An automated procedure was implemented to identify the kinase substrate-binding residues for the substrate positions -5 to &#x002B;4 (excluding P0) and all binding residues contacts were categorised as either hydrogen-bonded, ionic, or non-bonded (i.e. hydrophobic or van der Waals). Kinase-substrate homology models were constructed by first superposing the kinase of interest (query) with a template cocrystal structure to achieve a plausible positioning of the substrate peptide.
