<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Present chemotherapeutics are inadequate against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) an immunosuppressive ailment caused by <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>. Despite the interest in plant-based drug development, an antileishmanial drug from plant source is unavailable. <italic>Glinus oppositifolius</italic> had been reported in favor of being immunomodulators along with other traditional uses. Novel anti-VL therapies can rely on host immune-modulation with associated leishmanicidal action. With this rationale, an n-BuOH fraction of the methanolic extract of the plant and isolated triterpenoid saponin Spergulin-A were evaluated against acellular and intracellular <italic>L. donovani</italic>. Immunostimulatory activity of them was confirmed by elevated TNF-a and extracellular NO production from treated M&#x03A6;s and was found nontoxic to the host cells. Identification and structure confirmation for isolated Spergulin-A was performed by ESI-MS,<sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>1</sup>H NMR. Spergulin-A was found ineffective against the acellular forms while, against the intracellular parasites at 30&#x03BC;g/ml, the reduction was 92.6&#x0025; after 72h. Spergulin-A enhanced ROS and nitric oxide (NO) release and changes in Gp91-phox, i-NOS, and pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines elaborated its intracellular anti-leishmanial activity. The results supported that <italic>G. oppositifolius</italic> and Spergulin-A can potentiate new lead molecules for the development of alternative drugs against VL.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is prevalent in tropical and temperate regions and is endemic in 88 countries with an estimated yearly incidence of 1&#x2013;1.5 million cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and 500,000 cases of VL, of which 70,000 people die every year. More than 90&#x0025; of cases occur in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Brazil with an estimated incidence of at least 500,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths each year.</p>
<p>This work highlights the anti-leishmanial effect of a triterpenoid saponin that was extracted from a tropical plant, <italic>Glinus oppositifolius</italic>, commonly found in Asian and parts of African countries. The drug showed potent Leishmanicidal activity against <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> at very low concentration. As the application of the conventional drugs (pentavalent antimoniates, amphotericin B, and pentamidine) is limited due to low efficacy, life-threatening side effects, high toxicity, induction of parasite resistance, length of treatment and high cost and anti-leishmanial vaccines may not become available in the near future, so plant extracts or plant compounds, represent a valuable source of new medicinal agents and alternative, effective and less toxic treatments, leading to a search for natural products with a potential leishmanicidal action. Being an immunosuppressive disease efficacy against VL can be demonstrated against intracellular parasites in the lights of emphasizing host M&#x03A6; immunostimulation as elaborated precisely in the present study.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) considered as the most severe form of leishmaniasis caused by <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> and untreated patients nearly always die [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Leishmaniasis is endemic in 88 countries with approximately 350 million people are at risk with an estimated yearly incidence of 500,000 cases and almost 70,000 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Leishmaniasis is liable for the ninth most substantial infectious diseases burden, however, is mostly disregarded among tropical disease priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Sodium antimony gluconate, Miltefosine, Pentamidine, and Amphotericin B are the primary therapeutics though associated with toxicity or resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Pathogen recognition by neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells activates intracellular signaling pathways leading into inflammatory responses like inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x03B2; id="page"x03B2; production, which is not the case for leishmanial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. <italic>L. donovani</italic> infection is characterized by the parasite-induced active subversion of the host immune system and also immune deviation which additively favors infection establishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>Leishmania</italic> prevents inflammatory response by the impaired release of different pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-&#x03B1;, IL-12) and enhanced releases of immunosuppressive signaling molecules, such as arachidonic acid metabolites and the cytokines TGF-&#x03B2; and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Involvement of co-stimulatory molecule B7-CTLA-4 is associated with increased TGF-&#x00DF; production in VL with increased apoptosis of CD4&#x002B; T cells and decreased macrophage apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Leishmanial infection also undermines a generation of microbicidal macrophage nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the hindrance of antigenic peptide display to T cells, and permeation of IL-10 producing T regulatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In recent years increased instances of VL has been reported in connection with immune-suppressed AIDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Discovery of novel compounds which intercedes host immune-modulation associated with leishmanicidal function having permissible side effects is a precise research objective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. It is also of vital importance that the drug required for parasite elimination in immune-stimulated cells was significantly less than the immune-suppressed ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The anti-parasitic effectiveness of plant extracts majorly relies upon secondary metabolites of diverse chemical groups including alkaloids, polyphenol, flavonoids, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. For isolation and characterization of a herbal extract or an active compound, different research strategies can be employed mainly in the extraction steps. However, bioactivity-guided fractionation considered as simple, rapid, cost-effective and reproducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. For obtaining a potent anti-leishmanial agent with immune-modulation, different studies were conducted with compounds like aslicarin A, niranthrin, skimmianine, quassin, tannins, linalool, etc. nevertheless with varying degree of effectiveness and satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Aerial parts of <italic>Glinus oppositifolius</italic> (Family Molluginaceae) are used for treating abdominal pain and jaundice, while decoction is used against malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Plants of this genus were previously documented for the presence of triterpenoid saponins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], and isolated pectin polysaccharides are antiprotozoal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and immunomodulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. <italic>G. oppositifolius</italic> is indicated for wound healing and used in traditional medicine for treating diarrhea, joint pains, inflammations, intestinal parasites, fever, boils and skin disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Some triterpenoid saponins, 3-O-(&#x03B2;-D-xylopyranosyl)-spergulagenin-A, Spergulacin, Spergulacin-A Spergulin-A, and Spergulin-B had been isolated from <italic>G. oppositifolius</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Application of plant-based immunomodulators is smart as they mediate their effectiveness by enhancing the inherent host-derived protective machinery without the involvement of specific microbicidal agents namely antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Most of the available antimalarial drugs are plant-derived; regrettably, there is no anti-leishmanial drug present which is of plant origin. The recent efforts to achieve this goal also were restricted against the promastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In the present work, an attempt has been taken to evaluate the intracellular anti-leishmanial activity of this plant and its bioactive component, Spergulin-A emphasizing on the immunostimulatory activity.</p>

<title>Isolation of methanolic fractions from G. oppositifolius</title>
<p>The aerial parts of <italic>G. oppositifolius</italic> were shade dried (1kg) and were first defatted using petroleum ether (60&#x2013;80&#x00B0;C, 3.5L X 3) at room temperature for 48h. The marc was than subjected to extraction using MeOH (3.5LX3) at room temperature for 48h. The extract was then filtered and MeOH was evaporated under reduced pressure and finally was lyophilized to obtain the crude MeOH extract (13g). A part (10g) of ME was then suspended in milli-Q water and partitioned sequentially with EtOAc and n-BuOH. Each fraction was evaporated under vacuum and lyophilized to yield the EtOAc fraction (EAF; 3.6g), n-BuOH fraction (NBF; 4.1g) and aqueous fraction (AF; 2.3g). All the fractions were stored at 4&#x00B0;C till further use.</p>
<p>Among these four fractions, n-BuOH showed promising antileishmanial activity. Around 4g of NBF was subjected to column chromatography of Diaion HP 20 (100g) and the column washed with water followed by 30, 40, 60, 80 and 100&#x0025; of MeOH to obtain a total of six fractions. Fractions eluted with 50&#x0025; MeOH showed similar spots on TLC and were mixed and then re-chromatographed on Dianion HP 20 column to furnish 7mg of Spergulin-A.</p>

After purification of this fraction by using column chromatography, a white amorphous compound was obtained. Molecular formula C35H58O11S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) was assigned from the ESI-MS (Supple. Figure 2). Structural elucidation of this compound was achieved by critical analysis of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR and <sup>13</sup>C NMR DEPT results (Supple. Results and Supple. Figure 3&#x2013;6). All the spectral data of this compound were found to be in complete agreement with reported ones and structure was then confirmed as Spergulin-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>

<title>Effect on different forms of <italic>L. donovani</italic></title>
<p>Anti-leishmanial effect of Spergulin-A (10,20,30,50,100&#x03BC;g/ml) was first evaluated by MTT assay against promastigote and axenic amastigote, the acellular forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) after 24h. Viability was 87.6&#x0025; and 77.8&#x0025; respectively for promastigote and axenic forms even at 100&#x03BC;g/ml. At the lower doses (10, 20 and 30&#x03BC;g/ml) the viability reduction was found to be non-significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>After that, the effect of Spergulin-A was evaluated against the M&#x03A6; internalized parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Here, a significant reduction of the parasite was noticed as low as 10&#x03BC;g/ml and further increased with the increment of doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, above 30&#x03BC;g/ml M&#x03A6;internalized antileishmanial effect of Spergulin-A had reached a plateau, and thus further experiments were M&#x03A6;stly conducted with 30&#x03BC;g/ml.</p>

<p>Efficacy of Spergulin-A (30&#x03BC;g/ml) against the intracellular parasites was evaluated at every 24h interval up to 72h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

The treated M&#x03A6;s exhibited significantly reduced numbers of parasites from the initial infection as well as the corresponding observation point of infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The parasite reduction at 72h was 86.2&#x0025; less than the initial point of infection and 92.6&#x0025; less than the 72h count of infected M&#x03A6;s.</p>

<p>After infecting the M&#x03A6;s with CFSE-tagged promastigotes and treatment with Spergulin-A (10, 20 and 30&#x03BC;g/ml, 24h), the cells were evaluated by FACS in FITC filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Highest intensity was noticed in the infected panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.ii) and with the increment of Spergulin-A doses the intensity gradually reduces which is reciprocal to the reduced parasite count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.iii-v).

Thus, possibly Spergulin-A reduced the parasite by immune-stimulating the host M&#x03A6;s.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Precisely an immune-suppressive ailment, VL inhabit and modulate the microbicidal function of the macrophages and create a microenvironment favoring parasite growth inside the visceral organs by modulating pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines and impairing ROS and NO release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The present <italic>in vitro</italic> study aimed to assess the immunostimulatory property of <italic>G. oppositifolius</italic> and isolation of a compound Spergulin-A which can reduce the intracellular parasites by immune-stimulation within a safe dose range for the host cells. Primary appraisal of an extract that can have an immunostimulatory effect was based upon the increased release of TNF-&#x03B1; and extracellular NO from treated M&#x03A6;s. It was observed that at an applied same dose (50&#x03BC;g/ml, 24h) only the n-BuOH fraction showed a considerable increase in TNF-&#x03B1; and extracellular NO production. The selection of TNF-&#x03B1; and extracellular NO as the potent immunostimulatory index in the present context is vital because endogenous TNF-&#x03B1; produced by infected macrophages can elicit the release of L-arginine-derived nitrogen intermediates detrimental for the intracellular parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The six n-BuOH subfractions were again verified for immune-stimulation, and fraction 4 emerged as the M&#x03A6;st promising one. The fraction was also considered to be safe for the M&#x03A6;s even at 50&#x03BC;g/ml (81.5&#x0025; viability) having CC<sub>50</sub> well above 100&#x03BC;g/mll.</p>
<p>Interested by the initial observations on elevated immunostimulation by the n-BuOH sub-fraction 4 and based upon the previous inspection of the presence of triterpenoid saponins in this fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] a triterpenoid saponin Spergulin-A was isolated and purified following the well-established method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Supple. information) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Evaluation of the anti-leishmanial property of Spergulin-A was the principal research interest after identification and isolation of it. The possible anti-leishmanial effect was first checked against the acellular forms of the parasite but without major success even at 100&#x03BC;g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, if Spergulin-A has any leishmanicidal effect on the intracellular parasites that will possibly mediate by altering the microenvironment of the host M&#x03A6;s. After 24h of incubation Spergulin-A (30&#x03BC;g/ml) was found to be pretty useful in reducing the intracellular parasite count and when applied for a prolonged period of 72h reduction of intracellular <italic>Leishmania</italic> was significant in respect to both the infected M&#x03A6;s of corresponding time point and initial parasitized M&#x03A6;s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). It is also of great significance that no considerable alteration in number of parasitized M&#x03A6;s was found in treatment panel while reduction of CFSE-stained internalized parasites was notable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This specific observation strongly advocated in favor of immunostimulation by Spergulin-A which mediated parasite killing. For being leishmanicidal, Spergulin-A should be useful in enhancing the release of NO and ROI, well recognized for their worth against <italic>Leishmania</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. NO is especially critical for intracellular parasite clearance as it was reported that mice with impaired inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) and thus restricted production and release of NO are incapable of <italic>Leishmania</italic> control even for isolated macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. At the dose of 30&#x03BC;g/ml, Spergulin-A showed enhanced production of intracellular NO and ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>) which directly reciprocal to the reduction of intracellular parasites and signified their connection. In the western blot analysis also increment in i-NOS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) was noticed in Spergulin-A treated parasitized M&#x03A6;s in amendable enhanced NO production and parasite control. The same interpretation is also pertinent for an increase of Gp91-phox, a subunit of the NADPH oxidase and enhancement of ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 E,C</xref>) in Spergulin-A mediated intracellular parasite killing. It was previously established that intracellular leishmanial killing proceeds by NO production from arginine by i-NOS, and superoxide (O2<sup>-</sup>) generated by the NADPH oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Several Leishmania species induce immunosuppressive TGF-&#x03B2; production, and diminution of TGF-&#x03B2; secretion is in direct correlation with enhanced i-NOS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] and can lead to internalized parasite removal as found with Spergulin-A treatment. TGF-&#x03B2; also found to increase the VL progression and averts disease cure in murine models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. IL-10 is another anti-inflammatory cytokine which makes macrophages indifferent to various activation signals and thus causes impairment of intracellular parasite killing also by down-regulating the production of TNF-&#x03B1; and NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. IL-10 production increased in infected macrophages <italic>in vitro,</italic> apparently via interaction with the Fc receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and which down-regulated with Spergulin-A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) in connection with parasite reduction. Parasite infection is responsible for the suppression of macrophage microbicidal activity that relies upon NO, ROI and cytokines like IL-1, IL-12&#x00DF;, and TNF-&#x03B1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] as with infection the levels of TNF-&#x03B1; IL-12&#x00DF; got down-regulated, but with the application of Spergulin-A, these cytokines significantly elevated which signifies their role in intracellular <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite control.</p>
