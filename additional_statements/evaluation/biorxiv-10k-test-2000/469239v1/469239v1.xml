<title>Abstract</title>
<p>To enable robust patterning, morphogen systems should be resistant to variations in gene expression and tissue size. Here we explore how a Shh morphogen gradient in the ventral neural tube enables proportional patterning in embryos of varying sizes. Using a surgical technique to reduce the size of zebrafish embryos and quantitative confocal microscopy, we find that patterning of neural progenitors remains proportional after size reduction. Intriguingly, a protein necessary for Shh release, Scube2, is expressed far from the source of sonic hedgehog production. <italic>scube2</italic> expression levels control Shh signaling extent during ventral neural patterning and conversely Shh signaling represses the expression of <italic>scube2</italic>, thereby restricting its own signaling. <italic>scube2</italic> is disproportionately downregulated in size-reduced embryos, providing a potential mechanism for size-dependent regulation of Shh. This regulatory feedback is necessary for pattern scaling, as demonstrated by a loss of scaling in <italic>scube2</italic> overexpressing embryos. In a manner akin to the expander-repressor model of morphogen scaling, we conclude that feedback between Shh signaling and <italic>scube2</italic> expression enables proportional patterning in the ventral neural tube by encoding a tissue size dependent morphogen signaling gradient.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When Lewis Wolpert first posed the &#x201C;French Flag Problem&#x201D;, he was seeking the answer to this fundamental question: What systems enable proportional patterning in embryos independent of embryo size? By the time Wolpert formalized this problem, developmental biologists had long known that embryos scale their patterning programs in response to changes in embryo size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wolpert, 1969</xref>). For example, sea urchin larva pattern normally from a single blastomere up to the four-cell stage and amphibian embryos can survive bisection and pattern proportionally at a reduced size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Driesch, 1892</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Morgan, 1895</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Spemann, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cooke, 1981</xref>). Significant scaling of pattern formation to tissue availability seems to be a near universal property of developing organisms. Yet, as we pass the 50-year anniversary of Wolpert&#x2019;s work, how morphogen gradients scale to pattern domains of varied sizes remains unclear in many systems.</p>
<p>Recent theoretical studies have proposed mechanisms that could account for scaling of morphogen-mediated patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben-Zvi and Barkai, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Umulis and Othmer, 2013</xref>). Amongst the most prominent of these is a model termed expander-repressor integral feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben-Zvi and Barkai, 2010</xref>). In this model, a morphogen represses the expression of another gene, known as the expander, that affects the range of the morphogen itself cell-non-autonomously. In such models, morphogen signaling will expand until it has reached an encoded equilibrium. This equilibrium is controlled by the morphogen&#x2019;s repression of the expander, thus enabling &#x201C;measurement&#x201D; of the size of the domain in need of patterning. The first biological example of this mechanism was proposed in Xenopus axial patterning. In this original model, ADMP expands BMP signaling by binding Chordin and inhibiting shuttling of BMP towards the ventral side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Francois et al., 2009</xref>). However, more recent experimental work implicated another factor, Sizzled, which may play a central role in scaling in a mathematically equivalent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Inomata et al., 2013</xref>). Expander-like relationships have also been proposed to regulate scaling of Dpp gradients during wing disc growth and even scaling of synthetic patterns in bacterial colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ben-Zvi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hamaratoglu et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Though scaling of early axis patterning following size reduction has been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms through which tissues and organs subsequently scale their patterning has received less attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ben-Zvi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Inomata et al., 2013</xref>). Previously, scaling of patterning during organ growth has been considered in the fly wing disc, which grows remarkably in size while maintaining proportion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Averbukh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ben-Zvi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hamaratoglu et al., 2011</xref>). In vertebrates, the developing neural tube has been a powerful model to study morphogen-mediated patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Briscoe and Small, 2015</xref>). While neural tube patterning does not expand isometrically over time with growth, embryos of different species maintain consistent embryonic proportions in the face of significant variation in organ size during initial patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kicheva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Uygur et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The vertebrate ventral neural tube is patterned by the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh; Marti et al., 1995; Roelink et al., 1995). Shh is produced by the notochord and floorplate and induces ventral cell fates over a long range in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Briscoe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zeng et al., 2001</xref>). Shh ligands themselves are dually lipid-modified and are highly lipophilic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pepinsky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Porter et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Porter et al., 1996b</xref>). While mechanisms of Shh transport have long been disputed, biochemical evidence supports soluble Shh as a primary component of long-range signaling, and release of Shh ligands from cell membranes is critical for gradient formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zeng et al., 2001</xref>). Shh release was largely thought to be achieved by the protein Dispatched, but recent work has identified Scube2 as a more potent factor in promoting Shh release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Creanga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kawakami et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tukachinsky et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Scube2 is a <underline>S</underline>ignal sequence containing protein with a <underline>CUB</underline> domain and <underline>E</underline>GF-like repeats. The role of Scube2 in Shh signaling was first identified from work using the zebrafish <italic>you</italic> mutant which corresponds to <italic>scube2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hollway et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kawakami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">van Eeden et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, while <italic>scube2</italic> mutants have defects in ventral patterning, <italic>scube2</italic> is predominantly expressed in the dorsal and intermediate neural tube in both mice and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grimmond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kawakami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>). Additionally, epistasis experiments indicated that Scube2 acts upstream of Patched to stimulate Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>). This effect was also found to be cell-non-autonomous, as mosaic injection of <italic>scube2</italic> mRNA was capable of rescuing Shh-signaling defects over a long range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hollway et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>). Studies in cell culture then demonstrated that Scube2 releases Shh from secreting cells cell-non-autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Creanga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tukachinsky et al., 2012</xref>). Recent work concluded that Scube2 may be responsible for catalyzing the shedding of lipids from the Shh ligands, but this model is disputed by previous findings that released Shh remains dually lipid-modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Creanga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jakobs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jakobs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tukachinsky et al., 2012</xref>). Scube2&#x2019;s cell non-autonomous role in Shh release and unexpected expression pattern led us to wonder whether Scube2 may regulate pattern scaling by acting as an expander, as has recently been hypothesized elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shilo and Barkai, 2017</xref>). In this work, we use quantitative imaging of cell fate specification in zebrafish to investigate the scaling of ventral neural patterning and the regulatory role of Scube2.</p>

<title>Ventral neural patterning scales with embryo size</title>
<p>Studying mechanisms of scaling during growth or between species of different sizes is difficult because many properties of the patterning system depend on stage or species-specific variables. To study scaling of pattern formation in embryos with comparable genetic backgrounds at matched time points, we developed a technique to reduce the size of zebrafish embryos inspired by classical work in amphibians, as we recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ishimatsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Morgan, 1895</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Spemann, 1938</xref>). Two lateral cuts are made across the blastula stage embryo: one to remove cells near the animal pole, to avoid damaging signaling centers crucial to early D-V patterning, and a second to remove yolk near the vegetal pole. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). With this technique, a significant fraction of embryos pattern normally and develop at a reduced size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>).</p>

<p>We measured scaling of neural patterning in size-reduced embryos using quantitative imaging (Megason SG, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). High-resolution image-stacks of 18-24 hours postfertilization (hpf) stage matched zebrafish embryos were collected under identical settings, during the same imaging session, from matched Anterior-Posterior positions in control and experimentally perturbed embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D-E</xref>). Imaging volumes were analyzed with custom built software to manually demarcate the dorsoventral axis and width of the neural tube along the length of the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>). Image intensity values were extracted in a set number of bins along the D-V axis for the left and right halves of the neural tube to normalize for variability in neural tube height. This system allowed for the quantitative and unbiased comparison of 3-4 somite lengths of neural imaging data from multiple embryos.</p>
<p>Using this imaging platform, we compared the expression of <italic>patched2</italic>&#x2014;a direct transcriptional target of Shh&#x2014;with the <italic>tg(ptch2:kaede</italic>) reporter in wild type and size-reduced embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G-J</xref>) (Huang et al., 2012) . When quantified relative to their respective neural tube dorsal-ventral heights, <italic>tg(ptch2:kaede</italic>) response gradients maintained nearly identical intensity distributions despite neural tube height being 15.0&#x0025; (&#x002B;/- 2.8&#x0025;) smaller in size-reduced embryos in this dataset (N&#x003D;5), indicating that Shh responses scale following size reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1I-J</xref>). When viewed on an absolute scale, control and size-reduced embryos show clear shifts in the response gradient as measured by the position at which 50&#x0025; of mean control maximum intensity is reached (p&#x003D;0.0076) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1J</xref>). To quantify this effect at the level of cell fate specification, we utilized a triple transgenic imaging strategy based on reporter lines marking <italic>nkx2.2a</italic> (p3 progenitors), <italic>olig2</italic> (pMN and some p3 progenitors), and <italic>dbx1b</italic> (p0, d6 progenitors) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1K-L</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gribble et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jessen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kinkhabwala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kucenas et al., 2008</xref>). Anterior-posterior averaged intensity profiles were then segmented to form cell fate profiles (see methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>). Using this method, we generated cell fate profiles which can be compared between embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>). After normalizing for their altered D-V height (which was reduced in this population by 12.2&#x0025; &#x002B;/- 2.4&#x0025; compared to controls), the average of these cell fate profiles of size-reduced embryos were virtually indistinguishable from those of full sized embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1M</xref>). Furthermore, differences between progenitor domain boundary positions were visible when size normalization was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1N</xref>). Statistically significant shifts in the positions of the p2 and pMN upper boundaries were observed only when compared in their absolute coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1N</xref>). This further demonstrates that ventral neural patterning adjusts to changes in total D-V height.</p>

<title>Scube2 levels control Shh signaling</title>
<p>Based on its role in the cell-non-autonomous regulation of Shh release and its dorsal expression pattern, we hypothesized a potential role for Scube2 in enabling scaling of Shh gradients. This hypothesis depends on <italic>scube2</italic> expression levels having a dose dependent effect on Shh signaling. However, previous work concluded that Scube2 is only required for Shh signaling as a permissive factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kawakami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>). To examine the role of Scube2 in ventral neural patterning, we performed a morpholino knockdown of <italic>scube2</italic> in <italic>tg(ptch2:kaede</italic>) reporter embryos using a previously validated translation inhibiting morpholino (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>). We observed a decrease in Shh signaling following morpholino injection, as demonstrated by a statistically significant suppression of maximum <italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>). Additionally, quantification of <italic>nkx2.2a, olig2</italic>, and <italic>dbx1b</italic> domain sizes in embryos injected with <italic>scube2</italic> morpholino showed a contraction of ventral progenitor domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D-F</xref>). Ventral shifts in the upper boundaries of the pMN and p3 domains were statistically significant, due in part to near complete elimination of the <italic>nkx2.2a&#x002B;</italic> p3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Unexpectedly, expansion of the p1-2 domain dorsally was also observed, potentially implying long range Shh signaling is required for complete p1-2 induction.</p>

<p>Previous work concluded that Scube2 was a permissive factor based on a lack of ectopic expression of downstream Shh signaling markers as observed by whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>). However, our high-resolution quantitative imaging reveals that injection of <italic>scube2</italic> mRNA leads to the expansion of Shh signaling, as shown by broader distributions of <italic>tg(ptch2:kaede</italic>) fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G-I</xref>). Embryos injected with <italic>scube2</italic> mRNA showed significant dorsal shifts in the position of half control maximum <italic>tg(ptch2:kaede</italic>) intensities (p&#x003D;0.0047), a measure of absolute Shh signaling range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2H</xref>). Maximum <italic>tg(ptch2:kaede</italic>) fluorescence in <italic>scube2</italic> overexpressing embryos was somewhat higher on average, but not statistically significant (p&#x003D;0.0512), which may suggest the stronger effect of <italic>scube2</italic> overexpression is to extend the range of Shh signaling. In addition, <italic>scube2</italic> overexpression affected cell type patterning in the ventral neural tube, as measured in triple transgenic <italic>nkx2.2a, olig2,</italic> and <italic>dbx1b</italic> reporter embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2J-L</xref>). Quantification of these cell fate profiles revealed large increases in p3 and pMN domain sizes, a decrease in the size of the p2-p1 domains, and unchanged patterning of the p0-d6 domains and more dorsal cell types. Ventralization was measured by comparing dorsal boundaries of the p3 and pMN, which were statistically significantly shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2L</xref>). These data indicate that not only is Scube2 required for long range Shh signaling, but that <italic>scube2</italic> overexpression amplifies endogenous Shh signaling. Additionally, this suggests that Scube2-stimulated Shh release is a limiting factor in normal patterning.</p>

<p>To test whether Scube2 is downregulated by Shh signaling, we injected mRNA encoding a potent activator of Shh signaling, dnPKA, at the single cell stage and observed the resulting embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hammerschmidt et al., 1996</xref>). Embryos injected with <italic>dnpka</italic> mRNA showed near complete ablation of neural <italic>tg(scube2:moxNG</italic>) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A-C</xref>). To test whether Shha ligands themselves were capable of suppressing Scube2 expression at a distance, we mosaically overexpressed <italic>shha</italic> in <italic>tg(scube2:moxNG</italic>) embryos by injecting a single blastomere at the 16-cell stage with either <italic>memmTagBFP2</italic> alone or with <italic>shha</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D-F</xref>). We expected local inhibition of Scube2 reporter activity near secreting cells within a few cell diameters. Surprisingly, <italic>tg(scube2:moxNG</italic>) expression was nearly completely eliminated in these embryos indicating potent cell-non-autonomous repression of Scube2 by Shh. When quantified, these embryos demonstrate a highly significant reduction of peak <italic>tg(scube2:moxNG)</italic> intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>). To test whether Shh&#x2019;s inhibition of Scube2 is required for its endogenous low ventral expression, we treated embryos with sonidegib, a potent Smoothened antagonist starting at the dome stage. Resulting embryos showed expanded <italic>scube2</italic> expression towards the floor plate and notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G-I</xref>). Shifts in ventral boundaries were quantified by measuring the D-V position at which 50&#x0025; of the maximum intensity of the control population was reached. These measurements were statistically significantly shifted in sonidegib-treated embryos relative to controls, indicating that endogenous Shh signaling is responsible for a lack of ventral <italic>scube2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4I</xref>).

<title>Scube2 diffuses over long distances during patterning</title>
<p>While Scube2 is known to act cell non-autonomously from transplantation experiments and Scube2-conditioned media has a potent Shh release stimulating effect <italic>in vitro</italic>, the localization of Scube2 protein during development is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Creanga et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, Scube2 is thought to associate with Heparin Sulfate Proteoglycans, and Scube2 had been hypothesized to diffuse from secreting cells in the dorsal neural tube, the need for which was later disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jakobs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kawakami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hollway et al., 2006</xref>).

<p>To assay Scube2&#x2019;s rate of diffusion we performed Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) at the dome stage, during which cell movement is minimal. FRAP was performed in a 100&#x03BC;m x 100&#x03BC;m region and recovery was observed at 10 second intervals over 5 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D-E</xref>, Movie S3-4). Image data from the bleached region was then normalized to its initial intensity and fitted to recovery curves using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Munjal et al., 2015</xref>). We find that the addition of Scube2 to mCitrine causes only minor changes to its diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5F-G</xref>). No significant differences were observed between the calculated mobile fractions of Scube2-mCitrine (0.283 &#x002B;/- 0.018) and Sec-mCitrine (0.338&#x002B;/- 0.019; unpaired t-test p&#x003D;0.0698). When the time to 50&#x0025; recovery of the mobile fraction is calculated, Scube2-mCitrine has modestly slower diffusion time than Sec-mCitrine alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F-G</xref>; p&#x003D;0.0405). These data further support Scube2&#x2019;s diffusion in the extracellular space, which likely mediates its long range of effect.</p>
<p>To observe distributions of Scube2 during development, we generated a transgenic line expressing the full length Scube2 protein fused to moxNeonGreen under control of Scube2 regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5H-K</xref>). We validated the functionality of this <italic>Tg(scube2:scube2-moxNG)</italic> line using a morpholino which bound only endogenous Scube2 at the splice junction of exon6, and not <italic>Tg(scube2:scube2-moxNG)</italic> derived RNA which lacks this splice junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure S6</xref>). <italic>Tg(scube2:scube2-moxNG)</italic> embryos were markedly resistant to treatment with this morpholino, validating the in vivo functionality of this construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure S6</xref>). <italic>Tg(scube2:scube2-moxNG)</italic> embryos showed broad distributions of Scube2 during patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5H-K</xref>). Throughout early patterning Scube2-moxNeonGreen is visible near ventral cells marked by <italic>tg(shha:mem-mCherry</italic>), although Scube2 is expressed largely in the dorsal neurectoderm at this timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5H-I</xref>, Movie S5-6). By 24 hpf <italic>tg(scube2:scube2-moxNG)</italic> fluorescence is found distributed throughout the embryo, although expression from <italic>tg(scube2:moxNG)</italic> is localized to the dorsal-intermediate neurectoderm.

<title>Feedback regulation of Scube2 levels is necessary for pattern scaling</title>
<p>To examine the regulation of Scube2 in size-reduced embryos, we performed our size reduction technique on <italic>tg(scube2:moxNG; shha:mem-mCherry)</italic> embryos and imaged them at 20 hours post fertilization.

<p>Next, we examined whether feedback control of <italic>scube2</italic> expression levels by Shh signaling is required for pattern scaling by saturating <italic>scube2</italic> levels by over-expression. If Scube2 is responsible for adjusting Shh signaling during scaling, we would expect <italic>scube2</italic>-overexpressing size-reduced embryos to have the same absolute Shh response profiles as controls, which would fail to scale following size normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6F-G</xref>). If scaling of ventral patterning is not dependent on Scube2, we would expect maintenance of pattern scaling with size-proportionate increases in <italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> distributions in both populations. We overexpressed <italic>scube2</italic> by mRNA injection in <italic>ptch2:kaede</italic> reporter embryos. When normalized for differences in D-V heights, size-reduced <italic>scube2</italic>-overexpressing embryos showed a disproportionate expansion of the Ptch signaling gradient compared to normal-sized <italic>scube2-</italic>overexpressing embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6H-K</xref>). Dorsal expansion of Shh signaling is quantified using the position of 50&#x0025; of average maximum control intensity, which is statistically significantly shifted dorsally in size-reduced embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6J</xref>). Importantly, when <italic>tg(ptch2:kaede)</italic> response profiles are plotted on an absolute rather than relative scale, they nearly exactly overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6K</xref>). This overlap without size normalization suggests that <italic>scube2</italic> overexpression encodes a response profile which is independent of embryo size and is not secondarily tuned by another scaling related factor.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work uncovers that the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog can self-regulate to enable scale-invariant patterning through linking morphogen signaling to inhibition of Scube2. We discovered that patterning of the neural tube adjusts to tissue availability following surgical size reduction in zebrafish embryos. Using overexpression experiments we demonstrate that Scube2&#x2019;s activity during patterning is not just permissive&#x2014;overexpression of <italic>scube2</italic> quantiatively enhances Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>). Utilizing a transgenic reporter line which we developed, we characterized the expression of Scube2 during neural patterning and found that Shh signaling is responsible for its repression in the ventral neural tube. Using Scube2 fluorescent fusion proteins we found that Scube2 is broadly distributed from secreting cells, explaining its previously reported cell non-autonomous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Creanga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>). Unlike other patterning genes, <italic>scube2</italic> responds to changes in neural tube height by disproportionately decreasing its expression, and overexpression of Scube2 inhibits scaling of the Shh signaling gradient by circumventing its feedback control. The expression of <italic>scube2</italic> thus can be seen as comparable to the &#x201C;size-dependent factor&#x201D; Sizzled, which is thought to enable scaling in early D-V patterning by tuning its expression levels to embryo size by chordin-dependent feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Inomata et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between Scube2 and Shh has important similarities to proposed &#x201C;expander-repressor&#x201D; models of morphogen scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barkai and Ben-Zvi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben-Zvi and Barkai, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Inomata et al., 2013</xref>). As with expanders in these models, <italic>scube2</italic> enhances morphogen range, is repressed by morphogen signaling, and acts cell non-autonomously at a distance from its source. However, Scube2&#x2019;s reported role in morphogen release may be distinct from the proposed mechanism of expanders. Expanders extend the range of morphogens by promoting their diffusion or inhibiting their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben-Zvi and Barkai, 2010</xref>). While release of Shh ligands from secreting cells would support their transport, the potentially irreversible nature of this effect and local action at the morphogen source would make distinct predictions for Scube2&#x2019;s effects on morphogen distributions. Nonetheless our study marks the first observation of an expander-repressor-like relationship outside of the BMP/Dpp signaling pathway in a developing organism. This finding raises the possibility that expander-repressor-like relationships may be common motifs in the regulation of morphogen gradients.</p>
<p>We began this work in part due to interest in the discrepancy between the area of Scube2&#x2019;s activity in the ventral neural tube and its expression in the dorsal neural tube. Our work with Scube2 fluorescent protein fusions revealed that Scube2 is diffusive and is distributed broadly from producing cells. Scube2&#x2019;s diffusion from producing cells could easily account for the distance between its expression domain and area of effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Scube2&#x2019;s broad distribution and considerable extracellular diffusivity bolsters the hypothesis that Scube2 may serve as a chaperone for Shh during its transport as hypothesized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tukachinsky et al., 2012</xref>). Cell culture experiments have indicated that Scube2 cooperates with Dispatched in a cholesterol-dependent &#x201C;hand off&#x201D; by binding different domains on Shh&#x2019;s cholesterol moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tukachinsky et al., 2012</xref>). Continued binding of Scube2 to the hydrophobic sterol domain may facilitate the un-hindered diffusion of Shh through the extracellular millieu. This model is consistent with the dose dependency we observe in our Scube2 overexpression experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-L</xref>) and may help solve the puzzle of the long-range transport of dually lipid modified hedgehog in vertebrates. Further investigation of the strength and duration of Scube2 and Shh&#x2019;s binding in vivo may shed light on this relationship. Unfortunately, direct imaging of this phenomenon is hampered by the lack of fully functional Shh fluorescent protein fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chamberlain et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>While some evidence suggests that Scube2 plays a role in lipid-shedding, these observations conflict with previous HPLC analysis and the findings of independent groups which demonstrated that Shh species released by Scube2 are dually lipid modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Creanga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tukachinsky et al., 2012</xref>). If correct, a model of Scube2 in which it acts only transiently at the cell surface of producing cells&#x2014;either by enabling the formation of multimeric Shh complexes or lipid shedding&#x2014;would have interesting implications for its role as an expander. Expanders are often formalized as having a dose dependent reversible effect on morphogen spread, while a transient role of Scube2 in Shh multimeric complex formation or shedding would be localized and irreversible. Mathematical modeling may reveal interesting implications of each proposed mechanism in Scube2-Shh feedback interactions during pattern scaling.</p>
<p>Scube2 is one of several recently identified elements of the Shh signaling pathway that exerts cell non-autonomous effects. Recent work has shown that Hhip&#x2014;initially characterized as a membrane-tethered hedgehog antagonist&#x2014;acts over a long range that cannot be explained by ligand sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kwong et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, the Hedgehog receptor, Patched, may also have cell non-autonomous inhibitory effects on Smoothened through regulating inhibitory sterols or sterol availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bidet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>). Together with known feedback relationships and the diffusivity of Scube2 that we demonstrated here, these mechanisms interlink Shh signaling between neighboring cells and may enable tissue level properties, such as the scaling of pattern formation we observed.</p>
<p>However, scaling of neural patterning is unlikely to be achieved by regulation of Shh signaling alone. BMP signaling in the dorsal neural tube is known to pattern dorsal progenitors. Scaling of BMP signaling in dorsal neural patterning may be achieved via a similar or carry-over mechanism to early DV axis patterning and should be explored in further studies. In the early D-V patterning system, both existing models propose expander-like relationships between elements of the BMP signaling pathway. The first model proposed ADMP as a scaling related factor, while more recent research has demonstrated that Sizzled has an indispensable role in scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ben-Zvi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Inomata et al., 2013</xref>). During neural patterning, the BMP antagonists Noggin, Follistatin, and Chordin are expressed in the notochord while BMP ligands are expressed in the roof plate. Intriguingly, while Sizzled does not seem to be expressed during neural patterning, ADMP is expressed in the notochord and thus may play a role in the scaling of BMP-mediated patterning of the dorsal neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Willot et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>BMP signaling is known to increase the thresholds for Shh-dependent cell fate specification, making signaling integration between these pathways a potential additional candidate regulator of scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liem et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McHale et al., 2006</xref>). Inhibition of either Shh or BMP signaling causes expansion of signaling by the alternative program. In normal patterning, cells do not measure ratios of BMP and Shh. In fact, Dbx1 positive progenitors in the medial neural tube require little to no Shh or BMP signaling present in order to be specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pierani et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, recent experiments with precise control of Shh and BMP concentrations in an explant system have shown that cells choose either ventral or dorsal fates in the presence of significant BMP and Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zagorski et al., 2017</xref>). Regulation of <italic>scube2</italic> expression may be another way to enable crosstalk between signaling pathways, as <italic>scube2</italic> is not expressed in the dorsal most cells of the spinal cord, suggesting repression by dorsal factors. Specification of the dorsal boundary of <italic>scube2</italic> expression may encode yet more information about the size of the tissue which would then affect Shh spread.</p>

<title>Generation of Transgenic Lines</title>
<p>The construct used to make <italic>tg(scube2:moxNG)</italic> was generated by isothermal assembly of PCR-amplified <italic>scube2</italic> regulatory elements obtained from the CHORI-211 BAC library. Regulatory elements were in part chosen based on annotations of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aday et al., 2011</xref>). Selected regulatory sequences spanned 1677bp of upstream intergenic sequence and 5962bp of the area spanning exons 1-5 <italic>scube2</italic>. Regulatory sequences were cloned into a pMT backbone by placing a zebrafish codon-optimized moxNeonGreen fluorescent protein and sv40 poly-A tail just downstream of the endogenous <italic>scube2</italic> Kozak sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Costantini et al., 2015</xref>). The construct used to make <italic>tg(scube2:scube2-moxNG)</italic> was generated using the same regulatory sequences as <italic>tg(scube2:moxNG</italic>), with the addition of cDNA corresponding to exons 6-23 of the Scube2 coding sequence downstream of exon 5 and moxNeonGreen attached at the c-terminus with a 10 amino acid long GA rich linker.

<p>Transgenic lines were generated by injecting plasmid DNA for each construct along with Tol2 mRNA into wild type (AB) embryos at the single cell stage, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kawakami, 2004</xref>). moxNeonGreen positive embryos were then selected for raising. Upon reaching sexual maturity, F0s were outcrossed and screened for founders. Founders were isolated and raised as single alleles. Monoallelic versions of each line are shown throughout the paper.</p>

<title>Size Reduction Technique</title>
<p>Size reduction was performed as described in our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ishimatsu et al., 2018</xref>). Embryo sizes were reduced by sequentially removing &#x007E;1/3 of the cells from the animal cap, then wounding the yolk. These surgeries are performed in 1/3 ringers solution, and embryos are immobilized in a thin layer of 2&#x0025; methyl cellulose. Surgeries can be performed either with glass needles &#x2013; as previously described &#x2013; or using a loop of thin stainless-steel wire that is inserted through a glass capillary tube and mounted on a halved chopstick as done here. Healthy uninjected embryos show a maximum success rate of &#x007E;60&#x0025; while embryos which have undergone injection or were spawned by older females have significantly lower success rates. In each size reduction experiment, embryos are screened for health and the largest size reductions; those with insufficient size reduction or morphological defects are discarded.</p>

<p>Scube2-mCitrine was generated from cDNA obtained from the Talbot lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woods and Talbot, 2005</xref>). Fluorescent protein fusions were made by attaching mCitrine or moxNeonGreen with a 10 amino acid GA rich linker to the c-terminus of Scube2. Membrane-mTagBFP2 constructs were generated using membrane localization tags reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Megason, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Subach et al., 2011</xref>).

<title>Sonidegib and Cyclopamine Treatment</title>
<p>Stock solution of 1 mM Sonidegib suspended in DMSO was used for treatment as generously given by the lab of Rosalind Segal. Embryos were placed in egg water containing a concentration of 50&#x03BC;M for the treatment condition, and equal parts DMSO were added to the sham control. Cyclopamine was dissolved in 100&#x0025; ethanol to make 50mM stock solution and was diluted for treatment in egg water to 100 &#x03BC;M. Treatment began at 7 hpf and continued until imaging at 22 hpf.</p>

<title>Confocal Imaging</title>
<p>For quantitative imaging, embryos were staged and mounted in our previously described dorsal mount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Megason, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>) in egg water with 0.01&#x0025; tricaine (Western Chemical, Inc.). Embryos were manipulated for proper positioning with hair loops, before gently lowering the coverslip. Embryos were not depressed by the coverslip or impinged by the mold, enabling imaging of their normal proportions. Imaging was performed on embryos staged at 18-24 hpf, unless otherwise noted in corresponding figure legends. Live imaging was performed using a Zeiss 710 confocal/2-photon microscope, Zen image acquisition software, and C-Apochromat 40X 1.2 NA objective. For fluorescent protein excitation, 405 nm (BFP), 488 nm (GFP/moxNeonGreen), 514 nm (mCitrine), 561 nm (mCherry/dsRed) and 594 nm (mCardinal) lasers were used. The imaging field was centered in each embryo on the somite 6/7 boundary for consistent positioning between images. For quantitative analysis, imaging datasets are only compared between sibling embryos imaged on the same day with the same settings. This approach aims to avoid clutch effects or variability in detector sensitivity and laser power that occur over time. Typical imaging settings with the 40x objective were as follows: image size of 1024x1024 pixels with .21&#x03BC;m per pixel and an interval of 1&#x03BC;m in the Z direction. For display purposes, images are rendered in cross sectional views (X-Z axis) which are then rotated for display, with image intensities for co-injection markers adjusted evenly within datasets for displayable brightness. FRAP, early stage embryo imaging and time-lapses were performed using a 1.0 NA 20x objective. Brightfield and widefield fluorescence images of whole embryos were obtained using an Olympus MVX10 and a Leica MZ12.5 dissecting microscope.</p>

<title>FRAP Experiments and Analysis</title>
<p>Imaging for FRAP was performed using a 1.0 NA 20x objective at dome stage. Bleaching was performed for two minutes in a 100&#x03BC;mx100&#x03BC;m area in the center of the frame with a 488nm Argon laser. Imaging was performed with a low laser power to reduce bleaching, and images were obtained at 10 second intervals over five minutes to quantify recovery. FRAP data in the bleached region was then normalized to the minimum and maximum intensity for each respective time trace. Normalized recovery intensities were then fitted to the following exponential to determine the mobile fraction (<italic>A</italic>) in MATLAB: <italic>y = A</italic>(1&#x2212;e<sup>&#x2212;<italic>&#x03C4;t</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Munjal et al., 2015</xref>).

<title>Image Analysis</title>
<p>Images were analyzed using a custom MATLAB-based image analysis software that enables rapid segmentation of neural tube imaging data. Neural imaging data is segmented by the user sequentially from anterior to posterior. Over a set step size (usually 50 pixels), the user selects points at the base of the floor plate cell and top of the roof plate cell that divide the neural tube into its two halves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A</xref>). The user then selects the widest point of the neural tube in each image. Imaging data from mature neurons, found laterally, and within the lumen of the neural tube, found medially, are disregarded using a set percentage of neural width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Once these positions are recorded, imaging data is then recovered as average pixel intensity in 25 bins from ventral to dorsal across 3-4 somites of A-P length. This binning and averaging strategy enables comparison of data between embryos that accounts for variations in neural tube D-V height. During the segmentation process, the researcher is blinded to the title of the dataset which contains information about its treatment condition. For distribution plots, binned intensities are reported for each embryo as the average intensities for each bin along the entire AP axis of the imaging volume. Each embryo&#x2019;s average intensity profile is then treated as an independent sample and averaged for displayed distribution profiles and standard deviations. To avoid artifacts caused by rounding in the calculations of half maximum control intensity positional values are extracted from the spline-interpolated intensity profiles for each individual dataset.</p>
<p>Progenitor domain segmentation is performed on average intensity profiles from each embryo in a dataset in the following manner: first, all intensity profiles in the data set undergo background subtraction and cross channel fluorescence caused by the extreme brightness of the <italic>dbx1b:GFP</italic> line is removed from the <italic>olig2:dsred</italic> channel. Intensity profiles are then fed to a peak finding algorithm to identify local maxima. Both <italic>dbx1b&#x002B;</italic> and <italic>nkx2.2a&#x002B;</italic> progenitor domains are found in the green channel, so a maximum of two peaks is allowed. In the red channel, only one peak is specified to identify <italic>olig2:dsred</italic> signal. Average peak intensity values for each domain are then calculated for the entire control dataset, and 50&#x0025; of this value in the case of the <italic>nkx2.2a</italic> and <italic>dbx1b</italic> domains is used as the threshold for calculating domain width. Given its greater spread along the D-V axis, a threshold of 25&#x0025; of peak height is used in calculating width of the <italic>olig2&#x002B;</italic> domain. Domain widths are then extracted from spline-interpolated intensity profiles to avoid errors introduced by rounding to the next bin. Segmented widths and positions of <italic>nkx2.2a</italic>, <italic>olig2</italic>, and <italic>dbx1b</italic> expression are then averaged for plotting purposes. Domain plots are generated by assigning all <italic>nkx2.2a</italic>&#x002B; progenitors to the p3 fate, <italic>olig2</italic>&#x002B; progenitors lacking <italic>nkx2.2a</italic> expression overlap to the pMN fate, and <italic>dbx1b</italic>&#x002B; progenitors to the p0-d6 fate. These domain sizes and positions are then used to reconstruct domains in-between or flanking them, which include the p2-p1 domain between pMN and p0-d6, the floorplate below p3, and the d5-roofplate above p0-d6. These heights and positions are then used to generate the stacked bar plots shown.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical comparisons of maximum average intensity and position of 50&#x0025; maximum intensity are performed by an unpaired T-test. Although each dataset contains hundreds of measurements of each binned intensity value over the A-P axis of a z-stack, only the average of these measurements for each embryo is treated as a data-point for calculation of the standard deviation and statistical significance tests. This is done to avoid oversampling that would exaggerate statistical significance. In all measurements, statistical significance is markedly increased if analysis is performed by treating all underlying intensity measurements as samples. Thresholds for calculating the position of half maximum are determined from the average maximum of the corresponding control dataset for each experiment. Position is then determined from the fitted trend-line to avoid inaccuracies due to rounding. To calculate the significance of shifts in boundary positions, upper domain boundaries for each embryo were compared in an un-paired t-test between embryos from each population. When the progenitor domain segmentation algorithm finds there is no domain present, the boundary is set to 0.</p>

<caption><title>Segmentation of neural imaging data.</title>
<p>(A) Image of a 20 hpf <italic>tg(ptch2:kaede)</italic> reporter embryo undergoing selection of the &#x201C;axis of reflection&#x201D; which serves to mark a measurement of Dorsoventral height and separate the left and right halves of the neural tube. These positions are picked by the user, first by picking the bottom of the floor plate cell, then inputting the top coordinate of the roof plate cell. (B) Image of a 20 hpf <italic>tg(ptch2:kaede)</italic> reporter embryo after a user has selected the width of the spinal cord. The algorithm then calculates how much imaging data to collect based on a ratio which avoids mature neurons and the lumen of the spinal cord. (C) After collection of average intensities in each bin, data is stored as shown. Average profiles for generating distribution plots and segmenting domains are gathered by averaging these data along the A-P axis for both halves of the neural tube.</p></caption>

<p>(A) Averaged image intensity profiles from the green channel of both sides of a segmented neural tube from a <italic>tg(dbx1b:GFP;olig2:dsred;nkx2.2a:memGFP)</italic> embryo. Black diamonds represent peaks found by a peak finding algorithm, while open circles and lines show the calculated domain boundaries and width for this embryo based on the universally applied threshold in this dataset. Thresholds are determined by 50&#x0025; of average peak intensity of the control population for each dataset. (B) Example domain determination of <italic>nkx2.2a</italic> and dbx1b&#x002B; cells. Red lines mark the predicted <italic>nkx2.2a</italic> domain, which correlates with the boundary of their fluorescence. Green lines mark the predicted width of the <italic>dbx1b</italic> domain which correlates well with visible fluorescence of this domain. Some anterior-posterior variability in domain size is observed. (C) Formatted as in part A, this plots the averages <italic>olig2:dsred&#x002B;</italic> intensity, peak, and determined width. (D) Example domain determination of <italic>olig2&#x002B;</italic> cells. Blue lines mark the predicted <italic>olig2:dsred</italic> domain, which correlates with the boundary of their fluorescence. Thresholds are determined by 25&#x0025; of average peak intensity of the control embryos in each dataset. (E) Example stacked bar plot generated only from this embryo using calculated domain positions to determine domain sizes.</p></caption>
