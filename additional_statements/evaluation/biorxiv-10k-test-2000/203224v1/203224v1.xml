<title>Abstract</title>
<p>PARP inhibitors (PARPi) target homologous recombination defective tumour cells via synthetic lethality. Genome-wide and high-density CRISPR-Cas9 &#x201C;tag, mutate and enrich&#x201D; mutagenesis screens identified single amino acid mutations in PARP1 that cause profound PARPi-resistance. These included PARP1 mutations outside of the DNA interacting regions of the protein, such as mutations in solvent exposed regions of the catalytic domain and clusters of mutations around points of contact between ZnF, WGR and HD domains. These mutations altered PARP1 trapping, as did a mutation found in a clinical case of PARPi resistance. These genetic studies reinforce the importance of trapped PARP1 as a key cytotoxic DNA lesion and suggest that interactions between non-DNA binding domains of PARP1 influence cytotoxicity. Finally, different mechanisms of PARPi resistance (<italic>BRCA1</italic> reversion, <italic>PARP1</italic>, <italic>53BP1</italic>, <italic>REV7</italic> mutation) had differing effects on chemotherapy sensitivity, suggesting that the underlying mechanism of PARPi resistance likely influences the success of subsequent therapies.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drugs targeting the poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes PARP1 and PARP2 cause synthetic lethality in tumour cells with homologous recombination (HR) defects, including those with loss of function mutations in the <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> tumour suppressor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. PARP1 acts as a DNA damage sensor, rapidly binding single&#x002D; and double-stranded DNA breaks as they occur and then coordinating their repair by synthesizing poly-(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains on target proteins (PARylation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The rationale for using PARP inhibitors (PARPi) to treat HR-deficient cancers is based on the exquisite sensitivity of <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> defective cells to small molecule PARPi as well as the ability of <italic>Parp1</italic> gene silencing to selectively inhibit <italic>Brca1</italic> or <italic>Brca2</italic> defective cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Subsequent experiments have revealed that in addition to inhibiting the catalytic activity of PARP1, most clinical PARPi cause cytotoxicity by trapping PARP1 at sites of DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The PARP1 trapping potency of different inhibitors correlates with their cytotoxic potency, with talazoparib (BMN673, Pfizer) showing the greatest effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Complete ablation of PARP1 expression by transposon-mediated mutagenesis or gene silencing in <italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>BRCA2</italic> wild type cells results in extreme resistance to several PARP inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The ability of some PARPi to trap PARP1 might be partially explained by the observation that PARP1 DNA binding is independent of its catalytic activity, while dissociation of PARP1 from DNA requires PARylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Recent structural studies have proposed a model of PARP1 binding to single stranded DNA damage that takes into account a series of molecular interactions between different PARP1 protein domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In its non-DNA bound state, a regulatory PARP1 helical domain (HD) is proposed to prevent catalytic activity. Upon PARP1 DNA binding (via N-terminal zinc finger DNA binding domains), an unfolding of the PARP1 helical region accompanies catalytic activation and PARP1 synthesizes PAR chains on itself and other acceptor proteins in the vicinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. These PARylation events recruit other DNA repair enzymes, such as XRCC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and act as a second messenger signaling the presence of DNA damage. The synthesis of highly negatively-charged PAR chains on PARP1 is thought to also cause dissociation of PARP1 from DNA, presumably through a steric mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we used CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to investigate the mechanisms of PARPi toxicity in greater detail. We applied a focused mutagenesis approach to generate a large number of PARP1 mutant alleles that cause resistance, identifying an axis of intramolecular communication in PARP1 that mediates PARPi toxicity. We isolated PARP1 mutants from tumour cells with <italic>BRCA1</italic> exon 11 mutations and demonstrated that residual BRCA1 function in these cells allows tolerance of PARP1 loss of function despite the synthetic lethal relationship between these genes. A PARP1 mutation observed in a tumour from a PARPi resistant patient prevented PARP1 trapping, suggesting that <italic>PARP1</italic> mutations that impair trapping could contribute to clinical PARPi resistance. Finally, we found that <italic>PARP1</italic> mutations caused a distinct set of drug sensitivities when compared to other known forms of PARPi resistance (<italic>REV7</italic>, <italic>53BP1</italic> or <italic>BRCA1</italic> reversion mutants), suggesting that knowledge of the molecular mechanism of resistance in individual patients could inform decisions on further treatment.</p>

<title>A genome-wide CRISPR screen for PARP inhibitor resistance identifies in-frame Parp1 mutants</title>
<p>Although PARPi are showing considerable promise as the first of a new generation of synthetic lethal therapies, resistance is a major issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To better understand this, we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis screen (encompassing 87,897 single guide (sg)RNAs) to identify mouse ES cell mutants resistant to the potent PARPi talazoparib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> (BMN673). We isolated and analysed 24 resistant clones (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Nine clones harboured one of two different sgRNAs targeting <italic>Parp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). <italic>Parp1</italic> was the only gene that was targeted by more than one different sgRNA among the resistant clones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>

Temporal localisation of PARP1-GFP to damaged DNA was then estimated by visualising GFP signal at the microirradiated spot, as was the generation of PAR at the damaged site by use of a PAR binding PBZmRuby2 probe (see schematic).

<p>Parp1 protein was absent in all of the PARPi resistant clones with a <italic>Parp1</italic> sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) with one exception (clone BR8), consistent with the observation that ablation of PARP1 expression prevents PARP1 trapping and causes PARPi resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. DNA sequencing of the <italic>Parp1</italic> target site in clone BR8 revealed two in-frame <italic>Parp1</italic> mutations: c.127_129delATG and c[127_129delATG;130T&#x003E;A] (p.43delM and p.[43delM;44F&#x003E;I], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Both M43 and F44 residues are conserved between human and mouse PARP1 proteins and are predicted to be involved in base stacking interactions formed at the site of DNA/PARP1 interaction by the zinc fingers (ZnF) of the PARP1 DNA binding domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Using the PARP1 trapping assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, we found that mutant Parp1 protein was not associated with the chromatin (C) fraction after talazoparib treatment, in contrast to the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), suggesting that Parp1 trapping was impaired. A PARP1-GFP fusion protein with the p.[43delM;44F&#x003E;I] mutation also failed to be recruited to DNA damage produced by laser microirradiation and did not produce poly-(ADP-ribose) (PAR) at the irradiated site, as monitored by expression of a fluorescent PAR binding reporter, PBZ-mRuby2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). The magnitude of talazoparib resistance in the BR8 mutant clone was similar to that seen in <italic>Parp1</italic> mutants that showed complete loss of Parp1 protein expression, such as BR13, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). The BR8 clone also exhibited resistance to olaparib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C;0.0001, ANOVA), suggesting a drug class effect. Taken together, these observations suggested that loss of Parp1 DNA binding and activity caused by mutations in the zinc finger domain of the protein can drive PARPi resistance.</p>

<title>A focused CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis &#x201C;tag, mutate and enrich&#x201D; screen identifies PARP1 mutations outside the DNA binding domain that cause PARP inhibitor resistance</title>
<p>Our CRISPR screens highlighted a key feature of CRISPR mutagenesis &#x2013; the ability to cause and easily identify subtle mutations as well as null mutations, such as the p.43delM mutation in the BR8 clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). To study such mutations in more detail and to identify which regions of PARP1 are required for PARPi cytotoxicity, we designed an experimental approach to directly select PARPi-resistant cells with CRISPR-Cas9 induced mutations that preserved the native PARP1 reading frame (e.g. missense and in-frame indel mutations, rather than truncated, non-full length mutants). This approach, which we term, &#x201C;tag, mutate and enrich&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), used HeLa cells with a BAC transgene containing <italic>PARP1</italic> gene fused to GFP coding sequence (encoding a PARP1 protein with a C-terminal GFP fusion). The GFP tag allowed us to enrich for cells with in-frame PARP1 protein expression by FACS isolating the GFP positive fraction. <italic>PARP1-GFP</italic>&#x002B;ve cells were mutated with a focused sgRNA library of 29 guide RNAs targeting <italic>PARP1</italic> (Supplementary Table 1); PARPi resistant cells were then selected via talazoparib exposure and the GFP-positive fraction isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The sgRNA library was introduced as six different lentiviral pools, grouped by RT-PCR product later used for genotyping. These products were amplified from GFP cDNA and sequenced using the Ion Torrent PGM platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). For all but one sgRNA pool we saw a significant enrichment in in-frame mutations in <italic>PARP1</italic> in the PARPi resistant population (compared to a null hypothesis of 1/3 in-frame mutations; Pools 1, 2, 4, 5, 6: p &#x003C; 10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>, binomial test with alternative hypothesis p(success) &#x003E; 1/3, 95&#x0025; CI 0.62-1.00. Pool 3, 95&#x0025; CI 0.24-1.00, p &#x003D; 1; Supplementary Figure 1a). By translating and aligning in-frame reads from PGM sequencing, we identified key PARP1 amino acid residues associated with resistance. For example, we identified multiple alleles in the PARPi resistant population with deletion of nucleotides encoding amino acid residues K119 and S120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), which are both DNA-contacting residues within the second zinc finger domain of PARP1 (reference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>). Our subsequent microirradiation assay analysis demonstrated that a p.119_120delKS mutation abolished PARP1-GFP recruitment to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), suggesting that mutations in residues K119 and S120 might cause PARPi resistance by altering PARP1 DNA binding properties.</p>

In total, six different lentiviral pools were used; each sgRNA pool targeted a different region of <italic>PARP1</italic> as shown in (a). <italic>PARP1</italic> mutant cells were selected from this population by exposing cells to talazoparib.

<p>The focused sgRNA screen also identified three <italic>PARP1</italic> mutations in residues not known to be directly involved in DNA binding: p.329N&#x003E;Q (N329Q), p.742-743HD&#x003E;F (HD742F) and p.848delY (848delY, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). N329 sits within the third zinc finger of PARP1, but is not predicted to form part of the DNA binding interface. HD742F is located within the helical domain (HD), a regulatory region shown to be important for PARP activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Y848 is part of a solvent-exposed helix of the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). In cell-free assays using recombinant PARP1 proteins, we found the talazoparib IC<sub>50</sub> to be similar for mutant and wild type PARP1 proteins (Supplementary Figure 1b, c), suggesting that the PARPi resistance phenotypes were not caused by differences in the ability of PARPi to inhibit the catalytic activity of mutant proteins. PARP1 trapping assays in CAL51-<italic>PARP1</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> cells transfected with mutant or wild type (WT) PARP1-GFP cDNA expression constructs suggested that N329Q and HD742F mutant proteins were not trapped by PARPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), explaining the PARPi resistant phenotypes associated with these mutations. In contrast, PARP1-848delY-GFP was trapped in the chromatin fraction by talazoparib, but to a lesser extent than WT-PARP1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Laser microirradiation assays confirmed this partial PARP1 trapping phenotype with the PARP1-848delY-GFP protein; whilst WT-PARP1-GFP was rapidly recruited to the site of microirradiation (peak &#x2248; 4s) and induced PAR formation in a similar time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), the extent of PARP1-848delY-GFP recruitment to the site of microirradiation was reduced, as was PARylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). As a negative control, PARP1-N329Q-GFP exhibited limited recruitment to damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). The addition of talazoparib delayed PARP1-848delY-GFP dissociation from microirradiated sites, but to a lesser extent than for WT-PARP1-GFP (Supplementary Figure 1d, p &#x003D; 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>, t-test). PARP1-848delY-GFP also dissociated faster from microirradiated sites, being absent from microirradiated regions 30 minutes after microirradiation; WT PARP1-GFP still showed 40&#x0025; of maximal trapping at this timepoint (Supplementary Figure 1e, p &#x003D; 5.5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, t-test). These data therefore suggested that even the relatively subtle defect in trapping in the 848delY mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e, f</xref>) might be sufficient to cause PARPi resistance.</p>
<p>We mapped the residues affected by the mutations that we observed onto a previously described crystal structure of PARP1 zinc finger domains 1 and 2 together with the WGR, regulatory and catalytic domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. We found that several of the PARPi resistance-causing mutations (D45, H742, D743, E688) affected amino acid residues involved in hydrogen bonding interactions that bridge the DNA binding domain and the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), suggesting that these might control inter-domain interactions that mediate PARP1 trapping; similar inter-domain domain interactions link DNA binding to activation of PARP1 catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Taken together, these data established that mutations outside of the DNA binding domain can cause PARPi resistance, likely by impairing PARP1 trapping.</p>

<title><italic>PARP1</italic> mutations cause PARPi resistance in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant tumour cells with mutations in exon 11</title>
<p>We assessed whether <italic>PARP1</italic> mutations could cause PARPi resistance in a clinically relevant setting, such as in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant tumour cells. Complete loss of both <italic>PARP1</italic> and <italic>BRCA1</italic> is expected to be synthetic lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that many pathogenic <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations may not result in complete loss of function. For example, SUM149 (also known as SUM149PT) triple negative breast tumour cells possess a commonly-occurring hypomorphic <italic>BRCA1</italic> exon 11 c.2288delT frameshift mutation and loss of the wild type <italic>BRCA1</italic> allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. As a consequence, SUM149 cells do not express the full length BRCA1 p220 protein, but do express a hypomorphic splice isoform of BRCA1, &#x0394;11b, which excludes the c.2288delT premature truncating mutation (along with most of the exon 11 coding sequence), but has some residual function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We and others have previously confirmed that the <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation in SUM149 cells causes sensitivity to PARPi by demonstrating that genetic reversion of the <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation in SUM149 cells via CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis imparts PARPi resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We carried out a genome wide PARPi resistance CRISPR-Cas9 screen in SUM149 cells, using a previously validated sgRNA library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, similar to our earlier screen in mouse ES cells. Out of 12 talazoparib-resistant clones analysed, eight possessed one of three PARP1 sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that talazoparib cytotoxicity is mediated by PARP1 even in this <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant cell line. To confirm this observation, we infected Cas9-expressing SUM149 cells with a lentiviral sgRNA vector targeting the <italic>PARP1</italic> coding sequence homologous to the p.43/44 mutation site in the PARPi resistant mouse ES cell BR8 clone we identified earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This sgRNA induced talazoparib resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We subcloned two daughter clones from the PARPi-resistant SUM149 population, TR1 and TR2; TR1 had four different <italic>PARP1</italic> frameshift mutations and lacked PARP1 protein expression, whilst TR2 expressed apparently full length PARP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Both clones remained talazoparib-resistant after culture in the absence of PARPi, demonstrating that this was a stably-acquired phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, ANOVA p &#x003C; 0.0001). TR2 possessed three different frameshift PARP1 mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) but also a p.43_45delMFD in-frame deletion, similar to the p.43/44 mutations identified in PARPi resistant BR8 mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). No <italic>PARP1</italic> wild type DNA sequencing reads were identified in either TR1 or TR2. The allele frequencies of the <italic>PARP1</italic> mutations in TR1 and TR2 suggested that there were five copies of the <italic>PARP1</italic> locus in SUM149 cells, confirmed by SNP genotyping of SUM149 (A. Grigoriadis, personal communication). We did not find evidence for other known mechanisms of PARPi resistance in TR1 and TR2 such as reversion of full-length BRCA1 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figure 2a), 53BP1 or REV7 (MAD2L2) loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figure 2b, c), or an increase in DNA damage-induced nuclear RAD51 foci (Supplementary Figure 2d). This suggested that PARP1 mutation or loss could not only be tolerated in SUM149 cells but also caused PARPi resistance.</p>

<p>We went on to show that <italic>PARP1</italic> sgRNA also caused PARPi resistance in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant COV362 ovarian tumour cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<italic>BRCA1</italic> c.2611fs [exon 11] and c.4095&#x002B;1G&#x003E;T [exon 11 splice donor]), suggesting that these observations were not private to SUM149 cells. COV362 cells were infected with six different pools of lentiviral <italic>PARP1</italic> sgRNAs as used in the HeLa screen above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and selected in talazoparib. We found profound talazoparib resistance in all lentivirally-infected sgRNA-infected populations, except those infected with <italic>PARP1</italic> sgRNA pool six, where resistance was less pronounced, although still significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>; p &#x003C; 0.0001 in each case, ANOVA compared to parental COV362-Cas9 cells). We also isolated a number of daughter clones from the PARPi resistant COV362 populations. Some of these clones had lost PARP1 expression while others had point mutations in PARP1, including a clone with a p.119delKS mutation and three independently derived clones all with p.848delY/p.848_849delYK compound mutations (referred to as p.848delY/YK, Supplementary Figure 2e, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). All clones with <italic>PARP1</italic> mutations remained resistant to talazoparib after culture without PARPi selection during subcloning and expansion (Supplementary Figure 2f, g). Interestingly, COV362 clones isolated with Y848 mutations at the endogenous <italic>PARP1</italic> locus (p.848delY/delYK) showed a less pronounced resistance phenotype compared to complete null clones, although the extent of resistance was still significant compared to wild type cells (Supplementary Figure 2f, g, h). These clones also showed some residual PARylation activity in agreement with the microirradiation phenotype observed earlier (Supplementary Figure 2i, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), suggesting an intermediate level of PARPi resistance could be caused by an partial PARP1 trapping defect.</p>

<title>Residual <italic>BRCA1</italic> function supports <italic>PARP1</italic> mutations in tumour cells</title>
<p>We also attempted to isolate <italic>PARP1</italic> mutants from MDA-MB-436 cells, which have a <italic>BRCA1</italic> c.5396 &#x002B; 1G&#x003E;A mutation in the splice donor site of exon 20. This mutation results in a truncated BRCA1 protein lacking the BRCT region required for HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We were unable to isolate long-term talazoparib resistant cells from this cell line after transfection with PARP1 sgRNA expressing lentiviral pools. Analysis of cells grown in talazoparib for a short period showed that mutations were induced at the sgRNA target sites, but cells with PARP1 mutations did not survive in the long term (Supplementary Figure 2j, k). In contrast, sequencing of COV362 cells infected with the same PARP1 sgRNA pools revealed that several pools of talazoparib-resistant cells generated in the same way had mutagenized all <italic>PARP1</italic> alleles in all cells, indicated by very low or absent wild type reads (Supplementary Figure 2k). This suggested that mutation of all <italic>PARP1</italic> alleles was not tolerated in MDA-MB-436 cells, in contrast to SUM149 or COV362 cells.</p>
<p>We therefore considered it possible that the residual <italic>BRCA1</italic> function in SUM149 and COV362 might allow these cells to tolerate <italic>PARP1</italic> mutations. To address this, we inhibited the residual BRCA1 function in SUM149 and COV362 cells with siRNA targeting <italic>BRCA1</italic> target sites outside exon 11; doing the same in SUM149/COV362 <italic>PARP1</italic> mutants isolated earlier demonstrated that <italic>BRCA1</italic> siRNA had a more profound cell inhibitory effect in <italic>PARP1</italic> mutant COV362 and SUM149 cells, than in <italic>PARP1</italic> wild type parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e-g</xref>, p &#x003C; 0.05 for all cases compared to parental cells, t-test). This suggested that some residual BRCA1 function might exist in these cells and is required for cell survival in the face of <italic>PARP1</italic> mutation. <italic>BRCA2</italic> siRNA also selectively targeted <italic>PARP1</italic> mutant COV362 and SUM149 cells, suggesting some requirement for BRCA2 function in these cells despite the <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e-g</xref>, p &#x003C; 0.05, t-test). Taken together, these observations suggested that <italic>PARP1</italic> loss might be tolerated in COV362 and SUM149 cells due to some residual <italic>BRCA1</italic>-dependent function. Exon 11 frameshift mutations comprise approximately 30&#x0025; of pathogenic <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations identified to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and thus <italic>PARP1</italic> mutation and/or loss could be a clinically relevant mechanism of PARPi resistance in this specific context.</p>

<title>A high-density tiling CRISPR-Cas9 screen enables functional annotation of a <italic>PARP1</italic> mutation observed in an olaparib-resistant patient</title>
<p>To investigate which functions of PARP1 were important for cytotoxicity of talazoparib in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant cells, we designed a new tiling CRISPR library, comprising 489 guides, designed to give the densest possible coverage of PARP1 mutations (Supplementary Table 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and carried out a tiling screen in SUM149 cells in which the endogenous PARP1 locus had been tagged with a C-terminal GFP coding sequence using the CRISPaint system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. This screen further illuminated the roles of different areas of PARP1 in PARPi toxicity. In agreement with our previous results, a large number of mutations were isolated which affected residues associated with either direct DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b, c</xref>; Supplementary Table 5) or the interfaces between zinc finger domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). We also observed a high density of mutations affecting the WGR domain associated with PARPi resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b, e</xref>). Based on our previous screen, we hypothesized that points of contact of the WGR domain with the zinc finger and HD (regulatory) domains might be important for PARPi-resistance and PARP1 function and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>); in this new screen we identified several mutation clusters at these points of contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b, e</xref>; Supplementary Figure 3a) supporting this hypothesis. Although we identified few mutations in the catalytic domain that caused PARPi resistance &#x2013; perhaps because mutations directly disrupting the catalytic activity would cause constitutive trapping and cytotoxicity &#x2013; the most frequent mutation isolated in the screen affected residue A925, which is juxtaposed with residue Y848 in the three-dimensional structure of PARP1, further suggesting an important role for this region of the catalytic domain in PARPi cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, inset 2). The relative lack of mutations in the BRCT domain, despite ample sequencing and sgRNA coverage in this area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and Supplementary Figure 3b) might indicate that this region is dispensable for PARPi cytotoxicity and trapping.</p>

<p>To investigate how resistance via loss of PARP1 compares to previously-described PARPi resistance mechanisms in a <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant context, we used CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to generate SUM149 daughter clones with other previously-identified mechanisms of cellular PARPi resistance, namely reversion mutation in <italic>BRCA1</italic> or deleterious mutations in either <italic>T53BP1</italic> or REV7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). SUM149 cells with <italic>PARP1</italic> mutations exhibited a comparable if not greater, level of PARPi resistance than these previously identified mechanisms of resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b, c</xref>; p &#x003C; 0.0001, ANOVA compared to parental cells for all mutants). We compared these models of PARPi resistance to 37 additional breast tumour cell lines using a high throughput drug library screening approach. <italic>PARP1</italic> mutant cells consistently showed the strongest PARPi resistance phenotype across the whole panel, assessed by area under dose-response curve (AUC), while the other resistance mechanisms had slightly lower AUC values similar to breast tumour cell lines without known homologous recombination defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref> and Supplementary Figure 4a, b)</p>

</fig>
<p>We assessed whether the particular mechanism of PARPi resistance influenced the sensitivity of these models to additional DNA damaging agents; this could have implications for how patients are treated subsequent to the emergence of PARPi resistance. We found that 53BP1 mutant clones had an intermediate level of resistance to cisplatin (p &#x003C; 0.0001, ANOVA), as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, as did clones with a <italic>BRCA1</italic> reversion, whilst PARP1 mutant cells retained the cisplatin sensitivity of parental SUM149 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). In contrast, <italic>REV7</italic> mutants were even more sensitive to cisplatin (p &#x003C; 0.0001, ANOVA) than all other SUM149 clones, a possible consequence of losing REV7&#x2019;s role in translesion synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Similarly, we noted that whilst a <italic>BRCA1</italic> reversion mutation caused resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors, this was not the case when SUM149 cells possessed PARP1 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, Supplementary Figure 4c, d). This suggested that drug sensitivities in PARPi resistant tumour cells might be predicated in part by the mechanism of PARPi resistance, with different mechanisms of resistance defining secondary vulnerabilities. This implies that understanding the mechanisms of PARPi resistance that emerge in each patient might be important in determining how each individual is subsequently treated.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A key observation that lead to the trapping hypothesis of PARPi cytotoxicity is that, in homologous recombination proficient cells, PARP1 itself is required for cytotoxicty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Our genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that point mutations in the zinc finger domains that abolish DNA binding were sufficient for this resistance, providing direct genetic evidence for the trapping hypothesis.</p>
<p>Our genetic screens also uncovered several clusters of mutations that suggest that regions of PARP1 outside the DNA binding domain can influence trapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4b</xref>), observations that are consistent with inter-domain interactions being critical for PARP1 binding and activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. These observations are also supported by an orthogonal approach using ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis screens in haploid cells (M. Herzog, S.P. Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>, personal communication). These observations add weight to the &#x201C;reverse allostery&#x201D; hypothesis proposed by Murai, Pommier <italic>et al,</italic> which suggests that PARPi binding to the catalytic domain of PARP1 allosterically influences interactions between DNA and the N-terminal DNA binding domains of the protein, to the extent that PARP1 becomes trapped on DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. It is possible that the PARP1 mutations we have identified here are in amino acid residues critical to this reverse allosteric process and therefore prevent allosteric enhancement of DNA binding upon inhibitor binding.</p>
<p>We also isolated a PARP1 mutant, p.848delY, which was associated with PARP inhibitor resistance despite exhibiting some residual PARP1 trapping. This reduced level of trapping might be sufficient to cause resistance &#x2013; the amount of trapped PARP1 required to induce cytotoxicity is not known. Nor is it known whether all trapping, as observed by chromatin fractionation assays in the presence of alkylating agents, is equal with respect to cytotoxicity &#x2013; PARP1 trapping at certain sites or lesion types may be more toxic than at others. Alternatively, it is possible that PARP1 trapping is not, in itself, sufficient for cytotoxicity and other factors altered by the mutations are also required. For example, the Y848 residue is part of a solvent exposed helix in PARP1 that may participate in protein-protein interactions &#x2013; for example with Timeless<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> &#x2013; that could be important for generating a DNA lesion that is cytotoxic. Mutations in another residue (A925) juxtaposed with Y848 in the PARP1 tertiary structure also led to PARPi resistance, possibly via a similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). It is possible that a larger trapped complex of PARP1 and interacting partner(s) is responsible for cytotoxicity, or that trapped PARP1<sup>848delY</sup> is altered in such a way as to not be cytotoxic. Nevertheless, the resistance phenotype of cells with mutations affecting Y848 at the endogenous <italic>PARP1</italic> locus is slightly less pronounced than a complete PARP1 knockout (Supplementary Figure 2h), supporting the hypothesis that the residual PARP1 trapping corresponds to some residual PARPi cytotoxicity. It will be interesting to study this region further to pinpoint the cause of the reduced cytotoxicity.</p>
<p>Our experiments also showed that <italic>PARP1</italic> mutation can be tolerated in certain <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant, PARPi sensitive tumour cells. This suggests that PARP1 trapping still underlies the increased cytotoxicity of PARPi in these tumour cells but that some residual BRCA1 function allows these cells to tolerate PARP1 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e-g</xref>), consistent with previous observations that some <italic>BRCA1</italic> exon 11 mutations do not result in complete loss of BRCA1 function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Since <italic>PARP1</italic>;<italic>BRCA1</italic> double mutant cells show distinct drug sensitivities compared to cells that become PARPi resistance via other mechanisms, knowledge of the mechanism of resistance in patients that relapse could inform the best subsequent treatment. Importantly, we also observed a <italic>PARP1</italic> mutation that abolished trapping (R591C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) in a patient with <italic>de novo</italic> resistance to olaparib, suggesting that such mutations can arise in patients and could potentially contribute to resistance. It also seems reasonable to think that PARPi resistance in some patients might display some level of heterogeneity, with multiple different PARPi subclones emerging with distinct mechanisms of resistance; recent advances in the genomic profiling of both solid and liquid biopsies derived from PARPi resistant patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> might potentially assess whether this is the case. Whether this turns out to be the case or not, our observation that PARPi resistant cells with different mechanisms of resistance display different chemotherapy sensitivities suggests that defining the molecular features of PARPi resistant disease biopsies might be important to determine the best course of subsequent treatment.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;tag, mutate and enrich&#x201D; approach we have used, where the tagging of genes with C-terminal GFP coding sequences (or other selectable genes) followed by the targeted mutagenesis of these genes via CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis, allows, in principle, full-length mutants of any gene of interest associated with a selectable phenotype to be identified. This could be employed in the analysis of other resistance mutations observed in patients being treated with targeted therapies in order to annotate likely drivers and passengers of resistance.</p>

Samples were loaded on a 5 ml HiTrap Heparin column (GE) and eluted with a linear salt gradient. PARP1-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated to 1 ml and injected on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 coulmn (GE) equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES-NaOH pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP. PARP1-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated and snap-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>PARylation assay</title>
<p>DNA dumbbell ligand (DB4) was prepared as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> PARylation reactions were carried out in a buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM DTT) containing 100 nM PARP1 protein and 1 &#x03BC;M DB4. The reaction was started by the addition of NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to a 225 &#x03BC;M final concentration (spiked with 5 &#x03BC;Ci/ml <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>P-NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) and incubation at 30&#x00B0;C. Aliquots were taken at various time points and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2x SDS-PAGE loading dye and heat denaturation. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE, dried and exposed on a phosphoimager plate (GE). Total radioactive intensity was quantified in the lanes between the well start and the position of PARP1.</p>

<title>Patient tumour sequencing</title>
<p>The <italic>PARP1</italic>:R591C mutation was identified in the archival tumour sample of a 69 year old patient (without a <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> germline mutation) with platinum-resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer enrolled in a phase I trial of olaparib and durvalumab (NCT02484404). A panel of cancer susceptibility and DNA repair genes (BROCA-HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>) was sequenced and the <italic>PARP1</italic>.R591C mutation (genomic: chr1:226,564,979G&#x003E;A) was identified at a variant allele frequency (VAF) of 0.33 (65/198 reads). This ovarian carcinoma also had a TP53 mutation (p.R196&#x002A;) with VAF of 0.72. The patient did not have a response to olaparib and durvalumab based on RECIST v1.1 criteria.</p>
