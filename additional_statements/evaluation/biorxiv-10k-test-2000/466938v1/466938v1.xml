<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The ability to overcome drug resistance in outbreaks of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> infection is an unmet need in health management. Here, we investigated <italic>CDC8</italic>, which encodes thymidylate kinase (TMPK), as a potential drug target for the treatment of <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. In this study, we found that the specific region spanning amino acids 106-123, namely, the Ca-loop of <italic>C. albicans</italic> TMPK (CaTMPK) contributes to the hyperactivity of this enzyme compared to the human enzyme (hTMPK) and to the utilization of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP)/ deoxy-5-Fluorouridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP) as a substrate. Notably, CaTMPK but not hTMPK enables dUTP/5-FdUTP-mediated DNA toxicity in yeast. CRISPR-mediated deletion of this Ca-loop in <italic>C. albicans</italic> demonstrated the critical role of this Ca-loop in fungal growth and susceptibility to 5-Fluorouridine (5-FUrd). Moreover, pathogenic and drug-resistant <italic>C. albicans</italic> clones were similarly sensitive to 5-FUrd. Thus, this study not only identified a target site for the development of CaTMPK-selective drugs but also revealed 5-FUrd to be a potential drug for the treatment of <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The emergence of drug-resistant <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains is a serious medical concern that may be addressed by targeting an essential fungal enzyme. <italic>CDC8</italic> encodes thymidylate kinase (TMPK), which is the key enzyme required for dTTP synthesis and is an essential gene for yeast growth. Therefore, the differences of TMPK between human and <italic>C. albicans</italic> can be a potential drug targeting site. This study defines a specific Ca-loop unique to CaTMPK from <italic>C. albicans</italic>, contributing to hyper-activity over human enzyme (hTMPK). CRSPR-edited deletion of this loop also suppressed the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Moreover, we present evidence that this loop enables dUMP utilization by CaTMPK, but not hTMPK. CaTMPK is also capable of using 5-FdUMP as a substrate, which contributes to 5-FUrd-mediated toxicity. Importantly, we found that many drug resistant pathogenic <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates from patients are sensitive to 5-FUrd, which has not been used as a drug against fungal infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a yeast species and is the most prevalent fungal pathogen in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. In general, <italic>C. albicans</italic> growing as budding yeast are tolerated by the host immune system. This fungus becomes pathogenic upon switching to hyphal growth in response to changes in environmental temperature and pH and nutrient limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Four classes of antifungal drugs have been developed to treat candidiasis: polyenes, azoles, 5-flucytosine (5-FC) and echinocandins. However, major challenges in candidiasis treatment are the acquisition of drug resistance. It has been suggested that drugs such as azoles generate stress in fungus to drive genome evolution, thus selecting gene mutation for developing drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. New therapeutic strategies are needed to overcome these obstacles for clinical treatment during infection outbreaks.</p>
<p>Biochemical differences between hosts and pathogens can be exploited to develop selective drugs that have cytotoxic effects on the pathogen but not the host. We targeted an essential enzyme in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, thereby selectively suppressing fungal growth and overcoming drug resistance. Thymidylate kinase (TMPK) is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of dTTP, catalyzing the conversion of thymidine monophosphate (dTMP) to thymidine diphosphate (dTDP), which is subsequently phosphorylated by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) to form thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. <italic>CDC8</italic>, which encodes TMPK, is an essential gene in yeast; budding yeasts carrying temperature-sensitive mutations in <italic>cdc8</italic> are not viable at nonpermissive temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, TMPK (CaTMPK) is also encoded by <italic>CDC8</italic>, but the essentiality of this gene has not been previously characterized. The main catalytic modules of TMPK include the LID region, P-loop, DR motif and elements involved in dTMP binding. The sequences of the P-loop, DR motif and TMP-binding elements are highly conserved among TMPK orthologs, while the sequences of the LID region that contribute to the closed conformation for catalysis are divergent. Given the key function of TMPK in dTTP synthesis and the sequence divergence between humans and pathogens, this study investigated the potential application of CaTMPK from <italic>C. albicans</italic> in antifungal drug development.</p>
<p>It has been shown that CaTMPK in complex with ADP and dTMP (PDB ID: 5UIV) at a resolution of 2.45 &#x00C5; has a unique surface-exposed loop (termed Ca-loop) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. However, the functional significance of the Ca-loop in CaTMPK and the molecular mechanism by which the Ca-loop affects catalysis remained unexplored. Here, our data suggest that the Ca-loop mediates hyperactivity of CaTMPK. CRISPR-mediated deletion of this Ca-loop markedly slowed the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, highlighting this region as a new target site for the design of fungi-specific inhibitors. In addition, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that CaTMPK is highly efficient at using deoxy-uridine monophosphate (dUMP) as substrates, provoking a possible role of dUTP in stress-induced genetic instability of fungi. Moreover, CaTMPK is also capable of utilizing deoxy-5-fluorouridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP) as the substrate, thus mediating 5-FUrd toxicity. Finally, we showed that 5-FUrd is useful for the treatment of infections caused by <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains that are resistant to 5-FC and azoles.</p>

<title>The biochemical differences between hTMPK and CaTMPK</title>
<p>Members of the TMPK enzyme family have been categorized into type I and type II enzymes. Both hTMPK and CaTMPK are type I enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The sequences in P-loop, TMP binding and DR sites in catalysis are highly conserved between CaTMPK and hTMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). The structure-based alignment (PDB: 5UIV and PDB:1E2D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] shows that the <italic>Candida</italic>-specific Ca-loop starts from Phe107 to Lys108. We have previously developed a series of hTMPK inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Here, we showed that two compounds, YMU1 and 3b, at 1 &#x03BC;M effectively suppressed hTMPK activity while at 10&#x03BC;M having no inhibitory activity to CaTMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). We compared the enzyme activities of CaTMPK and hTMPK. The kinetic parameters of CaTMPK and hTMPK are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The k<sub>cat</sub> of CaTMPK for dTMP was 15-fold higher than that of hTMPK, with similar <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values observed for ATP and dTMP. Thus, the catalytic efficiency of CaTMPK is much higher than that of hTMPK. Taken together, these results suggest that these two TMPKs exhibit distinct properties.</p>

<title>The Ca-loop confers hyperactivity on CaTMPK and determines the growth rate of <italic>C. albicans</italic></title>
<p>To verify the contribution of the Ca-loop to the catalytic rate of CaTMPK, we generated a Ca-loop-deleted mutant, &#x0394;107-118. Recombinant wild-type and &#x0394;107-118 CaTMPK proteins were purified for activity assays. The 107-118 deletion led to a 70&#x0025; reduction in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). Because CaTMPK lacking the Ca-loop exhibited decreased activity, we asked whether deletion of this Ca-loop would affect the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. CaTMPK is the gene product of <italic>CDC8</italic>. Therefore, we performed CRISPR-mediated deletion of the 319-354 region of the <italic>CDC8</italic> gene locus (<italic>cdc8&#x0394;107-118</italic>) in the nonpathogenic <italic>C. albicans HLC54</italic> strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The sgRNA targeting the Ca-loop sequence for Cas9 cleavage and the plasmid pGEX-2T-CaTMPK&#x0394;107-118 as the donor template were cotransformed, followed by selection with nourseothricin (Nat) (S1A and S1B Figs). The selected clone was analyzed by PCR amplification of the region spanning the Ca-loop sequence of the <italic>CDC8</italic> gene locus (S1C Fig.). Sanger sequencing further confirmed that the <italic>cdc8<sub>&#x0394;107-118</sub></italic> clone had a 36-bp in-frame deletion in the Ca-loop (S1D Fig.). We then compared the growth rates of <italic>HLC54</italic> and <italic>HLC54[cdc8<sub>&#x0394;107-118</sub>]</italic>. The results showed that <italic>HLC54[cdc8<sub>&#x0394;107-118</sub>]</italic> grew much slower than the parental strain <italic>HLC54</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). Taken together, these results show that the Ca-loop is a critical structural element of CaTMPK in the rate of dTDP formation, which is indeed controlling the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>

<title>The Ca-loop allows CaTMPK to use dUMP as a substrate</title>
<p>Given the unique structural feature of the dTMP/LID/Ca-loop of CaTMPK, we further asked whether there is a difference in substrate selectivity between hTMPK and CaTMPK. Here, we performed an isotope-labeling-based &#x03B3;-phosphate transfer assay to analyze the capacity of purified CaTMPK and hTMPK to phosphorylate different dNMPs. As expected, both enzymes were capable of phosphorylating dTMP to dTDP, and dAMP, dGMP and dCMP were not used as substrates by these enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>). However, there was a striking difference in the capability of CaTMPK to transfer &#x03B3;-<sup>32</sup>P-phosphate from ATP to dUMPs, so as 5-FdUMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>). Analysis of the steady-state kinetics revealed a large difference in the rate of dUMP phosphorylation between hTMPK and CaTMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>). The k<sub>cat</sub> of CaTMPK for dUMP was 6-fold higher than that for dTMP, but the catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic>) of CaTMPK for dTMP remained higher than that for dUMP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>). This finding indicates that CaTMPK normally prefers dTMP as a substrate. However, when the dUMP/dTMP ratio increases, CaTMPK exhibits increased dUDP production. Next, we asked whether the Ca-loop is involved in the utilization of dUMP as a substrate. Similar to the results of the dTMP-based assay, the &#x0394;107-118 was defective in dUMP utilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3D</xref>), indicating that the Ca-loop determines the utilization of dUMP as a substrate in the enzymatic reaction.</p>

Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to separate the reaction products of hTMPK and CaTMPK.

<title>Distinct dUTP/5-FdUTP-meditated DNA toxicity in CaTMPK- and hTMPK-expressing <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title>
<p>Thymidylate synthase (TS) is the enzyme responsible for converting dUMP to dTMP. Upon uptake, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorouridine (5-FUrd) are metabolically converted to 5-FUMP and 5-FdUMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], the latter of which is a suicide inhibitor of TS. Therefore, treatment with 5-FU or 5-FUrd leads to dUMP accumulation. A previous study has shown that 5-FU-induced death in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is reversed by deletion of uracil-DNA-glycosylase (<italic>UNG1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. This finding suggests that 5-FU treatment causes misincorporation of dUTP, the removal of which by Ung1 leads to DNA toxicity and cell death. Because CaTMPK is hyperactive in the conversion of dUMP to dUDP, we then asked whether CaTMPK and hTMPK can mediate the differential toxicity of 5-FU and 5-FUrd in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. <italic>RWY-42-22B</italic>, harboring a temperature-sensitive mutation of <italic>cdc8<sup>ts</sup></italic>, is an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain that can grow at 23&#x00B0;C normally but is not viable at 30&#x00B0;C. The growth of this strain at nonpermissive temperatures was rescued by expression of hTMPK or CaTMPK without a significant difference in growth rate (S2 Fig.). To avoid complications associated with endogenous <italic>cdc8<sup>ts</sup></italic>, two strains expressing hTMPK or CaTMPK were further engineered by replacement of <italic>cdc8<sup>ts</sup></italic> with <italic>HIS3</italic>. We tested the sensitivity of these two strains to 5-FU. Interestingly, the growth of yeast expressing CaTMPK was obviously suppressed along a gradient increase in 5-FU concentration (0-2.5 &#x03BC;M) in agar plates; in contrast, only a slight response was observed in hTMPK-expressing yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). To determine whether 5-FU-induced death in the CaTMPK-expressing strain was associated with misincorporation of dUTP/5-FdUTP, <italic>ung1</italic> was deleted from this strain for the 5-FU sensitivity assay. The results showed that deletion of <italic>ung1</italic> allowed the CaTMPK strain to survive in 5-FU-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). Similar results were observed in 5-FUrd gradient (0-50 &#x03BC;M) agar plates. A high concentration of 5-FUrd was required for suppression of CaTMPK-expressing yeast growth, most likely due to the lower activity of uridine permease than uracil permease in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Nevertheless, <italic>ung1</italic> deletion abrogated the 5-FUrd response in CaTMPK-expressing yeast. In conclusion, expression of CaTMPK increases the susceptibility of yeast to 5-FU and 5-FUrd via dUTP/5-FdUTP-mediated DNA toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

CaTMPK mediates dUTP/5-FdUTP formation in yeast cells treated with 5-FU or 5-FUrd, leading to uracil misincorporation in DNA. Treatment with uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (Ung1) led to the generation of excess DNA breaks, resulting in toxicity.</p></caption>

<title>Sensitivity of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to 5-FUrd with other drugs</title>
<p>5-Flucytosine (5-FC) is an antifungal pyrimidine drug used for the treatment of <italic>Candida</italic> infection. Upon uptake, 5-FC is converted to 5-FU by cytosine deaminase in fungi. We compared the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU, 5-FC and 5-FUrd on <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth. The concentration of 5-FUrd that suppressed the growth of the <italic>HLC54</italic> strain was in the nM range, while that of 5-FC was in the &#x03BC;M range. Thus, the antifungal activity of 5-FUrd is more potent than that of 5-FC. Notably, <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth was unaffected by 50 &#x03BC;M 5-FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref>). The low 5-FU sensitivity of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is probably due to the poor uracil permease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>

<p>Given the contribution of the Ca-loop to the utilization of dUMP and 5-FdUMP as substrates of CaTMPK, we next investigated whether deletion of the Ca-loop could change the susceptibility of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to 5-FUrd. The 5-FUrd susceptibility was then compared in the <italic>HLC54</italic> and <italic>HLC54[cdc8<sub>&#x0394;107-118</sub>]</italic> strains. Consistent with the growth rate analysis performed in liquid culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>), the spot assay with serial dilutions on a control plate demonstrated that the growth rate of <italic>HLC54[cdc8<sub>&#x0394;107-118</sub>]</italic> was slower than that of <italic>HLC54</italic>. In contrast to the control plate, the presence of 100 nM 5-FUrd caused more pronounced growth suppression of the parental <italic>HLC54</italic> strain than of <italic>HLC54[cdc8<sub>&#x0394;107-118</sub>]</italic>. Because 5-FC is intracellularly metabolized to 5-FU, a similar difference was observed between these two strains on the plate containing 50 &#x03BC;M 5-FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>). Fluconazole and amphotericin B are antifungal drugs that target ergosterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The growth responses of <italic>HLC54</italic> and <italic>HLC54[cdc8<sub>&#x0394;107-118</sub>]</italic> to fluconazole were similar, whereas in the amphotericin plate, growth suppression of <italic>HLC54[cdc8<sub>&#x0394;107-118</sub>]</italic> was more pronounced than that of the parental strain.

<title>Different pathogenic <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates from patients are sensitive to 5-FUrd</title>
<p>5-FUrd has not been considered as a drug for the treatment of <italic>Candida</italic> infection, probably because a high dosage of 5-FU is required.

</table-wrap>
<p>We further tested the 5-FUrd sensitivity of a number of pathogenic <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates from patients. The MIC<sub>50</sub> of 5-FUrd was 0.03 &#x03BC;g/mL for the drug-susceptible isolate and was 0.01-0.08 &#x03BC;g/mL for five 5-FC-resistant isolates, designated non-wild-type strains. For azole-resistant isolates, 5-FUrd continued to efficiently inhibit growth in the range 0.02-0.07 &#x03BC;g/mL. Because 5-FC is intracellularly metabolized to 5-FU, we asked why the 5-FC-resistant isolates remained sensitive to 5-FUrd. Several mutations in 5-FC resistant strains were identified in the enzymes involved in the formation of 5-FUMP from 5-FC, including purine-cytosine permease (Fcy2), cytosine deaminase (Fca1) and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (Fur1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. These 5-FC-resistant but 5-FUrd-sensitive strains might have mutations in these genes. 5-FUrd is transported into <italic>C. albicans</italic> through uridine permease (Fui1) and is then phosphorylated to 5-FUMP by uridine kinase (Urk1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Presumably, activation of 5-FUrd metabolism by the Fui1 and Urk1 pathways can overcome the defects in genes mediating 5-FC activation, namely, Fcy2, Fca1 and Fur1, leading to toxicity, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>. One important effect of antifungal drugs is host liver toxicity. We then evaluated the potential toxicity of 5-FUrd in human HepG2 cells and found that the IC50 of 5-FUrd was 4 &#x03BC;g/mL (S3 Fig.). Taken together, these results suggest that 5-FUrd might be a suitable option for antifungal treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Members of the TMPK enzyme family have been categorized into type I and type II enzymes. Both hTMPK and CaTMPK are type I enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The in vitro analyses of this study highlight two major differences between of the purified hTMPK and CaTMPK. First, the catalytic efficiency of CaTMPK is 15&#x2013;fold higher than hTMPK. Second, CaTMPK is highly active in the conversion of dUMP to dUDP and 5-FdUMP to 5-FdUDP. Consistent with the data from biochemical analyses, we provide evidence that this Ca-loop-mediated hyperactivity determines the growth rate of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, suggesting the potential of targeting this site to control infection of this pathogen. Furthermore, the differences in the capacity to use dUMP and 5-FdUMP as substrates support the finding that CaTMPK, but not hTMPK, can mediate dUTP/5-FdUTP toxicity under 5-FU and 5-FUrd treatment in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Although 5-FU is not useful for the treatment of <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection probably due to the lack of transporter, we observed that nonpathogenic and pathogenic strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> are very sensitive to 5-FUrd. We propose that the utilization of dUMP and 5-FdUMP as substrates by CaTMPK increases the 5-FUrd susceptibility of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. In addition, our finding also open a new question whether the high activity of CaTMPK in dUMP utilization might participate in the mechanism of stress-induced genome evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] of <italic>C. albicans</italic> by uracil misincorporation in DNA, thereby facilitating the development of drug resistance.</p>
<p>CRISPR-mediated deletion was performed to generate a <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain lacking the Ca-loop of CaTMPK led to markedly reduced growth. This result indicated that the hyperactivity of CaTMPK in dTDP synthesis is an important factor affecting the growth rate of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Notably, in this study, we also used the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> expression system to evaluate differences between the effects of hTMPK and CaTMPK on growth and drug sensitivity. Despite the considerable differences in catalytic rates, the growth rates of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> expressing CaTMPK and hTMPK were very similar. This observation is consistent with a previous report that demonstrated that decreased thymidylate kinase activity did not affect the growth of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Apparently, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have different requirements for TMPK activity for growth maintenance. Notably, we observed a striking difference in 5-FU and 5-FUrd toxicity between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains expressing hTMPK or CaTMPK. Intracellular 5-FU is converted to 5-FdUMP, which is an inhibitor of TS, thereby blocking the synthesis of dTMP from dUMP, which in turn results in the accumulation of dUMP. Because dUMP is not a good substrate for hTMPK, cells expressing hTMPK would have less dUTP accumulation. In contrast, dUMP and 5-FdUMP are good substrates for CaTMPK, and dUDP formation by this enzyme might facilitate dUTP accumulation, to leading to misincorporation in DNA. Uracil is removed from DNA by the action of Ung1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], thereby generating DNA breaks. Excess uracil incorporation therefore leads to DNA toxicity. Given that deletion of <italic>ung1</italic> abolished 5-FU and 5-FUrd toxicity in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> expressing CaTMPK, it is very clear that high activity of CaTMPK in the utilization of dUMP and 5-FdUMP is responsible for DNA toxicity of 5-FU and 5-FUrd.</p>
<p>In this study, our data revealed 5-FUrd to be a potent drug for the treatment of <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. This proof-of-concept study showed that a number of <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates that were resistant to azoles or 5-FC were susceptible to 5-FUrd at a dose that had little toxicity in human hepatoma cells. We proposed that 5-FUrd could overcome 5-FC resistance in these strains because the metabolic activation pathways of 5-FUrd and 5-FC are different. Therefore, 5-FC resistance resulting from mutations in genes mediating the metabolic activation of 5-FC might not affect 5-FUrd toxicity. In summary, this report reveals the biochemical differences between the essential enzyme TMPK from <italic>C. albicans</italic> and host (human) TMPK due to the Ca-loop, highlighting this enzyme to be a new drug target site. Moreover, we found that 5-FUrd is indeed a potent inhibitor of <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth and that the Ca-loop is involved in 5-FUrd toxicity. Notably, 5-FUrd is able to overcome 5-FC and multidrug resistance in pathogenic <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates.</p>
