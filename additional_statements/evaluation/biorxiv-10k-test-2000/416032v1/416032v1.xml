<title>Summary</title>
<p>HIV-infected infants develop broadly neutralizing plasma responses with more rapid kinetics than adults, suggesting the ontogeny of infant responses could better inform a path to achievable vaccine targets. We developed computational methods to reconstruct the developmental lineage of BF520.1, the first example of a HIV-specific broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) from an infant. The BF520.1 inferred na&#x00EF;ve precursor binds HIV Env and a bnAb evolved within six months of infection and required only 3&#x0025; mutation. Mutagenesis and structural analyses revealed that for this infant bnAb, substitutions in the kappa chain were critical for activity, particularly in CDRL1. Overall, the developmental pathway of this infant antibody includes features distinct from adult antibodies, including several that may be amenable to better vaccine responses.</p>

<p>Considerable efforts are spent on defining evolutionary pathways of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in HIV-1 infection under the premise that these pathways will help guide effective immunization strategies<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Particular emphasis has been placed on bnAb epitopes that are common in different individuals<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, such as the V3-glycan region of HIV-1 envelope (Env)<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, and much progress has been made toward characterizing the development of V3-glycan bnAbs in adults<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. While the evolutionary pathway of adult bnAbs have been dissected to inform vaccine approaches<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, significant challenges remain to be addressed for inducing bnAb responses by vaccination. One such challenge is that most adult bnAbs take years to develop as a result of a complex interplay between viral escape and antibody maturation<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> that often leads to extensive somatic hypermutation (SHM), ranging from &#x223C;6-29&#x0025; (averaging &#x223C;18&#x0025;) for adult-derived V3-glycan bnAbs<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Additionally, the inferred germline precursors of a number of bnAbs lack detectable binding to recombinant HIV envelope and thus require the design of germline-targeting immunogens for vaccines<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, some bnAbs are limited by autoreactivity<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent studies reveal that infants and children develop bnAb responses at least as commonly, if not more frequently, than adults<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and that they do so rapidly, within 1-2 years post-infection<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. To begin to characterize these early infant cross-clade neutralizing antibody responses, we previously isolated antibodies from an infant with a rapid and broad plasma nAb response. One infant-derived bnAb, BF520.1, demonstrated cross-clade neutralization breadth and targets the V3-glycan region of HIV Env. In contrast to most adult-derived bnAbs, BF520.1 has limited SHM (VH=6.6&#x0025;, VK=5&#x0025; nt)<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The infant immune system has many unique features compared to adults<sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> but the differences between infant and adult antibody development is not known. Here we identify the na&#x00EF;ve antibody precursor of BF520.1, describe the subsequent evolution of this antibody lineage, and explore the structural basis for HIV binding for the first and currently only infant-derived HIV-specific bnAb that has been described.</p>

<title>Ontogeny of the infant-derived bnAb BF520.1</title>
<p>Infant BF520 was infected with a clade A HIV virus, detectable at 3.8 months of age, and a broadly-neutralizing V3 glycan-directed monoclonal antibody (mAb) BF520.1 was isolated one year post-infection (pi)<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> at 15 months of age. To infer the ontogeny of this bnAb, we performed next generation sequencing of the infant&#x2019;s B cell repertoire on an available post-infection sample from 6 months pi (9 months of age). We inferred the na&#x00EF;ve heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VK) ancestors of the BF520.1 mAb and identified all clonally-related sequences that descended from these ancestors (i.e. the clonal family of the bnAb) using the partis software package<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, which is more accurate than previous methods but has not been previously applied to deep sequencing bnAb inference.</p>
<p>To illustrate where BF520.1 falls within the context of its clonal family, maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were inferred for VH and VK clonal families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a,c</xref>). To reconstruct the most probable developmental routes taken by BF520.1 VH and VK sequences during the first six months of infection, we performed Bayesian phylogenetic and ancestral sequence inference analyses for each antibody chain. Importantly, this approach allowed us to rigorously estimate developmental route uncertainty because it accounts for phylogenetic uncertainty by considering many different phylogenies, which ML does not. We computationally validated that Bayesian lineage reconstruction correctly identified ancestral sequences for simulated antibody lineages with similar characteristics to that of BF520.1 97&#x0025; of the time for ancestral sequences with posterior probability &#x003E; 0.8, while dnaml and dnapars were less accurate (87&#x0025; and 89&#x0025;, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Therefore, inspired by Gong et al.&#x2019;s approach for reconstructing influenza evolution<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, we developed a software pipeline that uses Bayesian phylogenetics<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> to reconstruct BF520.1 VH and VK lineages while retaining relative confidences for internal node sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b,d</xref>).</p>
<p>Using two replicates of NGS data, we selected the most probable routes of development for the BF520.1 heavy and light chains based on Bayesian lineage inference between infection and 6 months pi. We synthesized chosen lineage intermediates for further study: VH intermediates 1-3 (Int1-3<sub>VH</sub>) and VK intermediates 1-4 (Int1-4<sub>VK</sub>). Selection of these lineages relied on considering the most confident transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1b,d</xref>; darkest blue arrows) from the na&#x00EF;ve sequence to the mature BF520.1 sequence in both NGS replicates. For the heavy chain, both replicates indicated that the G57D substitution occurred first and thus Int1<sub>VH</sub> included this change. The Y32N amino acid substitution occurred next in both replicates and was therefore incorporated in Int2<sub>VH</sub>. The M34I and F114L substitutions were inferred in one of the two replicates, but the order was unclear, so both were added to Int3<sub>VH</sub>. For the kappa chain, both replicates supported L78M as the first mutation, so this substitution was added to create Int1<sub>VK</sub>. However, there was less agreement between replicates on the chronological order of the substitutions that followed. Both agreed that two substitutions (S30A and S67F) occurred prior to two later substitutions (S28N and T53S), so these steps were incorporated as Int2<sub>VK</sub> and Int3<sub>VK</sub>. Finally, the A25T substitution was incorporated into Int4<sub>VK</sub> because one of the two replicates indicated that this was a possible late substitution. Using this approach, we reconstructed highly probable routes of heavy and light chain antibody development within the first 6 months of HIV infection.</p>

<title>Increasing heterologous neutralization by the maturing BF520.1 heavy chain lineage</title>
<p>Antibodies were tested for HIV neutralizing activity against a panel of heterologous viruses that were selected from both the virus panel used to describe infant plasma neutralization breadth<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and the standardized &#x201C;global panel&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> based on their ability to be neutralized by the mature BF520.1 antibody with an IC<sub>50</sub>&#x003C;20 &#x03BC;g ml<sup>-1</sup> <sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The inferred na&#x00EF;ve mAb derived by pairing the inferred na&#x00EF;ve VH and VK did not demonstrate neutralizing activity against any virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To identify the VH substitutions gained within the first 6 months pi that were important for neutralization breadth, the na&#x00EF;ve VH and Bayesian lineage intermediates (Int1-3<sub>VH</sub>) were paired with the mature VK and tested for HIV neutralizing activity. In contrast to the na&#x00EF;ve mAb, the na&#x00EF;ve VH paired with the mature VK (na&#x00EF;ve<sub>VH</sub>mature<sub>VK</sub>) demonstrated cross-clade tier 2 neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The Int1<sub>VH</sub>mature<sub>VK</sub> mAb had comparable activity to the na&#x00EF;ve<sub>VH</sub>mature<sub>VK</sub> mAb suggesting that the CDRH2 G57D substitution in this Int1<sub>VH</sub> did not confer increased neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Subsequent VH intermediates demonstrated increasing heterologous, cross-clade neutralizing activity with affinity maturation. Notably, a Y32N substitution in the CDRH1 conferred increased neutralization breadth for Int2<sub>VH</sub> and further cross-clade breadth and potency was observed in Int3<sub>VH</sub> with FR2 M34I and CDRH3 F114L substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the BF520.1 clonal family sequences were collected from a midpoint sample (M6 pi), these sequences only informed the first 6 months of BF520.1 antibody development. Thus, for mutations that occurred in between M6 and M12 pi, we rationally incorporated amino acid substitutions in order of precedence: CDR mutations, CDR-adjacent framework (FR) mutations, then non-conservative FR mutations (Int4-6<sub>VH</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>). With the addition of N52A in the CDRH2 of Int4<sub>VH</sub>, the antibody gained breadth and potency comparable to the mature mAb BF520.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies inferred intermediate sequences of antibody lineages from single ML and parsimony (Pars) phylogenies<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and thus did not consider relative confidence as we do with our Bayesian approach. Given this precedent, we compared our results using Bayesian methods against corresponding single ML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) and Pars phylogenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>) to infer BF520.1 intermediates. Interestingly, the VH intermediates inferred from the ML phylogeny included substitutions that were not found in either the na&#x00EF;ve or mature mAbs, indicating that they were likely erroneous. The Bayesian lineages also included substitution reversions, but these paths consistently had lower posterior probabilities than paths lacking these artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b,d</xref>). When present, these substitutions decreased neutralizing activity, which is apparent when comparing ML Int3<sub>VH</sub> and ML Int4<sub>VH</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). These findings suggest that the Bayesian antibody lineage determination that incorporated relative confidence over a number of possible lineage pathways prevented the inference of artifactual transient mutations in antibody intermediates. Regardless, our studies of the ML and Pars lineage intermediates led to similar conclusions about the importance of heavy chain substitutions: CDRH1 Y32N and CDRH2 N52A substitutions resulted in increased neutralization breadth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2a-d</xref>). The contribution of the Y32N CDRH1 substitution was particularly apparent when comparing Pars Int3<sub>VH</sub>, which lacks Y32N and Pars Int4<sub>VH</sub> (contains Y32N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2c,d</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these data demonstrate increasing heterologous neutralizing activity with affinity maturation and show that the heavy chain CDRH1 Y32N and CDHR2 N52A substitutions are important for the neutralization breadth of BF520.1.</p>

<title>Contribution of kappa light chain maturation to HIV binding and neutralization</title>
<p>Given the surprising finding that the na&#x00EF;ve VH paired with the mature VK (na&#x00EF;ve<sub>VH</sub>mature<sub>VK</sub>) demonstrated cross-clade tier 2 HIV neutralizing activity and the na&#x00EF;ve mAb did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>), we also examined the evolution of VK in relation to binding of HIV Env and neutralization breadth. The cross-paired mature and na&#x00EF;ve heavy and light chains (na&#x00EF;ve<sub>VH</sub>mature<sub>VK</sub> and mature<sub>VH</sub>na&#x00EF;ve<sub>VK</sub>) both bound the BG505 SOSIP trimer, which is an Env that is sensitive to BF520.1 neutralization. The na&#x00EF;ve<sub>VH</sub>mature<sub>VK</sub> mAb demonstrated stronger binding to the BG505.SOSIP.664 trimer (K<sub>D</sub>=&#x003C;0.001nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>) than the converse mature<sub>VH</sub>na&#x00EF;ve<sub>VK</sub> mAb (K<sub>D</sub>=8.95nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast to the heterologous neutralizing activity seen for the na&#x00EF;ve<sub>VH</sub>mature<sub>VK</sub> mAb, the mature<sub>VH</sub>na&#x00EF;ve<sub>VK</sub> mAb neutralized only tier 1A SF162 variant but not tier 2 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These data suggest that maturation in VK is necessary for BF520.1 heterologous neutralization breadth.</p>
<p>To identify which mutations in VK contributed to increased neutralizing activity, VK Bayesian lineage intermediates (Int1-4<sub>VK</sub>) and subsequent rationally-inferred intermediates (Int5-7<sub>VK</sub>) were paired with the mature VH and tested for cross-clade tier 2 neutralizing activity. Overall, VK lineage intermediates demonstrated increasing breadth with maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). A dramatic jump in neutralization breadth was demonstrated by Int2<sub>VK</sub>, which contains CDRL1 S30A and FR3 S67F substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). Although S67F was observed prior to the S30A substitution in the ML and Pars VK lineages, it did not increase neutralization breadth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Fig. 3a-d</xref>), suggesting that the S30A CDRL1 substitution alone enables the observed heterologous neutralization breadth. Further augmentation of potency and breadth was conferred by substitutions observed in Int3<sub>VK</sub> (CDRL1 S28N and CDRL2 T53S). The T53S substitution was observed prior to S28N in the ML VK lineage and it did not increase breadth but did confer a slight increase in potency. Int4<sub>VK</sub> (FR1 A25T) had a very modest increase in activity. Importantly, Int5<sub>VK</sub> (CDRL1 S31Y and CDRL2 G50E) neutralized all viruses that were neutralized by the mature antibody and Int6<sub>VK</sub> (FR2 L33F) reached potency comparable to BF520.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>).</p>
<p>While there are multiple mutations in and around CDRL1, the BF520.1 VK does not contain CDRL3 mutations, based on the inferred na&#x00EF;ve sequence. These data suggest that kappa chain mutations in and around the CDRL1 are important for BF520.1 heterologous neutralization breadth.</p>

<title>Cross-clade neutralization with limited SHM in paired intermediates</title>
<p>To define the minimal combination of changes in VH and VK that are needed for breadth, intermediates were paired together using percentage SHM to assign probable pairings. Tier 1A neutralizing activity was observed following just two amino acid substitutions in VH (Int2<sub>VH</sub>) and three in VK (Int2<sub>Vk</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) with the additions of the VH Y32N and VK S30A being important for the neutralizing activity. Cross-clade heterologous neutralization was achieved with the addition of the VH M34I and VK S28N in the Int3<sub>VH</sub>Int3<sub>Vk</sub> mAb, which had a total of four VH and five VK amino acid substitutions or 1.3&#x0025; and 1.8&#x0025; SHM at the nucleotide level in VH and VK, respectively. Int4<sub>VH</sub> paired with Int4<sub>VK</sub> neutralized the majority of the viruses (9/13; 69&#x0025;) that are neutralized by mature BF520.1 with only 1.8 VH and 2.1&#x0025; VK SHM. Further increased neutralization was conferred by single additional substitutions in both VH and VK: N52A (Int4<sub>VH</sub>) and A25T (Int4<sub>VK</sub>). The breadth of BF520.1 was reached with 1.8&#x0025; VH and 3.4&#x0025; VK SHM (2.5&#x0025; overall SHM) for Int4<sub>VH</sub>Int5<sub>VK</sub>. Finally, the Int5<sub>VH</sub>Int6<sub>VK</sub> mAb reached the breadth and potency of mature BF520.1 with only 2.4&#x0025; VH and 3.7&#x0025; VK SHM (3.0&#x0025; overall SHM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).

<title>Cryo-EM structure of the BG505.SOSIP.664 trimer in complex with BF520.1 Fab</title>
<p>Single particle cryo-electron microscopy was used to gain insight into the interaction of BF520.1 Fab and BG505.SOSIP.664 trimer, which is a clade A transmitted envelope variant from a Kenyan infant who was in the same cohort as BF520<sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. The resulting 4.8&#x00C5; map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) revealed features consistent with the resolution estimate including helices, beta-sheet structure as well as bulky densities for glycans that protrude from glycosylation sites, including N332 and N301, which are critical features for BF520.1 activity<sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>
<p>The positioning of the CDRH loops in our structural model indicates that they make multiple contacts with both protein and N-linked glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The CDRH1 loop is in close proximity to the base of the gp120 V3-loop, with N32 oriented towards the conserved GDIR sequence, consistent with increased neutralization observed when asparagine is introduced at position 32 on the CDRH1 loop (Y32N substitution). Adjacent residues of CDRH1 as well as the CDRH2 loop are located proximal to the N301 glycan. It is unclear if residue 52 (N52A substitution) in CDRH2 mediates direct contact between either the GDIR sequence or N301 glycan; however, it is plausible that substitution for alanine could influence loop positioning such that residues H54 and S55 would interact with the N301 glycan. The relative orientation of the CDRH3 loop suggests it may interact with the V3 GDIR sequence as well as the N332 glycan, though given variability in CDRH3 positioning between homology models, the contacts are less certain for this loop.</p>
<p>The structure of the Env trimer in complex with BF520.1 supports a role for the BF520.1 VK in neutralization through extensive contacts between the CDRL1 loop and the N332 glycan. Based upon the BF520.1 homology model, N28, A30, and Y31, which were implicated in nAb breadth, are positioned directly adjacent to the N332 glycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c</xref>), although we cannot unambiguously identify the position of specific residues. L33F and G50E mutations contributed to increased potency, but from the structure it is unclear whether these residues could directly contact the N332 glycan or protein surface<sup><xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>; they may instead alter local paratope structure in a more indirect fashion. The position of CDRL3 loop suggests it likely does not interact with the BG505 trimer or key glycans, which may explain why it does not contain mutations that contribute to BF520.1 breadth.</p>

<title>BF520.1 na&#x00EF;ve and lineage members bind HIV Env trimer</title>
<p>Though the inferred naive ancestor of BF520.1 did not demonstrate neutralizing activity, it weakly bound to BG505.SOSIP.664 trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a</xref>) and this binding was dependent on increasing mAb concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Qualitatively, we observed increased binding with affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a</xref>) with the most significant increase in binding demonstrated by Int2<sub>VH</sub> Int2<sub>VK</sub> and more subtle increases by later intermediates. Mutations acquired by Int4<sub>VH</sub>4<sub>VK</sub> enabled similar binding to Env as the mature BF520.1. Despite clear binding to the BG505 SOSIP trimer by Int2<sub>VH</sub>2<sub>VK</sub>, Int3<sub>VH</sub>3<sub>VK</sub>, and Int3<sub>VH</sub>4<sub>VK</sub>, these intermediates were not able to neutralize the BG505 pseudovirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> and 6a). These data indicate that the BF520.1 na&#x00EF;ve mAb had the potential to recognize HIV Env.</p>
<p>Our approach to inferring the na&#x00EF;ve ancestor using replicate sequence data differed from previous studies, which only used single replicates of NGS data<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. To compare the two methods, we also inferred the BF520.1 na&#x00EF;ve ancestor using just the first replicate of antibody sequence data. This approach resulted in uncertainty in the na&#x00EF;ve nucleotide sequences at three positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>) while there was not uncertainty using replicate datasets. When tested, none of the alternative inferred na&#x00EF;ve mAbs demonstrated neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>), nor did they bind trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>), which contrasts the ability of the more probable replicate-inferred na&#x00EF;ve mAb. We also found differences in the autoreactivity of the inferred na&#x00EF;ve mAbs: single dataset-inferred mAbs demonstrated weak autoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Supplementary Fig. 6e</xref>), whereas this was not observed for the more probable replicate-inferred na&#x00EF;ve mAb. These data demonstrate that uncertainty in the inference of bnAb precursors can result in significant differences in HIV Env binding and autoreactive properties.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The complex developmental pathways of bnAbs in HIV-infected adults have been carefully examined to guide immunogen design targeting key precursors in antibody evolutionary pathways<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In many cases, this approach is complicated by the observation that the inferred na&#x00EF;ve progenitor of the bnAb does not bind HIV Env, presenting challenges to stimulating the lineage<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Taking advantage of the rapid development of HIV bnAb responses in infants, here we discovered an evolutionary pathway that starts with a na&#x00EF;ve antibody that is capable of binding HIV Env trimer and requires as little as 3&#x0025; SHM to achieve the full cross clade breadth of this lineage. Remarkably, this antibody lineage relies on changes in both the heavy and light chains, mostly outside of the CDRH3, to develop HIV specificity and breadth. Thus, this antibody developmental pathway allows for two key aspects of vaccine design that were stumbling blocks for many adult bnAbs pathways: the HIV antigen can engage the na&#x00EF;ve B cell and a level of SHM that is easily within reach by vaccination<sup><xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>V3-glycan targeting bnAbs are of high interest because they are common and not restricted by certain germline genes<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. BF520.1 is of particular interest because it developed more rapidly than adult V3-bnAbs and achieved broad and potent capability with as little as 3.0&#x0025; SHM (2.4&#x0025; VH and 3.7&#x0025;VK SHM). Other known adult V3-glycan bnAbs required rare mutation events to occur<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and/or higher levels of SHM<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> compared to BF520.1<sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. The highly impactful N52A substitution in the BF520.1 heavy chain required one nucleotide mutation in an AID hotspot site and one mutation in a neutral site, but the improbability of these mutations was not a barrier to rapid bnAb development in this infant. This indicates that vaccines may be able to stimulate similar mutations in reasonable timeframes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, mutations important for increasing BF520.1 functional activity were primarily found in the heavy chain CDRH2 and light chain CDRL1, with little-to-no contribution from the CDRH3 and CDRL3. The Cryo-EM structural model indicated that CDRH2 and CDRL1 residues appear to contribute to the BF520.1 paratope by mediating contacts with the conserved V3-glycan site, namely the archetypal features of V3-targeting bnAbs: GDIR sequence and glycans at position 301 and 332<sup><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. In contrast to the position of CDRL3, located too distant to make meaningful contacts with the trimer, the structure suggests that CDRH3 may interact with both the V3 GDIR sequence and N332 glycan; however, the lack of substitutions in the loop during SHM suggests a likely minor role for CDRH3 in BF520.1&#x2019;s maturation. This contrasts many HIV bnAbs where major determinants of breadth reside in the CDR3 regions, particularly in VH<sup><xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We identified that maturation in the BF520.1 VK was particularly important for HIV Env binding and neutralization, demonstrated by the increased heterologous breadth observed when the mature VK was paired with the na&#x00EF;ve VH and the five amino acid substitutions in and around CDRL1 that contribute to neutralization breadth. The structural findings support this critical role for variable light chain development in the potent and broad neutralization capacity of BF520.1. With few exceptions<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, functional studies have largely focused on the contribution of VH to heterologous neutralizing activity<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> despite previous structural studies showing that adult-derived V3-glycan bnAb light chains contact the N332 glycan and conserved GDIR motif<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of considering both the heavy and light chain in the development of HIV-specific bnAbs and the fact that the light chain can potentially be harnessed to develop vaccine approaches that elicit such bnAbs with relatively little SHM.</p>
<p>While we see neutralization of heterologous Env variants by the early BF520.1 lineage intermediates, autologous neutralization is observed only with later stage intermediates (Int4<sub>VH</sub>Int4<sub>VK</sub> and beyond) against BF520 autologous Env variants isolated at &#x223C;2 months pi. While CDRH2 and CDRL1 mutations are important for heterologous breadth, autologous neutralization was conferred by additional kappa chain mutations in and around the CDRL1. The observation that the earlier intermediates are HIV-specific but do not neutralize the autologous virus suggests that the virus at &#x223C;2 months pi may have escaped neutralization by the early lineage. We do not know whether the na&#x00EF;ve or early lineage mAbs were able to bind autologous viruses at the time of infection or at &#x223C;2 months pi. The BF520.1 na&#x00EF;ve mAb and early lineage intermediates do, however, bind the heterologous clade A BG505.SOSIP.664 trimer.</p>
<p>This binding of the na&#x00EF;ve ancestor of BF520.1 to recombinant HIV Env contrasts with many adult bnAb precursors<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, including some V3-glycan bnAbs<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The affinity of the BF520.1 na&#x00EF;ve mAb for the Env trimer is within the range of affinities observed for VRC01 class na&#x00EF;ve precursors binding to a monovalent germline-targeting antigen<sup><xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. This study raises the possibility that an immunization strategy to elicit a BF520.1-like response could use the BG505.SOSIP.664 or an optimized target to initiate the response and then could be boosted with BF520 Env trimer from &#x223C;2 months pi to drive affinity maturation.</p>
<p>To identify appropriate vaccine immunogens that might stimulate bnAb precursors, it is critical that inferred bnAb precursor heavy and light chain sequences are as accurate as possible. Importantly, accurate na&#x00EF;ve inference enables more accurate phylogenetic inference of intermediate sequences. By using replicate NGS data, we resolved uncertainties in the inferred na&#x00EF;ve sequences that impacted the overall characterization of our antibody lineage. We are confident in our BF520.1 na&#x00EF;ve inference for three reasons: 1) we used the entire clonal family to infer the na&#x00EF;ve sequence along with more accurate clonal family clustering, which together increase confidence especially within the CDR3<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, 2) we used per-sample germline inference<sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, which mitigates gene assignment errors and expands our ability to accurately infer antibody ontogenies in non-European subjects whose antibody gene usage patterns are less well documented, and 3) BF520.1 had very low SHM compared to other bnAbs, which alleviated the difficulty of na&#x00EF;ve inference due to a reduced expected number of incorrect bases. Notably, our most probable replicate-inferred na&#x00EF;ve mAb measurably bound HIV and did not demonstrate autoreactivity. Conversely, the single-dataset inferred na&#x00EF;ve mAbs that contained uncertainties displayed autoreactivity, which is misleading because this is indeed a feature of many adult bnAbs<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and some V3-glycan bnAbs<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. These discrepancies highlight the potential imprecision of na&#x00EF;ve antibody inference due to insufficient quality or depth of sequencing data and suggest that our newer approaches designed specifically for antibody lineage analysis should be used.</p>
<p>The finding that infants develop broad and potent HIV bnAb responses has raised the question of whether HIV vaccine efforts should focus on infants<sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, pediatric immunizations for the prevention of viral infections is a practical strategy because infants and children have regular contact with the healthcare system. Understanding the ontogeny of HIV neutralizing antibody responses in the pediatric population is necessary to facilitate the rational design of such vaccine strategies. Given that the BF520.1 na&#x00EF;ve ancestor binds HIV Env, that very little SHM is required for this V3-directed antibody lineage to demonstrate heterologous cross-clade breadth, and that these antibodies lack unusual or rare features, the BF520.1 lineage should be considered an attractive template for vaccine design. These studies suggest that the setting of mother-to-child transmission or the infant immune system may be uniquely poised to develop bnAb responses rapidly.</p>

<title>Antibody lineage reconstruction</title>
<p>Initial phylogenetic trees of BF520.1 heavy and light chain clonal families were inferred using FastTree<sup><xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> and pared down to 100 sequences based on proximity to nodes within the &#x201C;seed lineage&#x201D; extending from the inferred na&#x00EF;ve ancestor (root) to the mature BF520.1 heavy or light sequence (prune.py, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.io/vA7wH">https://git.io/vA7wH</ext-link>). The prune.py program cycles along the path from seed to naive ancestor, adding closest sequences to that path until it achieves the target number of sequences. The 100 clonal sequences were then analyzed by BEAST<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. BEAST output was summarized for internal node sequences using the approach presented by Gong et al.<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In the resulting summary graphic, each red oval represents a unique inferred sequence, with color intensity proportional to the relative confidence that the true lineage included that intermediate. Arrows correspond to amino acid substitutions, with color intensity proportional to the relative confidence that this specific substitution occurred. The most probable BF520.1-IgG lineage paths were consistent between both technical replicates. For BF520.1-IgK, replicates agreed on probable lineage paths but each replicate offered higher resolution at a different part of the lineage (early mutations vs. later mutations). These data were combined to estimate the M0-M9 BF520.1-IgK lineage.</p>
<p>In addition to Bayesian lineage analysis, maximum likelihood (dnaml) and maximum parsimony (dnapars) phylogenetic trees were inferred from the list of 100 clonal sequences, including ancestral sequence reconstruction using PHYLIP tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/getme-new1.html">http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/getme-new1.html</ext-link>) (Felsenstein, J. 2017. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) version 3.696. <italic>Distributed by the author. Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle</italic>). Trees were rooted on the inferred na&#x00EF;ve sequence and we identified intermediate sequences that were found on lineage paths between na&#x00EF;ve to seed sequence. For dnaml and dnapars analyses, filtered IgK sequences were down sampled to 100,000 randomly-selected sequences prior to partis seed partitioning and FastTree trees were pared down using an earlier version of prune.py (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.io/vA7ww">https://git.io/vA7ww</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Validation of Bayesian lineage reconstruction</title>
<p>To computationally validate the performance of Bayesian ancestral sequence inference in antibody lineage reconstruction, we simulated 10 independent clonal families that had similar characteristics to the BF520.1 clonal family and performed Bayesian inference as described in this study on these simulated clonal families. Even though we exclusively used BEAST to perform Bayesian ancestral sequence inference on the BF520.1 clonal family, we additionally performed validation experiments using another popular Bayesian inference software package RevBayes<sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. RevBayes outputs trees that have unconstrained branch lengths, unlike BEAST, which outputs trees with fixed sampling time(s). Clonal family simulation was performed using the procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Davidsen and Matsen (2018)</xref><sup><xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. In short, this procedure approximates germinal center dynamics via nucleotide-context-sensitive mutation and amino-acid selection components and intermediate sampling times. We adjusted the simulation parameters such that the simulation produced clonal families similar to the BF520.1 family in terms of the distribution of root-to-tip distances. To do so, we computed the distribution of the median root-to-tip branch length distances from 10,000 independent RevBayes tree samples for all sequences in the BF520.1 family and matched this distribution with the corresponding distributions from our simulated clonal families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). The simulated &#x201C;seed&#x201D; sequence (meant to mimic a sequence of particular interest) was chosen to be the sequence farthest from the root naive sequence.</p>
<p>To assess the accuracy of BEAST and RevBayes in antibody lineage inference, reconstructed ancestral sequences (on the lineage from the naive sequence to the simulated &#x201C;seed&#x201D; sequence) were compared to sequences present on the known &#x201C;true&#x201D; lineage ancestral sequences in simulated phylogenies. We also ran dnaml and dnapars on these simulated families to compare accuracy between these four methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). For the Bayesian methods, the posterior probability of a sequence (which we call P(ASR) here for short) is calculated as the number of occurrences of that sequence divided by the number of posterior samples. Any true-lineage sequence that didn&#x2019;t appear in the posterior was assigned P(ASR)=0. For ML and parsimony, if a sequence was found in the reconstruction, P(ASR) was taken to be 1, and any true-lineage sequence not in the reconstruction got P(ASR)=0. We repeated simulation 10 times with the same parameters, chosen to mimic the BF520.1 clonal family as described above. The results were then collated across simulations to form a single accuracy table, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Thus, N is the total number of unique reconstructed and &#x201C;true&#x201D; lineage sequences across the simulations for a given method.</p>

Frame alignment and dose-weighting were completed using MotionCor2<sup><xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>, and CTF estimation was performed using CTFFIND4<sup><xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. Relion 2.1<sup><xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> was utilized for further processing and 3D refinement. Approximately 1,000 particles were manually selected and subjected to 2D classification to build templates for automated particle picking. A total of 559,022 particles was selected and binned to 8.8&#x00C5;/pixel for expeditious processing. The binned particle stack was subjected to 2D classification where 116,972 were selected for 3D refinement. This particle stack was re-extracted as a 4&#x00D7; binned stack (pixel size 2.2&#x00C5;/pix). Approximately 32,000 particles were chosen for 3D classification and a subset of &#x223C;9,000 particles was selected to build a low resolution 3D model, resulting in a 9.02&#x00C5; map. This model was low-pass filtered to 60&#x00C5; and refinement was performed on the full stack of 116,972 particles in Relion 2.1 with C3 symmetry imposed. Map sharpening and post processing in Relion yielded a 4.8&#x00C5; structure using the &#x201C;gold-standard&#x201D; FSC cutoff of 0.143.</p>

<p>The atomic model was generated by first fitting the BG505.SOSIP.664 trimer from the BG505:PGT128 cryo-EM structure (PDB ID: 5ACO)<sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, with glycans temporarily removed, into the generated 4.8&#x00C5; map using the fitmap command in UCSF Chimera<sup><xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>. Overall, docking of the BG505 structure showed a good quality fit resulting in a correlation score of 0.8602. No further modification to the protein structure was performed. Both glycans at positions N332 and N301 were manually placed into their corresponding densities in the 4.8&#x00C5; map.</p>
<p>The BF520.1 variable heavy and light chains were submitted as a single polypeptide sequence to MUlti-Sources ThreadER (MUSTER) Online to predict the structure of BF520.1<sup><xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. The structure template used for structure determination was a single chain variant of anti-gp120 antibody, b12 (PDB ID:3JUY)<sup><xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. Using Chimera&#x2019;s fitmap command, the BG505.SOSIP.664 trimer and BF520.1 variable domain were sequentially docked into the 4.8&#x00C5; map.</p>
