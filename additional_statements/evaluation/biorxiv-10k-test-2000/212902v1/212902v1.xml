<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p>Cells adapt to shifts in their environment by remodeling transcription. Measuring changes in transcription at the genome scale is now routine, but defining the functional significance of individual genes within large gene expression datasets remains a major challenge. We applied a network-based algorithm to interrogate publicly available transcription data to predict genes that serve major functional roles in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> stress survival. This approach identified GsrN, a conserved small RNA that is directly controlled by the general stress sigma factor, &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>, and functions as a potent post-transcriptional regulator of survival under multiple stress conditions. GsrN expression is both necessary and sufficient to protect cells from hydrogen peroxide, where it functions by base pairing with the leader of <italic>katG</italic> mRNA and promoting catalase/peroxidase expression. We conclude that GsrN convenes a post-transcriptional layer of gene expression that serves a central functional role in stress physiology.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Organisms must control gene expression to maintain homeostasis. A common mode of gene regulation in bacteria involves activation of alternative sigma factors (&#x03C3;), which redirect RNA polymerase to transcribe genes required for adaptation to particular environmental conditions. Alphaproteobacteria utilize an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) &#x03C3; factor to initiate a gene expression program known as the general stress response (GSR) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The GSR activates transcription of dozens of genes, which mitigates the detrimental effects of environmental stressors and influences the infection biology of alphaproteobacterial pathogens (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fiebig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Francez-Charlot et al., 2015</xref>). The molecular mechanisms by which genes in the GSR regulon enable growth and survival across a chemically- and physically-distinct spectrum of conditions remain largely uncharacterized. Indeed, defining the functional role(s) of individual genes contained within complex environmental response regulons is a major challenge in microbial genomics.</p>

<p>In the alphaproteobacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, GSR mutant strains have survival defects under multiple conditions including hyperosmotic and hydrogen peroxide stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alvarez-Martinez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Foreman et al., 2012</xref>). However, the majority of genes regulated at the transcriptional level by the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> GSR sigma factor, &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>, have no annotated function or no clear role in stress physiology. Attributing stress mitigation function(s) to GSR-regulated genes is challenging, not only for <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, but for analogous bacterial stress response systems as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Battesti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hecker et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, studying stress responses from an exclusively transcriptional perspective may miss functionally important processes that are regulated at the post-transcriptional level, such as those controlled by small RNAs (sRNAs). Roles for sRNAs in bacterial stress response systems are well described (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wagner and Romby, 2015</xref>)), but remain unexplored in the alphaproteobacterial GSR.</p>
<p>sRNAs typically function as repressors, though the regulatory roles and mechanisms of action of these molecules are diverse: sRNAs can control gene expression by protein sequestration, modulation of mRNA stability, transcription termination, or promotion of translation (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wagner and Romby, 2015</xref>)). The system properties of environmental response networks are often influenced by sRNAs, which can affect the dynamics of gene expression via feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beisel and Storz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mank et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nitzan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shimoni et al., 2007</xref>) or buffer response systems against transcriptional noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arbel-Goren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Golding et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Levine and Hwa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mehta et al., 2008</xref>). However, the phenotypic consequences of deleting sRNA genes are typically subtle and uncovering phenotypes often requires cultivation under particular conditions. Thus, reverse genetic approaches to define functions of uncharacterized sRNAs have proven challenging.</p>
<p>We applied a rank-based network analysis approach to predict the most functionally significant genes in the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> GSR regulon. This analysis led to the prediction that a sRNA, which we name GsrN, is a major genetic determinant of growth and survival under stress. We validated this prediction, demonstrating that <italic>gsrN</italic> is under direct control of &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup> and functions as a potent post-transcriptional regulator of survival across distinct conditions including hydrogen peroxide stress and hyperosmotic shock. We developed a novel forward biochemical approach to identify direct molecular targets of GsrN and discovered that peroxide stress survival is mediated through an interaction between GsrN and the 5&#x2019; leader sequence of <italic>katG</italic>, which activates KatG catalase/peroxidase expression. This post-transcriptional connection between &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup> and <italic>katG</italic>, a major determinant of peroxide stress and stationary phase survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Italiani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Steinman et al., 1997</xref>), explains the peroxide sensitivity phenotype of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> strains lacking a GSR system.</p>
<p>Finally, we demonstrate that RNA processing and sRNA-mRNA target interactions shape the pool of functional GsrN in the cell, and that changes in GsrN expression enhance expression of some proteins while inhibiting others. The broad regulatory capabilities of GsrN are reflected in the fact that a <italic>gsrN</italic> deletion strain has survival defects across chemically- and physically-distinct stress conditions, and support a model in which the GSR initiates layered transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory responses to ensure environmental stress survival.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Iterative rank analysis of gene expression data identifies a small RNA regulator of stress survival</title>
<p>We applied a network-based analytical approach to interrogate published transcriptomic datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fang et al., 2013</xref>) and predict new functional genetic components of the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> GSR system. We organized expression data for over 4000 genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) to create a weighted network. In our basic network construction, each gene in the genome was represented as a node and each node was linked to every other node by a correlation coefficient that quantified the strength of co-expression across all datasets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Within this undirected graph, we aimed to uncover a GSR clique and thus more explicitly define the core functional components of the GSR regulon.</p>
<p>To identify uncharacterized genes that are strongly associated with the GSR, we utilized an iterative ranking approach related to the well-known PageRank algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998). We defined the &#x201C;input&#x201D; set as the experimentally-defined regulators of &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), optimized parameters through a systematic self-predictability algorithm and applied iterative ranking to compute a ranked list of genes with strong associations to the input set (see Materials and Methods) (Table S1). We narrowed our ranked list by performing a promoter motif search to predict direct targets of &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>. A gene encoding an sRNA with a consensus &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup> binding site in its promoter, <italic>ccna_R0081</italic> (Landt et al., 2008), was a top hit in our rank list. We hereafter refer to this gene as <italic>gsrN</italic> (<italic><underline>g</underline></italic>eneral <italic><underline>s</underline></italic>tress <italic><underline>r</underline></italic>esponse non-coding R<underline>N</underline>A).</p>
<p>To test whether <italic>gsrN</italic> transcription requires the GSR sigma factor, &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>, we generated a transcriptional reporter by fusing the <italic>gsrN</italic> promoter to <italic>lacZ</italic> (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>gsrN</italic></sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic>). Transcription from P<sub><italic>gsrN</italic></sub> required <italic>sigT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>), validating <italic>gsrN</italic> as a bona fide member of the GSR regulon. To determine whether <italic>gsrN</italic> is a feedback regulator of GSR transcription, we utilized a well-characterized P<sub><italic>sigU</italic></sub><italic>lacZ</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Foreman et al., 2012</xref>). Transcription from P<sub><italic>sigU</italic></sub> required <italic>sigT</italic> and other GSR regulators (<italic>phyR</italic>, <italic>phyK</italic>), but was unaffected by deletion or overexpression of <italic>gsrN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1D</xref>). We conclude <italic>gsrN</italic> is activated by &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>, but does not feedback to control GSR transcription.</p>
<p>We next tested whether <italic>gsrN</italic> plays a role in stress survival. We subjected strains lacking <italic>gsrN</italic> or the core GSR regulators, <italic>sigT</italic>, <italic>phyR</italic>, or <italic>phyK</italic>, to hydrogen peroxide, a known stress under which GSR regulatory mutants have a survival defect. &#x0394;<italic>sigT</italic>, &#x0394;<italic>phyR</italic>, and &#x0394;<italic>phyK</italic> strains had a &#x2248;4-log decrease in cell survival relative to wild type after exposure to hydrogen peroxide, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alvarez-Martinez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Foreman et al., 2012</xref>). Cells lacking <italic>gsrN</italic> (&#x0394;<italic>gsrN</italic>) had a &#x2248;3-log viability defect relative to wild type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref>). Insertion of <italic>gsrN</italic> with its native promoter at the ectopic <italic>vanA</italic> locus fully complemented the peroxide survival defect of &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref>). These data provide evidence that <italic>gsrN</italic> is a major genetic contributor to cell survival upon peroxide exposure. We identified 10 additional genes that are strongly regulated by &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup> and generated strains harboring single, in-frame deletions of these genes. The functions of these 10 genes are unknown: 6 encode conserved hypothetical proteins; 2 encode predicted outer membrane proteins; 1 encodes a cold shock protein, and one a ROS/MUCR transcription factor. None of these additional deletion strains were sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression of GsrN is sufficient for survival under peroxide stress</title>
<p>Results outlined above demonstrate that <italic>gsrN</italic> is necessary for hydrogen peroxide stress survival. To assess the effects of <italic>gsrN</italic> overexpression, we inserted constructs containing either one or three copies of <italic>gsrN</italic> under its native promoter into the <italic>vanA</italic> locus of wild-type and &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic> strains (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). We measured GsrN expression directly in these strains by Northern blot (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>) and tested their susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Treatment with increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide revealed that strains overexpressing <italic>gsrN</italic> have a survival advantage compared to wild type. Measured levels of GsrN in the cell directly correlated (<italic>r&#x003D;0.92</italic>) with cell survival, which provides evidence that the protective effect of <italic>gsrN</italic> under peroxide stress is dose dependent over the measured range (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To test sufficiency of <italic>gsrN</italic> to regulate cell survival under peroxide stress, we decoupled <italic>gsrN</italic> transcription from &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>. <italic>gsrN</italic> was constitutively expressed from promoters (P1 and P2) controlled by the primary sigma factor, RpoD, in a strain lacking <italic>sigT</italic> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). <italic>gsrN</italic> expression from P1 was 15&#x0025; higher, and expression from P2 50&#x0025; lower than <italic>gsrN</italic> expressed from its native &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>-dependent promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Expression of <italic>gsrN</italic> from P1, but not P2, rescued the &#x0394;<italic>sigT</italic> peroxide survival defect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We conclude that <italic>gsrN</italic> is the sole genetic determinant of hydrogen peroxide survival regulated downstream of &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup> under these conditions. Consistent with the dose dependent protection by GsrN, these data demonstrate that a threshold level of <italic>gsrN</italic> expression is required to protect the cell from hydrogen peroxide.</p>

<title>GsrN is processed and the 5&#x0027;end is necessary for survival under peroxide stress</title>

<p>The short isoform of <italic>gsrN</italic> could arise through two biological processes: alternative transcriptional termination or endonucleolytic processing of full-length GsrN. To test these two possibilities, we inhibited transcription with rifampicin, and monitored levels of both GsrN isoforms over time. Full-length GsrN decayed exponentially with a half-life of &#x007E;105 seconds (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C and S3D</xref>). The 5&#x2019; isoform increased in abundance for several minutes after treatment, concomitant with the decay of the full-length product. This observation is consistent with a model in which the 5&#x2019; isoform arises from the cleavage of the full-length product.</p>
<p>To identify potential endonucleolytic cleavage sites, we conducted primer extension assays. Extension from an oligo complementary to the 5&#x2019; portion of GsrN confirmed the annotated transcriptional start site (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>). Extension from the 3&#x2019; portion identified two internal 5&#x2019; ends (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3F and S3G</xref>). The positions of these internal 5&#x2019; ends are consistent with two small bands observed on Northern blots of high concentrations of total RNA hybridized with the 3&#x2019; probe (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). The terminus around C53 corresponds to a potential endonucleolytic cleavage site that would generate the abundant stable 5&#x2019; isoform (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">S3A</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the function of the 5&#x2019; portion of GsrN, we integrated a <italic>gsrN</italic> allele that contains only the first 58 nucleotides (&#x0394;59-106), and lacks the transcriptional terminator (<italic>gsrN</italic>&#x0394;3&#x2019;) into the <italic>vanA</italic> locus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This short <italic>gsrN</italic> allele complemented the &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic> peroxide survival defect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). The <italic>gsrN</italic>&#x0394;3&#x2019; allele produced a 5&#x2019; isoform that was comparable in size and concentration to the wild-type 5&#x2019; <italic>gsrN</italic> isoform. Since the transcriptional terminator of <italic>gsrN</italic> was removed, we also observed a run-on &#x007E;200nt transcript from <italic>gsrN</italic>&#x0394;3&#x2019; (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>The PP7hp aptamer inserted at <italic>gsrN</italic> nucleotide 37 (GsrN(37)::PP7hp) was selected as the bait to identify molecular partners that co-purify with GsrN. The pull-down fraction was compared to a negative control pull-down from cells expressing PP7hp fused to the last 50 nucleotides of GsrN including its intrinsic terminator (PP7hp::GsrN-3&#x2019;) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Northern blots demonstrated GsrN-PP7hp fusion transcripts were enriched in our purification (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Electrophoretic separation of the eluate followed by silver staining revealed no significant protein differences between GsrN(37)::PP7hp and the negative control (data not shown). We identified and quantified co-eluting RNAs by RNA-seq.</p>
<p>We employed two approaches to identify RNAs enriched in GsrN(37)::PP7hp fractions relative to the negative control fractions. A conventional RNA-seq pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tjaden, 2015</xref>) quantified mapped reads within annotated gene boundaries as a first pass (Table S2) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). To capture reads in non-coding and unannotated regions, and to analyze reads unevenly distributed across genes, we also developed a sliding window analysis approach. Specifically, we organized the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> genome into 25 base-pair windows and quantified mapped reads in each window using the EDGE-pro/DESeq pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Magoc et al., 2013</xref>). Together these two quantification strategies identified several mRNA, sRNAs, and untranslated regions enriched in the GsrN(37)::PP7hp pull-down fraction (Table S3) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We applied IntaRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mann et al., 2017</xref>) to identify potential binding sites between GsrN and the enriched co-purifying RNAs. Of the 72 analyzed enriched genes and regions, the majority of the predicted RNA-RNA interactions involved a cytosine-rich 5&#x2019; loop in the predicted secondary structure of GsrN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). A sequence logo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Crooks et al., 2004</xref>) of predicted target mRNA binding sites is enriched with guanosines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), consistent with a model in which 6 tandem cytosines in the 5&#x2019; loop of GsrN determine target mRNA recognition.</p>
<p>Transcripts enriched in the GsrN(37)::PP7hp fraction encode proteins involved in proteolysis during envelope stress, enzymes required for envelope biogenesis, cofactor and nucleotide anabolic enzymes, and transport proteins (Table S4). <italic>sigT</italic> and its anti-&#x03C3; factor, <italic>nepR</italic>, were also enriched in the GsrN(37)::PP7hp fraction, though we found no evidence for regulation of &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>/NepR by GsrN (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>). We observed significant enrichment of rRNA in the GsrN(37)::PP7hp fractions; the functional significance of this signal is not known (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). <italic>katG</italic>, which encodes the sole catalase-peroxidase in the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marks et al., 2010</xref>), was among the highly enriched mRNAs in our pull-down. Specifically, reads mapping to the first 60 nucleotides of <italic>katG</italic> including the 5&#x2019; leader sequence and the first several codons of the open reading frame were enriched in the GsrN(37)::PP7hp pull-down fraction relative to the negative control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). <italic>katG</italic> was an attractive GsrN target to interrogate the mechanism by which GsrN determines cell survival under hydrogen peroxide stress.</p>

<title>GsrN base pairs to the 5&#x2019; leader of <italic>katG</italic> and activates KatG expression</title>
<p>Most bacterial sRNAs regulate gene expression at the transcript and/or protein levels through Watson-Crick base pairing with the 5&#x2019;end of their mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wagner and Romby, 2015</xref>). We sought to test whether GsrN affected the expression of <italic>katG</italic>. GsrN did not effect <italic>katG</italic> transcription in exponential or stationary phases, or in the presence of peroxide as measured by a <italic>katG</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusion (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A, S5B, S5C</xref>). However, <italic>katG</italic> is transcriptionally regulated by the activator OxyR, which binds upstream of the predicted <italic>katG</italic> &#x2212;35 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Italiani et al., 2011</xref>). To decouple the effects of OxyR and GsrN on <italic>katG</italic> expression we generated a strict <italic>katG</italic> translational reporter that contains the mRNA leader of <italic>katG</italic> fused to <italic>lacZ</italic> (<italic>katG-lacZ</italic>) constitutively expressed from a &#x03C3;<sup>RpoD</sup>-dependent promoter. In both exponential and stationary phases, <italic>katG</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> activity is reduced in &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic> and enhanced in <italic>gsrN</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;&#x002B;</italic></sup> strains compared to wild type (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D and S5F</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide exposure did not affect <italic>katG</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> activity (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E</xref>). We conclude that GsrN enhances KatG protein expression, but not <italic>katG</italic> transcription.</p>
<p>We then used this translational reporter to investigate a predicted binding interaction between the unpaired 5&#x2019; loop of GsrN and a G-rich region at the extreme 5&#x2019; end of the <italic>katG</italic> transcript. Specifically, the first 7 nucleotides of <italic>katG</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>) are complementary to 7 nucleotides in the single-stranded 5&#x2019; loop of GsrN, including 4 of the 6 cytosines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We disrupted this predicted base pairing, mutating 5 of the 7 nucleotides in the putative <italic>katG</italic> target site and GsrN interaction loop. These mutations preserved the GC-content of the interaction, but reversed and swapped (RS) the interacting nucleotides (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). We predicted that pairs of wild-type and RS mutant transcripts would not interact, while base pairing interactions would be restored between RS mutant pairs.</p>

<p>As predicted, mutating the predicted target site in the <italic>katG</italic> 5&#x2019; leader sequence ablated GsrN-dependent regulation of the <italic>katG-lacZ</italic> translational reporter (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5G</xref>) and reduced activity similar to &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic>. We aimed to further test this interaction by assessing the effect of the reverse-swapped <italic>gsrN</italic>(RS) allele on expression of <italic>katG-lacZ</italic>. However, GsrN(RS) was unstable; total GsrN(RS) levels were &#x2248;10-fold lower than wild-type GsrN (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5H</xref>). To overcome GsrN(RS) instability, we inserted a plasmid with three tandem copies of <italic>gsrN</italic>(RS), 3<italic>gsrN</italic>(RS), into the <italic>vanA</italic> locus in a &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic> background, which increased steady-state levels of GsrN(RS) approximately 4-fold (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5H</xref>).</p>

<title>Target interactions influence GsrN stability <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Given differences in steady state levels of GsrN and GsrN(RS), we postulated that the capacity of GsrN to interact with its targets influences its stability <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, mutation of the <italic>katG</italic> target site reduced GsrN by more than 2-fold (Student&#x2019;s t-test, <italic>p&#x003C;0.0001</italic>). The compensatory <italic>katG(RS)</italic> allele partially restored stability to GsrN(RS) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>)<italic>. katG(RS)</italic> mutation or <italic>katG</italic> deletion did not influence <italic>gsrN</italic> transcription (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5I</xref>). Thus, we attribute the differences in steady-state levels of the GsrN alleles to their ability to interact with mRNA targets via the 5&#x2019; C-rich loop.</p>
<p>To assess the relative effects of GsrN on <italic>katG</italic> transcript and protein levels <italic>in vivo</italic>, we directly measured both by dot blot and Western blot, respectively.

<p>Importantly, RNA-seq and proteomics experiments validated <italic>katG</italic> as a regulatory target of GsrN. <italic>katG</italic> transcript levels measured by RNA-seq were not significantly different between &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic> and <italic>gsrN</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;&#x002B;</italic></sup> strains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), consistent with our dot blot measurements of unstressed cultures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).

<p>BLASTn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) hits to GsrN were limited to the Caulobacteraceae family, including the genera <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, <italic>Brevundimonas</italic>, and <italic>Phenylobacterium</italic>. The 5&#x2019; C-rich loop of homologs identified in this family had the highest level of conservation compared to other regions of secondary structure (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7SB</xref>). Predicted <italic>gsrN</italic> homologs are often proximal to the genes encoding the core GSR regulators (<italic>ecfG/sigT</italic>, <italic>nepR</italic> and <italic>phyR</italic>) (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>). <italic>C. crescentus</italic> is a notable exception where <italic>gsrN</italic> is positioned distal to the GSR locus. Therefore, we used genome position as a key parameter to identify additional GsrN or GsrN-like RNAs in Alphaproteobacteria outside of Caulobacteraceae.</p>

<caption><title>Regulatory architecture of the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> stress response systems</title>
<p>Expression of the GSR sigma factor, <italic>sigT</italic> (&#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>), and select genes in the GSR regulon is regulated as a function cell cycle phase. &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>-dependent transcription can be induced by certain signals (e.g. hyperosmotic stress), but is unaffected by hydrogen peroxide. Transcription of the sRNA, GsrN, is activated by &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>, and the cell cycle expression profile of <italic>gsrN</italic> is highly correlated with <italic>sigT</italic> and its upstream regulators. Transcription of the catalase/peroxidase <italic>katG</italic> is independent of &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>. GsrN dependent activation of KatG protein expression is sufficient to rescue the peroxide survival defect of a &#x2206;<italic>sigT</italic> null strain. GsrN convenes a post-transcriptional layer of gene regulation that confers resistance to peroxide and hyperosmotic stresses.</p></caption>

<p>Our search for GsrN focused on three parameters: evidence of intergenic transcription, identification of a near-consensus &#x03C3;<sup>EcfG</sup>-binding site in the promoter region, and proximity to the <italic>sigT</italic>-<italic>phyR</italic> chromosomal locus. Based on our criteria, we identified a set of putative GsrN homologs in the Rhibzobiaceae family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Valverde et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>). The predicted secondary structure of these putative GsrN homologues has features similar to GsrN from Caulobacteraceae. Specifically, there is an exposed cytosine-rich loop at the 5&#x2019; end (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7SC</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>We sought to understand how GSR transcription determines cell survival across a spectrum of chemical and physical conditions. To this end, we developed a directed gene network analysis approach to predict genes with significant functional roles in the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> GSR. Our approach led to the discovery of <italic>gsrN</italic>, a small RNA of previously unknown function that is a major post-transcriptional regulator of stress physiology.</p>

<title>Role of GsrN in mitigating hydrogen peroxide stress</title>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide can arise naturally from the environment and is also produced as an aerobic metabolic byproduct (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Imlay, 2013</xref>)). Our data provide evidence that &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>-dependent transcription of GsrN basally protects cells from hydrogen peroxide by enhancing KatG expression. Unlike the transcription factor OxyR, which induces <italic>katG</italic> expression in response to peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Italiani et al., 2011</xref>), GsrN is expressed across the cell cycle by &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>) and is not induced by peroxide treatment. KatG levels change by only a factor of two when <italic>gsrN</italic> is deleted or overexpressed, but we observe dramatic peroxide susceptibility and protection phenotypes as a function of <italic>gsrN</italic> deletion and overexpression, respectively. The survival phenotypes associated with subtle fold changes in KatG expression suggest that the capacity of KatG to detoxify endogenous sources of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is at or near its limit under normal cultivation conditions, similar to what has been postulated for <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Imlay, 2013</xref>). Expression of the ferritin-like protein, Dps, is controlled by &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup> and is reported to aid in the survival of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> under peroxide stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">de Castro Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>). The protective effect of Dps is apparently minimal under our conditions given that <italic>a)</italic> the peroxide survival defect of &#x2206;<italic>sigT</italic> is rescued by simply restoring <italic>gsrN</italic> transcription (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), and <italic>b)</italic> survival after peroxide exposure is determined almost entirely by modifying base-pairing interactions between GsrN and <italic>katG</italic> mRNA. This stated, the difference in hydrogen peroxide susceptibility between &#x2206;<italic>sigT</italic> and &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>) may be explained in part by the fact that <italic>dps</italic> is still expressed in &#x2206;<italic>gsrN.</italic></p>

<title>Post-transcriptional gene regulation by GsrN is a central feature of the general stress response</title>
<p>Alternative sigma factor regulation is a major mechanism underlying transcriptional reprogramming in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Paget, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Staron et al., 2009</xref>). Roles for sRNAs in regulation of environmental adaptation are also well-described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Storz et al., 2011</xref>). sRNAs have been implicated in regulation of the &#x03C3;<sup>S</sup>-dependent general stress pathway of Enterobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mika and Hengge, 2014</xref>), which is functionally analogous to the Alphaproteobacterial GSR. sRNAs that function downstream of the &#x03C3;<sup>B</sup> general stress factor in Firmicutes have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mader et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mellin and Cossart, 2012</xref>). In the case of the &#x03C3;<sup>S</sup> pathway of <italic>E. coli</italic>, different sRNAs function under different conditions to modulate <italic>rpoS</italic> regulatory output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Repoila et al., 2003</xref>). Our data define <italic>Caulobacter</italic> GsrN as a central regulator of stress physiology that has a major protective effect across distinct conditions. GsrN does not mitigate stress by feeding back to affect GSR dependent transcription. The effects we report here are, apparently, purely post-transcriptional and downstream of &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup>. GsrN protects <italic>Caulobacter</italic> from death under hyperosmotic and peroxide stress conditions via genetically distinct post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Thus, transcriptional activation of GsrN by &#x03C3;<sup>T</sup> initiates a downstream post-transcriptional program that directly affects multiple genes required for stress mitigation.</p>
<p>Quantitative proteomic studies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) demonstrate that GsrN activates and represses protein expression, either directly or indirectly. In the case of KatG, we have shown that GsrN is among the rare class of sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Frohlich and Vogel, 2009</xref>) that directly enhance protein expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Our global and directed measurements of mRNA show that <italic>katG</italic> mRNA levels do not change significantly between &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic> and <italic>gsrN</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;&#x002B;</italic></sup> strains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). However, in the presence of peroxide, we observe significant changes in <italic>katG</italic> mRNA that correlate with changes in KatG protein levels. Our data suggest a role for GsrN as a regulator of mRNA translation and, perhaps, mRNA stability. In this way, GsrN may be similar to the sRNAs, DsrA and RhyB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lease and Belfort, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Prevost et al., 2007</xref>). However, DsrA and RhyB function by uncovering ribosome-binding sites (RBS) in the leaders of their respective mRNA target. We are unable to predict a location for the RBS in the <italic>katG</italic> mRNA leader, but note that <italic>katG</italic> is among the 75&#x0025; of open reading frames (ORFs) in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> that do not contain a canonical RBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schrader et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no other sRNA deletion mutant has as dramatic a set of stress survival phenotypes as &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic>. The target of GsrN that confers hyperosmotic stress protection remains undefined, but this phenotype is also likely regulated at the post-transcriptional level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). While the reported regulatory effects of sRNAs are often subtle, GsrN provides a remarkable example of a single post-transcriptional regulator that exerts a strong influence on multiple, distinct pathways controlling cellular stress survival.</p>

<title>On GsrN stability and processing</title>
<p>The roles of sRNAs in stress adaptation have been investigated in many species, and a number of molecular mechanisms underlying sRNA-dependent gene regulation have been described. We have uncovered a connection between mRNA target site recognition and GsrN stability that may confound the characterization of GsrN regulatory mechanisms. Specifically, mutations in the <italic>katG</italic> mRNA leader affect steady-state levels of GsrN (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Given this result, one could envision scenarios in which changes in transcription of <italic>katG</italic> or some other direct GsrN target could broadly affect stress susceptibility by changing levels of GsrN and, in turn, the stability of other target mRNAs in the cell. In short, the concentrations of mRNA targets could affect each other via GsrN. Such effects should be considered when assessing mRNA target site mutations in this system and others.</p>
<p>GsrN is among a handful of sRNAs that are reported to be post-transcriptionally processed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Papenfort and Vanderpool, 2015</xref>)). Select PP7hp insertions resulted in reduced 5&#x2019; isoform formation; PP7hp insertion mutants with low 5&#x2019; isoform levels did not complement the peroxide viability defect of &#x2206;<italic>gsrN</italic>. Processing to a short 5&#x2019; isoform may be necessary for GsrN to bind <italic>katG</italic> mRNA and regulate KatG expression. Alternatively, cleavage may not be required for function, and lack of complemention by certain hairpin insertion mutants may be due to PP7hp interfering with target recognition or simply reducing total levels of GsrN. Regardless, our data clearly show that GsrN is cleaved in a regular fashion to yield a 5&#x2019; isoform that is very stable in the cell (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>) and is sufficient to protect <italic>Caulobacter</italic> from hydrogen peroxide treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Our understanding of the role of RNA metabolism in sRNA-dependent gene regulation is limited, and GsrN provides a good model to investigate mechanisms by which mRNA target levels and sRNA and mRNA processing control of gene expression.</p>

<title><italic>Caulobacter</italic> GSR and the cell cycle</title>
<p>The transcription of <italic>sigT</italic>, <italic>gsrN</italic>, and several other genes in the GSR regulon are cell cycle regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Laub et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">McGrath et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), with highest expression during the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition, when cells initiate DNA replication and growth. GSR activation during this period potentially protects cells from endogenous stressors that arise from upregulation of anabolic systems required for growth and replication. In the future, it is of interest to explore the hypothesis that the GSR system provides both basal protection against endogenous stressors generated as a function of normal metabolism, and induced protection against particular stressors (e.g. hyperosmotic stress) encountered in the external environment.</p>

<p><italic>C. crescentus</italic> was cultivated on peptone-yeast extract (PYE)-agar (0.2&#x0025; peptone, 0.1&#x0025; yeast extract, 1.5&#x0025; agar, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ely, 1991</xref>) at 30&#x00B0;C. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations on this solid medium: kanamycin 25 &#x00B5;g/ml; tetracycline 1 &#x00B5;g/ml; and chloramphenicol 2 &#x00B5;g/ml.</p>
<p>For liquid culture, <italic>C. crescentus</italic> was cultivated in either PYE or in M2X defined medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ely, 1991</xref>). PYE liquid: 0.2&#x0025;(w/v) peptone, 0.1&#x0025;(w/v) yeast extract, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, autoclaved before use. M2X defined medium: 0.15&#x0025; (w/v) xylose, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.01mM Fe Chelate, and 1x M2 salts, filtered with a 0.22 micron bottle top filter. One liter of 10x M2 stock was prepared by mixing 17.4g Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 10.6 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 5g NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. To induce gene expression from the <italic>vanA</italic> promoter, 500 &#x00B5;M vanillate (final concentration) was added. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations in liquid medium: kanamycin 5 &#x00B5;g/ml, tetracycline 1 &#x00B5;g/ml, nalidixic acid 20 &#x00B5;g/ml, and chloramphenicol 2 &#x00B5;g/ml.</p>
<p>For cultivation of <italic>E. coli</italic> in liquid medium, we used lysogeny broth (LB). Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin 100 &#x00B5;g/ml, kanamycin 50 &#x00B5;g/ml, tetracycline 12 &#x00B5;g/ml, and chloramphenicol 20 &#x00B5;g/ml.</p>

<title>Strain construction</title>
<p>All <italic>C. crescentus</italic> experiments were conducted using strain CB15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Poindexter, 1964</xref>) and derivatives thereof. Plasmids were conjugated into CB15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ely, 1991</xref>) using the <italic>E. coli</italic> helper strain FC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Finan et al., 1986</xref>). Conjugations were performed by mixing the donor <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, FC3, and the CB15 recipient strain in a 1:1:5 ratio. Mixed cells were pelleted for 2 minutes at 15,000xg, resuspended in 100 &#x00B5;L, and spotted on a nonselective PYE-agar plate for 12-24 hours. Exconjugants containing the desired plasmid were spread on PYE agar containing the plasmid-specified antibiotic for selection. The antibiotic nalidixic acid (20 &#x00B5;g/ml) was used to counterselect against both <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (helper and plasmid donor).</p>
<p>Gene deletion and nucleotide substitution strains were generated using the integrating plasmid pNPTS138 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ried and Collmer, 1987</xref>). pNPTS138 transformation and integration occurs at a chromosomal site homologous to the insertion sequence in pNPTS138. Exconjugants with pNPTS138 plasmids were selected on PYE agar plates with 5 &#x00B5;g/ml kanamycin; 20 &#x00B5;g/ml naldixic acid selected against the <italic>E. coli</italic> donor strain. Single colony exconjugants were innoculated into liquid PYE or M2X for 6-16 hours in a rolling 30&#x00B0;C incubator for non-selective growth. Nonselective liquid growth allows for a second recombination event to occur, which either restores the native locus or replaces the native locus with the insertion sequence that was engineered into pNPTS138. Counterselection for the second recombination of pNPTS138 was carried out on PYE agar with 3&#x0025; (w/v) sucrose. This selects for loss of the <italic>sacB</italic> gene during the second crossover event. Colonies were subjected to PCR genotyping and/or sequencing to identify to confirm the allele replacement.</p>
<p>The &#x0394;<italic>gsrN</italic> strains and &#x0394;<italic>katG</italic> strains were complemented by introducing the gene at an ectopic locus (either <italic>vanA</italic> or <italic>xylX</italic>) utilizing the integrating plasmids: pMT552, pMT674, and pMT680. pMT674 and pMT680 carry a chloramphenicol resistance marker gene (<italic>cat</italic>) and pMT552 carryies a kanamycin resistance marker gene (<italic>npt1</italic>). pMT552 and pMT674 integrate into the <italic>vanA</italic> gene and pMT680 integrates into the <italic>xylX</italic> gene. Transformation of ectopic complementation plamids conjugated (as described earlier).</p>
<p>Replicating plasmids pPR9TT and pRKlac290 were conjugated as previously described earlier. pPR9TT and pRKlac290 were selected using tetracycline and chloramphenicol, respectively.</p>
<p>pMal-MBP-PP7CPHis was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta by electroporation and plated on LB plates with ampicillin 100 &#x00B5;g/ml.</p>

<title>Plasmid construction</title>
<p>Plasmid pNPTS138 was used to perform allele replacements and to generate gene deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ried and Collmer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">West et al., 2002</xref>). Primers for in-frame deletions and GeneBlocks (Gblocks) are listed in Table S7. Gene fragments were created by splice-overlap-extension and ligated into the digested pNPTS138 vector at restriction enzyme sites (HindIII, SpeI) or gene fragments were stitched together using Gibson assembly. pNPTS138 contains a <italic>kan</italic><sup><italic>R</italic></sup> (<italic>npt1</italic>) antibiotic resistance marker and the counterselectable marker gene <italic>sacB</italic>, which encodes levansucrase</p>
<p>Plasmids for <italic>gsrN</italic> genetic complementation experiments carried wild-type or mutant <italic>gsrN</italic> alleles cloned antisense into a vanillate inducible(<italic>vanA</italic>)-promoter. An in-frame stop codon was designed at a restriction enzyme site downstream of the <italic>vanA</italic> promoter to ensure translational read-through of the <italic>vanA</italic> transcript did not disrupt <italic>gsrN</italic> transcription. Tandem <italic>gsrN</italic> alleles (overexpression by multiple copies of <italic>gsrN</italic>) were constructed using Gblocks with unique ends for Gibson assembly into pMT552. Plasmids for genetic complementation of the <italic>katG</italic> mutant were constructed by cloning <italic>katG</italic> in-frame with the vanillate and xylose-inducible promoters of pMT674 and pMT680, respectively, at the NdeI and KpnI restriction sites. <italic>katG</italic> complementation plasmids did not include the 5&#x2019; untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>katG</italic>.</p>
<p>Beta-galactosidase transcriptional and translational reporters utilized pRKlac290 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ely, 1991</xref>) and pPR9TT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Santos et al., 2001</xref>) replicating plasmids, respectively. Transcriptional reporters of <italic>gsrN</italic> contained upstream and promoter sequences of <italic>gsrN</italic> cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pPRKlac290. Translational reporters of <italic>katG</italic> contained the 191 nucleotides 3&#x2019; of the annotated <italic>katG</italic> transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>) cloned into pPR9TT at HindIII and KpnI.</p>
<p>Protein expression plasmid pMal was used to express a maltose binding protein (MBP) fused to the N-terminus of a Pseudomanas Phage 7 coat protein fused to a His-tag at its C-terminus (to generate MBP-PP7CP-His). The PP7CPHis protein sequence was amplified out of pET283xFlagPP7CPHis and inserted into pMal at SalI and EcoRI restriction sites. pET283xFlagPP7CPHis was a gift from Alex Ruthenberg and originates from Kathleen Collins (Addgene plasmid # 28174).</p>

<title>Hydrogen peroxide/osmotic stress assays</title>
<p>Liquid cultures were passaged several times before stress treatment to insure that population growth rate and density was as consistent as possible prior to addition of hydrogen peroxide (oxidative stress) or sucrose (hyperosmotic stress). Briefly, starter cultures were inoculated in liquid M2X medium from colonies grown on PYE-agar plates. Cultures were grown overnight at 30&#x00B0;C in a rolling incubator. Overnight cultures were then diluted back to an optical density reading of 0.05 at 660 nm (OD<sub>660</sub>&#x003D;0.05) and grown in a rolling incubator at 30&#x00B0;C for 7-10 hours. After this period, cultures were re-diluted with M2X to OD<sub>660</sub>&#x003D;0.025 and grown for 16 hours at 30&#x00B0;C in a rolling incubator. After this period, OD<sub>660</sub> was consistently 0.85-0.90. These cultures were then diluted to OD<sub>660</sub>&#x003D;0.05 and grown for 1 hour and split into two tubes. One tube received stress treatment and the other tube was untreated. Treated cultures were subjected to either hydrogen peroxide or sucrose.</p>
<p>For stress treatment, we used a freshly prepared 10 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution diluted from a 30&#x0025; (w/w) stock bottle (stock never more than 3 months old) or a stock of 80&#x0025; (w/v) sucrose. The amount of 10 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> added for stress perturbation depended on the volume of the culture and the desired final concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Final volumes assessed in our studies are described for each experiment throughout this manuscript.</p>
<p>Treated cultures and untreated cultures were subsequently titered (10 &#x03BC;L sample in 90 &#x03BC;L of PYE) by initially diluting into 96-well plates. 5 &#x03BC;L spots from each dilution were plated on PYE-agar. Once spots dried, plates were incubated at 30&#x00B0;C for 2 days. Clearly visible colonies begin to form after 36 hours in the incubator.</p>

<title>&#x03B2;-galactosidase gene expression reporter assays</title>
<p>To assess reporter gene expression, liquid cultures were passaged several times as described in the hydrogen peroxide/osmotic stress assays section above. However, cultures were placed in a 30&#x00B0;C shaker instead of a 30&#x00B0;C rolling incubator. Exponential phase cultures were harvested when the last starter culture (i.e., the OD<sub>660</sub>&#x003D;0.05 culture at the 16 hour time point) reached an OD<sub>660</sub> of 0.2-0.25. Saturated growth cultures were harvested when the exponential phase culture reached an OD660 of 0.85-0.90. Reporter assays in which the effect of stress treatment was quantified were conducted on exponential phase cultures that were split immediately before treatment.</p>
<p>&#x03B2;-galactosidase activity from chloroform-permeabilized cells was measured using the colorimetric substrate o-nitrophenyl-&#x03B2;-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG). 1 mL enzymatic reactions contained 200-250 &#x03BC;L of chloroform-permablized cells, 550-600 &#x03BC;L of Z-buffer (60 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 40 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>), and 200 &#x03BC;L of 4 mg/mL ONPG in 0.1 M KPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.0. Chloroform-permeabilized cell samples were prepared from 100-150 &#x03BC;L of culture, 100 &#x03BC;L of PYE, and 50 &#x03BC;L of chloroform (chloroform volume is not included in the final calculation of the 1 mL reaction). Chloroform-treated cells were vortexed for 5-10 seconds to facilitate permeabilization. Z buffer and ONPG were added directly to chloroform-permeablized cells. Reactions were incubated in the dark at room temperature and quenched with 1 mL of 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>Each reporter construct was optimized with different reaction times and different volumes of cells. Reaction time and volume for each reporter was empirically determined by the development of the yellow pigment from chloroform-permeabilized <italic>C. crescentus</italic> CB15 cultures. Strains harboring the pRKlac290 transcriptional reporter plasmid containing the established GSR promoter reporter P<sub><italic>sigU</italic></sub> or P<sub><italic>gsrN</italic></sub> used 100 &#x03BC;L of cells and were quenched after 10 minutes and 18 minutes, respectively. Strains containing pRKlac290 with the <italic>katG</italic> promoter (P<sub><italic>katG</italic></sub>) used 150 &#x03BC;L of cells and were quenched after 12 minutes. Strains with the translational reporter plasmid pPR9TT containing the 5&#x2019;UTR of <italic>katG</italic> (wild-type and RS constructs) used 150 &#x03BC;L of cells and were quenched after 4 minutes.</p>

<title>TRIzol RNA extractions</title>
<p>Cultures used for the extraction of RNA were passaged in the same manner outlined in the hydrogen peroxide/osmotic stress assays section above. Exponential phase cultures were harvested from the last starter (i.e., the OD<sub>660</sub>&#x003D;0.05 culture at the 16 hour time point) when it reached an OD<sub>660</sub> of 0.20-0.25. Saturated cultures were harvested when the final culture diluted to OD<sub>660</sub>&#x003D;0.025 reached an OD<sub>660</sub> of 0.85-0.90.</p>
<p>Exponential phase cultures (OD<sub>660</sub> of 0.20-0.25) harvested for extraction of RNA were pelleted at 15000xg for 3 minutes at &#x2248;23&#x00B0;C (i.e. room temperature). Early saturated cultures (OD<sub>660</sub> of 0.85-0.90) were also pelleted at 15000xg for 30 seconds at &#x2248;23&#x00B0;C. All media were aspirated using a vacuum flask. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of TRIzol&#x2122;. The TRIzol resuspension was heated for 10 minutes at 65&#x00B0;C, treated with 200 &#x03BC;L of chloroform and hand shaken. The chloroform mixture was allowed to stand for 5 minutes and then spun down at 15000xg for 15 minutes at 4&#x00B0;C. Approximately 500 &#x03BC;L of clear aqueous phase was extracted and mixed with 500 &#x03BC;L of 100&#x0025; isopropanol. Samples were then incubated at &#x2212;20&#x00B0;C overnight. Overnight isopropanol precipitation was then spun down at 15000xg for 15 minutes at 4&#x00B0;C. Isopropanol was aspirated, the pellet was washed in 1mL of 75&#x0025; ethanol, and sample was spun down at 15000xg for 15 minutes at 4&#x00B0;C. Ethanol was removed from pellet, and the pellet was left to dry for 15 minutes. The RNA pellet was resuspended in 25 &#x03BC;L of nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<title>Northern Blots</title>
<p>RNA samples were resolved on a 10&#x0025; acrylamide:bisacrylamide (29:1), 7 M urea, 89 mM Tris Borate pH 8.3, 2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA (TBE) 17 by 15 cm gel, run for 1 hour and 50 minutes at 12 Watts constant power in TBE running buffer. The amount of sample loaded was between 1-5 &#x03BC;g of RNA, mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 2x RNA loading dye (9 M urea, 100 mM EDTA, 0.02&#x0025; w/v xylene cyanol, 0.02&#x0025; w/v bromophenol blue). Samples were heated for 8 minutes at 75&#x00B0;C and then subjected to an ice bath for 1 minute before loading. Acrylamide gels with immobilized samples were then soaked in TBE buffer with ethidium bromide and imaged. Samples immobilized on the gel were transferred onto Zeta-Probe Blotting Membrane with a Trans-Blot<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell. Transfer was done at 400 mA constant current with voltage not exceeding 25V for 2 hours. Membrane was then subjected to two doses of 120 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> UV radiation, using a Stratalinker UV crosslinker. Membranes were subsequently prehybridized 2 times for 30 minutes in hybridization buffer at 65&#x00B0;C in a rotating hybridization oven. Hybridization buffer is a variation of the Church and Gilbert hybridization buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7, 300 mM NaCl, 1&#x0025; SDS). Blots were hybridized with hybridization buffer containing the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes described above. Hybridization buffer was always prepared so that GsrN probe concentration was approximately 1 nM, 5S rRNA probe concentration was approximately 2 pM, and tRNA-Tyr probe was 500 pM. Hybridization took place over 16 hours at 65&#x00B0;C in a rotating hybridization oven. Membranes were then incubated with wash buffer three times for 20 minutes at 65&#x00B0;C in a rotating hybridization oven. Wash buffer contained 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.1&#x0025; SDS. Membranes were then wrapped in plastic wrap and placed directly against a Molecular Dynamics Phosphor Screen. Screens were imaged with Personal Molecular Imager&#x2122; (PMI&#x2122;) System. Membrane exposure time was determined using a Geiger counter: 100x 2 minutes, 10x 30-60 minutes, 1.0x 8-16 hours, 0.1x 48-72 hours.</p>

<title>Rifampicin transcription inhibition assays</title>
<p>Liquid <italic>C. crescentus</italic> CB15 cultures were passaged in the same manner outlined in the hydrogen peroxide/osmotic stress assays section. However, cells for transcription inhibition assays were grown to an OD<sub>660</sub> of 0.2-0.25 from the last starter culture (i.e., inoculated from the OD<sub>660</sub>&#x003D;0.05 culture from 16 hour growth) and split across 6 tubes and labeled: untreated, 30 second treatment, 2 minute treatment, 4 minute treatment, 8 minute treatment, and 16 minute treatment. Untreated cultures were the 0 time point where no rifampicin was added. Rifampicin treated cultures were subjected to a final concentration of 10 &#x03BC;g/mL (from a 10 mg/mL stock in methanol) and were grown in a rolling incubator at 30&#x00B0;C. The 30 second rifampicin treatment refers to the centrifugation time (15000xg for 30 seconds at room temperature) to pellet the cells. Thus, the 30 second sample was immediately pelleted after exposure to rifampicin. 2 minute, 4 minute, 8 minute, and 16 minute samples were placed into a rolling incubator after exposure and were removed 30 seconds prior to their indicated time point, (i.e. 2 minute culture was removed from the incubator at 1 minute and 30 seconds).

Total RNA from <italic>gsrN</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;&#x002B;</italic></sup> and &#x0394;<italic>gsrN</italic> strains was extracted from saturated cultures (OD<sub>660</sub>&#x003D;0.95- 1.0) as described in the TRIzol extraction section. Primers for extension were first HPLC purified (Integrated DNA technologies) and radiolabeled as described in the Radiolabeled Oligonucleotides section.</p>
<p>Briefly, 14 &#x03BC;L annealing reactions comprised of the following final concentrations/amounts: 0.1 &#x03BC;M of gene specific radiolabeled primer, 0.3-0.5 mM of dNTPs, 2 &#x03BC;g of total RNA, and when necessary 0.5 mM ddNTPs. ddNTP reactions had a 3 dNTP:5 ddNTP ratio and were conducted using total RNA from <italic>gsrN<sup>&#x002B;&#x002B;</sup>.</italic> Annealing reactions were incubated at 65&#x00B0;C for 5 minutes and subsequently incubated on ice for at least 1 minute.</p>
<p>Extension reactions contained 14 &#x03BC;L annealing reactions with 6 &#x03BC;L of SuperScript&#x2122; IV Reverse Transcriptase master mix (final concentrations/amount 5 mM DTT, 2.0 U/&#x03BC;L, 1x SSIV buffer). Reactions were incubated at 50&#x2013;55&#x00B0;C for 10 minutes and then incubated at 80&#x00B0;C for 10 minutes to inactivate the reaction.</p>
<p>After the extension reaction, 1 &#x03BC;L of RNase H was added to the mixture. This was incubated at 37&#x00B0;C for 20 minutes and mixed with 20 &#x03BC;L of 2x RNA loading dye. Reactions were subsequently heated for 8 minutes at 80&#x00B0;C, subjected to an ice bath for 1 minute, and loaded onto a 33.8 by 19.7 cm 20&#x0025; acrylamide:bisacrylamide gel (as outlined in the Northern Blot section). Reactions were loaded on the gel along with a labeled Low Molecular Weight Marker (10-100 nt; Affymetrix/USB). Final amounts loaded were estimated using a Geiger counter, such that 10 mR/hr was loaded for each sample. Primer extension samples were resolved on the gel at 10 Watts constant power until unextended primer reached the bottom of the gel. The acrylamide gel was wrapped in plastic, exposed, and imaged as outlined in the Northern Blot section.</p>

<title>Affinity purification of GsrN using a PP7hp-PP7cp system</title>
<p>GsrN constructs containing a Pseudomonas phage 7 RNA hairpin (PP7hp) sequence was affinity purified using a hairpin-binding phage coat protein (PP7cp) immobilized on agarose beads. To prepare the coat protein, a 50 mL culture of <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta carrying an expression plasmid for PP7cp fused to maltose binding protein (MBP) at its N-terminus and a His-tag at its C-terminus (pMal-PP7cp-HIS) was grown at 37&#x00B0;C in a shaking incubator overnight in LB-ampicillin broth. Overnight cultures were rediluted and grown to OD<sub>600</sub>&#x003D;0.6. Cells were then induced with 1mM IPTG for 5 hours and spun down at 8000g at 4&#x00B0;C for 10 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in 6 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer (125 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM Imidizole) and mechanically lysed in a LV1 Microfluidizer. Lysate was immediately added to 500 &#x03BC;L of amylose resin slurry that was prewashed with ice-cold lysis buffer. After the sample was loaded, beads were washed in 50x bead volume (&#x007E;10mL) of ice-cold lysis buffer.</p>
<p>A 50 mL culture of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> &#x0394;<italic>gsrN</italic> carrying plasmid pMT552 expressing PP7hp-tagged alleles of <italic>gsrN</italic> was grown at 30&#x00B0;C in a shaking incubator overnight in M2X medium. The culture was prepared from a starter and passaged as outlined in the hydrogen peroxide/osmotic stress assays section. Cells were grown to an OD<sub>660</sub>&#x003D;0.85-0.90. Cells were spun down at 8000g at 4&#x00B0;C for 15 minutes, resuspended in 6 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer, and mechanically lysed in a LV1 Microfluidizer. Lysate was immediately loaded onto a column of amylose resin on which pMal-PP7cp-HIS had been immobilized. After the sample was loaded, beads were washed in 50x bead volume (&#x007E;10mL) of ice-cold lysis buffer. Elution of MBP-PP7cp-HIS bound to GsrN-PP7hp and associated biomolecules was completed over three 0.5 mL elution steps using 500 mM maltose. Each 0.5 mL elution was then mixed with equal volumes of acid-phenol for RNA extraction for RNA analysis, or equal volumes of SDS-Loading Buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 400 mM DTT, 8&#x0025; SDS, 0.4&#x0025; bromophenol blue, 40&#x0025; glycerol) for protein analysis. For the RNA analysis, the three elution fractions were combined in an isopropanol precipitation step. RNA samples were subjected to DNase treatment as outlined in the RNA-seq sequencing section.</p>

<p>Samples (&#x2248;3 &#x03BC;g) for dot blot analysis were mixed with equal volumes of 2x RNA loading dye as in a Northern Blot, and heated for 8 minutes at 75&#x00B0;C. Samples were then spotted on a Zeta-Probe Blotting Membrane and left to dry for 30 minutes. Spotted membrane was then subjected to two doses of 120 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> UV radiation (Stratalinker UV crosslinker). The membrane was then prehybridized 2 times for 30 minutes in hybridization buffer at 65&#x00B0;C in a rotating hybridization oven. After pre-hybridization, we added radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. Hybridization buffer with probes was always prepared so that each probe&#x2019;s concentration was approximately 1 nM. <italic>katG</italic> mRNA was first hybridized for 16 hours at 65&#x00B0;C in a rotating hybridization oven. Membrane was then washed with wash buffer three times, 20 minutes each at 65&#x00B0;C in a rotating hybridization oven. The blot was exposed for 48 hours to a Molecular Dynamics Phosphor screen and imaged on a Personal Molecular Imager as described above. Membrane was subsequently stripped with two rounds of boiling in 0.1&#x0025; SDS solution and incubated for 30 minutes at 65&#x00B0;C in a rotating hybridization oven. Following stripping, the membrane was subjected to two rounds of prehybridization and then hybridized for 16 hours at 65&#x00B0;C in a rotating hybridization oven with the probe specific to the 5&#x2019; end of GsrN. Membrane was then washed again with wash buffer three times for 20 minutes each at 65&#x00B0;C in a rotating hybridization oven.

Samples were boiled at 85&#x00B0;C for 10 minutes, and 10-20 &#x03BC;L of each sample was loaded onto a Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gradient Gel (4-20&#x0025;) with Precision Plus Protein&#x2122; Kaleidoscope&#x2122; Prestained Protein Standards. Samples were resolved at 35 mA constant current in SDS running buffer (0.3&#x0025; Tris, 18.8&#x0025; Glycine, 0.1&#x0025; SDS). Gels were run until the 25 kDa marker reached the bottom of the gel. Gel was transferred to an Immobilon<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>-P PVDF Membrane using a Mini Trans-Blot<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Cell after preincubation in Western transfer buffer (0.3&#x0025; Tris, 18.8&#x0025; Glycine, 20&#x0025; methanol). Transfer was carried out at 4&#x00B0;C, 100 V for 1 hour and 20 minutes in Western transfer buffer.

<p>RNAseq data (15 read files) was obtained from the NCBI GEO database from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fang et al., 2013</xref>).

Reads were mapped and quantified with Rockhopper 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tjaden, 2015</xref>). The estimated expression levels of each gene across the 5 time points were extracted from the &#x201C;Expression&#x201D; column in the &#x201C;_transcripts.txt&#x201D; file, using the &#x201C;verbose&#x201D; output. Expression of each gene across the 5 time points was normalized using python scripts as follows: for a given gene, the normalized expression of the gene at a time point, t, is divided by the sum of the gene&#x2019;s expression across all the time points, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnS1">Equation S1</xref>.

<disp-formula id="eqnS1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="212902_eqnS1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
<p>We computed Pearson&#x2019;s correlaton coefficient based on normalized expression between all pairwise combinations of genes. Correlation coefficients were organized into a numpy.matrix data structure where each row and column corresponds to the same gene order. Correlation coefficients less than 0 were not considered for this analysis and were assigned the value 0. We refer to this matrix as the Rho-matrix. The Rho-matrix is symmetric and the product of its diagonal is 1. The Rho-matrix represents the weighted edges of the network, where the value of 0 demonstrates no edge is drawn between nodes.</p>
<p>A one-dimensional weight matrix that corresponds to the rows and columns of the Rho-matrix was constructed as a numpy.matrix data structure with all values initialized at 0. Lastly, a key array was constructed in conjunction with the Rho-matrix and weight-matrix for initializing the assignment of weight and obtaining the final weights of the algorithm. The weight-matrix represents the weight of the nodes of the network and the key matrix represents the gene name of the node.</p>

<p>RNA-seq read files (fastQ) from the three replicate GsrN(37)::PP7hp purifications and duplicate PP7hp-GsrN-3&#x2019; purifications were quantified and analyzed with Rockhopper 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tjaden, 2015</xref>). Reads were mapped to modified <italic>C. crescentus</italic> genome files (fastA, PTT, RNT) where the wild-type <italic>gsrN</italic> locus was replaced with the sequence of <italic>gsrN(37)-PP7hp</italic>. Using the &#x201C;verbose output&#x201D; option and the resulting &#x201C;transcripts.txt&#x201D; file, we pruned the dataset to find genes that had low FDR values (&#x201C;qValue&#x201D; &#x003C; .05), were significantly enriched in GsrN(37)::PP7 (&#x201C;Expression GsrN(37)-PP7hp&#x201D; &#x003E; &#x201C;Expression PP7hp-GsrN-3&#x2019;&#x201D;), and had a high total number of reads that mapped to GsrN(37)::PP7 (&#x201C;Expression GsrN(37)-PP7hp&#x201D; &#x003E;1000). This analysis provided a list of 35 candidate genes (Table S3).</p>
<p>The Rockhopper analysis package organizes reads into IGV (integrative Genomic Viewer) files. Upon visual inspection and spot validation of the 35 candidates in IGV, we found 26 genes with consistently higher signal across the three GsrN(37)::PP7hp purifications relative to PP7hp-GsrN-3&#x2019; control fractions. In some cases, reads mapped outside coding sequences. Such reads mapped proximal to the 5&#x2019; end of annotated genes and to intergenic regions. We observed uneven read distribution across some annotated genes. Cases in which reads were not evenly distributed across a gene were typically not classified as significantly different from the control samples in &#x201C;Expression&#x201D; or &#x201C;qValues&#x201D; by Rockhopper even when a clear bias in read density was visually evident (most often at the 5&#x2019; end of the gene).</p>
<p>As a second approach, we performed a systematic window annotation analysis to capture the unaccounted read density differences between the two purified fractions (GsrN(37)::PP7hp and the PP7hp-GsrN-3&#x2019; negative control). Windows were generated by <italic>in silco</italic> fragmentation of the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> NA1000 genome sequence, designating 25 base pair windows across the genome. We prepared new annotated window files (FAST, PTT, RNT) for both <italic>gsrN(37)::PP7hp</italic> and <italic>PP7hp-gsrN-3&#x2019;</italic>.</p>
<p>Mapping and quantification of reads to these windows was conducted using the EDGE-pro analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Magoc et al., 2013</xref>). A caveat of EDGE-pro quantification is the potential misattribution of reads to input windows. EDGE-pro quantification does not take strand information into account when mapping reads to input windows.</p>
<p>Read quantification of the <italic>gsrN(37)::PP7hp</italic> purifications showed consistent differences in one of the three samples. <italic>gsrN(37)::PP7hp</italic> sample 1 contained 2.69&#x0025; reads mapped to <italic>gsrN(37)-PP7hp</italic> while sample 2 and 3 had 15.78&#x0025; and 14.04&#x0025; mapped to <italic>gsrN(37)-PP7hp</italic> respectively. Additionally, we observed that sample 1 had several genes that were strongly enriched in sample 1 and not in sample 2 and 3. Thus we employed a metric to balance the discrepancies between the three separate purifications. To minimize potential false positives, we calculated the average of all three samples and the average of samples 2 and 3. If the total average was 1.5 times greater than the sample 2 and 3 average, we assumed that the sample 1 artificially raised the average RPKM value and did not consider any data from any of the purifications in that specific window. The total window population decreased from 161713 windows to 109648 windows after this correction.</p>
<p>From the RPKM values calculated with EDGE-pro, we used the R-package, DESeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>), to assess statistically significant differences between windows of expression. Candidate windows enriched in the GsrN(37)::PP7 fractions were identified using metrics similar to what is applied to traditional RNA-seq data. Briefly, we identified windows that had a low p-values (pvalue&#x003C; .05), were enriched in the GsrN(37)::PP7 (&#x201C;baseMean GsrN(37)-PP7hp&#x201D; &#x003E; &#x201C;baseMean PP7hp&#x201D;), and had a high level of reads mapped to the gene in the GsrN(37)::PP7 (&#x201C;baseMean GsrN(37)-PP7hp&#x201D; &#x003E;1000) (Table S4).</p>
<p>Adjacent significant windows were then combined and mapped onto the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> genome annotation files described earlier. In order to correct for strand information lost in EDGE-pro quantitation, bowtie file information was used to define the strand of reads mapped to combined significant windows (Table S4).</p>

Samples were run against a FASTA file of proteins from the UniProt database (UP000001364) and standard contaminants. The label free quantitation (LFQ) option was turned on. Fixed modification included carbamidomethyl (C) and variable modifications were acetyl or formyl (N-term) and oxidation (M). Protein group files were created for three comparisons: wild-type versus &#x0394;<italic>gsrN</italic>, &#x0394;<italic>gsrN</italic> versus <italic>gsrN</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;&#x002B;</italic></sup>, and wild-type versus <italic>gsrN</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;&#x002B;</italic></sup> samples.
