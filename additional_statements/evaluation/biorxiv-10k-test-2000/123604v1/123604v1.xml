<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Diversification of the <italic>ca</italic>. 250,000 extant flowering plant species has been driven in large part by coevolution with animal pollinators. A recurring pattern of pollinator shifts from hummingbird to hawkmoth pollination has characterized plant speciation in many western North American plant taxa, but in the genus <italic>Mimulus</italic> (monkeyflowers) section <italic>Erythranthe</italic> the evolution of hawkmoth pollination from hummingbird-pollinated ancestors has not occurred. We manipulated two flower color loci and tested the attractiveness of the resulting four color phenotypes (red, yellow, pink, white) to na&#x00EF;ve hawkmoths. Hawkmoths strongly prefer derived colors (yellow, pink, white) over the ancestral red, and prefer the two-locus change (white) to either of the single-locus changes (yellow, pink). The simple flower color genetics underlying this innate pollinator preference suggests a potential path for speciation into an unfilled hawkmoth-pollinated niche, and the deliberate design of a hawkmoth-pollinated flower demonstrates a new, predictive method for studying pollination syndrome evolution.</p>

<body>
<p>Darwin called the dramatic radiation of the <italic>ca</italic>. 250,000 flowering plant species &#x201C;an abominable mystery,&#x201D; though he recognized the potential role of the strong coevolutionary relationships between plants and their pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). It is now clear that animal pollination is responsible for high rates of speciation in the flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Shifts between pollinator guilds (<italic>e.g</italic>., bumblebees, hummingbirds, hawkmoths, bats) often coincide with plant speciation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3"><italic>3</italic></xref>), and each pollinator guild is attracted by a different suite of floral traits (<italic>e.g</italic>., color, pattern, shape, nectar reward) collectively known as a pollination syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Extensive work has identified pollination syndromes among various plant families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4"><italic>4</italic></xref>), but the detailed genetics of traits involved in pollinator shift-driven plant speciation remain largely unresolved. Have we learned enough about the genetic basis of the origin of flowering plant species to <italic>engineer</italic> a shift in pollinator guilds? Borrowing from Gould&#x2019;s metaphor of the &#x201C;tape of life,&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5"><italic>5</italic></xref>) can we <italic>anticipate</italic> (rather than recapitulate) evolutionary trajectories, and, instead of replaying the tape of life, run the tape in fast forward?</p>
<p>A recurring pattern of pollinator shifts from hummingbird to hawkmoth pollination has characterized plant speciation in many western North American taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3"><italic>3</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6"><italic>6</italic></xref>), but in the genus <italic>Mimulus</italic> (monkeyflowers) section <italic>Erythranthe</italic> the evolution of hawkmoth pollination from hummingbird-pollinated ancestors has not occurred. &#x201C;Hawkmoth flowers&#x201D; share several characteristics with &#x201C;hummingbird flowers,&#x201D; including a large volume of dilute nectar and a long tubular corolla. But most hummingbird flowers are red, hence not easily visible to hawkmoths, whose visual sensitivity does not extend into the longer wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Hawkmoth flowers are usually white (or pale) and highly reflective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6"><italic>6</italic></xref>), adapted for detection by crepuscular and nocturnal hawkmoths.</p>
<p>Our goal is to design and synthesize a new <italic>Mimulus</italic> species, pollinated by hawkmoths and reproductively isolated from its red-flowered, hummingbird-pollinated ancestor, <italic>M. cardinalis</italic>. As a first step, we manipulated two flower color loci in <italic>M. cardinalis</italic> and tested the attractiveness of the resulting four color phenotypes (red, yellow, pink, white) to na&#x00EF;ve hawkmoths.</p>
<p>The red color of <italic>M. cardinalis</italic> flowers is produced by the combination of high concentrations of anthocyanin (pink) and carotenoid (yellow) pigments. To selectively eliminate either (or both) floral pigments, we crossed <italic>M. cardinalis</italic> to a white-flowered (bumblebee-pollinated) <italic>M. lewisii</italic> homozygous for a recessive allele (<italic>boo1, 8</italic>) unable to produce anthocyanins, and homozygous for a dominant suppressor of carotenoid pigmentation (<italic>YUP, 9</italic>). <italic>M. cardinalis</italic> is homozygous for the alternative alleles (<italic>BOO1 yup</italic>). We self-pollinated the F<sub>1</sub> (<italic>BOO1/boo1yup/YUP</italic>) to produce a segregating F<sub>2</sub> population (<italic>N</italic> &#x003D; 500), from which we recovered the &#x201C;ancestral&#x201D; red phenotype (<italic>BOO1 yup</italic>), and the &#x201C;derived&#x201D; yellow (<italic>boo1 yup</italic>), pink (<italic>BOO1 YUP</italic>), and white (<italic>boo1 YUP</italic>) phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Segregants of each color (<italic>N</italic> &#x003D; 3 per color) were matched as closely as possible for corolla size and shape and nectar volume.

<p>Using na&#x00EF;ve captive-bred female hawkmoths (<italic>Manduca sexta</italic>) in a dimly-lit flight chamber with one flower of each color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>), we counted the total number of pollinator visits (see Supporting Material). There were significant differences in visits among the flower color phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <italic>N</italic> &#x003D; 447, <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 134, <italic>P</italic> &#x003D; 10<sup>-29</sup>). These results indicate that hawkmoths are attracted to flowers with at least one allele substitution step (yellow or pink) from the red flower color characteristic of the ancestral hummingbird-pollinated <italic>M. cardinalis</italic>, and most strongly prefer the two-allele substitution (white).</p>
<p>Testing these four flower color phenotypes with na&#x00EF;ve hawkmoths in an experimental chamber has established the remarkably simple genetic basis of phenotypic change required to initiate a pollinator guild shift from hummingbirds to hawkmoths. Observations of pollinator preference and pollen movement in the native environment of <italic>M. cardinalis</italic> using near-isogenic lines for the <italic>YUP</italic> and <italic>boo1</italic> alleles will be needed for a definitive assessment of reproductive isolation between the hummingbird-pollinated ancestral <italic>M. cardinalis</italic> and the rationally designed hawkmoth-pollinated derivatives with yellow, pink, or white flowers.</p>
<p>The classical approach to understanding plant speciation by pollinator shift is <italic>retrospective</italic> &#x2013; sister taxa with different pollinators are analyzed for differences in key floral traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3"><italic>3</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"><italic>10</italic></xref>) and their underlying alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8"><italic>8</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11"><italic>11</italic></xref>) to infer the evolutionary history of divergence from their common ancestor. But perhaps the most stringent test of our understanding of flowering plant diversification is the <italic>prospective</italic> approach we have used here. Darwin famously predicted that the Malagasy star orchid <italic>(Angraecum sesquipedale)</italic>, which has a white flower and <italic>ca</italic>. 35cm nectar spur, must be pollinated by a (then-undiscovered) hawkmoth with a <italic>ca</italic>. 35cm proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). We have shown that critical steps towards the origin of a new, human-designed, hawkmoth-pollinated plant species can, likewise, be predicted based upon a fundamental knowledge of pollination syndromes and genetics.</p>

<title>Hawkmoth population</title>
<p>Carolina hawkmoths (<italic>Manduca sexta</italic>) were raised on artificial diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1"><italic>1</italic></xref>) under controlled conditions at the University of Washington. Hawkmoths were eclosed in full artificial lighting and were not fed or light-cycled prior to the experimental runs. Female hawkmoths eclosed four to six days prior to the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2"><italic>2</italic></xref>) were used in all experiments.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Test chamber experiments</title>
<p>Hawkmoths were tested in a 1m x 1m x 70cm chamber constructed of black Coroplast (Coroplast, Dallas, TX) with a clear Plexiglas top for observation. The chamber was located within a darkroom illuminated with red safelight; the chamber itself was illuminated with a single blue-white LED emitting 2 lumens mounted on the Plexiglas top. One flower (including pedicel) of each color was mounted at a height of 50cm on a long side of the symmetrical chamber. Each run was randomized for both flower color at each position and one of three parent plants for each color.</p>
<p>Each hawkmoth was observed until an initial na&#x00EF;ve choice (defined as proboscis extension and contact with the floral surface, see <italic>3</italic>) was made. At that point, number of visits until nectar exhaustion or hawkmoth exhaustion were recorded (nectar exhaustion was defined as a visit of one second or less; hawkmoth exhaustion as the hawkmoth becoming unwilling to fly), at which point the hawkmoth was removed and the flowers replaced before a new hawkmoth was introduced. Data were analyzed using a chi-square goodness-of-fit and individual ranking was done with pairwise chi-square tests with a sequential Bonferroni correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Visit profiles were examined to rule out initial preference having an effect on further visits (i.e. learning); of 28 moths, 22 visited all three non-red colors, distributed evenly with initial preference ( <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1.375, <italic>P</italic> = 0.503, df = 2); additionally, 17 of the 28 moths visited another color as often as or more than their initial choice.</p></sec></sec>
