<title>Abstract</title>
<p>A novel genome-wide genetics platform is presented in this study, which permits functional interrogation of all point mutations across a viral genome in parallel. Here we generated the first fitness profile of individual point mutations across the influenza virus genome. Critical residues on the viral genome were systematically identified, which provided a collection of subdomain data informative for structure-function studies and for effective rational drug and vaccine design. Our data was consistent with known, well-characterized structural features. In addition, we have achieved a validation rate of 68&#x0025; for severely attenuated mutations and 94&#x0025; for neutral mutations. The approach described in this study is applicable to other viral or microbial genomes where a means of genetic manipulation is available.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The influenza virus causes several hundred thousand deaths every year, and this number can reach millions in pandemic years. The huge socioeconomic associated with influenza highlights the importance of understanding of virus-host interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The rapidly evolving nature of influenza challenges the development of anti-influenza drugs and vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Consequently, it is important to develop drugs or vaccines that target indispensable regions on the influenza virus to maximize the genetic barrier for the emergence of resistance or escape mutations. Nevertheless, genetic research on the influenza virus has largely relied on naturally variants and individual mutants created in the laboratory. A substantial part of the genome remains uncharacterized.</p>
<p>Traditional genetics studies the relationship of a single genotype-phenotype at a time, and has been extensively to study panels of influenza mutations. However, the low throughput of traditional genetics limited the number of mutations being examined. In contrast, high-throughput genetics interrogates the phenotypic outcomes of multiple mutants in parallel. Genome-wide insertional mutagenesis is a common high-throughput genetics approach. It has been employed in the influenza virus to systematically identify regions that are tolerate to mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. However, the resolution of insertion-based approach is limited at the protein subdomain level. This resolution is insufficient to identify residues critical for replication. As a result, there is a demand for a high-throughput genetics platform at a single-residue resolution.</p>
<p>Recently, we have developed a high-throughput genetic platform which allowed us to profile the fitness effect of individual point mutations across the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The principle of the high-throughput genetic platform is to utilize a large mutant library and deep sequencing. Here, we extended this approach to quantify the fitness effects of each point mutation in 96&#x0025; of the influenza A virus genome. This technique will enable systematic identification of indispensable regions for drug or vaccine targets. More importantly, it can be applied to any specified growth conditions for any virus that can be genetically manipulated.</p>

<title>Quantification of the fitness effect of individual point mutation</title>
<p>Our high-throughput genetics platform aims to randomly mutagenize each nucleotide of the genome, monitor the changes in occurrence frequency for individual point mutations under specified growth conditions using massive deep-sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The changes in occurrence frequency of each point mutation (such as diminishment or enrichment) allow us to quantify the mutational fitness outcomes under the given growth conditions. The mutant libraries were created by error-prone PCR on the eight-plasmid reverse genetics system influenza A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] (see materials and methods). Subsequently, eight viral mutant libraries were generated by transfection, each with one of the eight segments mutagenized. All viral mutant libraries were passaged for two 24-hour rounds in A549 cells (human lung epithelial carcinoma cells). The plasmid library and the passaged viral library were each sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000. Here, a relative fitness index (RF index) is used to estimate the mutational fitness effect. The RF index is calculated as:</p>
<p>RF index &#x003D; occurrence frequency in passaged library)/(occurrence frequency in plasmid library)</p>
<p>The occurrence frequency of individual mutations was expected to be lower than the sequencing error rate (&#x223C;0.1&#x0025;-1&#x0025;) in next generation sequencing (NGS). Therefore, we utilized a two-step PCR approach for sequencing library preparation to distinguish true mutations from sequencing errors. In the first PCR, a unique tag was assigned to individual molecules. The second PCR generated multiple identical copies for individual tagged molecules. The input copy number for the second PCR was well-controlled such that individual tagged molecules would be sequenced &#x223C;10 times. True mutations would exist in all sequencing reads sharing the same tag, whereas sequencing errors would not. Individual molecules, each carrying a unique tag, have an average copy number of &#x223C;10 in the sequencing data, which validated the sequencing library preparation design (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Point mutation fitness profiling of influenza A virus genome</title>
<p>The RF indices for individual point mutations were profiled across 96&#x0025; of nucleotide positions in the influenza A/WSN/1933 virus genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The remaining 4&#x0025; of nucleotide were from the termini of each gene segment due to PCR amplification difficulty. As expected, a positive correlation exists between RF index and the degree of amino acid conservation of missense mutations (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). In addition, the fitness data for well-characterized mutants were consistent with their phenotypes reported in the literature. Examples include a critical salt bridge for viral replication on nucleoprotein (NP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>), replication enhancement mutation on polymerase subunit (PB2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>), attenuation of oseltamivir resistance mutation on neuraminidase (NA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>), low fitness cost of amantadine/rimantadine resistance mutations on ion channel (M2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>), and the basic stretch on matrix protein (M1) required for assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Furthermore, comparison between our fitness data with the polymerase activity on 19 PB1 mutants previously reported showed an 80&#x0025; correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Mutants that displayed a severely attenuated (RF index &#x003C;0.05) or neutral (RF index &#x003E;0.4) phenotype were randomly selected across the genome, individually constructed and tested. The replication phenotype of each single mutant validated the profiling data with a confirmation rate of 68&#x0025; for severely attenuated mutations and 94&#x0025; for neutral mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). These data taken together provides validity to our fitness profiling data set.

<title>Structural analysis and identification of indispensable protein surface</title>
<p>Our high-throughput profiling technique provides a basis to identify essential protein surfaces for drug targeting and indispensable regions for vaccine epitopes. We have performed a structural analysis on NA, a major influenza vaccine antigen. Here we identified a cluster of essential residues at the tetramer formation interface, suggesting that it bears functional importance and can possibly be a drug targeting site. In contrast, such a large cluster of essential residues could not be found in any other part of the NA surface. The lack of essential residues on the NA surface explain the functional basis of antigenic drift.</p>
<p>We have also performed a structural analysis using the PA subunit of the influenza virus RNA polymerase as an example to search for indispensable regions to aid in rational drug design. Increasing evidence suggests PA is a valuable target for drug development due to its polyfunctionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Our fitness data provided an informative reference for rational drug design. It captured several critical interactions between PA and PB1, such as the hydrogen bond between PA E617 and PB1 K11 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), and the hydrophobic interaction between PA and PB1 via the volume-filling residues L666 and F710 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). It has also revealed a cluster of essential residues on the PA surface consisting of eight amino acids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), including K539 and K574, which were previously shown to be part of a lead compound binding pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. This patch of amino acids may be involved in an essential protein-protein interaction for viral replication. Similar analyses using our dataset have been applied to PA endonuclease domain and the M2 ion channel, which are plausible targets in drug development (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>-<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). By projecting the fitness profiling data on three dimensional protein structures, it enables the identification of novel putative essential structural motifs that are surface exposed but not necessarily sequential in the primary sequence. This type of analysis reveals biological targets useful for rational drug and vaccine design. We propose that future antiviral drug design can incorporate the technique described in this study with in silico drug screening to increase the efficiency of therapeutic identification.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sequence conservation was often taken as the sole parameter for identifying residues essential for viral replication, although conservation is not equivalent to essentialness for viral replication. It has been suggested that a significant fraction of conserved residues that are conserved in the influenza A virus are dispensable in viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. In addition, new mutations were observed in every flu season, implying that residues that are naturally conserved currently may still be able to mutate under future unforeseen selection pressures. Therefore, a high-throughput fitness profiling complements the shortcoming in the sequence conservation analysis and allows identification of amino acid residues that are critical for viral replication in a defined cellular environment.</p>
<p>Here we provided a proof-of-concept study to profile the entire influenza A virus genome at single-nucleotide resolution. The fitness effects of individual point mutations were interrogated in a high-throughput manner by coupling a large mutant libary with NGS. However, the quantifiability of our platform can be further improved as sequencing technology advance. Similar experiments should be performed with strains across subtypes to identify mutations that display a genetic background-dependent fitness effect. These results would provide valuable information to dissect the evolutionary process of the influenza A virus. In addition, this platform can be applied to study the virus-host interaction under different cellular responses (such as apoptosis, autophagy, inflammasome induction, ER stress, etc.) and immune responses (such as NK cells, T cells, antibodies, macrophages, cytokines, etc.) that influence the viral replication in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Such results will significantly improve our understanding of the biological role of each residue on the genome of the influenza A virus. They will also help improve the design of a live attenuated influenza vaccine by minimizing the virulence. More importantly, it can potentially be adapted to other virus and microbes that can be genetically manipulated in the laboratory.</p>

<title>Viral mutant library and point mutations</title>
<p>The plasmid mutant libraries were created by performing error-prone PCR on the eight-plasmid reverse genetics system of influenza A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. We PCR-amplified the flu insert with error-prone polymerase Mutazyme II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutation rate of the error-prone PCR was optimized by adjusting the input template amount to avoid the accumulation of deleterious mutations. The restriction enzyme sites BsmBI and/or BsaI were added to the PCR primers, and used to clone into a BsmBI-digested parental vector pHW2000. Ligations were carried out with high concentration T4 ligase (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Transformations were carried out with electrocompetent MegaX DH10B T1R cells (Invitrogen), and &#x003E; 100,000 colonies for each segment library were scraped and directly processed for plasmid DNA purification (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD). As extensive trans-complementation was expected during the transfection step, &#x003E; 35 million cells were used for transfection to average out any bias or artifact generated from possible trans-complementation. Point mutants for the validation experiment were constructed using the QuikChange XL Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.</p>

<title>Transfections, infections, and titering</title>
<p>C227 cells, a dominant negative IRF-3 stably expressing cell line derived from human embryonic kidney (293T) cells, were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using 7 wildtype plasmids plus 1 mutant (library) plasmid. Supernatant was replaced with fresh cell growth medium at 24 hrs and 48 hrs post-transfection. At 72 hrs post-transfection, supernatant containing infectious virus was harvested, filtered through a 0.45 um MCE filter, and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C. The TCID50 was measured on A549 cells (human lung carcinoma cells).</p>
<p>Virus from C227 transfection was used to infect A549 at an MOI of 0.05. Infected cells were washed three times with PBS followed by the addition of fresh cell growth medium at 2 hrs post-infection. Virus was harvested at 24 hrs post-infection. For the mutant library profiling, all viral mutant libraries were passaged for two 24-hour rounds in A549 cells. Our pilot experiments as well as our previous study revealed that two rounds of passaging were suffcient for profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>

<title>Sequencing library preparation</title>
<p>DNA from the plasmid library or cDNA from the passaged viral mutant library were amplified with both forward and reverse primers each flanked with a 6 &#x201C;N&#x201D; tag and the flow cell adapter region. Flanking region for 5&#x2019; primer: 5&#x2019;-CTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN-3&#x2019;, Flanking region for 3&#x2019; primer: 5&#x2019;-TGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN-3&#x2019;. Following PCR, 93 amplicon products were pooled together. 15 million copies of the pooled product were used as the input for the second PCR, which was equivalent to 10 paired-end reads per molecule if 150 million paired-end reads (approximately one lane on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine) were sequenced. 5&#x2019;-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCG-3&#x2019; and 5&#x2019;-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCG-3&#x2019; were used as the primers for the second PCR. Products from the second PCR were submitted for NGS. The error-correction technique described in this study adapted the philosophy described for detecting rare mutations in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Sequencing reads were mapped by BWA with a maximum of six mismatches and no gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Amplicons with the same tag were collected to generate a read cluster. Since each read cluster was originated from the same template, true mutations were called only if the mutations occurred in 90&#x0025; of the reads withina a read cluster. Read clusters with a size below three reads were filtered out. Read clusters were further conflated into &#x201C;error-free&#x201D; reads. Relative fitness index (RF index) for individual point mutations was computed by:</p>
<p>(occurrence frequency in passaged library)/(occurrence frequency in plasmid library)</p>
<p>For all the downstream analysis, only point mutations covered with &#x2A7E; 30 tag-conflated reads (&#x201C;error-free&#x201D; reads) in the plasmid library were included. This arbitrary cutoff filtered out mutants with low statistical confidence.</p>

The degree of amino acid conservation was quantified by the BLO-SUM62 matrix, a substitution matrix based on an implicit model of evolution. The x-axis represents the different cutoffs for BLOSUM62 values. The average RF index value for missense mutations that satisfied the cutoff was plotted against different BLOSUM62 cutoff values. The positive correlation between the RF index and the degree of amino acid conservation of missense mutations indicates that our fitness data shows consistency with the evolutionary trend for missense mutations.</p></caption>

<caption><title>The RF index of substitutions at different functional sites.</title><p>(A) E339 and R416 on the NP protein form a salt bridge at the homodimer interface, which is essential for viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. This suggests that it is a feasible drug target. Several small molecules have been identified to target this interface and inhibit viral replication. (B) T271A has been identified as the replication enhancement substitution on PB2. T271A virus showed enhanced growth as compared to the WT strain in mammalian cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. (C) NA 259Y (N1 naming: H274Y), a known oseltamivir drug resistance substitution, was shown to present a strongly attenuated phenotype in WSN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. In contrast, H259N (N1 naming: H274N), did not impose a deleterious effect in our fitness profiling data. This substitution is hypothesized to reduce influenza zanamivir sensitivity. Our results suggest further characterization of this substitution is warranted. (D) L26I, L26F, V27A and S31N on M2, the amantadine/rimantadine resistance substitutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], were shown to impose little effect on viral replication. Our data is consistent with the observation that resistance substitutions emerged rapidly during amantadine/rimantadine drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Green dotted line represents the average RF index for missense mutation at the indicated segment. Overall, the fitness data was consistent with the phenotypes of functional mutants reported in the literature.</p></caption>

It has been suggested that this basic amino acid stretch is important for virus assembly and/or budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Virus substitutions at these positions show an attenuated phenotype. Our data is consistent with the previous observation. The non-structural region at the C-terminal end of <sub>76</sub>RRR<sub>78</sub> is also indispensable in our profiling data. This suggests that entire the non-structural region containing the <sub>76</sub>RRR<sub>78</sub> basic stretch is functionally important. One possibility for functional importance is that it provides an interface for a protein-protein interaction.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Structural analysis of the PA endonuclease domain.</title><p>The RF index of the least destructive missense mutations in the profiling data for individual amino acids on the PA segment are projected on the PA endonuclease crystal structure (PDB: 4E5G). Most deleterious 10&#x0025;, red; 10&#x0025; to 20&#x0025;, orange; Others, green. A critical helix-helix interface, which consists of T40, V44, M47, I171, R174 and I178, is highlighted. It demonstrates the power of qHRG in identifying residues that are not continuous in the primary sequence.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Structural analysis of the M2 ion channel.</title><p>The RF index of the least destructive missense mutations in the profiling data for individual amino acids on the M2 protein are projected on the M2 ion channel crystal structure (PDB: 2RLF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Most deleterious 10&#x0025;, red; 10&#x0025; to 20&#x0025;, orange; Others, green. An indispensable region on the transmembrane helix is highlighted. Our data captured the essential amino acids W41 and H37, which are critical for M2 ion channel activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. We also identified several adjacent hydrophobic residues, I35, L36, and L38 as critical residues, which can be attributed to their contact with the hydrophobic membrane.</p></caption>
