<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Three members of the <italic>Puccini</italic> genus, <italic>P. triticina</italic> (<italic>Pt</italic>), <italic>P. striiformis f.sp. tritici</italic>(<italic>Pst</italic>), and <italic>P. graminis f.sp. tritici</italic> (<italic>Pgt</italic>), cause the most common and often most significant foliar diseases of wheat. While similar in biology and life cycle, each species is uniquely adapted and specialized. The genomes of <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic> were sequenced and compared to that of <italic>Pgt</italic> to identify common and distinguishing gene content, to determine gene variation among wheat rust pathogens, other rust fungi and basidiomycetes, and to identify genes of significance for infection. <italic>Pt</italic> had the largest genome of the three, estimated at 135 Mb with expansion due to mobile elements and repeats encompassing 50.9&#x0025; of contig bases; by comparison repeats occupy 31.5&#x0025; for <italic>Pst</italic> and 36.5&#x0025; for <italic>Pgt</italic>. We find all three genomes are highly heterozygous, with <italic>Pst</italic> (5.97 SNPs/kb) nearly twice the level detected in <italic>Pt</italic> (2.57 SNPs/kb) and that previously reported for <italic>Pgt</italic>. Of 1,358 predicted effectors in <italic>Pt</italic>, 784 were found expressed across diverse life cycle stages including the sexual stage. Comparison to related fungi highlighted the expansion of gene families involved in transcriptional regulation and nucleotide binding, protein modification, and carbohydrate enzyme degradation. Two allelic homeodomain, HD1 and HD2, pairs and three pheromone receptor (<italic>STE3</italic>) mating-type genes were identified in each dikaryotic <italic>Puccinia</italic> species. The HD proteins were active in a heterologous <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> mating assay and host induced gene silencing of the HD and <italic>STE3</italic> alleles reduced wheat host infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rust fungi have the most complex life cycles among described fungi, with many stages having discrete morphologies and very distinguishable sexual and asexual propagation. For many rust fungi, these stages occur on two different, unrelated host plants requiring two different infection strategies (heteroecious). For many, such as the cereal rust fungi, the asexual stage can successfully propagate and lead to epidemics as long as the host is present. When biologically stressed, the fungus enters the sexual cycle and survival teliospore structures are produced. In homoecious rust fungi, like flax rust (<italic>Melampsora lini</italic> (Ehrenb.) L&#x00E9;v.), both stages evolved on the same host (autoecious). In heteroecious rust fungi, such as the cereal rust pathogens, major host jumps occur through evolution of the asexual (uredinial) stage to infect a different host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Savile 1976</xref>). These complex interactions result in the production of up to five different rust spore types, requiring very discrete developmental programs, resulting in altered gene expression profiles.</p>
<p>The obligate biotrophic lifestyle of wheat rust pathogens hampers the ability to culture the fungus <italic>in vitro</italic> and thus limits biological studies. Genetic studies by crossing individual strains is not trivial due to the difficulty of breaking teliospore dormancy in order to infect the alternate hosts. Most of what is known about wheat rust pathogen biology is based on extensive cytology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Bushnell and Roelfs 1984</xref>) and isolate interactions with host resistance genes. Many interactions between rust fungi and their cereal hosts have been shown to genetically conform to the gene-for-gene theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Flor 1942</xref>; <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Loegering, and Powers 1962</xref>). The majority of wheat rust resistance genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">McIntosh <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>) have been shown to be dominant or semi-dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Statler 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">2000</xref>) and current models imply an interaction between the resistance genes and fungal effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sperschneider <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Petre <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Wheat leaf rust, caused by <italic>Puccinia triticina</italic> Eriks (<italic>Pt</italic>), is the most commonly occurring cereal rust disease worldwide. Leaf rust on wheat was first recognized as different from stem rust in 1718 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">De Candolle 1815</xref>) and included into a species complex (<italic>P. rubigo-vera</italic>) and taxonomic refinements resulted in the current classification based on differences in spore morphology and alternate host range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Eriksson 1899</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Savile 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anikster <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>). <italic>Pt</italic> is an obligate biotroph that can complete its sexual cycle on either of two known alternate host species, <italic>Thalictrum speciosissimum</italic> Loefl. (meadow rue; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jackson and Mains 1921</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Saari <italic>et al</italic>. 1968</xref>)) or <italic>Isopyrum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brizgalova 1935</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">1937</xref>). The complete <italic>Pt</italic> cycle consists of five spore stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bolton <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). The urediniospore is the most common and is asexual and polycyclic. At maturity when leaves begin to senesce, the fungus will form black teliospores as survival structures on the underside of the leaf. Within the teliospores, karyogamy takes place and promycelia are formed when the teliospores germinate. Four haploid basidiospores, in which the mating types have segregated, are formed and infect the alternate host, forming the pycnium. Dikaryotization occurs through fusion between a receptive flexous hyphae and a pycniospore of a different mating type. After fusion, the dikaryotic state is reestablished and an aecium will form on the underside of the leaf from which aeciospores will be released and travel to the wheat host. After landing on wheat leaves, the aeciospore will germinate forming an appressorium over a stoma. The haustorial mother cell forms in the substomatal cavity and attaches to the host cell wall. The plant cell wall is breached between 24 to 48 hours, forming haustoria. The fungus will spread intercellularly and a uredinium is formed at 7 days, from which urediniospores are produced to complete the life cycle. Wheat suffers from two other major rust diseases: stem rust, caused by <italic>Puccinia graminis</italic> Pers.:Pers. f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> Erikss. &#x0026; E. Henn. (Pgt; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Leonard and Szabo 2005</xref>) and stripe rust, caused by <italic>P. striiformis</italic> Westend. f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> Erikss. (<italic>Pst</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). While all three wheat rust pathogens share very similar biology and spore stages, only <italic>Pgt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic> have <italic>Berberis</italic> spp. as an alternate host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Statler 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Jin <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Rust fungi belong to the subphylum Pucciniomycotina that together with the Ustilaginomycotina, the true smut fungi, and the Agaricomycotina, which include mushroom-forming species, make up the phylum Basidiomycota. In this subphylum, the sexual cycle typically requires cell-cell fusion governed by both pheromone (<italic>mfa</italic>) and pheromone receptor (<italic>STE3</italic>) genes, which then allows the formation of heterodimeric transcription factors coded for by two classes of homeodomain-containing protein genes, <italic>HD1</italic> and <italic>HD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Raudaskoski and Kothe 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kues <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). In the corn smut fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, the mating-type locus contains both the pheromone receptor gene <italic>Pra</italic> (the <italic>STE3</italic> equivalent) and a pheromone precursor gene <italic>mfa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brefort <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). In all basidiomycetes studied to date, heterodimeric HD-containing transcription factors have been implicated in the mating process. They are found in pairs of genes each encoding subunits of a HD1 and HD2-containing protein that are divergently transcribed. Originally found with their start sites within 1 kb in <italic>Um</italic>, many variations exist and multiple pairs in arrays of linked diverged copies are often found in mushrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Casselton and Kues 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Raudaskoski and Kothe 2010</xref>) though single gene pairs are predicted in <italic>Pleurotus djamor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">James <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>) and <italic>Pholiota nameko</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yi <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). To date, the mating loci of the wheat rusts have not been carefully analysed.</p>
<p>As for other obligate pathogens, genome sequencing of rust fungi has advanced the basic understanding of these organisms, which are otherwise recalcitrant to laboratory study. Initial molecular analyses and phylogenetic data indicated that within each lineage of these three rust pathogens, adaptation to the wheat host had occurred independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zambino and Szabo 1993</xref>). Genome differences were identified in EST sequencing studies where it was shown that 40&#x0025; of <italic>Pt</italic> ESTs did not have a match to <italic>Pgt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Xu <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Comparison of contigs from BAC and genome sequencing have shown synteny between the three genomes, however, there are regions of gene insertions, expansion by mobile elements, and inversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cantu <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fellers <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to this work, the genomes of <italic>Pgt</italic> and the poplar leaf rust <italic>M. larici-populina (Mlp</italic>) were sequenced and compared. Out of 17,773 and 16,399 predicted genes, respectively, a core set of genes was identified representing the biotrophic nature of rusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Duplessis <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). More recently, a second <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly of <italic>Pgt</italic> was completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Upadhyaya <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). Three genome sequencing projects have been described for <italic>Pst</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cantu <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). The first two focused on identifying the effector complement, and the third study on identifying heterozygosity between two isolates of <italic>Pst</italic>. In each study, the total number of predicted genes varied across the projects (22,815 versus 25,288, respectively). The genome of the flax rust <italic>M. lini</italic> (Ml/), has also been sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nemri <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). Comparative analyses with other basidiomycete genomic resources have provided initial insights into relatedness of subsets of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Xu <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nemri <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>) but a comprehensive analysis among wheat rusts is missing.</p>
<p>Here, we have generated draft genome sequences of the wheat rust fungi <italic>Pt</italic> race 1 (BBBD) and <italic>Pst</italic> race PST-78 and updated the gene set of <italic>Pgt</italic> race SCCL, and utilized these sets to define the shared and unique properties of these three related pathogens. To examine gene content evolution, we compared predicted proteins to those of other high-quality basidiomycete genomes. We examined the three wheat rust pathogens for conservation of gene families, including effector genes, and compared to other sequenced rust fungi. We identified predicted secreted proteins including gene families found only in the wheat rust pathogens and found differences in expression levels between <italic>Pt</italic> life cycle stages, including sexual stages on the alternate host and wheat infection. In addition, we analyzed the mating-type gene complexes, revealed their evolutionary placement among basidiomycetes, tested the functionality of several <italic>Pt</italic> homeodomain proteins through heterologous expression in <italic>U. maydis</italic> (<italic>Um</italic>), and demonstrated a role for mating-type genes during wheat infection by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS).</p>

<p>Genomic DNA was isolated from <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic> urediniospores.

RNA was also isolated and sequenced for two stages for both <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pgt</italic> from the alternate host, <italic>Thalictrum speciosissimum</italic> (meadow rue), and represented pycnia with their pycniospores and a mixture of pycnia and aecia with aeciospores.

<p>For <italic>Pt</italic> genome sequencing, various sizes of genomic DNA libraries and platforms were used. In short, libraries of 3 kb and 8 kb fragment inserts were sequenced using Roche 454 FLX chemistry and two large insert libraries were end-sequenced using Sanger technology: a 40 kb insert Fosmid library (30,731 clones) and &#x007E;100 kb insert BAC library (15,000 clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fellers <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>); Table S1).

<p>Three similar <italic>Pst</italic> genomic DNA insert libraries were sequenced using FLX chemistry with a Roche 454.

<title>Genome expansion in <italic>Pt</italic> associated with repetitive element proliferation</title>
<p>High quality genome assemblies of <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic> were generated by combining data from multiple sequencing technologies. A range of insert size libraries for both genomes were sequenced using Roche 454, Illumina and Sanger technologies (Tables S1 and S2). The assembled genome of <italic>Pt</italic> was the largest of the three wheat rust pathogens, totaling 135.3 Mb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>); this assembly included 14,820 scaffolds of an N50 length of 544 Kb. The assembly of <italic>Pst</italic> totaled 117.31 Mb; this is comparable to previously reported values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cantu <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). The <italic>Pst</italic> assembly consisted of 9,715 scaffolds with N50 length of 519 Kb. RNA-Seq was used to guide gene prediction for both <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic>, and to improve the gene set of <italic>Pgt</italic> (Methods). Of the three rust pathogens, <italic>Pst</italic> had the highest number of genes predicted with 19,542, though fewer than the number reported for other <italic>Pst</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cantu <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>), while <italic>Pt</italic> had the smallest total of the three with 14,880 genes. All three genomes have high coverage of a core eukaryotic gene (CEG) set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Parra <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The CEG coverage of this <italic>Pst</italic> gene set (97&#x0025;) is notably higher than that of the PST-130 assembly (66&#x0025;), the only other publicly available <italic>Pst</italic> gene set, due to a higher fraction of partial gene matches in PST-130 (Figure S1). In addition, comparison of a larger set of basidiomycete conserved orthologs supports that few genes appear missing in the three wheat rust fungal genomes (Figure S2). Together, these gene conservation metrics suggest that these assemblies contain highly complete gene sets.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The assemblies of the three wheat rust fungi varied significantly in size, ranging from 89 Mb for <italic>Pgt</italic> to 135 Mb for <italic>Pt</italic>. While the <italic>Pst</italic> assembly totals 117 Mb, the genome may in fact be smaller than the assembly size, as the high percentage of gaps (32&#x0025;) in scaffolds suggests that small contigs fall in to some of the gap regions. By comparison, the <italic>Pt</italic> assembly consists of 21&#x0025; and <italic>the Pgt</italic> assembly only 8&#x0025; gap regions. While all assemblies are impacted by the high heterozygosity (see below), differences in repeat content and organization likely as well as the use of different sequencing technologies likely contribute to these differences. Each of the three wheat rust pathogen genomes was evaluated for content of repeated elements using both <italic>de novo</italic> predicted repeats and fungal elements from RepBase, which included 413 <italic>Puccinia</italic> sequences (Supplemental Material and Methods). The larger genome of <italic>Pt</italic> includes a higher fraction of repetitive elements, encompassing 50.9&#x0025; of contig bases, whereas repeats covered only 31.5&#x0025; of <italic>Pst</italic> and 36.5&#x0025; of <italic>Pgt</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The expanded repeat content of <italic>Pt</italic> includes roughly 2-fold more of both Class I retroelements and Class II DNA elements. After excluding the identified repeats, the non-repetitive portions of the genomes are very similar, totaling 53.4 Mb for <italic>Pt</italic>, 54.4 Mb for <italic>Pst</italic>, and 51.8 Mb for <italic>Pgt</italic>.</p>

<p>Comparison of syntenic regions between <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pgt</italic> highlights that the genome expansion in <italic>Pt</italic> is due to disperse integration of repetitive elements.

However, the size of the syntenic blocks in <italic>Pt</italic> are 30.1&#x0025; larger overall than in <italic>Pgt</italic>; syntenic regions cover 46.7 Mb of <italic>Pt</italic> and 35.9 Mb of <italic>Pgt</italic>. By contrast, regions of <italic>Pst</italic> are 71.2&#x0025; the size of syntenic regions of <italic>Pgt</italic>, suggesting a compaction of <italic>Pst</italic>; however this analysis is impacted by the high percentage of gap in the <italic>Pst</italic> assembly, reducing the resolution of blocks that can be detected. Within the expanded regions of <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic>, there are larger blocks of repetitive sequence interleaved between the orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), highlighting that the genome expansion appears due to disperse integration of repetitive elements.</p>

<title>High heterozygosity across all wheat rusts and evaluation of haploid assemblies</title>
<p>The cereal rust pathogens exist as dikaryotic (<italic>n&#x002B;n</italic>) organisms for most of their life cycle, with a high level of heterozygosity between haplotypes. For <italic>Pt</italic>, 273,526 heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified across the genome based on Illumina read alignment (Supplemental Material and Methods). Across the genome, the average rate of heterozygosity was 2.57 SNPs/kb, though a higher rate bias was observed in intergenic regions (2.85 SNPs/kb) than in genic regions (1.71 SNPs/kb). By contrast for <italic>Pst</italic>, 473,282 heterozygous SNPs were identified, for an average rate of 5.97 SNPs/kb; genic regions show a higher rate (7.49/kb) than intergenic regions (4.96/kb), a much higher rate than the 0.68 SNPs/kb previously reported for <italic>Pst</italic> with an assembly of the CY32 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). The rate of heterozygosity for <italic>Pt</italic> is similar to that reported for <italic>Pgt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Duplessis <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>), where higher rates in genic regions (2.28 SNPs/kb) were found compared to intergenic regions (1.72 SNPs/kb), although the sequencing technology and methods differ between these studies. Heterozygosity levels in both <italic>Pst, Pgt</italic> and <italic>Pt</italic> are more than double those reported for genic and intergenic regions of <italic>Mlp</italic> (0.84 and 0.87 SNPs/kb respectively), supporting a high level of allelic diversity in these two wheat rust pathogens.</p>
<p>Regions of high heterozygosity could carry enough differences to prevent haploid assembly and could inflate the gene count for such regions, as alleles would appear as duplicated genes. Therefore, we examined the orthology assignment of genes found in all three wheat rust pathogens for conserved genes with two copies in only one species. Among the wheat rust fungi, <italic>Pt</italic> has only 230 species-specific two-copy paralogs (2&#x003A;1&#x003A;1; <italic>Pt</italic>:<italic>Pgt</italic>:<italic>Pst</italic>). <italic>Pst</italic> has an intermediate value of 361 species-specific paralogs while <italic>Pgt</italic> has 465 species-specific paralogs. Duplications detected by assembly self-alignment were most easily examined in <italic>Pgt</italic> due to the low scaffold count and only one region was found to have both haplotypes assembled separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Duplessis <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Overall this suggests that independent assembly of both haplotypes is minimal in all three wheat rust pathogens, as expected given the choice of assembly strategies that take heterozygosity into account.</p>

<title>Core protein comparisons and orthology</title>
<p>To examine gene content variation between the three wheat rust pathogens and with other basidiomycetes, we compared the predicted proteins of <italic>Pt, Pgt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic> to those of related genomes. These included <italic>Mlp</italic> and <italic>Mli</italic>, the smuts <italic>Um</italic> and <italic>Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae</italic>, the fern parasite <italic>Mixia osmundae</italic>, the unicellular plant phylloplane &#x201C;red&#x201D; yeast <italic>Sporobolomyces roseus</italic>, the human facultative pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, and the woodrotter <italic>Coprinopsis cinerea</italic>. By identifying orthologs across these genomes, we inferred the phylogenetic relationship of the species using single copy orthologs; <italic>Pgt</italic> and <italic>Pt</italic> are most closely related, with <italic>Pst</italic> being an earlier diverged outgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), consistent with previous findings from phylogenetic analysis of the ITS ribosomal DNA region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zambino and Szabo 1993</xref>).

<p>The wheat rust pathogens have very different gene content from other Basidiomycetes, including a large fraction of species-specific genes. Less than half of genes in each wheat rust pathogen, an average of 6,867, were conserved among other basidiomycetes. All of the rust fungi (<italic>Pt</italic>, <italic>Pst</italic>, <italic>Pgt</italic>, <italic>Mlp</italic>, and <italic>Mli</italic>) contained an average of 6,482 species-specific predicted genes. Among the other compared basidiomycetes, only <italic>C. cinerea</italic> contained a similar number of species-specific genes. Among the wheat rust pathogens, <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pgt</italic> had similar numbers of species-specific genes (5,443 and 4,901 respectively), while the <italic>Pst</italic> number was higher at 8,955. In addition, a large fraction of the genes are conserved across the wheat rust pathogens but not other fungi; an average of 3,440 are conserved in at least two genomes and 2,164 are found in all three.</p>
<p>To assess functional differences based on variation in genes between the three wheat rust pathogens and other fungi, we identified significant differences in the number of predicted protein domains. The three wheat rust pathogens were compared to <italic>Mli, Mlp</italic>, and to six other basidiomycetes to determine what protein families exhibit significant gain or loss in rust fungi. The majority of these are protein families involved with nucleotide binding and modification, transcription factor regulation, and protein modification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). These include the NAM-associated transacting factor family, the most significantly enriched protein domain overall; this domain is specific to the rusts among basidiomycetes, with 7 or 10 copies in <italic>Mlp</italic> and <italic>Mli</italic> and between 49 and 134 copies in the three wheat rusts. Three other Zn-finger transacting factor and a fungal-specific transcription factor families are also enriched. Four other enriched protein families are associated with carbohydrate active enzymes; trehalose phosphatase, pectinesterases, glycoside hydrolase family 26 (GH26), which processes mannan and galactomannan, and the GH76 family of alpha-1,6 mannanases. Other families are involved in carbohydrate processing and transportation, cell metabolism, and metabolite transportation (Table S3). A notable depleted family, NmrA, belongs to a family of transcriptional repressors involved in controlling nitrogen metabolite repression in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Stammers <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). Other genes involved in nitrate metabolism are lost in <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic>, as previously noted for <italic>Pgt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Duplessis <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Overall these highlight recent adaptation of gene regulation and host-interaction via gene duplication and diversification.</p>

<title>Effector repertoire mining and conservation</title>
<p>Candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) across the wheat rust pathogens are proteins predicted to be secreted and expressed during host infection are likely involved in host interactions. In this analysis, CSEPs predicted for <italic>Pt</italic> were compared to those previously identified in <italic>Pst</italic> and <italic>Pgt</italic>. From a starting set of 15,685 predicted proteins, including variant proteins encoded by alternate transcripts and novel genes detected by RNA-Seq data, a total of 1,358 CSEP-encoding genes were predicted for <italic>Pt</italic> (Figure S3). Of these, a total of 914 <italic>Pt</italic> CSEPs grouped in 385 families or &#x2018;tribes&#x2019; previously assigned to <italic>Pst</italic> or <italic>Pgt</italic> CSEP tribes (Table S4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cantu <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>)). From the remaining CSEPs, an additional 111 contained BLASTP sequence similarity (at &#x2264; e<sup>&#x2212;20</sup>) to <italic>Pst</italic> and <italic>Pgt</italic> predicted proteins, of which 72 did not contain a predicted signal peptide at the expected initiation codon. The remaining 333 CSEPs were specific to <italic>Pt</italic> of which 246 were unique without any paralogs in the <italic>Pt</italic> protein set. The remaining 87 CSEPs belonged to <italic>Pt</italic>-specific gene families having from two to eight members per tribe. This highlights that while the vast majority of <italic>Pt</italic> CSEPs share sequence similarity with those in the other wheat rust pathogens, a subset are unique to each species. In addition, a disproportionate fraction of the wheat rust pathogen-specific genes mentioned above are predicted to code for secreted proteins. In <italic>Pt</italic>, a total of 17.0&#x0025; of the wheat rust specific genes are predicted to encode secreted proteins compared to 9.6&#x0025; of all predicted genes. This suggests the genes specific to the wheat rust fungi include a high fraction of potential effector proteins.</p>
<p>Based on gene ontology (GO) term assignment and similarities to Pfam domains, the molecular functions of the <italic>Pt</italic> CSEPs appear highly diverse, though some frequent categories were observed. The largest subcategories include a total of 123 CSEPs that have hydrolase activity, 76 contain ion-binding activity, and 44 have oxidoreductase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Pfam domain comparisons also revealed some potential common and unique functions among rust fungi (Figure S4). Since protein targeting is dependent on intrinsic protein motifs such as a nuclear localization signal or a chloroplast transit peptide, we analyzed all predicted CSEPs minus their signal peptides for their potential localization in the host to deduce possible functions. The distribution of their subcellular localization prediction in the plant indicates 388 CSEPs are potentially targeted to the cytoplasm, 361 to the nucleus, and 292 to plastids. A total of 190 of these proteins are targeted to membranes, 16 to the apoplast, seven to the Golgi system, four to the vacuole, and one to the ER (Table S4).</p>

<title>Expression profiles across life cycle stages and two hosts</title>
<p>Functionally important gene expression was evaluated using RNA-Seq across diverse life cycle stages. RNA was sequenced from samples of dormant and germinating urediniospores, infected wheat leaf tissue at 6 DPI representing most of the infection structures of the uredinial spore genesis of the life cycle, and two stages collected from the alternate host, <italic>Thalictrum speciosissimum</italic> (meadow rue), the pycnia sexual stage and a later stage mixture of both pycnia and aecia. Comparing normalized counts across conditions revealed the two urediniospore samples were most highly correlated, and both were similar to the mixed sample of pycnia and aecia (Table S5). By contrast the pycnia and infected wheat leaf samples appeared the most different from the others.</p>
<p>To closely evaluate how secreted proteins change in expression across these conditions, all <italic>Pt</italic> CSEP genes were assessed and 199 effectors were identified with a minimum of 5-fold change. From these, 138 <italic>Pt</italic> effectors were highly induced in wheat-infected leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) with 30 assigned to known proteins with hydrolase (10), peptidase (4), oxidoreductase (3), ion-binding (2), phosphatase (2), carbohydrate-binding (2), lipase (2), chitinase (1), protease (1), phospholipase (1), phosphoglucono-lactonase (1) and esterase (1) activities. Twenty-six CSEP genes were highly induced exclusively in germinating urediniospores. Among other stage-specific sets were 16 CSEP transcripts highly accumulated in dormant urediniospores compared to the germinated spore stage. When focusing on infection of the alternate host <italic>Thalictrum</italic>, 16 were highly expressed in pycnia and 3 during the later stage of the mixed pycnia and aecia sample (p&#x002B;ae). In various datasets, except for the &#x201C;mixed&#x201D; pycnia &#x002B; aecia stages, 1 to 10 candidate effector genes coding for proteins with hydrolase activity are highly induced. Among those, members of the glycoside hydrolases (GH) superfamily were prevalent, with GH18 specifically highly expressed (2 in wheat-infected tissues), GH16 and GH17 in germinating urediniospores, GH26 in dormant urediniospores, and GH16 in pycnia.</p>
<p>The predominant gene classes expressed in each stage were also examined by testing for functional enrichment in differentially expressed genes. Roughly half of the genes most induced during wheat infection compared to dormant spores encode predicted secreted proteins (Table S6). Other gene families that are enriched during wheat infection include the GH18 family, DNA binding proteins, peroxidases, and amino acid permeases (Table S7). By contrast, genes expressed in pycnia relative to dormant urediniospores are enriched for GMC oxidoreductase, LON proteases, potassium uptake, osmotic stress response, and chitin synthases (Table S8).</p>

<p>Using annotated <italic>Pt</italic> EST or known <italic>mfa</italic> sequences (Supplementary Note), three contigs in <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pgt</italic> and two in <italic>Pst</italic> were found as containing putative <italic>mfa</italic> genes (Table S10). A putative <italic>Ptmfa2</italic> gene coding for a 33 amino acid protein with a characteristic C-terminal CAAX motif was identified on supercontig 2.517; while no gene model was initially predicted here, evidence of expression was detected in several life cycle stages (Figure S5). Extensive searches of genomic reads and RNA-Seq data could not identify other <italic>mfa</italic> genes. In all three <italic>Puccinia</italic> species, the predicted <italic>mfa2</italic> and <italic>STE3.2</italic> genes are divergently transcribed and are approximately 500-700 bp apart (605 bp in <italic>Pt</italic>; Figure S5), an organization reminiscent of <italic>Ustilagomycete a2</italic> loci.

<p>Two allelic homologs of both HD1-and HD2&#x2013;&#x2013;containing protein genes were found in each of the three <italic>Puccinia</italic> species that were termed <italic>bE-HD2</italic> and <italic>bW-HD1</italic> (Table S11). Gene models in the genome assemblies were found to be partial, and complete transcript sequences were constructed using <italic>de novo</italic> RNA-Seq assemblies (Figure S6). The predicted <italic>Puccinia</italic> HD2 proteins are approximately 374 amino acids in length whereas the HD1 proteins are approximately 620 amino acids in length. <italic>PtbE2-HD2</italic> and <italic>PtbW2-HD1</italic> are located close together and are divergently transcribed (Table S11; Figure S7). However, in the fragmented genome assembly, <italic>PtbE1-HD2</italic> and <italic>PtbW1-HD1</italic> are each located on a small contig so no direct inferences of linkage could be made for this pair. Comparative analysis of aligned DNA and protein sequences for the two alleles of each <italic>PtbE</italic> and <italic>PtbW</italic> gene revealed the conserved HD-specific domains within an overall conserved C-terminal region whereas the proteins were more diverged at the N-terminus, similar to the paradigm established in <italic>Ustilago</italic> species (Figure S6). A similar pattern of conservation was noted for the corrected <italic>Pgt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic> alleles. A molecular phylogeny was generated to establish the relatedness among the HD-containing mating-type proteins in the three cereal rust fungi, compared to single homologs from the poplar and pine rust fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The allelic variants were closer to each other in each <italic>Puccinia</italic> species as they were among the species, since they are alleles and their sequences are evolving in a concerted fashion. Thus, among the rust fungi compared, the HD1-and HD2-containing transcription factors are each separated in defined clades, as is seen when many basidiomycetes are compared, indicating an ancient system in which allelic specificities are maintained because of their functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bakkeren <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kues <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>In all three wheat rust pathogens, a large contig with a complete divergently-transcribed pair of <italic>bE</italic> and <italic>bW</italic> genes is found while the other sometimes partial alleles are found on small contigs. This analysis highlights the challenges faced when assembling very similar sequences such as the conserved C-terminal domains, likely belonging to two different haplotype genomes. Therefore, to investigate the physical arrangement of both <italic>bE-bW</italic>pairs in the <italic>Pt</italic> race 1 genome, primers to the conserved 3&#x2019;-ends of each gene (Table S12) were used in a PCR reaction, which yielded a single product of 3.9 kb from total gDNA isolated from germinating urediniospores. In dikaryotic urediniospores, both pairs are assumed to be present. Analysis of the sequences had revealed that nucleotide polymorphisms in restriction enzyme sites for Xma1 and Spe1 could be used to distinguish the allelic pairs. To verify whether or not the 3.9 kb PCR product contained both divergently-transcribed <italic>bW</italic>and <italic>bE</italic> gene pairs, it was digested with these enzymes for a prolonged period of time to indeed yield fragments consistent with the presence of both allelic pairs, confirming the suspected organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>We previously demonstrated the feasibility of using <italic>Um</italic> as a heterologous expression system for <italic>Pt</italic> genes (Hu <italic>et al</italic>. 2007).

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The genomes of <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic>, sequenced here and compared to those from <italic>Pgt</italic> and other Basidiomycetes, are notable for their expanded size and high level of heterozygosity. While each genome was assembled using different sequencing technology, each of the gene sets appears to be of similar quality, with high representation of core genes. The genome of <italic>Pt</italic> in particular has been expanded due to multiple classes of repetitive elements; while this higher repeat content was found to be dispersed across the genome assembly, repeat elements could impact the expression of nearby genes and could also contribute in this way to differences between related strains of the same species. Notably, we find that <italic>Pst</italic> has the highest level of heterozygosity and that this measure is larger than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). While some of this difference could be attributed to the isolate sequenced, the much larger size of the Pst-130 genome used in this previous study may result in an under-estimation of heterozygosity, such as in cases where both alleles of a gene were assembled independently.</p>
<p>Prior to this work, gene content surveys focused on genes expressed during infection and other life cycle stages. An extensive EST data set of 13,328 unique ESTs was created by sampling several stages in <italic>Pt</italic>, however, functional annotation was generally low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hu <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Xu <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). During this genome project, ESTs and newly generated RNA sequences were used to refine gene models and predict alternatively spliced forms in each of the genomes. Notably, <italic>Pst</italic> contained the largest set of predicted genes at 19,542, despite not having the largest genome. This total is similar to what has been found in other <italic>Pst</italic> genome projects. In the sequence of four other <italic>Pst</italic> races, the gene count varied from 18,149, to 21,030, which may have been impacted by differing levels of heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cantu <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). It is intriguing that in <italic>Pst</italic> there are many more CSEPs than in <italic>Pt</italic> or <italic>Pgt</italic>; in one study, 2,999 CSEPs were predicted in five consolidated <italic>Pst</italic> genomes, compared to 1,333 and 1,173 in <italic>Pgt</italic> and <italic>Mlp</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cantu et al., 2013</xref>). Virulence variability among <italic>Pst</italic> isolates is high and larger than for <italic>Pgt</italic> and <italic>Pt</italic>, likely due to a CSEP gene expansion and diversification to elude host recognition. In this regard, it may be significant that <italic>Pst</italic> can be found on 126 species of grasses among 20 genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Line 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Overall, the number of genes within the three rust fungal genomes is higher than that in other plant pathogenic fungi. Smut fungi have fairly low gene counts (6,500 &#x2013; 7,000), but plant pathogenic fungi have as many as 17,735 in <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (Ma <italic>et al</italic>. 2010) and 16,448 in the necrotroph <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amselem <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). <italic>Mli</italic> and <italic>Mlp</italic> have gene numbers of 16,271 and 16,399 respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Duplessis <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nemri <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>), indicating a similar number of genes to wheat rust pathogens. Higher gene numbers may support the multiple spore stages and more complex life cycle in the rust fungi.</p>
<p>The large genome expansion in <italic>Pt</italic> due to repetitive elements was suggested by an earlier study of selected genome regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fellers <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). The genomes of other rust fungi are also enriched for repetitive elements though smaller in number and total DNA content. <italic>Pst</italic> and <italic>Pgt</italic> have similar repeat element numbers, while <italic>Pt</italic> is more like <italic>Mli</italic>, for which repeats occupy 87 Mbp or 46&#x0025; of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nemri <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). While in some fungi the process of repeat-induced point mutation helps control the expansion of transposable elements, the activity of repeat-induced point mutation in the rust fungi (<italic>Pgt</italic> and <italic>Mlp</italic>) appears much lower than in other fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amselem <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). Mobile elements are now considered to be essential &#x201C;genome modifiers&#x201D; that replicate and randomly re-insert to drive recombination, addition and/or deletion events, sometimes leading to protein neo-functionalizations. Regions of the genome enriched in repetitive elements have also been shown to be a source of genetic diversity, particularly within effector repertoires of pathogens for possible adaptation to their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Haas <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Raffaele and Kamoun 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ali <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to two previously sequenced wheat rust pathogen genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Duplessis <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>), 8&#x0025; of the identified <italic>Pt</italic> transcript repertoire encodes potential secreted effectors. The three <italic>Puccinia</italic> species share a complement of secreted proteins, yet each has a group that is specific to its own species (Table S4 and Figure S4). Although all three are pathogens of wheat, their indigenous world-wide distribution and therefore evolutionary path and environmental (host) adaptation and life histories are different, as are their symptom formation and alternate host selection; this will have likely translated into a varied complement of CSEPs. Comparison among available rust fungus inventories allowed us to identify a preliminary set of CSEPs specific to the wheat rusts. However, poor annotation of candidate effectors, currently a common challenge in plant pathology, makes deducing biological meaning from specific subsets difficult. Nevertheless, based on Pfam domain searches, specific to wheat rust CSEPs were members of glycoside hydrolase families (GH15, GH17 and GH88), trehalose-phosphatases, members of the DyP-type peroxidase family, and glyoxal oxidase, and in addition, proteins with pro-kumamolisin, thaumatin and alcohol dehydrogenase-like domains (Figure S4). Intriguingly, 140 of the unidentified proteins were predicted to target the cytoplasm of the host and could be candidates with a role in the interplay with the host immune system.</p>
<p>Gene expression during the key stages of the fungal life cycle is quite different. Many CSEPs were strongly expressed in plant host tissues in comparison to the (germinating) urediniospore stages suggesting their particular role during infection. Although a large number of highly induced CSEPs could not be functionally annotated, a significant number fall into groups with hydrolase, peptidase and oxidoreductase activities. In the uredinial, pycnial, and aecial spore stages, many of the genes are associated with sugar, amino acid and membrane modification, or are amino acid transporters, nucleotide binding proteins or transcription factors. However, prior to uredinia formation, the fungus induces the protein manufacturing machinery and the most highly expressed genes are associated with ribosomes.</p>
<p>Mating and compatibility have been very difficult to study in the (cereal) rusts because many are macrocyclic, completing their sexual stage on a different (sometimes obscure or unknown) alternate host plant. Several studies have attempted to shed light on the mating-type system in rust fungi. Conclusions and speculations vary from rust fungi having a simple &#x002B;/-bipolar system in several <italic>Puccinia</italic> and <italic>Uromyces</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Anikster and Eliam 1999</xref>) to a more complicated tetrapolar system with multiple allelic specificities in <italic>Mli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lawrence 1980</xref>) and related oat crown rust pathogen, <italic>P. coronata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Narisawa <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>). Our genome analysis demonstrates that the proposed simple &#x002B;/&#x2212; bipolar system is much more complex, at least in the cereal rust fungi. Analysis of the <italic>STE3</italic> genes in basidiomycetes supports the idea of two ancient clades, tentatively called STE3.1 and STE3.2 (in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In members of the genus <italic>Puccinia</italic>, the STE3 pheromone receptors evolved in two major clades, which for consistency in this speculative scenario would then be called STE3.2-1 and STE3.2-2 (in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Further duplication and divergence events likely led to the STE3.2-3 group, and an additional STE3.2-4 allele in <italic>Mlp</italic> (in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Some of the genomic locations, synteny, and structure including the presence of multiple TEs and repeats we identified are in agreement with accelerated evolutionary potential in STE3-containing regions (Supplementary Note). This then would strengthen the idea that the bi-allelic recognition system is indeed ancestral in the basidiomycetes. In the Ustilaginaceae, S. <italic>reilianum</italic> has three <italic>pra (STE3</italic>) alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schirawski <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>) whereas in closely related <italic>Uh</italic> and <italic>Um</italic> only two are found although in the latter, one specificity is likely lost. A recent study among members of the Ustilaginaceae found three highly syntenic pheromone receptor alleles to be prevalent which led Kellner <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kellner <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>) to propose a tri-allelic recognition system to be ancestral. However, a recent study into the mating-type organization of a basal basidiomycete lineage, <italic>Leucosporidium scotii</italic>, strongly suggested a bi-allelic pheromone-receptor recognition system to be ancestral in the basidiomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Maia <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). This is generally seen among the Ustilaginomycotina, the Agaricomycotina, and the Microbotryomycetes more recently identified. In the mushrooms, two clades of pheromone receptors are found but in each, expansion by duplication and mutation leading to many allelic series, is very common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Raudaskoski and Kothe 2010</xref>). Whether all three pheromone receptors in the <italic>Puccinia</italic> species are functional and capable of interacting with and responding to pheromones remains to be investigated. Since we analysed genome data derived from dikaryotic urediniospores from one isolate for each <italic>Pt, Pst</italic>, and <italic>Pgt</italic>, it is unclear which alleles represent opposite specificities normally expected for the pheromone response during mate partner interaction. Differing expression levels for specific alleles at different life cycle stages could indicate functional divergence and possibly a lost function in determining MAT-specificity such as seen in many mushrooms. Genome analysis of haploid-phase stages such as from several single pycnia on the alternate host, need to be performed to investigate this issue.</p>
<p>The limited number of <italic>a</italic> locus <italic>Pra</italic> and <italic>mfa</italic> alleles in smuts indicates a small repertoire of haploid fusion capabilities in nature (though promiscuity has been observed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bakkeren and Kronstad 1996</xref>); this contrasts with multiple (allelic) arrays often found in mushrooms. Similarly, single <italic>bE/bW</italic> pairs are found in smuts with very few allelic variants identified in nature for the bipolars but many more (up to 33) for tetrapolar <italic>Um</italic>. The organization is often more complex in mushrooms where one to multiple HD1-HD2 pairs representing various alleles are found in arrays in many of their analysed genomes, accounting for the myriad of sexually productive specificities recognised in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fraser <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bakkeren <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kues <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nieuwenhuis <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; Kues 2015). Closer to the Pucciniomycetes, in the Microbotryomycetes, a bipolar system with limited number of alleles for the HD-pair and <italic>Pra-mfa</italic> genes has been found in <italic>Microbotryum violaceum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Petit <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) but a &#x201C;pseudo-bipolar&#x201D; system with loose linkage of the HD-pair and pheromone-receptor genes, estimated to be 1.2 Mb apart, was described in <italic>Sporidiobolus salmonicolor</italic>, resulting in the discovery of multiple allelic HD-pairs in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Coelho <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). The <italic>Puccinia</italic> species genome analyses described here did not indicate close linkage of the <italic>STE3/mfa</italic> and HD genes (the current assembly and preliminary mapping data in <italic>Pt</italic> indicate these loci to be at least 216 kb apart; Supplementary Notes), though a loose linkage has not been ruled out. An inventory of HD alleles among a wide collection of isolates may answer some of these questions.</p>
<p>When introducing one particular <italic>Pt bE</italic> or <italic>bW</italic> allele into a wild-type haploid <italic>Um</italic> strain, these constructs triggered filamentous growth through the production of the respective HD protein, functional interaction with the <italic>Ustilago</italic> counterpart, and subsequent transcriptional activation of a subset of genes by the formed bi-species HD dimer, as shown for <italic>Um</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wahl <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). While we have shown such active interactions to occur between <italic>b</italic> alleles from different species within the smuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bakkeren and Kronstad 1993</xref>), such activity across quite diverged members of the basidiomycetes is astounding and suggests an ancient origin of these proteins indeed. However, the experiment introducing <italic>PtbWI</italic> and <italic>PtbE2</italic> alleles, each in a compatible <italic>Uh</italic> strain lacking <italic>b</italic> genes, did not trigger a switch to hyphal growth upon mating. Although fusion of mating hyphae was confirmed, this suggests that no productive interaction within the dikaryotic heterologous cell occurred. Given that we found only two allelic pairs of <italic>bE</italic> and <italic>bW</italic> in these <italic>Puccinia</italic> species and the overwhelming evidence of the productive interaction between such heterodimers in many very diverse basidiomycetes studied to date, it is unlikely that the PtbE and PtbW HD proteins would not interact. Failure to initiate filamentous growth in <italic>Uh</italic> then may indicate that the <italic>Pt</italic> HD-proteins lack domains or the specificity necessary for <italic>Ustilago-specific</italic> downstream interactions, nuclear import and/or for binding to <italic>Ustilago</italic> promoter elements that normally initiate the transcription of genes involved in the switch to filamentous growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Scherer <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kahmann and Schirawski 2007</xref>); when <italic>Pt-Uh</italic> HD-heterodimers are formed, such functionality may be provided by the <italic>Uh</italic> component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, the predicted PtbE proteins are, at 374 amino acids, approximately 100 residues shorter than the <italic>Ustilago</italic> homologs. In addition, whereas the compositions of the helices that constitute the HD are relatively well-conserved between the <italic>Pt</italic> and <italic>Ustilago</italic> b-proteins, their location within the protein is significantly different. They may have evolved Puccinia lineage-specific adaptations.</p>
<p>The HIGS experiments demonstrated that some of the <italic>Pt</italic> mating-type genes were certainly functional in dikaryotic hyphae during wheat infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) in addition to the assumed activity during the sexual stage on <italic>Thalictrum</italic> spp. The involvement of the <italic>a</italic> mating-type genes not only in mating but also in pathogenicity of the dikaryotic cell type has been demonstrated in <italic>Um</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hartmann <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Urban <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>). Silencing of <italic>PtSTE3.1</italic> had less of an effect than of <italic>PtSTE3.3</italic> and this was correlated with the observed expression levels during wheat infection (Figure S8). As discussed above, since three STE3 genes are found, functional diversification catered to the various life cycle stages is distinctly possible. The sequences in the HD silencing constructs were designed such that they would silence both alleles and this was clearly detrimental to the infection process and shows therefore that they are important for pathogenicity. They could play a role in maintenance of the dikaryotic stage and/or induction or persistence of pathogenicity gene expression such as demonstrated for <italic>Um</italic> where the bE/bW heterodimer was shown to be essential for initiating the induction of a set of genes involved in the pathogenic life style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brachmann <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wahl <italic>et al</italic>. 2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>Wheat rust diseases are a major impediment to economic production of wheat in many areas in the world, and because of their rapid adaptation to newly introduced resistant cultivars and fungicides, they are a threat to envisaged increased yield for a growing population. Genome research on these elusive biotrophic pathogens has tremendously accelerated our understanding of their interaction with their host and the presentation of a <italic>Pt</italic> and another <italic>Pst</italic> genome and the comparative analysis to other rust fungi in this study has highlighted similarities and differences that can now be exploited for targeted crop protection strategies. Conserved and essential effectors, expressed during infection, and their intended host targets, would be interesting components for further study; a search for natural or engineered resistance genes recognizing such effectors could be effective.</p>
