<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Combining high-throughput sequencing with targeted sequence capture has become an attractive tool to study specific genomic regions of interest. Most studies have so far focused on the exome using short-read technology. This approach does not capture intergenic regions needed to reconstruct genomic organization, including regulatory regions and gene synteny. In this study, we demonstrate the power of combining targeted sequence capture with long-read sequencing technology, leading to the successful sequencing and assembling of the two hemoglobin (Hb) gene clusters LA (&#x007E;100kb) and MN (&#x007E;200kb) across eight species of codfishes that are separated by up to 70 million years of evolution. The highly continuous assemblies &#x2013; capturing both intergenic and coding sequences &#x2013; revealed overall conserved genetic organization and synteny of the <italic>Hb</italic> genes within this lineage, yet with several, lineage-specific gene duplications. Moreover, for some of the species examined we identified amino acid substitutions at two sites in the <italic>Hbb1</italic> gene as well as length polymorphisms in its regulatory region, which has previously been linked to temperature adaptation in Atlantic cod populations. Taken together, our study highlights the efficiency of targeted long-read capture for comparative genomic studies by shedding light on the evolutionary history of the <italic>Hb</italic> gene family across the highly divergent group of codfishes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing has over the last decade revolutionized genomic research with the increasing numbers of whole genome resources available for multiple vertebrate species, including the diverse group of teleost fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Volff 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ellegren 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goodwin <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Malmstr&#x00F8;m <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, whole genome sequencing (WGS) and generation of high quality genome assemblies are still considered costly and time-consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jones and Good 2015</xref>). For investigations concerning specific genomic regions there is no need for complete genome information, which has spurred the development of reduction complexity approaches such as targeted sequence capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Teer <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grover <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Samorodnitsky <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). The basic idea of targeted sequence capture involves design of specific probes covering the particular genomic area of interest generating an enriched coverage of the targeted sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Turner <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grover <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Most studies using targeted sequence capture have to a large extent been directed towards the exome, often supported by the existence of a reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ng <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Broeckx <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yoshihara <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>), or transcriptome assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Syring <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Recent reports have, however, been focusing on off-target sequences in noncoding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guo <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Samuels <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Syring <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yoshihara <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Morin <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>), as they may contain crucial regulatory elements varying in sequence and length between populations or species, and could be of functional and evolutionary importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Woolfe <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Patrushev and Kovalenko 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, sequence capture studies have so far been based on short-read sequencing technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">George <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Samorodnitsky <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bragg <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>), and construction of continuous sequences enabling resolution of gene organization have therefore not been possible. Comparative genetic studies of gene organization or synteny requires longer, more continuous stretches of DNA containing more than one gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huddleston <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). By its ability to span long stretches of repeats, long-read sequencing technology has been successfully applied to improve genome assembly statistics and generation of highly continuous genome assemblies for a growing number of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">English <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bickhart <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Korlach <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">T&#x00F8;rresen <italic>et al</italic>. 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">T&#x00F8;rresen <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>). For example, incorporation of long PacBio reads resulted in a significantly improved version of the Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>) genome assembly, i.e. a 50-fold increase in sequence continuity and a 15-fold reduction in the proportion of gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">T&#x00F8;rresen <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>). Correspondingly, utilizing long-read sequencing technology in combination with targeted capture could yield longer continuous assemblies of specific genomic regions of interest, allowing in-depth comparative genetic studies, even in species where a reference genome is not available.</p>
<p>In fishes, the hemoglobin (<italic>Hb</italic>) gene family, encoding the protein subunits Hba and Hbb, has shown to be of importance for ecological adaptation, as environmental factors such as temperature directly influences the ability of Hb to bind O<sub>2</sub> at respiratory surfaces and its subsequent release to tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wells 2005</xref>). In a recent report, a full characterization of the <italic>Hb</italic> gene repertoire &#x2013; using comparative genomics analysis &#x2013; uncovered a remarkably high <italic>Hb</italic> gene copy variation within the codfishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). Notably, a negative correlation between the number of <italic>Hb</italic> genes and depth of which the species occur was observed, suggesting that the more variable environment in epipelagic waters have facilitated a larger and more diverse <italic>Hb</italic> gene repertoire, which was supported by evidence of diversifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). Furthermore, in Atlantic cod, two tightly linked polymorphisms at amino acid positions 55 and 62 of the Hbb1-globin &#x2013; suggested to be associated with thermal adaptation &#x2013; exhibit a latitudinal cline in allele frequency in populations inhabiting varying temperature and oxygen regimes in the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andersen <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Populations found in the southern regions display the Hbb1-1 variant (Met55Lys62), whereas more northern populations largely display the Hbb1-2 variant (Val55Ala62) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andersen <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Hbb1-1 variant has been shown to be insensitive to temperature whereas Hbb1-2 is temperature dependent with a higher O<sub>2</sub> affinity than Hbb1-1 at colder temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Karpov and Novikov 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andersen <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>), however, this has been questioned by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barlow <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). Additionally, an indel polymorphism within the promoter of the <italic>Hbb1</italic> gene has been reported to be in linkage disequilibrium with the above-mentioned polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Star <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Examination of multiple Atlantic cod populations uncovered that a longer promoter variant is associated with <italic>Hbb1-2</italic> and found to up-regulate its gene expression at higher temperatures, i.e. aiding in the maintenance of total oxygen-carrying capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Star <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In teleosts, the <italic>Hb</italic> genes are found to reside at two distinct genomic regions &#x2013; the MN and LA cluster. Earlier reports have shown that there is a high evolutionary turnover of <italic>Hb</italic> genes across teleosts, with lineage-specific duplications and losses, which is in stark contrast to genes flanking the <italic>Hb</italic> genes, where the synteny is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Quinn <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Opazo <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Feng <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). In this study, the overall goal was to elucidate the evolutionary past of the <italic>Hb</italic> clusters &#x2013; including <italic>Hb</italic> genes, flanking genes and intergenic sequences &#x2013; within the phylogenetically diverse group of codfishes (Gadiformes) by taking the advantage of long read sequencing technology combined with targeted sequence capture. Eight codfish species were carefully selected on the basis of both phylogenetic and habitat divergence, implying that they are exposed to a variety of environmental factors as well as displaying distinct life-history traits. A highly continuous genome assembly of Atlantic cod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">T&#x00F8;rresen <italic>et al</italic>. 2017b</xref>) as well as low coverage draft genome assemblies of all eight species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Malmstr&#x00F8;m <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>) were used in the design of the probes covering the genomic regions of interest. To enable targeted sequence capture for PacBio RSII sequencing, we modified the standard protocol for sequence capture offered by NimbleGen, i.e. the SeqCap EZ (Roche NimbleGen), as well as generating custom-made barcodes. This combined approach resulted in successful capturing and assembling of the two <italic>Hb</italic> gene clusters across the codfishes examined. The generation of highly continuous assemblies &#x2013; for most of the species &#x2013; enabled reconstruction of micro-synteny revealing lineage-specific gene duplications and identification of a relatively large and inter-species variable indel located in the promoter region between the <italic>Hbb1</italic> and <italic>Hba1</italic> genes.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates that this approach, combining sequence capture technology with long-read sequencing is a highly efficient and versatile method to investigate specific genomic regions of interest &#x2013; with respect to micro-synteny, regulatory regions and genetic organization &#x2013; across distantly related species where genome sequences are lacking.</p>

<title>Capture and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the target regions</title>
<p>The capture probe design (workflow schematically shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) resulted in a total of 7057 probes based on the target region in Atlantic cod, covering 337 kbp of sequence. 26774 probes were designed for the additional codfishes, covering in total an area of 1.82 Mbp of target sequence. The target region and the <italic>Hb</italic> gene clusters were successfully captured and enriched for eight codfishes; Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>), haddock (<italic>Melanogrammus aeglefinus)</italic>, silvery pout (<italic>Gadiculus argenteus</italic>), cusk (<italic>Brosme brosme</italic>), burbot (<italic>Lota lota</italic>), European hake (<italic>Merluccius merluccius</italic>), marbled moray cod (<italic>Muraenolepus marmoratus</italic>), and roughhead grenadier (<italic>Macrourus berglax</italic>), with number of reads spanning from 35573 to 73005 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The average read length was 3032 bp, varying from 2836 bp in European hake to 3265 bp in burbot, resulting in the capture of an average of 16.71 Mbp per species (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). By mapping reads back to the capture target region we found that the average mapping depth was variable across the target region for all species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Because of the skewed distribution of mapping depth, we also calculated median depth, which was, as expected, the highest for Atlantic cod at 242x (Table S1). The median mapping depth was consistently high for most of the other species as well, with the lowest for roughhead grenadier (12x). Both median and average depths for the MN region are persistently higher than for the LA region for all species, with the exception of silvery pout (Table S1). Furthermore, positions with high degree of mapping corresponded to the location of the genes used in the design of the capture probes across all species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The percentage of reads mapping to the target region ranged from 25-43&#x0025;, however, the percentage of the target region covered by reads ranged from 53-100&#x0025; with five species having more than 90&#x0025; of the target region covered by reads (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref> and Table S1).</p>

<p>To address factors influencing capture success we compared various capture statistics to overall genomic divergence between the Atlantic cod genome and independent WGS data for each species from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Malmstr&#x00F8;m <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>) (Table S1). We found a strong negative correlation between genomic divergence to Atlantic cod and median mapping depth against the target region (r=-0.90, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>), percent of reads mapped to the target region (r=-0.90, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>), and percentage of reads mapped to the target region (r=-0.84, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>).</p>
<p>We constructed <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies with quite consistent assembly statistics across species. Contig N50 ranged from 8055 bp in burbot to 6523 bp in European hake and the total number of contigs varied from 205 in burbot to 455 in marbled moray cod. However, there was some variation in the size of the largest contig, which ranged from 79 kbp in Atlantic cod to 30 kbp in marbled moray cod (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). To evaluate whether the assemblies represent the actual target regions we mapped the <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies for each species to the target region in Atlantic cod, for which the capture design is largely based upon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). As expected, the assemblies corresponded to the regions with high coverage of reads, i.e. the areas of the target region containing genes included in the probe design.</p>

<title>Synteny of the <italic>Hb</italic> gene regions</title>
<p>Our capture design combined with long-read PacBio sequencing allowed us to reconstruct micro-synteny of the MN and LA regions for Atlantic cod, haddock, silvery pout, cusk, burbot, European hake, marbled moray cod and roughhead grenadier (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). From the <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies, we were able to identify the majority of the <italic>Hb</italic> genes and all of the flanking genes, which show that our capture design was successful. However, the degree of continuity varied in the different assemblies. In Atlantic cod, haddock, silvery pout, cusk, burbot and European hake we could infer micro-synteny revealing that <italic>Hb</italic> and their flanking genes organization largely followed what has previously been reported for Atlantic cod (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Star <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).

The amount of repetitive sequences in the target region differed between the MN cluster and the LA cluster in Atlantic cod.

<title>Capture of <italic>Hb</italic> gene clusters with 70 million years divergence time reveal conserved synteny and lineage-specific <italic>Hb</italic> duplications</title>
<p>We here demonstrate a successful in-solution targeted sequence capture and assembling of coding and noncoding sequences of the <italic>Hb</italic> clusters from codfish species separated by up to 70 million years (My) of evolution. Two features make our approach unique from earlier studies. First, the target regions consisted of both coding and noncoding genomic sequences. Second, we designed capture of large fragments &#x2013; combined with development of custom-made probes &#x2013; in order to utilize the long-read PacBio sequencing platform. This is in contrast to current targeted capture sequencing protocols that are based on short-read sequencing technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">George <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mascher <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The organization and orientation of the <italic>Hb</italic> flanking genes that we identified were conserved across all species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref> and b). However, in concordance with earlier studies of the <italic>Hb</italic> region, we found significant variation in copy numbers of the <italic>Hb</italic> genes, with linage specific duplications and losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Star <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Opazo <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Feng <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). We only found <italic>Hbb4</italic> in Atlantic cod, supporting earlier studies showing that <italic>Hbb4</italic> is the result of a recent duplication in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Borza <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the presence of two copies of <italic>Hbb2</italic> on the same contig in the roughhead grenadier <italic>de novo</italic> assembly confirmed a lineage specific gene duplication of <italic>Hbb2</italic>, which was found in a recent study of <italic>Hb</italic>s in codfishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). Additionally, a copy of the <italic>Hba4</italic> was found in the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the marbled moray cod not found in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). The presence of a frame-shifting mutation that is causing multiple stop codons indicated that this <italic>Hba4</italic> gene is most likely a pseudogene. <italic>Hba4</italic> is also a pseudogene in the closely related species <italic>Mora moro</italic>, <italic>Trachyrincus scabrus</italic>, <italic>T. murrayi</italic> and <italic>Melanonus zugmayeri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). Although we identified most of the <italic>Hb</italic> genes from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>), a few were absent from this dataset (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref> and b), which we suspect may be due to collapse of paralogous <italic>Hb</italic> genes, as they may have as high as 98&#x0025; sequence identity (Table S2).</p>

<title>Length variation in the bi-directional <italic>Hba1-Hbb1</italic> promoter within the codfishes</title>
<p>The discovery of a promoter of variable length between <italic>Hba1</italic> and <italic>Hbb1</italic> in different species (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) was concordant with earlier findings of length variation in the homologous region in different populations of Atlantic cod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Star <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). The migratory NEAC population has been shown to harbor the 73 bp longer variant at a higher frequency compared to coastal cod populations (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Star <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>)). Interestingly, we found relatively long promoters with high sequence similarity to the NEAC indel in haddock and silvery pout. In contrast, cusk displayed a relatively short promoter, however, still 17 bp longer than in NCC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, we found the amino acid positions 55 and 62 in <italic>Hbb1</italic>, known to be polymorphic in Atlantic cod, to be variable across all codfishes included in this study (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Investigations of the same positions in a number additional codfishes for which we have available gene sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>), revealed that these positions are highly variable across this linage (Table S2). Notably, the most likely ancestral state of codfish <italic>Hbb1</italic> is Met55Lys62 (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). Cusk and the coastal/southern Atlantic cod thus both display the ancestral state as well as a short promoter, although the cusk promoter was 17 bp longer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest two different scenarios for promoter length evolution. Scenario 1: The short promoter represents the ancestral state of the Gadidae-family (including cusk and Atlantic cod; see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Malmstr&#x00F8;m <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>)) and that silvery pout and some populations of Atlantic cod have evolved a longer promoter. Scenario 2: The long promoter is the ancestral state with independent deletions of variable lengths in cusk, silvery pout, haddock and costal/southern Atlantic cod (<italic>Hbb1-1</italic>). To disentangle this, we would need to obtain promoter sequences from additional gadiform species. Regardless, the short-long promoter polymorphism has been maintained throughout speciation events based on the presence of both variants in Atlantic cod. Moreover, in both scenarios, cusk and Atlantic cod (<italic>Hbb1-1</italic>) have maintained the ancestral Met55Lys62, while silvery pout, haddock and Atlantic cod (<italic>Hbb1-2</italic>) have acquired substitutions at these positions due to similar selection pressures or genetic drift. In this regard, it could be mentioned that the NEAC, haddock and silvery pout display migratory behavior (e.g. diurnally feeding movements as well as seasonal spawning migrations) compared to the more stationary cusk and coastal cod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eschemeyer and Fricke 2017</xref>) which could mean that they have a higher O<sub>2</sub> demand and are exposed to greater temperature variation, which in turn has selected for a temperature-dependent long promoter. Furthermore, given that promoter length and positions 55/62 at <italic>Hbb1</italic> are important genetic components of temperature adaptation in Atlantic cod populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Star <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>), they most likely play a role in temperature adaptation in the other codfishes.</p>

<title>Assembly success affected by probe design and repeat content</title>
<p>In some species, nearly the complete target region is assembled in large contigs containing multiple genes including cusk, whereas in other species such as the more distantly related roughhead grenadier, the cluster is more fragmented (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In all species, the areas of the target regions that harbor genes of which probes are designed for, as well as any areas containing repeated sequences, have very high depths in comparison to the areas of intergenic sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This poses a challenge for the assembly software, which is based in the assumption of uniform depth over the sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miller <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the MN cluster seems to be more successfully assembled than the LA cluster, which is more fragmented (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Differences in assembly completeness between the two regions might be a result of several factors. Firstly, the MN region has more flanking genes in closer proximity to the <italic>Hb</italic> region, which results in a higher density of probes. Secondly, the overall repeat content of the LA region is one order of magnitude larger than in the MN region, largely due to the larger proportion of simple repeats. Repeat content is a major interference in capture experiments because unwanted repetitive DNA may be enriched for, especially if there are repeated sequences included in the probe design. Furthermore, if probes were not completely covered by target DNA they get single-stranded sticky ends that can hybridize to repetitive or other non-target DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Newman and Austin 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, unless there were some longer reads that bridged such areas, this would in turn have led to gaps in the downstream <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies. Following that the assembly success was possibly a result of read length, we reason that a future increase of the average read length from 3 kbp to 5-10 kbp, would be sufficient to substantially increase the completeness of the assemblies. Due to the current circular consensus (CCS) PacBio sequencing technology, however, which is a trade-off between accuracy and length of reads, longer reads with sufficient accuracy are not feasible.</p>

<title>Long-read sequencing capture across species harbors new potential for comparative genomic studies</title>
<p>The number of reads mapping to the target region was in the range of 23-43&#x0025;, which may seem low compared with other capture studies. For instance, a whole exome capture study on humans reported 56.1&#x0025; of reads mapped to the target region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guo <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) and a similar study in rats reported to have 78.3&#x0025; of reads on target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yoshihara <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). In contrast to our study however, these capture experiments enriched either the exome or ultra-conserved elements within a single species.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we were able to cover up to 98&#x0025; of the target region with >10 reads across species (Table S1) which is similar to what mentioned experiments within human and rat exomes reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guo <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yoshihara <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>) and the main difference is the higher percentage of non-target sequences in our study.</p>
<p>We were able to capture complete genes for species with 70 My divergence time from the Atlantic cod (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). As expected, we found that capture success declines with increased sequence divergence between the reference genome of which we chiefly based our capture probes and the genomes of the included codfishes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). It has been reported that orthologous exons were successfully captured in highly divergent frog species (with 200 My of separation), nevertheless the capture success greatly decreased with increased evolutionary distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hedtke <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to capture >97&#x0025; of orthologous sequences in four species of primates that diverged from humans 40 My ago, using probes entirely based on the human exome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">George <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Further, exomes were effectively captured from skink species that diverged up to 80 My from the reference, yet reporting a substantial decline in capture efficiency for sequences >10 &#x0025; different from the reference species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bragg <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Our study stands out from previous capture experiments because intergenic, noncoding sequences in addition to genes were captured. Efficient capture of intergenic sequences requires less divergence time, as these regions usually evolve faster than genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Koonin and Wolf 2010</xref>). Thus, the most distantly related species from Atlantic cod for which we captured both coding and noncoding sequences was burbot, which diverged from Atlantic cod 46 My (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). We argue, in line with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schott <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>), that sequence divergence may be a more exact predictor of capture success than evolutionary distance, as the sequence capture process is mainly influenced by the difference between the probe sequence and the target sequence. European hake, marbled moray cod and roughhead grenadier all diverged from cod about 70 My ago, however, the European hake <italic>Hb</italic> regions was more successfully captured and assembled (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>This could be due to European hake having a lower genome-wide divergence to Atlantic cod than marbled moray cod and roughhead grenadier (809k vs 879k and 907k SNPs; Table S1).</p>
<p>Finally, it should be mentioned that cusk &#x2013; which diverged from Atlantic cod 39 My ago &#x2013; was added to the experimental design after the species-specific probes were generated. Thus, the successful capture of cusk was therefore solely based on cross-species target enrichment, and could most likely been further improved if species-specific probes for this species have been included.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks and future perspectives</title>
<p>Here, we have successfully demonstrated that combining targeted sequence capture with long-read sequencing technology is as an efficient approach to obtain high quality sequence data of a specific genomic region, including both coding and noncoding sequences, across evolutionary distant species. We show that genome-wide divergence is of importance for capture success across species. Furthermore, the use of long-read sequencing augmented the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of regions containing repeated sequences that would otherwise fragment assemblies based on short-read sequencing. This is crucial for capturing complete intergenic sequences that may be highly divergent compared to genic regions even among fairly closely related species. Given the rapid development in sequencing technologies future methods will enable read-through of repeated regions and thus further increase the completeness of assemblies. Moreover, a less stringent hybridization protocol should make it possible to capture sequences across even deeper evolutionary time. In sum, our approach has the potential of enhancing comparative genomic studies of continuous genic and intergenic regions between any eukaryotic species-group where genomic resources are scarce.</p>

In addition, species-specific probes were designed based on low-coverage assembled genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Malmstr&#x00F8;m <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>) for ten selected species representing six families in the Gadiformes order. These species were Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>), Alaskan Pollock (<italic>Gadus chalcogrammus</italic>), polar cod (<italic>Boreogadus saida</italic>), haddock (<italic>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</italic>), Silvery pout (<italic>Gadiculus argenteus</italic>), burbot (<italic>Lota lota</italic>), European hake (<italic>Merluccius merluccius</italic>), roughhead grenadier (<italic>Macrourus berglax</italic>), roughsnout grenadier (<italic>Trachyrincus scabrus</italic>) and marbled moray cod (<italic>Muraenolepus marmoratus</italic>).</p>
<p>To retrieve relevant sequence data for the probe design, the MN and LA <italic>Hb</italic> regions were extracted from gadMor2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These sequences, hereby known as the target region, were then used queries in BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Altschul <italic>et al</italic>. 1990</xref>) searches with an E-value threshold of &#x003C;0.1 against the genome assembly data of all ten species.</p>
<p>In total, 5604 sequences from the chosen species were supplied to NimbleGen probe design. Protein coding genes from the ENSEMBL database were used to define the regions to be tiled in the probe design (Table S5) within the target region of the Atlantic cod, and the unitigs for each of the additional codfishes.</p>
<p>NimbleGen SeqCap EZ capture probes were designed by NimbleGen (Roche, Madison, USA) using a proprietary design algorithm. NimbleGen offers an in-solution sequence capture protocol, which includes custom made probes. Uniquely, the capture probes from NimbleGen are tiled to overlap the target area. 50 &#x2013; 100 bp (average 75 bp) probes where designed tiled over the target region (subset of gadMor2) resulting in each base, on average, being covered by two probes.</p>
<p>Additionally, raw reads from Illumina sequencing from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Malmstr&#x00F8;m <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>) were used for each species to estimate repetitive sequences in each of the species&#x2019; genomes, aiming to discard probes containing any repeats.</p>

After amplification, fragment length distribution was evaluated using Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and samples were pooled in equimolar ratio.</p>
<p>During hybridization, SeqCap EZ Developer Reagent (universal repeat blocker for use on vertebrate genomes) and oligos corresponding to Illumina and PacBio barcodes were used for blocking. Captured gDNA was amplified to ensure that sufficient amount of DNA was available for PacBio library preparation. Size selection of the libraries was performed using BluePippin. Final libraries were quality checked using Bioanalyzer and Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and sequenced on RS II instrument (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) using P6-C4 chemistry with 360 minutes movie time. In total, 9 SMRT cells were used for sequencing.</p>

<title><italic>De novo</italic> assemblies</title>
<p>Reads were filtered and de-multiplexed using the &#x2018;RS_reads of insert.1&#x2019; pipeline on SMRT Portal (SMRT Analysis version smrtanalysis_2.3.0.140936.p2.144836). Each set of reads corresponding to a given species was crossed-checked with their respective six-nucleotide Illumina adapter. Reads containing an incorrect Illumina adapter were removed. Adapter sequences were then trimmed using the application Prinseq-lite v0.20.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schmieder and Edwards 2011</xref>). The trimmed reads were assembled <italic>de novo</italic> using Canu v1.4 &#x002B;155 changes (r8150 c0a988b6a106c27c6f993dfe586d2336282336a6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berlin <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). The Canu software is optimized for assembling single molecule high noise sequence data. We specified genome size as the size of the target region (300 kbp). Additionally, we ran PBJelly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">English <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) on the Canu <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies, using the raw reads to possible bridge gaps between scaffolds, settings given in Supplementary Materials and Methods.</p>
<p>We assessed the assemblies by running Assemblathon 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bradnam <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>), which reports assembly metrics such as the longest contig, the number of contigs, and the N50 value. <italic>De novo</italic> assemblies of the MN and LA regions of Atlantic cod and haddock were aligned and compared to their reference genomes, gadMor2 and melAeg respectively, using BLAST and BWA v0.7.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>) to determine syntenic similarities and assembly completeness.</p>

<title>Estimating capture success</title>
<p>PacBio reads for all the species were mapped back to the Atlantic cod genome assembly (gadMor2) in order to determine sequence capture success and target mapping depths. Mapping was done using BWA-MEM v0.7.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>). Target-area read depth for all the species based on mapping against gadMor2, were calculated using Samtools v1.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). We calculated both average and median mapping depth against the target region as a whole and for the MN and LA region separately. We also calculated percentage of reads that mapped to the target region, and the percentage of the target regions covered by reads to a minimum depth of 10x. To compare assemblies to the target region we additionally mapped the assemblies to the target region. In order to verify the sequence capture process, sequence data for Atlantic cod and haddock were mapped back to their reference genomes using BWA-mem v0.7.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>). The results were visualized using Integrative Genome Viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To obtain an independent measure of divergence between species in the capture experiment we calculated genome wide level of divergence of each species to the reference genome of Atlantic cod using low-coverage whole-genome sequence data from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Malmstr&#x00F8;m <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). We mapped raw reads to Atlantic cod using BWA-MEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>) and called SNPs using the Freebayes variant caller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garrison and Marth 2017</xref>). Some species are more closely related to Atlantic cod than others, which could introduce a bias in mapping. To avoid this, we only looked at genomic regions where all species mapped. The number of SNPs was then used as an estimate of genome-wide divergence of each species to Atlantic cod. We also mapped a low-coverage genome of Atlantic cod to the Atlantic cod reference genome as a control.</p>
<p>In pursuance of factors explaining capture success we tested for correlations and plotted the relationship between the genome wide level of divergence and the following variables; median mapping depth against the target region (for total, LA and MN, respectively); percentage of reads that mapped to the target region; and the percentage of the target region covered by reads. All tests and plots were done using R version 3.2.5(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Team 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Assembly continuity is very often hampered by the presence of repeats, which create gaps. We therefore quantified repeat-content in the target region extracted from gadMor2 and orthologous regions in haddock using Repeatmasker Open 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Smit <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) for the MN region and the LA region separately.</p>

<title>Identifying gene location and synteny</title>
<p>In order to identify the genes of interest and their location in the assembly we used local sequence alignment algorithm BLAST v2.4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Altschul <italic>et al</italic>. 1990</xref>) with protein sequences of the genes of interest (Table S5) as queries. tblastn was used with an e-value of 0.1. Investigation of <italic>Hbb1-Hba1</italic> promoter region was done for four species, Atlantic cod, haddock, silvery cod and cusk. Sequences were aligned with ClustalW default settings using MEGA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Ancestral sequence reconstruction was carried out for <italic>Hbb-1</italic> gene sequences from 24 species of codfishes from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>) using a maximum likelihood method implemented in MEGA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, we estimated sequence identity using EMBOSS Needle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rice <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>) with default settings, between <italic>Hbb</italic> gene sequences from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baalsrud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>) that where missing and present in the <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies to evaluate similarity (Table S2).</p>
