<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The mechanisms by which different microbes colonize the healthy human gut versus free-living communities, other body sites, or the gut in disease states remain largely unknown. Identifying microbial genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis. We propose a statistical approach to this problem that measures the association between having a gene and the probability that a species is present in the gut microbiome. The challenge is that closely related species tend to be jointly present or absent in the microbiome and also share many genes, only a subset of which are involved in gut adaptation. We show that this phylogenetic correlation indeed leads to many false discoveries and propose phylogenetic linear regression as a powerful solution. To apply this method across the bacterial tree of life, where most species have not been experimentally phenotyped, we used metagenomes from hundreds of people to quantify each species&#x2019; prevalence in and specificity for the gut microbiome. This analysis revealed thousands of genes potentially involved across species in adaptation to the gut, including many novel candidates as well as processes known to contribute to fitness of gut bacteria, such as acid tolerance in Bacteroidetes and sporulation in Firmicutes. We also found microbial genes associated with a preference for the gut over other body sites, which were significantly enriched for genes linked to fitness in an in vivo competition experiment. Finally, we identified gene families associated with higher prevalence in patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease, including Proteobacterial genes involved in conjugation and fimbria regulation, processes previously linked to inflammation. These gene targets may represent new avenues for modulating host colonization and disease. Our strategy of combining metagenomics with phylogenetic modeling is general and can be used to identify genes associated with adaptation to any environment.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Why do certain microbes and not others colonize our gut, and why do they differ between healthy and sick people? One explanation is the genes in their genomes. If we can find microbial genes involved in gut adaptation, we may be able to keep out pathogens and encourage the growth of beneficial microbes. One could look for genes that were present more often in prevalent microbes, and less often in rare ones. However, this ignores that similar species may have related phenotypes simply because of common ancestry. To solve this problem, we used a method from ecology that accounts for phylogenetic relatedness. We first calculated gut prevalence phenotypes for thousands of species using a compedium of shotgun sequencing data, then tested for gene associations. We found genes that are associated with overall gut prevalence, with a preference for the gut over other body sites, and with the gut in Crohn&#x2019;s disease vs. health. Many of these findings have biological plausibility based on existing literature. We also showed agreement with the results of a previously published high-throughput screen of bacterial gene knockouts in mice. These results, and this type of analysis, may eventually lead to new strategies for maintaining gut health.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Microbes that colonize the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract have a wide variety of effects on their hosts, ranging from beneficial to harmful. Increasing evidence shows that commensal gut microbes are responsible for training and modulating the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], protecting against inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] and pathogen invasion (reviewed in Sassone-Corsi and Rafiatellu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]), affecting GI motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], maintaining the intestinal barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], and potentially even affecting mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In contrast, pathogens (and conditionally-pathogenic microbes, or &#x201C;pathobionts&#x201D;) can induce and worsen inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], increase the risk of cancer in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], and cause potentially life-threatening infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Additionally, the transplantation of microbes from a healthy host (fecal microbiota transplant, or FMT) is also a highly effective therapy for some gut infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], although it is still an active area of investigation why certain microbes from the donor persist long-term and others do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], and how pre-existing inflammatory disease affects FMT efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Which microbes are able to persist in the GI tract, and why some persist instead of others, is therefore a question with consequences that directly impact human health.</p>
<p>Because of this, we are interested in the specific mechanisms by which microbes colonize the gut, avoiding other potential fates such as being killed in the harsh stomach environment, simply passing through the GI tract transiently, or being outcompeted by other gut microbes. Understanding these mechanisms could yield opportunities to design better probiotics and to prevent invasion of the gut community by pathogens. In particular, creating new therapies, whether those are drugs, engineered bacterial strains, or rationally designed communities, will likely require an understanding of gut colonization at the level of individual microbial genes. We also anticipate that these mechanisms may vary in health vs. disease, since, for example, different selective pressures are known to be present in inflamed versus healthy guts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>One approach that has been used to link genetic features to a phenotype is to correlate the two using observational data. Most typically, this approach is applied in the form of genome-wide association mapping, in which phenotypes are correlated with genetic markers across individuals in a population. While we are interested in comparing phenotypes and genetic features <italic>across</italic>, rather than within species, the approach we take in this paper is conceptually similar. In order to perform association mapping, it is necessary to account for population structure, that is, dependencies resulting from common ancestry; otherwise, spurious discoveries can be made in genome-wide association studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Analogously, we expected it to be important to choose a method that can account for the confounding effect of phylogeny when testing for associations across species.</p>
<p>There is increasing interest in using phylogenetic information to make better inferences about associations between microbes and quantities of interest. For example, co-conservation patterns of genes (&#x201C;correlogs&#x201D;) have been used to assign functions to microbial genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], and genome-wide association studies have been applied within a genus of soil bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Recent publications have also described techniques that use information from the taxonomic tree to more accurately link clades in compositional taxonomic data to covariates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, so far, only one study has attempted to associate genes with a preference for the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. That study introduced a valuable method based on UniFrac and gene-count distances, which compares how well gut-vs. non-gut-associated microbes cluster on the species tree compared to a composite gene tree. This study also provides an important insight in the form of evidence of convergence of glycoside hydrolase and glycosyltransferase repertoires among gut bacteria, suggesting horizontal gene transfer within the gut community to deal with a common evolutionary pressure. The method described in that study, though, requires a binary phenotype of gut presence vs. absence. Deciding which microbes are &#x201C;gut&#x201D; vs. &#x201C;non-gut&#x201D; requires manual curation and can be somewhat subjective, as microbes have a continuous range of prevalences and can appear in multiple environments; this binarization could also potentially decrease power by excluding microbes with intermediate phenotypes. The method also requires multiple sequence alignments and trees to be built for every gene family under analysis, which are computationally intensive to generate over a large set of genomes.</p>
<p>We take a complementary approach and use a flexible technique, known as phylogenetic linear modeling, to detect associations between microbial genotype and phenotype while accounting for the fact that microbes are related to one another by vertical descent. Phylogenetic linear models have an extensive history in the ecology literature dating back to seminal works by Felsenstein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] and Grafen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. However, despite their power, genome-scale applications of these models are still few in number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and have typically been used to relate traits of macroorganisms (e.g., anole lizards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]) to their genotypes. While there is a growing appreciation for the need to explicitly account for phylogeny in microbial community analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], we believe ours is the first study to apply this class of methods to microbiome data.</p>
<p>Our approach to accounting for phylogenetic relationships is general and could be applied to measure association of any quantitative trait with genotypes or other binary or quantitative characteristics. In this study, we focus on phenotypes related to the ability of bacteria to colonize the human gut: 1. overall prevalence in the guts of hosts from a specific population (e.g., post-industrialized countries), which we expect to capture ease of transmission, how cosmopolitan microbes are, and how efficiently they colonize the gut; 2. a preference for the gut over other human body sites in the same hosts, which we expect to capture gut colonization more specifically; and 3. a preference for the gut in disease (e.g., Crohn&#x2019;s disease) versus health. We present a novel method to estimate these quantitative phenotypes for thousands of bacterial species directly from existing shotgun metagenomics data, both obviating the need for us to draw a cutoff between &#x201C;gut&#x201D; and &#x201C;non-gut&#x201D; microbes, and also giving us the necessary power to detect associations. Coupling these phenotype estimates with phylogenetic linear models, we generate a compendium of thousands of bacterial genes whose functions may be involved in colonizing the human gut.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We present a phylogeny-aware method for modeling associations between the presence of specific genes in bacterial genomes and quantitative traits that measure how common these species are in the human microbiome. To apply phylogenetic linear modeling to the microbiome, we needed to solve three problems. First, we had to show that these models controlled false positives and had reasonable power on large bacterial phylogenies. Second, we needed to develop estimators that captured meaningful traits related to bacterial colonization of humans for thousands of diverse bacterial species, most of which had not been directly phenotyped. The third problem was to estimate genotypes (e.g., gene presence/absence) for each species. The analysis framework we describe is quite general and could be easily extended to link other traits to genotypes across the tree of life.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic linear models solve the problem of high false positive rates when testing for associations on bacterial phylogenies</title>
<p>To test for associations between continuous traits and binary phenotypes across species, we use models with the following form:
<disp-formula id="eqn1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p><italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> is the quantitative trait value of species <italic>T</italic>, <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>0</sub> is a baseline level of <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub>, <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>1,<italic>g</italic></sub> is the effect of gene <italic>g</italic> on <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub>, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> is an indicator variable (0 if the gene is ab sent in species <italic>T</italic> and 1 if present), and <italic>&#x03F5;</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> is the remaining unmodeled variation in <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub>. The distribution of the residuals <italic>&#x03F5;</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> is the key difference between standard and phylogenetic linear models. In the standard model, the residuals are assumed to be independent and normally distributed. In the phylogenetic model, however, the residuals covary, with more closely-related species having greater covariance (see Methods).</p>
<p>To explore the potential pitfalls of failing to correct for phylogenetic structure in cross-species association tests, we generated a species tree for thousands of bacteria with genome sequences (see Methods). In order to have a consistent operational definition of a microbial species, we used a set of previously defined bacterial taxonomic units with approximately 95&#x0025; pairwise average nucleotide identity across the entire genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. The methods we describe can be applied to other taxonomic levels or with other species definitions. Using this species tree, we performed simulations for each of the four major bacterial phyla in the human gut (Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria). Specifically, we generated continuous traits with phylogenetic signal along the species tree, and then, for each continuous trait, simulated a binary trait for each species that was correlated with the continuous trait to varying degrees including no association. We used levels of correlation spanning those we observe between prevalence of species in gut metagenomes and presence/absence of genes (see below).</p>
<p>We then fit phylogenetic and standard linear models to the simulated data and tested for a relationship between each binary trait and its corresponding continuous trait. For both standard and phylogenetic linear models, separate models were fit for each of the four phyla. The results were used to estimate false positive rate (Type I error) and power (1 - Type II error) for the two methods across different effect sizes.</p>
<p>These analyses showed that standard linear models result in many false positive associations. When the binary trait was specified to be wholly uncorrelated (i.e., under the null), <italic>p</italic>-value from the linear model showed a strong anticonservative bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>, right) with many more significant <italic>p</italic>-value than expected under no correlation. In contrast, the phylogenetic linear model <italic>p</italic>-value distribution was fiat and Type I error was controlled appropriately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>, left). This means that at the same <italic>p</italic>-value threshold, linear models will identify many spurious relationships compared to phylogenetic linear models. Further, our simulations with non-zero associations showed that the phylogenetic model has high power when applied to gut bacterial phyla, even for small effect sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; see Methods). These results emphasize the importance of using models that account for phylogenetic relationships in cross-species association testing and demonstrate the feasibility of applying phylogenetic linear models to the human microbiome.</p>

<title>Estimating quantitative phenotypes from shotgun data</title>
<p>To apply phylogenetic linear modeling to the microbiome we sought to define meaningful traits for thousands of bacterial species, all of which have genome sequences but most of which have never been phenotyped. The prevalence and specificity of bacterial species in an environment, such as the human gut, are quantitative traits that we hypothesized could be estimated directly from shotgun metagenomics data. The precise taxonomic composition of a healthy gut microbiome can vary significantly from person to person, indicating that the ability of a microbe to colonize the gut is quantitative (and likely context-dependent, and stochastic). This trait can be conceptualized differently depending on which aspects of colonization one wishes to capture. We present metagenome-based estimators for two different types of colonization trait parameters. These are described in the context of our goal of studying the gut microbiome, but the approach is general and could be used to quantify how well a given genotype discriminates species found in or specific to any environment.</p>
<p>The first trait is the probability of observing a species in an environment, that is, its <italic>overall prevalence</italic>. Both genes relating to survival in the GI tract and genes relating to survival, persistence, and dispersal in the outside environment are expected to correlate with overall prevalence. Prevalence can be estimated by the frequency with which the species is observed in a sample from the environment, for example, using a logit transform to enable linear modeling and pseudocounts to avoid estimates of 0 or 1 (see Methods).</p>
<p>The second type of quantitative trait is the <italic>environmental specificity</italic> of a microbial species, which we define as the conditional probability that a sample is derived from a specific environment versus others, given that the species is present in the sample. This parameter captures the power of a given microbe as a marker to discriminate between two or more different environments, such as different body sites or types of hosts. This is distinct from its overall prevalence in the environment.</p>
<p>We developed estimators for two examples of environmental specificity for gut microbes. First, we considered a phenotype defined as the conditional probability that a given body site is the gut and not another body site, given that a particular species is present. The physical distance between body sites is much smaller than the distance between hosts, and microbes from one body site are likely to be transiently-introduced to others. Hence, enrichment of a species in one body site over others is stronger evidence for selection (versus dispersal) than is overall prevalence in that body site alone. We estimate this parameter with a <italic>body-site specificity score</italic> that uses metagenomics data to measure how predictive a particular microbe is for the gut versus other body sites (e.g., skin, urogenital tract, oropharynx, or lung). The score is based on a maximum <italic>a posteriori</italic> (MAP) estimate of the conditional probability of a sample being from the gut given that a microbe is observed in the sample, and it utilizes Laplace regularization, as in the Bayesian lasso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], to perform a type of <italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub>-norm penalization of parameter estimates (see Methods).</p>
<p>The second type of environmental specificity we considered is the conditional probability that a host has a disease given that a particular species is present. This <italic>disease-specific specificity score</italic> is estimated in a similar way to the body-site specificity score (see Methods). We focus on Crohn&#x2019;s disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease known to be associated with dramatic shifts in the gut microbiota and in gutimmune interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Genes associated with this disease-specific prevalence could illuminate differences in selective pressures between healthy vs. diseased gut environments.</p>

<title>Genes associated with species prevalence in healthy human gut metagenomes</title>
<p>We assembled a compendium of published DNA sequencing data from healthy human stool microbiomes across five studies in North America, Europe, and China (433 subjects total). Multiple replicates from the same individual were merged. Using the MIDAS 1.0 database and pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], we mapped metagenomic sequencing reads from each subject to a panel of phylogenetic marker genes, and from these, estimated species relative abundances. We then estimated the prevalence (probability of non-zero abundance) of each species across these subjects, weighting each study equally (see Methods). Finally, we determined gene presence for each species using its pangenome. This approach to genotyping could be elaborated to account for metagenomic sequencing data and assemblies in future work (see Discussion). Our analysis framework can also be applied to genotypes other than gene presence/absence (e.g., nucleotide or amino acid changes).</p>
<p>As expected, the most prevalent species overall included <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides ovatus</italic>, and <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic>, while the least prevalent included halophiles and thermophiles (Supplemental File 1). Gut prevalence had a strong phylogenetic signal (Pagel&#x2019;s <italic>&#x03BB;</italic> = 0.97, likelihood-ratio <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 10<sup>-22</sup>), meaning that it was strongly correlated with the evolutionary relatedness of species. This emphasizes the need for phylogeny aware modeling so that signal linking genes to prevalence will not be drowned out byshared variation in gene content between closely-related species.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the effect of phylogenetic correlation empirically, we fit both a standard linear model and a phylogenetic linear model for each of the four common gut phyla and all genes present in that phylum. These models relate the logit-transformed prevalence of different species in the phylum to a gene&#x2019;s presence/absence in their pangenomes. The models have the following form:
<disp-formula id="eqn2"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) is the prevalence of species <italic>T</italic>, <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>1,<italic>g</italic></sub> captures the association of gene <italic>g</italic> with <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) across species, and the other terms are defined above. The unit of measurement is a species, and each species has a value for <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) mid <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub>. Recall that <italic>&#x03F5;</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> is the residual variation in logit-prevalence, which is independent and normally distributed in the standard linear model but has a distribution encoding correlations proportional to species relatedness in the phylogenetic linear model (see Methods). For both standard and phylogenetic linear models, separate models were fit for each phylum. We modeled associations for 144,651 genes total across the four phyla, fitting 381,846 models total (since some genes are present in multiple phyla).</p>
<p>We used the parameter estimates and their standard errors from fitted models to test null hypotheses of the form <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub>: <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>1,<italic>g</italic></sub> = 0, meting gene <italic>g</italic> is not associated with gut prevalence of species in a particular phylum. The <italic>p</italic>-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR)(see Methods). We found 9,830 genes positively associated with logit-prevalence within at least one phylum (FDR <italic>q</italic> &#x003C; 0.05) using phylogenetic linear models. We observed that 75&#x0025; of the significant genes from these tests had effect sizes larger than (Bacteroidetes) 0.93, (Firmicutes) 1.03, (Proteobacteria) 0.35, and (Actinobacteria) 2.04, which are within the range of effect sizes for which phylogenetic linear models showed good performance in simulations (see above).</p>
<p>With standard linear models our tests identified 25,185 genes associated with gut prevalence, substantially more than with phylogenetic linear models (17.4&#x0025; versus 6.8&#x0025; of total) and, based on our simulations, likely including many false positives. The top results of phylogenetic versus standard linear models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) illustrate the pitfalls of not correcting for phylogenetic correlation. Using the standard model, we recover associations such as those seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>: a subunit of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in Bacteroidetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and in Firmicutes, a particular type of glutamine synthetase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While these associations might look reasonable at a first glance, on closer inspection, they depend on the fact that these genes are near-uniformly present in entire clades of bacteria. These clades are, in general, more prevalent in the gut compared to the rest of the species in the tree. However, any finer structure relating to differences between close neighbors is lost.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="189795_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>While this alone does not necessarily constitute evidence <italic>against</italic> these genes having adaptive functions in the gut, we do expect that matched pheno&#x2010; and genotypic differences between close phylogenetic neighbors offer stronger evidence for an association. An analogy can be drawn with genome-wide association mapping in humans: models that do not account for correlations between sites caused by population structure, as opposed to selective pressure, will tend to identify more spurious associations. In contrast, because the phylogenetic null model &#x201C;expects&#x201D; trait correlations to scale with the evolutionary distance between species, this approach will tend to upweight cases where phylogenetically close relatives have different phenotypes and where distant relatives have similar phenotypes. This leads to the identification of candidate genes that capture more variation between close neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). Thus, phylogenetic linear models will identify genes whose presence in genomes is more frequently changing between sister taxa in association with a trait.</p>
<p>We provided further evidence that this trend is true in general by calculating the phylogenetic signal of the top hits from each model using Ives and Garland&#x2019;s <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. This statistic captures the rate of transitions between having and not having a binary trait (here, a gene) across a tree; higher values therefore correspond to more disagreement between closely related species and lower values correspond to more agreement. Indeed, <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> the phylogenetic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, linear model <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 10<sup>-16</sup>), indicating that these genes&#x2019; presence versus absence tended to be driven more by clade-to-clade differences (i.e., shared evolution).</p>
<p>These results show that standard linear models will identify genes that are truly important for colonizing an environment, such as the healthy human gut, as well as other genes unrelated to the environment but also common in clades with many species that are present in the environment. The latter set will likely include many false positive associations from the perspective of understanding functions necessary for living in the environment. Phylogenetic linear models overcome this problem by accounting for correlations due to both phenotypes and genotypes being more similar amongst closely related species. These conclusions are supported by our simulations and by an <italic>in vivo</italic> functional screen (see below).</p>

<title>Gene families associated with gut prevalence provide insight into colonization biology</title>
<p>Several of the gene families that we observe to be associated with gut prevalence have previously been linked to gut colonization efficiency. For example, in Firmicutes, we noticed that several top hits were annotated as sporulation proteins (e.g., &#x201C;stage IV sporulation protein B&#x201D;, FIG00004463, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Sporulation is known to be a strategy for surviving harsh environments (such as acid, alcohol, and oxygen exposure) that is used by many, but not all, members of Firmicutes. Resistance to oxygen (aerotolerance) is particularly important because many gut Firmicutes are strict anaerobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], sporulation is known to be an important mechanism of transmission and survival in the environment (reviewed in Swick et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]), and sporulation ability has been linked to transmission patterns of gut microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Our result associating sporulation proteins to gut prevalence provides further evidence for sporulation as a strategy that is generally important for the propagation and fitness of gut microbes.</p>
<p>In Bacteroidetes, we observed an association between gut prevalence and the presence of a pair of gene families putatively assigned to the GAD operon, namely, the glutamate decarboxylase <italic>gadB</italic> and the glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antiporter <italic>gadC</italic>. These genes show a complex pattern of presence that is strongly correlated with gut prevalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Results from research in Proteobacteria, where these genes were first described, shows that their products participate in acid tolerance. L-glutamate must be protonated in order to be decarboxylated to GABA; export of GABA coupled to import of fresh L-glutamate therefore allows the net export of protons, raising intracellular pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. It was previously hypothesized that this acid tolerance mechanism allowed bacteria to survive the harshly acidic conditions in the stomach: indeed, if disrupted in the pathogen <italic>Edwardsiella tarda</italic>, gut colonization in a fish model is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> with disrupted Gad systems also become sensitive to porcine gastric fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. However, while it has previously been shown that gut <italic>Bacteroides</italic> do contain homologs for at least one of these genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], their functional importance has not yet been demonstrated in this phylum. Our results provide preliminary evidence that this system may be important in Bacteroidetes as well as in Proteobacteria.</p>

<title>Using body sites as a control allows us to differentiate general dispersal from a specific gut advantage</title>
<p>The previous analyses have focused on modeling the phenotype of overall prevalence in the human gut. However, microbes could be prevalent in the gut for at least two main reasons. First, they could be specifically well-adapted to the human gut; second, they could simply be very common in the environment (i.e., highly dispersed). The presence or absence of a gene family could enhance either of these properties. Some genes might, for example, confer improved stress tolerance that was adaptive across a range of harsh conditions, while others might allow, for example, uptake and catabolism of metabolic substrates that were more common in the human gut than in other environments.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we analyzed the relative enrichment of microbes in the gut over other human body sites in 127 individuals from the Human Microbiome Project study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. We chose other body sites as a control because the physical distance between sites within a host is much smaller than the distance between people, and microbes from one body site are likely to be commonly, if transiently, introduced to other body sites (e.g., skin to oral cavity). To find specifically gut-associated genes, we used the phylogenetic linear model to regress gene presence/absence on the logit-transformed conditional probability <italic>P</italic>(<italic>B</italic> = <italic>gut</italic>\<italic>T</italic>), i.e., the probability that a body site <italic>B</italic> was the human gut given that a particular species <italic>T</italic> was observed, which we estimated using Laplace regularization (see Methods). We identified 4,672 genes whose presence in bacterial genomes was associated with those species being present in the gut versus other body sites in at least one phylum (397 in Bacteroidetes, 1,572 in Firmicutes, 1,284 in Proteobacteria, and 1,507 in Actinobacteria).</p>
<p>Overall, the effect sizes for genes learned from this body site-specific model correlated only moderately with those learned from the &#x201C;gut prevalence&#x201D; models (median <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.06, range &#x2013;0.06&#x2014;0.24), indicating that these two quantitative phenotypes describe distinct phenomena. Additionally, the overlap between significant (<italic>q</italic> &#x2264; 0.05) hits for both models was small (median Jaccard index 0.054, range 0.011&#x2014;0.089). These results are not surprising given that our regularized estimates of gut specificity were only moderately correlated with overall gut prevalence (Spearman&#x2019;s <italic>&#x03C1;</italic> = 0.33, Supplemental Figure SI). This may arise from different genes being involved in dispersal or adaptation to many different environments versus those involved in adaptation specifically to the gut.</p>
<p>Indeed, when we compare enrichments for genes significant in either the body site or overall prevalence models alone (i.e., genes with <italic>q</italic> &#x2264; 0.05 in one model but <italic>q</italic> > 0.5 and/or wrong sign of effect size in the other), we observe large functional shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For example, in the gut prevalence model, but not the body site-specific model, Firmicutes were strongly enriched for &#x201C;dormancy and sporulation&#x201D; (<italic>q</italic> = 8.7 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-7</sup>). Because sporulation is likely useful in a wide range of environments beyond the gut, this result seems intuitive. Body site-specific results for Firmicutes were instead enriched for genes involved in &#x201C;phosphate metabolism&#x201D; (<italic>q</italic> = 0.12) and in particular the term &#x201C;high affinity phosphate transporter and control of PHO regulon&#x201D; (<italic>q</italic> = 0.05).</p>

<p>We also observed biologically-justified individual gene families that were significant in the body sitespecific model but not the overall gut prevalence model. In Firmicutes, for example, carnitine dehydratase and bile acid 7-alpha dehydratase were both significant only in the body site-specific model, suggesting a specific role for these genes within the gut environment. Indeed, bile acids are metabolites of cholesterol that are produced by vertebrates and thus unlikely to be encountered outside of the host. While the metabolite L-carnitine is made and used in organisms spanning the tree of life, it is particularly concentrated in animal tissue and especially red meat, and cannot be further catabolized by humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], making it available to intestinal microbes. Bile acid transformation by gut commensals is a well-established function of the gut microbiome, with complex influences on health (reviewed in Staley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]).</p>
<p>In Bacteroidetes, we found that a homolog of the autoinducer 2 aldolase <italic>IsrF</italic> was significant only in the body site-specific model. Autoinducer 2 is a small signaling molecule produced by a wide range of bacteria that is involved in interspecies quorum sensing. The protein <italic>IsrF</italic>, specifically, is part of an operon whose function in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is to &#x201C;quench&#x201D; or destroy the &#x039B;1-2 signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Further, an increase of the &#x039B;1-2 signal has been shown to decrease the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio <italic>in vivo</italic> in the intestines of streptomycin-treated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Degrading this molecule is therefore a plausible gut-specific colonization strategy for gut Bacteroidetes. These discovered associations make the genes involved, including many genes without known functions or roles in gut biology, excellent candidates for understanding how bacteria adapt to the gut environment.</p>

<title>Deletion of gut-specific genes lowers fitness in the mouse microbiome</title>
<p>Beyond finding evidence for the plausibility of individual genes based on the literature, we were interested in whether more high-throughput experimental evidence supported the associations we found between gut colonization and gene presence. To interrogate this, we used results from an <italic>in vivo</italic> transposon-insertion screen of four strains of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>. This screen identified many genes whose disruption caused a competitive disadvantage in gnotobiotic mice, as revealed by time-course high-throughput sequencing; 79 gene families significantly affected microbial fitness across all four strains tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Determining agreement with this screen is somewhat complicated by the fact that we associated gene presence to gut specificity across all members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, and not only within the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genus. Significance of overlap therefore depends on what we take as the null &#x201C;background&#x201D; set, the cutoff used for significance, and the set of results from the screen we choose as true positives (Supplementary Table S2).</p>
<p>Despite these complications, this analysis clearly showed that the 79 genes whose disruption led to lower fitness in the murine gut across all four <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species were over-represented among our predictions for gut-specific genes (odds ratio = 4.39, <italic>q</italic> = 8.3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-3</sup>), and remained so if we only considered the gene families that were present in all <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species (odds ratio= 7.02, <italic>q</italic> = 3.0 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, we observed the opposite pattern for the overall prevalence model: the prevalence-associated genes we identified were actually depleted for genes found to be important <italic>in vivo</italic> (odds ratio = 0.18, <italic>q</italic> = 7.7 &#x003C; 10<sup>-3</sup>). We believe that this is because the body-site-specific model, like the experiment, focused specifically on colonization efficiency, while the overall gut prevalence model would have included genes involved in persistence and dispersal in the environment and transfer between hosts. This experimental evidence supports the idea that environment-specific phylogenetic linear models truly identify genes that are important for bacteria to colonize an environment.</p>

<title>Proteobacterial gene families are associated with microbes more prevalent in Crohn&#x2019;s disease</title>
<p>The above analyses were performed with respect to the gut of healthy individuals from the mainly postindustrial populations of North America, Europe and China. However, we also know that taxonomic shifts are common between healthy guts versus the guts of individuals from the same population with diseases such as type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (reviewed in Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]). One explanation for these results is that sick hosts select for specific microbial taxa, as with the links previously observed between Proteobacteria and the inflammation that accompanies many disease states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Since gut microbes have also been implicated in altering disease progression (reviewed in Lynch and Pedersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]), identifying genes associated with colonizing diseased individuals may afford us new opportunities for intervention.</p>
<p>To identify microbiome functions that could be involved in disease-specific adaptation to the gut, we looked for genes that were present more often in microbes that discriminated case from control subjects. Specifically, we compared <italic>n</italic> = 38 healthy controls from the MetaHIT consortium to <italic>n</italic> = 13 individuals with Crohn&#x2019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Similar to our analysis of gut versus other body sites, we used the conditional probability that a subject had Crohn&#x2019;s disease <italic>given</italic> that we observed a particular microbe in their gut microbiome <italic>P</italic>(<italic>CD</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) (see Methods). We identified 1,904 genes whose presence in bacterial genomes is associated with Crohn&#x2019;s after correcting for phylogenetic relationships in at least one phylum (800 in Bacteroidetes, 272 in Firmicutes, 529 in Proteobacteria, and 319 in Actinobacteria).</p>
<p>Three of our top Proteobacterial associations were annotated as fimbrial proteins, including one predicted to be involved specifically in the regulation of type 1 fimbriae, or pili (FimE, association <italic>q</italic> = 4.0 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-6</sup>), cell surface structures involved in attachment and invasion. Crohn&#x2019;s pathology has been linked to an immune response to invasive bacteria, and adherent-invasive <italic>E. coli</italic> (AIEC) appear to be overrepresented in ileal Crohn&#x2019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. In an AIEC <italic>E. coli</italic> strain isolated from the ileum of a Crohn&#x2019;s patient, type 1 pili were required for this adherent-invasive phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Chronic infection by AIEC strains was also observed to lead to chronic inflammation, and to an increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in CD8&#x002B; T cells similar to that observed in Crohn&#x2019;s patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>].</p>
<p>An additional striking feature of the results was the number of Proteobacterial proteins associated with greater risk of Crohn&#x2019;s that were annotated as being involved in the the type III, IV, VI, and ESAT secretion systems (Fisher&#x2019;s test <italic>q</italic> = 0.13). On further investigation, we found that these proteins were actually all predicted to be involved in conjugati ve transfer, a process by which gram-negative bacteria in direct physical contact share genetic material. More specifically, many of these genes were homologs of those involved in an &#x201C;F-type&#x201D; conjugal system for transferring IncF plasmids, which can be classified as a variety of type IV secretion system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Previously, in a mouse model, gut inflammation was shown to stimulate efficient horizontal gene transfer in Proteobacteria by promoting blooms of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and thus facilitating cell-to-cell contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Future work will be required to determine whether this increased conjugation is a neutral consequence of inflammation, a causative factor, or provides a selective advantage in the inflamed gut.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present analyses represent a first look into what can be learned by combining shotgun metagenomics with phylogenetically-aware models. Several extensions to our work could be made in the future. First, in addition to modeling prevalence, for instance, we could model abundance using a phylogenetic linear model with random effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], potentially allowing us to learn what controls the steady-state abundance of species in the gut. Additionally, we could also use these models to screen for epistatic interactions, which would be near-intractable even in systems with well-characterized genetic tools, but for which a subset of hypotheses could be validated by, e.g., comparing the fitness of wild-type microbes with double knockouts. While controlling the total number of tests would still be important to preserve power, an automated, computational approach to detecting gene interactions would still offer important savings in time and expense over developing a genome-wide experimental library of multiple knockouts per organism under investigation.</p>
<p>Currently, these analyses estimate species abundance and gene presence/absence from available sequenced isolate genomes. However, it has been estimated that on average 51&#x0025; of genomes in the gut are from novel species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Especially for case/control comparisons, using information from metagenomic assemblies could enable quantification of species with no sequenced representatives, and would yield a more accurate estimate of the complement of genes in the pangenome for species that do have sequenced representatives. This would be particularly helpful in gut communities from individuals in non-industrialized societies that are enriched for novel microbial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. In fact, genes then could be treated as quantitative variables (e.g., coverage or prevalence) rather than binary, which is possible for covariates in phylogenetic linear models and simply changes the interpretation of the association coefficient <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>1,<italic>g</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>Another potential extension would be to model prevalence and environment-specific prevalence for taxa other than the species clusters analyzed in this study. We focused on four prevalent and abundant phyla of bacteria, but our methods could be applied more broadly as long as quantitative traits and genotypes could be accurately estimated. Phylogenetic linear modeling could also be applied directly to genera or higher taxonomic groups, although both traits and genotypes would be averages over more diverse sets of genomes, which could result in associations with different signs canceling out. As more genome and metagenome data is generated for microbial populations over time, extensions of phylogenetic linear modeling (e.g., with random effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]) may also be useful for studying associations between traits and evolving gene copy number and single nucleotide variants at the strain level. This application would require accurate trees with strains as leaves, each with estimates of a trait and genotype. Beyond prevalence, other traits will also be interesting to investigate, especially experimentally measured phenotypes from high throughput screens and other techniques that complement genomics.</p>
<p>In summary, using phylogenetic linear models, we were able to discover thousands of specific gene families associated with quantitative phenotypes calculated directly from data: overall gut prevalence, a specificity score for the gut over other body sites, and a specificity score for the gut in Crohn&#x2019;s disease versus health. Importantly, we have shown through simulation and real examples that standard linear models are inadequate for this task because of an unacceptably high false-positive rate under realistic conditions. Furthermore, many of the results we found also have biological plausibility, both from the literature on specific microbial pathways and from a high-throughput <italic>in vivo</italic> screen directly measuring colonization efficiency. In addition to these expected discoveries, we also found thousands of novel candidates for understanding and potentially manipulating gut colonization. These results illustrate the potential of integrating phylogeny with shotgun metagenomic data to deepen our understanding of the factors determining which microbes come to constitute our gut microbiota in health and disease.</p>

<title>Species definition</title>
<p>We utilized the previously published clustering of 31,007 high-quality bacterial genomes into 5,952 species from the MIDAS 1.0 database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] (<monospace><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lighthouse.ucsf.edU/MIDAS/rnidas_db_vl.0.tar.gz">http://lighthouse.ucsf.edU/MIDAS/rnidas_db_vl.0.tar.gz</ext-link></monospace>). These species clusters are sets of genomes with high pairwise sequence similarity across a panel of 30 universal, single-copy genes. The genomes in each species clustering have approximately 95&#x0025; average genome-wide nucleotide identity, a common &#x201C;gold-standard&#x201D; definition of bacterial and archaeal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>].

One Actinobacterial species cluster, the radiation-resistant bacterium <italic>Kineococcus radiotolerans</italic> SRS30126, was dropped from the tree because it had an extremely long branch length, indicating an unusual degree of divergence.

<title>Modeling overall gut prevalence and environmental specificity scores</title>
<p><italic>Prevalence</italic> can be understood as the probability of observing a particular microbe in a given environment <italic>e</italic>, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>|<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>). (We use the term <italic>overall prevalence</italic> to refer specifically to the prevalence in the healthy gut in this study.) Modeling prevalence as a probability provides an intuitive justification of the logit transform, which is used for the response variable in logistic and binomial regression. Because we integrated data from multiple studies (see above) and did not want one study to dominate the results, instead of simply using the counts across all samples to determine the prevalence, we used weighted counts <italic>W</italic>(<italic>T</italic>,<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>), where the weights came from the number of samples per study <italic>s</italic> &#x2208; <italic>S</italic>:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In order to avoid probabilities of 0 or 1, probabilities were based on prevalence with one additional &#x201C;present&#x201D; and one additional &#x201C;absent&#x201D; pseudocount; this procedure is equivalent to a maximum <italic>a posteriori</italic> estimate derived from placing a uniform Beta(1,1) prior on a binomially-distributed parameter:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_ueqn2.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Beyond prevalence, we were also interested in <italic>environmental specificity</italic>, or the discriminative power of a given microbe among a given set of environments, such as body sites or disease states. Statistically, we define the environmental specificity score to be the conditional probability <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) that, given that a particular species <italic>T</italic> is observed in a sample, that the sample is from environment <italic>e</italic> &#x2208; <italic>E</italic>. By Bayes&#x2019; rule, we can see that:
<disp-formula id="eqn3"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>This conditional probability can be estimated directly from the environment-specific prevalences <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>|<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>) and the prior probabilities <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>) of a sample being taken from a given environment. However, if we simply plug in the maximum-likelihood estimates of <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>|<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>) to the above equation, infrequent observation of a species (for example, 0/38 in healthy subjects versus 1/13 in subjects with a disease) will yield inappropriately extreme estimates of <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic>|<italic>T</italic>). We therefore use a regularized e stimate of <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) that incorporates a prior centered on <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>).</p>
<p>More specifically, we use a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) with a Laplace prior centered on logit(<italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>)). Laplace regularization is used in the Bayesian Lasso to perform L1-norm penalization of parameter estimates. We use it in a similar way, i.e., to reduce the variance in <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) by shrinking more uncertain estimates towards the prior, and to reduce the total number of species for which <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) = <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>). The general form of MAP estimates is the following:
<disp-formula id="eqn4"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>p</italic> is the parameter being estimated, <italic>D</italic> represents the data (or sufficient statistics derived from it), <italic>Q</italic> represents the set of hyperparameters (parameters of the prior distribution), <italic>&#x2112;</italic> represents the likelihood function of the distribution from which the data is assumed to be drawn, and <italic>&#x2112;</italic><sub><italic>&#x03C0;</italic></sub> represents the likelihood of the prior distribution (without which the estimator reduces to the maximum-likelihood estimator). In our case, we model the data as having the following distribution:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_ueqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The parameter being estimated is <italic>p</italic>, corresponding to <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>). We observe <italic>n</italic>, the number of samples from environment <italic>e</italic> in the dataset (as well as <italic>k</italic>, the number of samples in environment <italic>e</italic> in which species <italic>T</italic> is observed), and <italic>T</italic>, the weighted prevalence across classes <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) = &#x2211;<sub><italic>e</italic></sub><italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>|<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>)<italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>) (here, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>|<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>) are maximum-likelihood estimates directly from the data). The hyperparameters of this model are <italic>b</italic>, a tuning hyperparameter corresponding to the strength of regularization, and <italic>q</italic>, the prior probability <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>). In the above formulation, we use <italic>x</italic> to represent the prevalence <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>|<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>); its value <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="189795_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> follows from Bayes&#x2019; rule. The MAP estimate of <italic>p</italic> = <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) is therefore obtained through the following
<disp-formula id="eqn5"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_eqn5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>To choose appropriate, dataset-specific values of <italic>b</italic>, which controls how much estimates of <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) are shrunk back to the prior, we performed simulations based on these datasets, in which presence vs. absence <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>,<italic>e</italic></sub> of sped es <italic>t</italic> &#x2208; <italic>T</italic> across environments <italic>e</italic> &#x2208; <italic>E</italic> were modeled as follows:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_ueqn4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>In other words, for each species t in different environments e, presence-absence <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>,<italic>e</italic></sub> was modeled as a binomial random variable. The success parameter from this binomial was drawn from a Beta distribution with parameters <italic>a</italic> Mid <italic>b</italic>, which were fit from a single environment in the corresponding real dataset using maximum-likelihood, thus ensuring that the simulated species had similar baseline prevalences as real species. In species with no difference between environments <italic>t</italic> &#x2208; <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>, the true prevai enee <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> was set to be equal between the environment of interest ei and all other environments; in species with true differences between environments (<italic>t</italic> &#x2209; <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>), in contrast, the effect size <italic>f</italic> was either added or subtracted from the logit-prevalence (with the parameter g controlling the proportion of positive true effects). The number of null species ||<italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>|| was set to 25&#x0025; of the total number of simulated species ||<italic>T</italic>||, which was matched to the real dataset.</p>
<p>For a given simulated dataset and value of <italic>b</italic>, the false positive rate (<italic>FPR</italic><sub>b</sub>) and the true positive rates for <italic>F</italic> > 0 Mid <italic>F</italic> &#x003C; 0 (<italic>TPR</italic><sub><italic>pos</italic></sub> and <italic>TPR</italic><sub><italic>neg</italic></sub>, respectively) were calculated:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_ueqn5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
<italic>&#x03f5;</italic> is a tolerance parameter set at <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>) &#x00B7; 0.005 to account for numerical error. The tuning parameter <italic>b</italic> was then optimized according to the following piecewise continuous function, which increases from 0 to 1 until the false positive rate drops to 0.05 or lower (in order to guide the optimizer), and then increases above 1 in proportion to the average (geometric mean) of the positive and negative effect true positive rates:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_ueqn6.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Given <italic>f</italic> = 2, for Crohn&#x2019;s disease, <italic>b</italic> was estimated at <italic>b</italic> = 0.14 and for the body site specificity, b was estimated at <italic>b</italic> = 0.19. (Changing f to 1 or 0.5, or changing <italic>g</italic> to 0.1 or 0.9, resulted in very similar estimates of <italic>b</italic>.</p>
<p>Calculating environmental specificities requires a prior <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>). In the case of the environmental specificity for Crohn&#x2019;s disease, this prior was from epidemiological data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] and fixed at 0:002. In the case of body site specificity, we instead assumed an uninformative (i.e., uniform) prior across the body sites considered (supragingival plaque, subgingival plaque, buccal mucosa, posterior fornix, tongue dorsum, anterior nares, retroauricular crease, and gut, from the Human Microbiome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]), meaning that in the absence of other information, all body sites were considered to be equally likely. To avoid introducing study effects, when computing the disease-specific conditional probabilities, we used only Crohn&#x2019;s cases and controls from the same MetaHIT cohort ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]), and when computing body site specificities, we used only samples from the Human Microbiome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].</p>
<p>This process can be visualized in Supplemental Figure S2. As an example, two species, one with very little predictive power for Crohn&#x2019;s disease (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>) and another with high predictive power (<italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>), are compared. Without regularization, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> actually appears to be a better predictor. This is because with few observations in each condition, estimating the predictiveness of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> for Crohn&#x2019;s, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>), is noisy. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> appears in 1 out of 13 Crohn&#x2019;s samples (0.077) versus 1 out of 38 (0.026) healthy samples, while <italic>B. fragilis</italic> appears in 13 out of 13 Crohn&#x2019;s samples (1.00) but also 24 out of 38 healthy samples (0.63) (Supplemental Figure S2a).</p>
<p>Unregularized, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) = <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>|<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>)<italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>)|<italic>P</italic> (<italic>T</italic>). Since the prior for C rohn&#x2019;s <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>) is low, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) &#x00AB; <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>|<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>)<italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>)|<italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>|<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>), meaning that the estimate is mainly determined by the ratio of prevalences in each environment. Naively, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is 2.9 times more likely to appear in Crohn&#x2019;s vs. normal, while for <italic>B. fragilis</italic> that ratio is only 1.6. However, intuitively, we expect that the estimate for <italic>B. fragilis</italic> would be much more stable to perturbation: removing one Crohn&#x2019;s observation of <italic>B. fragilis</italic> would only drop the ratio from 1.6 to 1.5, while removing the lone Crohn&#x2019;s observation for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> takes the ratio from 2.9 to zero. This difference in how conifdently <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>|<italic>T</italic>) is estimated can be seen quantitatively by comparing the likelihood distributions for the unregularized estimates of logit (<italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic>|<italic>T</italic>)) given the data (Supplemental Figure S2C). The distribution for <italic>Bacillus subtilus</italic> is flatter (note y-axis) and more spread out than the distribution for <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>. Therefore, when we regularize using the Laplace prior (Supplemental Figure S2d), the MAP estimate for <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, but not for <italic>B. fragilis</italic>, is dominated by the peak at <italic>P</italic>(<italic>E</italic> = <italic>e</italic>), i.e., 0.002 (Supplemental Figure S2e). The tuning parameter b (discussed above) controls the width of the Laplace prior.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic linear models</title>
<p>Throughout the text, we used phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic linear models to identify FIGfam gene families associated with presence of bacterial species in the human gut. The response variables in the models we fit were logit-transformed probabilities. These probabilities fell into two categories: 1. the overall probability of observing a particular species <italic>T</italic> in the gut <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) (i.e., prevalence), and 2. the conditional probabilit y of a sample/subject coming from some particular state <italic>P</italic>(&#x2981;|<italic>T</italic>) (specifically, a given body site or a given disease state) given an observation of this microbe.</p>
<p>Per-gene-family models were fit according to the following simple model. For each gene family (in this case, FIGfams, a grouping of orthologous genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]) in each phylum, we fit a model of the following form:
<disp-formula id="eqn6"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_eqn6.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) is the prevalence of a species (equivalently, the estimated probability of observing that species), <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> are model parameters, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is an indicator variable that is 1 if sped es t has gene <italic>g</italic> in its sequenced pan-genome and 0 otherwise, and <italic>&#x03F5;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> are the residuals, i.e., the unmodeled variation in the species prevalence.</p>
<p>The phylogenetic and standard linear models are very similar, except for the assumptions about the distribution of the residuals. In the standard linear model, the residuals are taken to be independently and identically distributed as a normal distribution, i.e., <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="189795_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. In the phylogenetic model, in contrast, the residuals are not independent: rather, they are correlated based on the phylogenetic relatedness of the species. They are therefore distributed <italic>&#x03F5;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> &#x007E; <italic>MVN</italic>(0, &#x03A3;) with the covariance matrix:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="189795_ueqn7.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where n is the number of species, <italic>&#x03C3;</italic><sup>2</sup> is the overall variance, and <italic>&#x03C3;</italic><sub>1,2</sub> is the shared variance between species 1 and species 2. Under the assumption of the phylogenetic model, this shared variance is proportional to the distance between the last common ancestor of species 1 and 2 and the root of the tree; very closely-relatedspecies have a common ancestor that is far from the root, while the last common ancestor of two unrelated species is the root node itself. This method was first described in Grafen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]; for this study, we use the implementation in the phylolm R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>1</sub> parameters were tested for a significant difference from 0 and the resulting <italic>p</italic>-values were converted to <italic>q</italic>-values using Storey and Tibshirani&#x2019;s FDR correction procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>].</p>
<p>To find genes associated specifically with prevalence in the gut as opposed to other body sites, or genes specifically associated with prevalence in a particular disease state, we again used phylogenetic linear models, this time using the logit-transform of the appropriate conditional probability:

The &#x201C;background sets&#x201D; were defined as follows: &#x201C;all tested&#x201D; (all gene families for which a phylogenetic model was fit), &#x201C;Bacteroides (core or variable)&#x201D; (all gene families with at least one representative in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genome cluster pangenomes), &#x201C;Bacteroides (core only)&#x201D; (gene families that were present in all <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genome cluster pangenomes), &#x201C;Bacteroides (variable only)&#x201D; (gene families present in some but not all <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genomes clusters), and &#x201C;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron only&#x201D; (only gene families present in <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic>).
