<title>Summary</title>
<p>All organisms possess several DNA repair pathways to maintain the integrity of their genetic material. Although there are several DNA repair pathways that are well understood, we recently identified several genes in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> that are important for surviving treatment with drugs that damage DNA. Here, we report a drug specific DNA repair pathway in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. We identified genes coding for a previously uncharacterized helicase and exonuclease, <italic>mrfA</italic> and <italic>mrfB</italic>, respectively. Deletion of <italic>mrfA</italic> and <italic>mrfB</italic> resulted in sensitivity to the DNA damaging agent mitomycin C, but not other types of DNA damage. We found that MrfAB operate independently of canonical nucleotide excision repair, forming a novel excision repair pathway in bacteria. A phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that MrfAB homologs are present in diverse bacterial phyla, and a cross-complementation assay shows that MrfAB function is conserved in closely related species. Mitomycin C is a natural antibiotic that is produced by the soil dwelling bacterium <italic>Streptomyces lavendulae</italic>, and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is also a soil dwelling organism. The specificity of the &#x0394;<italic>mrfAB</italic> phenotype suggests that MrfAB have been adapted as a countermeasure to mitomycin producing bacteria.</p>

<title>Abbreviated Summary</title>
<p>Bacteria possess DNA repair pathways to maintain the integrity of their genetic material. The helicase MrfA and the exonuclease MrfB are part of a mitomycin C specific DNA repair pathway in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Despite being present in many bacterial species, MrfAB activity in repairing MMC damaged DNA appears to be restricted to closely related species, suggesting that these proteins have likely been adapted to the specific needs of each bacterium.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A defining feature of biology is the ability to reproduce, which requires replication of the genetic material. High fidelity DNA replication depends on the integrity of the template DNA which can be damaged by UV light, ionizing radiation, and numerous chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Friedberg et al., 2006</xref>). Many DNA damaging agents have been used as chemotherapeutics and are also produced from natural sources such as bacteria, fungi, or plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Demain &#x0026; Vaishnav, 2011</xref>). One such naturally produced antibiotic is mitomycin C (MMC), originally isolated from <italic>Streptomyces lavendulae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hata et al., 1956</xref>). MMC is produced as an inactive metabolite that must be activated by enzymatic or chemical reduction to react with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tomasz, 1995</xref>). MMC reacts specifically with guanine residues in DNA and results in three principle modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bargonetti, Champeil, &#x0026; Tomasz, 2010</xref>). MMC forms a mono-adduct by reacting with a single guanine, however, MMC has two reactive centers, which can result in intra-strand crosslinks on adjacent guanines on the same strand, or in inter-strand crosslinks wherein the two guanines on opposite strands of CpG sequences are covalently linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bizanek, McGuinness, Nakanishi, &#x0026; Tomasz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Borowyborowski, Lipman, Chowdary, &#x0026; Tomasz, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Borowyborowski, Lipman, &#x0026; Tomasz, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Iyer &#x0026; Szybalski, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kumar, Lipman, &#x0026; Tomasz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tomasz et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tomasz et al., 1987</xref>). The toxicity of these different adducts is a result of preventing DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bargonetti et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In bacteria, MMC adducts and intra-strand crosslinks are repaired by nucleotide excision repair and inter-strand crosslinks are repaired by a combination of nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dronkert &#x0026; Kanaar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lenhart, Schroeder, Walsh, &#x0026; Simmons, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Noll, Mason, &#x0026; Miller, 2006</xref>). Both mono-adducts and crosslinks are recognized in genomic DNA by UvrA to initiate repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jaciuk, Nowak, Skowronek, Tanska, &#x0026; Nowotny, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kisker, Kuper, &#x0026; Van Houten, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stracy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Weng et al., 2010</xref>). In some nucleotide excision repair models UvrB functions in complex with UvrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kisker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Truglio, Croteau, Van Houten, &#x0026; Kisker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Van Houten, Croteau, DellaVecchia, Wang, &#x0026; Kisker, 2005</xref>), while <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and a recent <italic>in vivo</italic> study using single molecule microscopy suggests that UvrB is recruited by UvrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Orren &#x0026; Sancar, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stracy et al., 2016</xref>). In any event, once UvrA and UvrB are present at the lesion, the subsequent step is the disassociation of UvrA and the recruitment of UvrC which incises the DNA on either side of the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Orren &#x0026; Sancar, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>E. coli</italic> there is a second UvrC like protein called Cho that can also perform the incision function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Moolenaar, van Rossum-Fikkert, van Kesteren, &#x0026; Goosen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Perera, Mendenhall, Courcelle, &#x0026; Courcelle, 2016</xref>). Mono-adducts and intra-strand crosslinks are removed from the DNA via UvrD helicase in <italic>E. coli</italic> after UvrC excision and then a DNA polymerase can resynthesize the missing nucleotides and DNA ligase can seal the gap, completing the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kisker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Petit &#x0026; Sancar, 1999</xref>). For an inter-strand crosslink, the process requires another step because the lesion containing DNA remains covalently bonded to the opposite strand. Homologous recombination pairs the lesion containing strand with a second copy of the chromosome if present and then a subsequent round of nucleotide excision repair can remove the crosslink followed by DNA polymerase and DNA ligase to complete repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dronkert &#x0026; Kanaar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Noll et al., 2006</xref>). Homologous recombination and UvrABC dependent nucleotide excision repair are general DNA repair pathways that participate in the repair of many different types of DNA damage.</p>
<p>Although the above mentioned pathways are known to function in the repair of MMC damaged DNA, it is not clear if other pathways exist in bacteria. We recently reported a forward genetic screen in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> where we identified two genes, <italic>mrfA</italic> and <italic>mrfB</italic> (formerly <italic>yprA</italic> and <italic>yprB</italic>, respectively) that when deleted resulted in sensitivity to MMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burby, Simmons, Schroeder, &#x0026; Simmons, 2018</xref>). Here, we report that MrfAB are part of a MMC specific DNA repair pathway in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Deletion of <italic>mrfAB</italic> (formerly <italic>yprAB</italic>) operon renders <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sensitive to MMC, but not to other DNA damaging agents known to be repair by canonical nucleotide excision repair. MrfAB code for a helicase and exonuclease, and we demonstrate that conserved residues required for these activities are important for their function <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that MrfAB operate independent of UvrABC. We monitored DNA repair status over time using RecA-GFP as a reporter, and we show that deletion of <italic>mrfAB</italic> and <italic>uvrABC</italic> results in a synergistic decrease in RecA-GFP foci, suggesting that MrfAB are part of a novel nucleotide excision repair pathway in bacteria. We also found that MrfAB do not contribute to inter-strand crosslink repair, suggesting that MrfAB are specific to MMC mono-adducts or intra-strand crosslinks. A phylogenetic analysis shows that MrfAB homologs are present in many bacterial species and that the function of MrfAB is conserved in closely related species. Together, our study identifies a novel strategy to counteract the natural antibiotic MMC in bacteria.</p>

<title>DNA damage sensitivity of &#x0394;<italic>mrfAB</italic> is specific to mitomycin C</title>
<p>Our recent study using a forward genetic screen identified genes important for surviving exposure to DNA damage uncovering many genes that had not previously been implicated in DNA repair or the SOS-response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burby et al., 2018</xref>). As part of this screen, we identified a gene pair, <italic>yprAB</italic>, in which disruption by a transposon resulted in sensitivity to MMC but not phleomycin or methyl methanesulfonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burby et al., 2018</xref>). Because the phenotypes are specific to MMC (see below), we rename <italic>yprAB</italic> to <underline>m</underline>itomycin <underline>r</underline>epair <underline>f</underline>actors <underline>A</underline> and <underline>B</underline> (<italic>mrfAB</italic>). To follow up on the phenotype of the transposon insertions we tested clean deletion strains of <italic>mrfA</italic> and <italic>mrfB</italic> and found that deletion of either gene resulted in sensitivity to MMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Further, we ectopically expressed each gene in its respective mutant background and we were capable of complementing the MMC sensitivity phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). The absence of phenotypes with phleomycin and methyl methanesulfonate, is similar to the phenotypic profile of nucleotide excision repair (NER) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burby et al., 2018</xref>). We next asked if deletion of <italic>mrfA</italic> would result in sensitivity to other agents known to be repaired by NER. We tested for sensitivity to three other agents that cause DNA lesions that are repaired by NER: UV light, 4-NQO, and the DNA crosslinking agent psoralen (trioxsalen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Petit &#x0026; Sancar, 1999</xref>). Interestingly, we found that deletion of <italic>mrfA</italic> did not cause sensitivity to any of these agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). We also tested whether the presence of <italic>uvrAB</italic> was masking the effect, but no additional sensitivity was observed when <italic>mrfA</italic> was deleted in the &#x0394;<italic>uvrAB</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). We conclude that MrfAB are important for mitigating the toxicity of MMC-generated DNA lesions.</p>

<title>MrfA and MrfB function in the same pathway</title>
<p>The phenotypes of <italic>mrfA</italic> and <italic>mrfB</italic> mutants were identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A&#x0026;B</xref>), and the two genes are predicted to be an operon. We hypothesized that MrfA and MrfB function together. We tested this hypothesis using an epistasis analysis. We found that deletion of both genes gave the same sensitivity to MMC as each single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>), indicating that they function in the same pathway. If MrfAB function together, we wondered whether these proteins interact. We employed a bacterial two-hybrid assay, and found that MrfA and MrfB formed a robust interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). Next, we asked if we could localize the interaction to a particular domain.</p>

<p>We performed a deletion analysis with MrfA and found that deletion of either the N-terminus or the C-terminus was sufficient to abolish the interaction with MrfB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>), and the N-terminus of MrfA was not sufficient for MrfB interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>). We tested whether the N-terminus or C-terminus of MrfB was required for MrfA interaction. We found that the C-terminus of MrfB was not required, though the signal was reduced, whereas deletion of the N-terminus of MrfB abolished the interaction with MrfA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>). We conclude that MrfAB interaction is specific and that these proteins function together in mitigating MMC toxicity.</p>

<title>MrfA helicase motifs and C-terminus is required for function <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>MrfA is a predicted DEXH box helicase containing a C-terminal domain of unknown function (Fig S1 and S2A). The C-terminal domain of unknown function contains four conserved cysteines that are thought to function in coordinating a metal ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yakovleva &#x0026; Shuman, 2012</xref>). We initially searched for a similar helicase in other well studied organisms. We were unable to identify a clear homolog of MrfA in <italic>E. coli</italic>, however, Hrq1 from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> shares the same domain structure with 32&#x0025; identity and 55&#x0025; positives. Hrq1 has been shown to be a RecQ family helicase with 3&#x25A1; &#x2192; 5&#x25A1; helicase activity and has been observed to exist as a heptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bochman, Paeschke, Chan, &#x0026; Zakian, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rogers et al., 2017</xref>). We performed an alignment with Hrq1 and identified helicase motifs typical of super family 2 helicases (Fig S1). A homolog of MrfA from <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> has also been shown to be a 3&#x25A1; &#x2192; 5&#x25A1; helicase, however, unlike Hrq1 SftH exists as a monomer in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yakovleva &#x0026; Shuman, 2012</xref>). To address whether MrfA helicase activity was important for function we used a complementation assay using variants containing alanine substitutions in several conserved helicase motifs. Mutations in helicase motif I (K82A), motif II (DE185-186AA), and motif III (S222A) all failed to complement a <italic>mrfA</italic> deficiency (Fig S2B). Intriguingly, when motif Ib (T134V) was mutated <italic>mrfA</italic> MMC sensitivity could still be complemented (Fig S2B). We asked whether the C-terminal domain of unknown function and the conserved cysteines were required for function. Deletion of the entire C-terminal domain, mutation of the first two cysteines, or mutation of all four cysteines all resulted in a failure to complement MMC sensitivity in a &#x0394;<italic>mrfA</italic> strain (Fig S2B). Together our data suggest that both helicase activity and the C-terminal domain are required for MrfA function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>MrfB is a metal dependent exonuclease</title>
<p>MrfB is predicted to be a DnaQ-like exonuclease and to have a three tetratrichopeptide repeats at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>). To search for putative catalytic residues in MrfB, we aligned MrfB to ExoI, ExoX, and DnaQ from <italic>E. coli</italic> (Fig S3A). MrfB has the four acidic residues typical of DnaQ like exonucleases (Fig S3A). This type of nuclease also has a histidine located proximal to the last aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yang, 2011</xref>), and we identified two histidines, one of which was conserved (Fig S3A, conserved histidine highlighted in red and the other in green). DnaQ exonucleases coordinate a metal ion that is used in catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yang, 2011</xref>). We hypothesized that MrfB catalytic residues would cluster together in the tertiary structure. We modelled MrfB using Phyre2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kelley, Mezulis, Yates, Wass, &#x0026; Sternberg, 2015</xref>), which used DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic subunit A (pdb structure c5okiA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Grabarczyk, Silkenat, &#x0026; Kisker, 2018</xref>)), and found that the conserved aspartates and glutamate indeed clustered together in the model (Fig S3B).</p>

<p>Interestingly, we found that the histidine conserved in the <italic>E. coli</italic> exonucleases was facing the opposite direction, whereas the non-conserved histidine was facing the putative catalytic residues in the MrfB model (Fig S3C). An alignment of MrfB with homologs demonstrates that the histidine (labeled in green) facing the other putative catalytic residues is conserved in putative MrfB homologs, whereas the other is not (see supplemental text). To test whether these residues were important for function, we used variants with alanine substitutions at each putative catalytic residue in a complementation assay. We found that all five mutants could not complement the &#x0394;<italic>mrfB</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>With these results we wanted to test whether MrfB had exonuclease activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. We expressed and purified MrfB to homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>). We tested for exonuclease activity using a plasmid linearized by restriction digest. We found that MrfB could degrade linear dsDNA and that Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> was required, demonstrating that MrfB is a metal-dependent exonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3D</xref>). With exonuclease activity established we tested the substrate preference of MrfB using a closed circular covalent plasmid (CCC), a nicked plasmid or a linear plasmid using T<sub>5</sub> and <italic>&#x03BB;</italic> exonucleases as controls. T<sub>5</sub> exonuclease is able to degrade both nicked and linear substrates but cannot degrade a super-coiled plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sayers &#x0026; Eckstein, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">1991</xref>). In contrast, &#x03BB; exonuclease can only degrade a linear substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Little, 1981</xref>). The T<sub>5</sub> and lambda exonuclease controls performed as predicted, and MrfB demonstrated robust activity using a linear substrate and very slight activity using a nicked substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E</xref>). We conclude that MrfB is a metal-dependent exonuclease with a preference for linear DNA.</p>

<title>MrfAB are not required for unhooking inter-strand DNA crosslinks</title>
<p>The synergistic sensitivity to MMC observed in the double pathway mutant suggests that MrfAB are part of a novel nucleotide excision repair pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated that RecA-GFP forms foci in response to DNA damage such as treatment with MMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kidane &#x0026; Graumann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Simmons et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Simmons, Grossman, &#x0026; Walker, 2007</xref>). Therefore, to test whether DNA repair was affected by the absence of <italic>mrfAB</italic>, <italic>uvrABC</italic>, or both pathways, we used a RecA-GFP fusion to monitor DNA repair status over time following treatment with MMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref> &#x0026; S5). We quantified the percentage of cells containing a focus or foci of RecA-GFP, and found an increase in RecA-GFP focus formation over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>). In all three mutant strains there was a significant increase in RecA-GFP foci prior to MMC addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>). We found that deletion of <italic>mrfAB</italic> did not have a significant impact on RecA-GFP focus formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>). Deletion of <italic>uvrABC</italic> led to a slight decrease in RecA-GFP focus formation (Fig S5).</p>

<p>The double pathway mutant had a significant decrease in RecA-GFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>). With these results we suggest that RecA is responding to excision repair gaps that occur after removal of the MMC adduct. These results further support the conclusion that MrfAB participate in the repair of MMC damaged DNA.</p>
<p>As stated previously, MMC results in several DNA lesions, one of which is the inter-strand crosslink. We asked whether one or both pathways contribute to unhooking DNA crosslinks <italic>in vivo</italic>. To address this question we treated <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains with MMC and then allowed them to recover for 45 or 90 minutes and monitored DNA crosslinks by denaturing and snap cooling the DNA, which will allow for renaturing of crosslinked DNA but not non-crosslinked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Iyer &#x0026; Szybalski, 1963</xref>). We found that in WT and &#x0394;<italic>mrfAB</italic> cells we could detect some crosslinked DNA that decreased slightly over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C</xref>). In the absence of <italic>uvrABC</italic> there was a significant stabilization of crosslinked DNA that did not decrease over time and deleting <italic>mrfAB</italic> had no effect in the <italic>uvrABC</italic> mutant on crosslink stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C</xref>). We conclude that UvrABC are the primary proteins responsible for repair of inter-strand crosslinks and MrfAB likely repair the more abundant mono-adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Warren, Maccubbin, &#x0026; Hamilton, 1998</xref>) and potentially intra-strand crosslinks that form.</p>

<title>MrfAB are conserved in diverse bacterial phyla</title>
<p>Given the specificity of MrfAB for MMC, we wondered how conserved <italic>mrfA</italic> and <italic>mrfB</italic> are in bacteria. We performed a PSI-BLAST search using MrfA or MrfB against the proteomes of bacterial organisms from several phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>; Table S4). We found that MrfA and MrfB are both present in organisms from 5 different phyla, though MrfA is more broadly conserved in bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). To test if MrfA and MrfB function is conserved, we attempted to complement MMC sensitivity using codon-optimized versions of the homologs from three organisms, <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. We found that expression of <italic>Bc</italic>-<italic>mrfA</italic> and <italic>Bc</italic>-<italic>mrfB</italic> were capable of complementing the respective deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MrfAB are founding members of a novel bacterial nucleotide excision repair pathway. From our results, the current model is that MrfA recognizes a MMC mono-adduct or intra-strand crosslink and uses its helicase activity to separate the MMC containing strand, while MrfB degrades the displaced DNA strand ultimately removing the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref>). The initial finding that sensitivity to DNA damage in <italic>mrfAB</italic> mutants is specific to MMC suggested a drug specific repair pathway. The observation that RecA-GFP foci changes in a synergistic manner with deletion of both <italic>uvrABC</italic> and <italic>mrfAB</italic> suggests that MrfAB are acting as a second excision repair pathway. The major source of toxicity from MMC has long been thought to be the inter-strand crosslink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bargonetti et al., 2010</xref>). We found that MrfAB do not contribute to inter-strand crosslink repair, and yet deletion of <italic>mrfAB</italic> in the <italic>uvrABC</italic> mutant resulted in a significant decrease in survival following MMC treatment. These observations strongly suggest that the mono-adducts and/or the intra-strand crosslink make a significant contribution to the overall toxicity of MMC. Therefore, through identifying a new repair pathway in bacteria, we are able to shed new light on the toxicity profile of a well-studied, natural antibiotic.</p>

<p>The specificity of the &#x0394;<italic>mrfAB</italic> phenotype suggests that lesion recognition depends on MMC adduct structure. Our previously reported forward genetic screen did not identify other candidates for this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burby et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that lesion recognition is a function carried out by either MrfA, MrfB, or by both proteins in complex. MrfA is a helicase with a C-terminal domain of unknown function containing four well conserved cysteines. A high throughput X-ray absorption spectroscopy study of over 3000 proteins including MrfA reported finding that MrfA binds to zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, UvrA, the recognition factor of canonical nucleotide excision repair, also contains a zinc finger which is required for regulating recognition of damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Croteau et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, three of the four recognition factors in eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair, XPA, RPA, and TFIIH also each contain a zinc finger component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Petit &#x0026; Sancar, 1999</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that MrfA functions as the lesion recognition factor through its putative C-terminal zinc finger domain.</p>
<p>MrfAB have likely been adapted to specific needs in different bacteria. We speculate that MrfAB specificity for MMC is a reflection of habitat overlap between <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and mitomycin producing bacteria such as <italic>S. lavendulae</italic>. Thus, MrfAB were adapted to effectively help <italic>B. subtilis</italic> compete in habitats where MMC is produced. Given that only closely related species could substitute for MrfA and MrfB function in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, we hypothesize that the MMC specific repair activity is restricted to those species. In fact, the homologs present in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> have diverged significantly (Table S4). The N-terminus of <italic>Pa</italic>-MrfA is quite different from that of <italic>Bs</italic>-MrfA, and the C-terminal TPR domain of MrfB is completely absent in <italic>Pa</italic>-MrfB (see supplemental alignments), consistent with the notion that MrfAB function has diverged in more distantly related bacteria. We recently investigated the mismatch repair homolog MutS2 and arrived at a similar conclusion&#x2014;MutS2 has been adapted to the specific DNA repair needs of different organisms. MutS2 in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> promotes homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burby &#x0026; Simmons, 2017</xref>), whereas MutS2 in several other organisms inhibits homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Damke, Dhanaraju, Marsin, Radicella, &#x0026; Rao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fukui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pinto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang &#x0026; Maier, 2017</xref>). The reality that distantly related organisms have adapted their genetic repertoire inherited from the most recent common ancestor would seem obvious. Still, a major thrust of biological exploration is often to examine processes that are highly conserved. While well conserved processes are often critical for more organisms, it is the divergent functions that make each organism unique, which is a property of inherent value found throughout nature.</p>
