<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Ramularia Leaf Spot (RLS) has emerged as a threat for barley production in many regions of the world. Late appearance of unspecific symptoms caused that <italic>Ramularia collo-cygni</italic> could only by molecular diagnostics be detected as the causal agent of RLS. Although recent research has shed more light on the biology and genomics of the pathogen, the cause of the recent global spread remains unclear.</p>
<p>To address urgent questions, especially on the emergence to a major disease, life-cycle, transmission, and quick adaptation to control measures, we de-novo sequenced the genome of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> (urug2 isolate). Additionally, we sequenced fungal RNA from 6 different conditions, which allowed for an improved genome annotation. This resulted in a high quality draft assembly of about 32 Mb, with only 78 scaffolds with an N50 of 2.1 Mb. The overall annotation enabled the prediction of 12.346 high confidence genes. Genomic comparison revealed that <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> has significantly diverged from related <italic>Dothidiomycetes</italic>, including gain and loss of putative effectors, however without obtaining species-specific genome features.</p>
<p>To evaluate the species-wide genetic diversity, we sequenced the genomes of 19 <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> isolates from multiple geographic locations and diverse hosts and mapped sequences to our reference genome. Admixture analyses show that <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> is world-wide genetically uniform and that samples do not show a strong clustering on either geographical location or host species. To date, the teleomorph of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> has not been observed. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium shows that in the world-wide sample set there are clear signals of recombination and thus sexual reproduction, however these signals largely disappear when excluding three outliers samples, suggesting that the main global expansion of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> comes from mixed or clonally propagating populations. We further analysed the historic population size (Ne) of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> using Bayesian simulations.</p>
<p>We discuss how our genomic data and population genetics analysis can help understand the current <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> epidemic and provide different hypothesis that are supported by our data. We specifically highlight how recombination, clonal spreading and lack of host-specificity could further support global epidemics of this increasingly recognized plant disease and suggest specific approaches to combat this pathogen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant pathogens cause serious damage on crop plants. They need to be controlled to achieve sufficient yield and best quality of the agricultural products. The ascomycete fungus <italic>Ramularia collo-cygni</italic> has been detected in barley samples worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The filamentous fungus is the major biotic agent of a leaf spotting complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] typically occurring late in the growing season on the upper canopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Ramularia leaf spot (RLS) poses a major risk in barley production, particularly in important barley growing regions like Scotland, mid Europe, Argentina and Uruguay It is estimated to cause losses up to 25 and in extreme cases up to 70&#x0025; of the yield potential through a significant decrease of kernel size and quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Since thus far no major resistance genes were identified within the commercial barley genepool, control has been relying on the pre-epidemic use of several fungicides, but only a limited number of active substances are available and resistance has already been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. <italic>Ramularia collo-cygni</italic> was first described in 1893 by Cavara [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] as <italic>Ophiocladium hordei</italic>. However, it is only since the mid-1980&#x2019;s that it became of increasing importance, with serious economic impact and the reasons for this remain unknown. Little is know about the pathogens biology or diversity in the field and even reproductive mode in the field and methods of dispersal remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>Previously a draft genome had been published for <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> strain DK05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The assembled 30.3 Mb genome data predicted 11,617 of gene models. It allowed the confirmation that <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> belongs to the <italic>Dothidiomycetes</italic>, particularly to the family of <italic>Mycosphaerellaceae</italic> that contains several major plant pathogens. Additionally the study revealed relative paucity of plant cell wall degrading enzyme genes and a large number of secondary metabolite production associated genes. Both findings were hypothesised to be linked to the relatively long asymptomatic growth inside the host. The authors also highlighted the occurrence of several toxin encoding genes, on the genome, including the well-studied rubellins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. It is suggested that RLS-associated necrosis is caused by toxins produced by the fungus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. However, these toxins are non-host-specific and also present in other <italic>Dothideomycetes</italic>, thus their findings did not explain the recent emergence of the pathogen in barley.Instead it has been suggested that the intensive use of mildew resistant <italic>mlo</italic>-genotype cultivars might be one of the causes of the emergence of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> as a threat to barley production and quality. McGrann <italic>et al</italic> have investigated the trade-off between the barley <italic>mlo</italic> mutation-mediated powdery mildew resistance and susceptibility to RLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. However, analysis of grain of near isogenic <italic>MLO</italic> and <italic>mlo</italic>-barley did subsequently not suggest enhanced levels of Rcc transmission via <italic>mlo</italic>-barley seed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> has also been isolated from wheat, oat, maize and from a number of uncultivated grasses such as <italic>Agropyron repens</italic> suggesting a broad host range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] and shows microscopically similar compatible interactions with many of these grasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. It is so far not known whether isolates of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> generally are able to infect a broad range of host species or if host specialization (e.g. to barley) occurs within local populations, nor do we have good insights in geographical diversity. An Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism study investigating the population structure of samples from barley in Czechia, Slovakia, Germany and Switzerland showed variability between the samples and rejected the hypothesis of random mating in the field, but suggests that mixed reproduction is likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. To date, no teleomorph of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> has been described. However data from both Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism or microsatellites studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] also hint that sexual reproduction might take place in the field. Moreover, both studies show considerable variation between their two samples locations (Scotland &#x0026; Denmark or Scotland &#x0026; Czechia, respectively), but do not see clear substructures within the populations.</p>
<p>Here we move beyond the genomics of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> and combine a comparative genomics approach with population genetics to get a deeper insight in <italic>R. collo-cygni&#x2019;</italic>s biology and to better understand the life cycle as basis for sustainable control. We generated an independent draft genome and use this reference to gain a deeper understanding of the pathogens genome compared to selected model fungi and economically relevant plant pathogens, to identify those genetic factors that might contribute to its recent success. Moreover, we sequenced 17 additional isolates from a global collection from different hosts, to infer the pathogen&#x2019;s population structure and its global diversity. Finally, we used our high quality assembly to infer the Linkage Disequilibrium, to define whether indeed <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> is a sexual plant pathogen and to establish the historic population sizes of the pathogen. Our combined results show that <italic>R. Collo-cygni</italic> is unlike many other pathogens and that special care might be required to prevent worsening of the current epidemic.</p>

<title><italic>R. collo-cygni Archive samples and</italic> DNA quantification</title>
<p>Archive barley seed samples dating back to the 60&#x2019;s were provided by Markus Herz from the Bavarian State Research Center for Agriculture (LfL). Quantification of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> DNA from archive barley grains sample was performed following a Taq-Man qPCR protocol. Briefly, 1x iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), 400 nmol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> forward and reverse primer (RamF6/RamR6), 150 nmol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> Ramularia probe (FAM; Ram6), 5 &#x03BC;l of DNA template (20 ng &#x03BC;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), and PCR-grade water were mixed together to make the reaction mixture with a final volume of 25 &#x00B5;l. PCR amplification was performed using a MX3000P Cycler (Stratagene).</p>

<title>Cultures media and incubation conditions</title>
<p><italic>Ramularia collo-cygni</italic> cultures were maintained 9-cm petri dishes incubated at room temperature in the dark.For the genome sequencing, the isolate was grown on Alkyl Esther medium (AE) (10 g Yeast extract, 0.5 g MgSO4 &#x002A;7 H2O, 6 g NaNO3, 0.5 g Kcl, 1.5 g KH2PO4, 20 g Bacto Agar, 20 mL Glycerol for 1000 ml of final volume) for 7 days.</p>
<p>Concerning the expression analysis (by RNA-seq), the isolate was grown on 6 different conditions: &#x201C;control&#x201D; which is the same as used for the genome sequencing, <italic>i.e</italic> growing on AE medium for 7 days; &#x201C;old&#x201D;, growing the isolates on AE for 14 days instead of 7 days.; &#x201C;PH5&#x201D;, growing it on AE buffered with HCl until pH &#x003D; 5, for 7 days; &#x201C;PH9&#x201D;, growing it on AE buffered with NaOH until pH &#x003D; 9, for 7 days; &#x201C;NoG&#x201D;, growing it on AE without glycerol, for 7 days; &#x201C;BSagar&#x201D;, growing it on Barley Straw Agar medium (BSagar) (40g of grounded barley straw, 20 g of agar for 1000 mL of final volume), for 7 days.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>DNA and RNA extraction</title>
<p>Mycelia from above-mentioned cultures were harvested, and finely ground mycelium was used for DNA extraction and RNA extraction.</p>
<p>For the DNA extraction, 1400&#x00B5;l of preheated (60&#x00B0;C) CTAB extraction buffer (100 mM Tris&#x2013;HCl, pH 8.0; 20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 1.4M NaCl; 2&#x0025; CTAB; 0.2&#x0025; &#x03B2;-mercaptoethanol) was added to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube. The tubes were mixed thoroughly and incubated at 60&#x00B0;C for 1h. The tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. One thousand microliter of the supernatant was transferred into a fresh 2 ml tube and then 1 volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) was added and the tubes were gently mixed for 5 to 10 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. RNase (20&#x00B5;g/ml, DNase-free) was added and the tubes were incubated at 37&#x00B0;C for 30 min. One volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) was added and the tube were gently mixed for 5 to 10 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. DNA was precipitated by adding 0.1 volume of sodium acetate (3M, pH 5.2) and 0.6 volume of cold isopropanol. The tubes were kept at &#x2212;20&#x00B0;C overnight. Tubes were then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4&#x00B0;C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed with 500 &#x00B5;l cold 70&#x0025; ethanol, the pellet was spin down at 13,000 rpm for 1 min at 4&#x00B0;C and the supernatant was discarded. This last step with the ethanol was repeated one more time. The precipitate was dried for 20&#x2013;30 min at 37&#x00B0;C and then resuspended in 100 &#x03BC;l of sterile Tris-Buffer (10 mM Tris&#x2013;HCl, pH 8.5).</p>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> mycelium from the 6 different conditions using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). RNA integrity was confirmed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA Nanochip with the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (5067-1511) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).</p>
<p>For the isolation of genomic DNA from barley grain, a subsample of 50 g was ground to fine powder using a laboratory mill. DNA extraction from ground Barley seeds was performed following recommendations of the European Community Reference Laboratories (Joint Research Centre 2007) for the isolation of maize DNA, with some modifications described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>

<title>Library preparation and sequencing</title>
<p>Whole genome sequencing of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> was performed by Eurofins Genomics GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany, using a short distance library (SD) by fragmentation and end repair of DNA (customized insert size of approx. 500 bp) on the Illumina MiSeq v3 (paired-end sequencing 2&#x003D;150 bp) and a long jumping distance library (LJD) with a jumping distance of 8 kbp on the Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 v3 (paired-end sequencing 2&#x003D;300 bp).</p>
<p>The RNA-seq library preparation was performed using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (RS-122-2101) (Illumina San Diego, California 92122 U.S.A.) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. The prepared library (Insert size: about 180 bp) was then subjected to high-throughput sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq2500 using 1 lane and multiplexed paired-end read (read 1: 101 cycles, index read: 7 cycles, read 2: 101 cycles). The sequencing was performed using the TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster Kit (PE-402-4001) and the TruSeq Rapid SBS Kits - HS (200 cycles) (FC-402-4001) (Illumina San Diego, California 92122 U.S.A.).</p>

<title>Genome assembly and structural annotation</title>
<p>The assembly was performed by ALLPATHS-LG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] using around 100 fold SD and 30 fold LJD genome covering. The assembly in total has a size of 32 Mb and consists of 78 scaffold with a N50 of 2.1 Mb. Gene models were generated by three de-novo prediction programs: 1) Fgenesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] with different matrices (trained on <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> and a mixed matrix based on different species); 2) GeneMark-ES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] and 3) AUGUSTUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] with RNA-seq based transcripts as training sets. Annotation was aided by exonerate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] hits of protein sequences from <italic>Botrytis</italic>, <italic>Sclerotinia</italic> and <italic>Rhynchosporium</italic> models to uncover gene annotation gaps. Transcripts were assembled on the RNA-seq data sets using Trinity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. The different gene structures and evidences (exonerate mapped transcripts and bowtie mapped RNA-seq reads) were visualized in Gbrowse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], allowing manual validation of coding sequences. The best fitting model per locus was selected manually and gene structures were adjusted by splitting or fusion of gene models or redefining exon-intron boundaries if necessary. tRNAs where predicted using tRNAscan-SE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. The predicted protein sets were searched for highly conserved single (low) copy genes to assess the completeness of the genomic sequences and gene predictions. All of the 248 core-genes commonly present in higher eukaryotes (CEGs) could be identified by Blastp comparisons (e-value: 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>RNA-seq analysis</title>
<p>RNA-seq reads were mapped against our reference genome using TopHat (ver. 2.1.0). The gene expression levels were estimated as Fragments Per Kilobase of Million Fragments Mapped (FPKM) using the cufflinks.cuffdiff package (ver. 2.2.1). All the FPKM values were transferred into log2 values after adding 1 to each FPKM. Fold changes of expression levels between the different conditions were then calculated. The transcripts with a fold change of expression between two conditions greater or equal to 4 (log2&#x003E;&#x003D;2) were considered significantly differentially expressed</p>

<title>Prediction of secreted proteins and effectors</title>
<p>We used a pipeline which combines the use of five methods. First, secreted proteins candidates are selected by SecretomeP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] (cutoff score &#x003D; 0.6). Proteins with mitochondrial target were removed using TargetP (RC-score &#x003C; 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and the one with membrane bound using TMHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Extracellular target compartments were predicted using WolfPsort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Finally, to identify the class of secretion (classical or non-classical secreted proteins) SignalP (s-score &#x2265; 0.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] was applied. The combination of all these 5 methods generated our working set of secreted proteins (Table S2)</p>
<p>For the prediction of effectors, the subsequent set of secreted proteins predicted as explained above was submitted to EffectorP 1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] (Table S2).</p>

<p>To confirm the recent emergence of <italic>R. collo-cygni,</italic> we obtained seed samples from the Bavarian State Research Center for Agriculture (LfL) from all over Bavaria over the years 1958-2010. We quantified <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> DNA from these archive samples dating back to 1958. This revealed that <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> was constantly present in harvested barley grain (on average 39.4 pg R. collo-cygni DNA / ng total-DNA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). However, it is only starting 1984 that we observe irregular oscillations of enhanced DNA content in spring barley seeds (up to 710 pg R. collo-cygni DNA / ng total-DNA in 1984). In winter barley we observed even higher contents of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> DNA from 1989 on with maximum amount above 2000 pg <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> DNA per ng total-DNA. These dates coincide with more frequent reports about epidemics and relative importance of RLS.</p>

<title>On genome level <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> is a typical Dothideomycete</title>
<p>We sequenced genomic DNA from <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> isolate urug2 using a combination of a shotgun library on the Illumina MiSeq v3 and a long jumping distance library (LJD) on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 v3. This sequencing strategy allowed for sequence assembly into long scaffolds.</p>
<p>The assembled genome data of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> isolate urug2 contains about 32 Mb, in only 78 scaffolds with an N50 scaffold size 2.1 Mb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Automated gene annotations are prone to misprediction of splice sites and actual coding sequences (CDS). Therefore, we performed RNA sequencing of mRNA isolated from <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> isolate urug2 grown under six different axenic growth conditions to generate diverse sets of transcripts. Having these transcripts enabled us to re-annotate problematic splice sites and coding regions (CDS) of all genes, which we considered crucial for follow-up analyses. Using the RNA-seq data mapped to the genome, the annotation was manually corrected gene by gene yielding a more reliable set of gene models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1</xref>) shows an example of improved gene models). The curated <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> annotation enabled the prediction of 11,637 protein coding genes. Out of these 11,637 predicted genes, 11,614 were expressed in at least one of the growth condition (Table S1). The use of RNAseq enabled us therefore, to achieve the most accurate annotation and a strong confidence in our gene models for 99.8&#x0025; of them.</p>

Additionally, we calculated the divergence time of the different pathogens in our phylogeny.

<p>The fungal secretome is usually of pivotal nature in interactions with plant hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. The <italic>Ramularia collo-cygni</italic> secretome represents around 9&#x0025; of its predicted proteome. We predicted 1292 secreted proteins ranging in length from 41 to 3256 amino-acids and 213 effector candidates genes (Table S2).

<p>Next we compared <italic>R. collo-cyngi</italic> genes with 11 other dothideomycetes to look for unique and shared characteristics. A full genome comparison shows a clear bimodal distribution, indicating a large (&#x003E;3500) conserved core-set of genes, shared between 10 or more species. Similarly, a second large fraction (&#x003E;2800) genes is unique or only has a homolog in one of the other species. When counting the number of secreted proteins shared among these plant pathogens and endophytes (Table S3), very few (43) are shared among all the 12 species used for the analysis. 217 secreted proteins are shared between <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> and one other species and 237 secreted proteins are unique (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

<p>Based on the fact that <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> diverged from other Dothideomycetes such as <italic>Z. tritici</italic> millions of years ago, but did not acquire truly outstanding genome characteristics, or genes under selection in our genome comparisons, we set out to investigate the population structure within the <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> species in order to unravel its recent evolutionary history. We used whole genome sequencing data for 14 isolates from different geographical locations and five from different host plants.

<p>In total we obtained 162045 high confidence SNPs between all samples of which 79949 SNPs occurred within coding regions, corresponding to approximately one SNP every 200 bases. The transition/transversion ratio is 2.36 for the whole genome and 2.31 for the coding sites, suggesting no anomalies in the SNP calling. 56&#x0025; of all SNPs in the coding regions occur as singletons within the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4</xref>). Average nucleotide diversity per site (&#x03C0;) over all coding sites is 4.7 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup> and Tajima&#x2019;s D is &#x2212;1.186.

<title><italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> isolates show little substructure in the global population</title>
<p>Several approaches were used to assess the population structure of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic>. First, we reduced the complexity of the data and drew a PCA for the SNPs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure S6</xref> shows that the first two components explain 17&#x0025; (12 and 5 resp) of the variation. When drawing the two first components, most isolates group very closely together in one cluster. Only three outliers can be observed. Similar patterns are observed in the coding parts of the genome only as well in the whole genome. Next we estimated the population structure from the SNP data. The previous PCA results and minimum entropy analysis suggest the optimal cluster k-value to be between 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7</xref>). LEA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] was run for k-values 2-4 in 10 separate runs. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> shows that with these k-values, two or three isolates can be marked as outliers, being the isolates from Norway, Argentina and possibly New Zealand.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although, it was discovered more than 100 years ago as a saprophyte of grasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], <italic>Ramularia collo-cygni</italic> began to attract interest only since the late 1980&#x2019;s when it started to gain an economic impact on cultivation in regions of major barley production. Our analysis of barley seed archive samples dating back to the late 1950&#x2019;s showed that the fungus was already present in grain before epidemics were recognized. However, it is only since the mid-1980&#x2019;s that there is a significant increase <italic>of R. collo-cygni</italic> DNA in the grain. Indeed, coinciding with more frequent observations of RLS symptoms from the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>A draft genome of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> (isolate DK05) has been available since 2016. The data suggested a genetic composition that might at least partially explain the lifestyle of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic>, which is characterized by a long endophytic phase throughout the life cycle of the host and an intense parasitic phase during crop senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. We generated an independent draft genome for another isolate (urug2) to get better insights in <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> variability and understand the genomic factors that contribute to its current success as a pathogen. To allow robust population genetics analysis, we aimed for optimised gene annotations and increased scaffold length. We assembled the 32 Mb genome into only 78 scaffolds of N50 2.1 MB length with 12,346 high confidence genes predicted. Overall, our sequencing approach allowed us to produce a high quality draft assembly for comparative studies and confirmed that unlike many other pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> did not undergo any genome expansions since it diverged from it&#x2019;s nearest related sequenced <italic>Dothidiomycete</italic> species 59 million years ago.</p>
<p>One main feature of pathogenic fungi to avoid or suppress plant defenses is the secretion of the so-called effectors. Unlike what can be seen between certain oomycete species, where the numbers of genes in some effector families differ in order of magnitude within the genus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> effector numbers are comparable with related fungi. Moreover, this phenomenon is often associated with high repeat content on the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], yet <italic>R. collo-cygni&#x2019;s</italic> repeat content is low. Hence such gene family expansions are unlikely to explain the differences between these species.</p>
<p>When looking for similarity between the predicted <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> proteome, secretome and effectome to those fungal genomes see a very strong bimodal distribution with large numbers of genes shared between all species, indicating highly conserved genes, but we find also small sets of (effector) genes unique for each pathogen. As there is no reported race-specific full resistance in <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic>, selection on the shared effector genes might not be expected to be the dominant driving force for pathogen evolution.</p>
<p>To test that hypothesis we performed a pairwise comparison of the coding sequences of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> and the related wheat pathogen <italic>Z. tritici</italic>. We observe a very high synonymous mutation rate and see very little evidence for strong positive selection on certain gene-types between the two species. The dN/dS ratio has a simple and intuitive interpretation of selection pressure, but comes with a large number of limitations, especially when dS is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. For this reason, our findings are not conclusive with regards to the number of genes actually under selective pressure. However, our analyses provide interesting insights. Contrary to phenomenon observed in a large number of other plant pathogens, we see no evidence for accelerated evolution of secreted proteins or effectors. The dN/dS distribution is similar for all three classes and also when looking at pathogenicity-related genes, based on up or downregulation on BSA, a host, mimicking medium, there are no significant differences between the groups. This is in stark contrast to for example the genus <italic>Colletotrichum,</italic> where high dN/dS was visible in effectors when comparing endophytic and parasitic species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] or the comparison between two <italic>Phytophthora</italic> species, where an elevated (&#x003E;1) dN/dS was much larger in the effectors than in all genes together (37&#x0025; versus 14&#x0025;)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] and positive selection on effectors appear to drive host-adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>].</p>
<p>This leaves the possibility that only a few unique effectors are shaping the evolution of <italic>R. collo-cygni.</italic> In other fungal pathogens, such unique effectors are often associated with host specificity or aggressiveness on a certain host, as for example in <italic>Z. tritici</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] or <italic>B. graminis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Moreover, appearance or disappearance of effector genes might indeed contribute to co-evolution with the plant hosts and is a potential driver for speciation. Thus the previously mentioned effectors unique to <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> might contain interesting candidates for future analysis. Alternatively, the largely symptomless and endophytic lifestyle and the possibility to escape to alternative hosts might have caused little selection pressure on <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic>.</p>
<p>Next, to obtain a better understanding of the biology and the current world-wide emergence of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic>, we analysed 19 <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> strains. This revealed a relatively low SNP rate, as well as a very similar transition/transversion ratio on coding regions and the whole genome (2.31 and 2.37 resp.). These findings are the first indication of gradual, but not extreme diversification within the species and suggest a bottleneck and recent expansion event of the species. We confirm that indeed there is very little evidence for geographical population substructure and with the exception of three possible outlier samples, all our samples form one genetic cluster. In a previous study, populations from Czechia and Scotland were found to form two diverged populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. With our additional sampling, we now show that isolates from these populations form rather two sides from within the same large main cluster but not clear outliers. The main cluster can be divided in two putative genomic groups, but these do not show a strong geographical cline. These results are partly surprising, because other cereal pathogens, like for example <italic>Wheat Yellow Rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici,</italic> show geographical population structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>].</p>
<p>One explanation for lack of clustering and mixing could be long distance dispersal of spores. Wind dispersal could be one means by which <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> spores travel around the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], such dispersal is heavily reliant on stochastic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], but that would only in part explain the lack of geographical clustering, as geographically close areas are still most likely to be genetically more similar to one another. Another reason could be found in seed transmission and contaminated seed shipments by humans. Seed transmission of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> has been suggested before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Hence, trading and winter nurseries potentially contribute to dispersal of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> whereas seed monitoring and quarantine might delay global spreading of RLS. These finding are in line with observations made for another barley pathogen with seed dispersal, <italic>Rynchosporium commune</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>], but closely related pathogens like Z<italic>. tritici</italic> are rarely isolated from seed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, our analyses also show no sign of a clear host specialization. These results are in contrast with other fungi. The rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> is pervasive on rice, but strains can also be found on many other monocot hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>], <italic>Z. tritici</italic> contains a small set of genes that can be related to host preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] and even the broad host range, opportunistic pathogen <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> shows signs of host-adaptation in its population structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. These examples are all linked to either selection of or absence/presence of effector genes. Yet, since we see no clear evidence for such phenomena in <italic>R. collo-cygni,</italic> it will be crucial to identify other factors in <italic>R. collo-cygni&#x2019;</italic>s biology that determine its opportunistic properties. This is particularly relevant, because other wild graminaceous hosts can be an alternative source of inoculum, resulting in more than one overwintering host available that provides a &#x201C;green bridge&#x201D; or &#x201C;seed bridge&#x201D; for <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> to survive winter.</p>
<p>The lack of host adaptation on the fungal side could give further evidence for <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> being a general endophyte of grasses. Pathogenicity would then derive from host specific lack of resistance factors or presence of susceptibility factors, likely triggered or at least enhanced by environmental factors. In <italic>Piriformospora indica</italic> metabolic cues from its hosts result in differentstrategies of host-colonisation by directly affecting expression levels of genes related to specific life-styles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Similar specific interactions are described for symbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>].In fact early infection with <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> has been observed to have beneficial effects on yield, suggesting that the host-parasite interaction switches from mutualistic/endophytic to parasitic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. An early symbiontic interaction could also explain the lack of major resistance genes in barley. The absence of epidemics in related <italic>Gramineae</italic> and the high diversity in barley germplasm give hope that effective host genes can be identified for the control of RLS.</p>
<p>Rapid expansion of a plant pathogen can also arise from beneficial recombinations during sexual reproduction. Using LD scans, we show that indeed there is proof of sexual recombinations between the populations we inspected. These findings confirm previous assumptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Interestingy, there is limited recombination within the main subpopulations (or main isolate cluster), that excludes Argentinia, Norway and New Zealand, showing that the recent expansion of <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> is possibly due to clonal propagation of one or several well-adapted strains. The combination of high clonal reproduction and global transfer via seed was probably favoured by modern intensification of cereal production and global cereal trade and trafficking. When calculating the effective population size, we see a strong increase in the past 200 years, coinciding with the intensification of barley production, suggesting that <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> expanded over time with the increased availability of susceptible hosts.</p>
<p>With its large efective population size (10 times larger than that of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]), mixed recombination and global gene flow <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> meets the criteria to classified a high risk pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. To date no major R genes have been identified against <italic>R. collo-cygni</italic> in barley and the characteristics described above make that eventual R genes are unlikely to provide durable resistance, even when introduced as stacks or pyramids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. The best way to diminish the current epidemic is to drastically reduce the effective population size. This could be achieved by measurements to reduce overwintering capacity and seed transfer or more mixed breeding approaches including identification of host factors that result in quantitative resistances or manipulation of host susceptibility factors.</p>
