<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>As direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy is progressively rolled out for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, careful scrutiny of HCV epidemiology, diagnostic testing, and access to care is crucial to underpin improvements in delivery of treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective study of HCV infection in a UK teaching hospital to evaluate the performance of different diagnostic laboratory tests, to describe the population with active HCV infection, and to determine the proportion of these individuals who access clinical care.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Over a total time period of 33 months between 2013 and 2016, we tested 38,510 individuals for HCV infection and confirmed a new diagnosis of active HCV infection (HCV-Ag&#x002B; and/or HCV RNA&#x002B;) in 359 (positive rate 0.9&#x0025;). Our in-house HCV-Ab test had a positive predictive value of 87&#x0025; when compared to repeat HCV-Ab testing in a regional reference laboratory, highlighting the potential for false positives to arise based on a single round of antibody-based screening. Of those confirmed Ab-positive, 70&#x0025; were HCV RNA positive. HCV-Ag screening performed well, with 100&#x0025; positive predictive value compared to detection of HCV RNA. There was a strong correlation between quantitative HCV-Ag and HCV RNA viral load (p&#x003C;0.0001). Among the 359 cases of infection, the median age was 37 years, 85&#x0025; were male, and 36&#x0025; were in prison. Among 250 infections for which genotype was available, HCV genotype-1 (n&#x003D;110) and genotype-3 (n&#x003D;111) accounted for the majority. 117/359 (33&#x0025;) attended a clinic appointment and 48 (13&#x0025;) had curative treatment defined as sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR<sub>12</sub>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>HCV-Ab tests should be interpreted with caution as an indicator of population prevalence of HCV infection, both as a result of the detection of individuals who have cleared infection and due to false positive test results. We demonstrate that active HCV infection is over-represented among men and in the prison population. A minority of patients with a diagnosis of HCV infection access clinical care and therapy; enhanced efforts are required to target diagnosis and providing linkage to clinical care within high risk populations.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 71 million people are chronically infected with the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and 0.4 million people die each year as a consequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] and Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] have a target of elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by the year 2030. The need for enhancing HCV diagnosis has acutely become more pertinent as a result of the availability of highly effective Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. On a worldwide basis, an estimated 80&#x2013;85&#x0025; of individuals with chronic infection are unaware of their infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], although this figure may be somewhat lower in the UK, and among those with a diagnosis a minority currently receive treatment.</p>
<p>Enhanced diagnosis of HCV is important not only as a pathway to treatment for individual patients, but also to allow confident estimates of the true prevalence of chronic HCV in different settings, to underpin appropriate allocation of resources and development of infra-structure for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Diagnosis of HCV is based on three different approaches to testing, which may be used alone or in combination. These are (i) detection of an IgG antibody by ELISA (HCV-Ab); (ii) detection of HCV core antigen (HCV-Ag); (iii) Nucleic acid testing (NAT) to detect HCV RNA by PCR (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)</p>

<label>Table 1:</label>

<graphic xlink:href="216937_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Reliance upon HCV-Ab screening has potentially distorted epidemiological data upon which resource-planning depends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], as detection of individuals who have cleared infection, as well as false positives, may have led to over estimation of HCV prevalence. As a result, there has been a progressive move towards using HCV-Ag and/or HCV PCR to determine accurately the population prevalence of active infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Although sensitivity and specificity of HCV-Ag testing appears to perform well when compared head-to-head with PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], there are still potential doubts over whether this test is adequately sensitive to be widely implemented as a primary screening tool, and recent WHO guidelines continue to recommend use of the HCV-Ab test as first line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. A careful balance must be struck between managing cost and optimising specificity without sacrificing sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>We here set out to assess our progress in diagnosing and treating HCV infection in a tertiary referral UK hospital, in the context of global aspirations for elimination. We reviewed the performance of our local HCV testing protocol in two different time periods, first when screening was undertaken using an HCV-Ab test only, and subsequently following the introduction of a combined approach using both HCV-Ab and HCV-Ag testing. In each case, we went on to evaluate further using HCV PCR. Collating these data allowed us to evaluate the performance of different diagnostic tests, to describe the epidemiology of our local cohort, and to determine the proportion of those with active HCV infection who attend a hepatology clinic and receive treatment.</p>

<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Setting and cohort</title>
<p>Our microbiology laboratory serves a large UK tertiary referral and teaching centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ouh.nhs.uk/">http://www.ouh.nhs.uk/</ext-link>) that provides one million patient contacts a year, and handles samples referred from the community as well as four in-patient sites. We retrospectively interrogated electronic microbiology records for all HCV screening tests performed within two defined time-intervals, during which different diagnostic algorithms were operating. These are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref> and outlined as follows:</p>

<list-item>
<p><bold>Group 1</bold> (18 months; January 2013 - June 2014; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). During this period, samples were screened for HCV-Ab using an ADVIA Centaur automated immunoassay (Bayer). HCV-Ab-positive samples (excluding repeat samples from patients with a pre-existing HCV diagnosis) were sent for confirmatory testing by the regional reference laboratory (Public Health England, Colindale), using two further ELISA tests (Ortho and BioRad). Antibody positive samples (based on sample:cut-off ratio &#x003E;1) were tested for HCV RNA using Abbott HCV M2000 assay.</p></list-item>
<list-item>
<p><bold>Group 2</bold> (15 months; January 2015 - March 2016; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). HCV diagnosis during this period was undertaken using a combination of HCV-Ab and HCV-Ag testing using Abbott Architect i2000SR with Diasorin Liason XL for confirmation of HCV-Ab. HCV-Ag assay positives are in the range 10-20,000 fmol/L.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For those testing positive with the initial screening test, we then collected follow-up testing data (per algorithms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). We recorded patient age, sex, and the location from which the sample was sent. Treatment data were captured and recorded from an electronic database within the Hepatology Department. Response to treatment was defined as SVR<sub>12</sub> (sustained virologic response at &#x2265;12 weeks following the end of therapy).</p>
<p>Ethnic origin is not routinely captured data in hospital electronic systems. Prior to anonymisation, we therefore used an analytical tool to estimate ethnicity, applying Onolytics software for all patients for whom a full name was part of the electronic record (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://onolytics.com">http://onolytics.com</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]). This software was developed in 2006-7 funded by Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Knowledge Transfer Partnerships, and sets out to determine probable ethnic origin based on name.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v.7.0b and Googlesheets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets</ext-link>). We compared binary values using Fisher&#x2019;s Exact Test, Mann-Whitney U test for continuous non-parametric data and linear regression for correlation between continuous variables.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Ethics approval</title>
<p>Ethics approval was not required, as this study was undertaken as a departmental quality improvement exercise within microbiology using anonymised patient data, and completed the audit cycle for previously approved audit projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Data for Onolytics analysis were handled separately and were subject to a confidential disclosure agreement drawn up by University of Oxford Research Services (February 2016).</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>HCV testing: prevalence and characteristics of infection</title>
<p>In total, we present data for 38,510 HCV tests done during the two intervals reviewed. On average testing increased slightly, from an average of 1068 tests / month during the earlier phase of the study (Group 1) up to 1286 tests / month in the later time period (Group 2); (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In total, 359 new active HCV infections were identified and confirmed during the two testing periods (359 / 38,510 &#x003D; 0.9&#x0025; of all tests performed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). Characteristics of these individuals are summarised in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and the complete metadata are available on-line (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5355097.v2">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5355097.v2</ext-link>). The median age was 37 years (IQR 31-48) and there was a consistent male excess, with men representing 55&#x0025; of those tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] but 85&#x0025; of all new diagnoses (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Over one-third (36&#x0025;) of new diagnoses were made in prison. Of the remainder, the majority were in primary care or attending hospital outpatient departments.</p>

<title>HCV-Ab test outcomes and performance</title>
<p>In the earlier testing period (Group 1), 277 of 317 HCV-Ab positive samples were positive on confirmatory testing for HCV-Ab at the reference laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>), giving our in-house test a positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.4&#x0025; compared to a regionally accepted standard. We used these results to investigate whether any host factors are associated with false positive antibody tests, and found that individuals identified as African have a higher chance of a false-positive HCV Ab test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>). We confirmed this result by multivariate logistic regression analysis, in which African ethnicity was significantly associated with a false positive Ab test result (p&#x003D;0.0004), but age &#x003E;60 years and gender were not. Prison location was associated with a true positive Ab-test result (p&#x003D;0.01).</p>

<title>HCV-Ag test outcomes and performance</title>
<p>In the later testing period (Group 2), the PPV of the combined use of HCV-Ab plus HCV-Ag was 100&#x0025; when compared to a gold-standard diagnostic test using PCR (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This exceeds a previous estimation of the PPV of the Ag test (94.7&#x0025;) calculated from assimilation of data from other comparable reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>

<graphic xlink:href="216937_tbl3.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>We explored the relationship between HCV-Ag and HCV RNA. Individuals with a positive HCV-Ag test had a median HCV viral load of 6.3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>5</sup> IU/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>), and there was a significant positive correlation between quantitative antigenaemia and viral load (r&#x003D;0.67, p&#x003C;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). This suggests that, in the absence of having access to a quantitative PCR result, HCV-Ag is a good surrogate marker of viraemia. However, in a small proportion of cases, the antigen test results in false negative results (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). There are no consistent features that unify these misleading HCV-Ag results; in particular there was no clear relationship between false negative HCV-Ag and low viral load (although one sample had HCV RNA 25 IU/ml).</p>

<p>Of 359 patients with a new HCV diagnosis, 117 (33&#x0025;) attended a hepatology clinic appointment, 76 were treated (21&#x0025;) and 48 had an outcome of SVR<sub>12</sub> (13&#x0025;). These data illustrate the substantial loss of patients at each step of the clinical pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>; <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), due to a combination of factors including poor linkage between services, itinerant populations, individuals who are drug users and/or in prison, and deaths.</p>

<p>This study was not designed to examine or report on the outcomes of treatment. However, we examined existing treatment data (Suppl data table) to look for evidence of different outcomes between genotypes 1 and 3. Among genotype 1 infections, we recorded 28 cases of SVR<sub>12</sub>, and two cases who relapse. For genotype 3, there were 16 cases of SVR<sub>12</sub> and five relapses. This difference did not reach statistical significance (p&#x003D;0.1, Fisher&#x2019;s Exact Test).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Summary comments</title>
<p>Careful scrutiny of HCV testing and treatment is important so that best efforts can be made to diagnose and treat individuals with active infection in order to optimize the benefits of recent therapeutic advances, and to move towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Our study indicates a high workload of HCV-screening in a UK teaching hospital laboratory (&#x003E;1000 tests performed each month). Overall, 0.9&#x0025; of these were confirmed to have active HCV infection, with a substantial excess among males, and over one-third from the prison population. Following the implementation of HCV-Ag testing as part of the diagnostic algorithm, the PPV of a positive test increased to 100&#x0025;, slightly exceeding that reported by other recently published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. In keeping with national and international data, genotypes 1 and 3 predominate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], with a trend towards better outcome in treatment of genotype 1 infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Relevance to laboratory and clinical practice</title>
<p>Although HCV-Ag testing can potentially replace a nucleic acid test for HCV diagnosis or monitoring in some settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], guidelines from the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] still advocate use of PCR as a definitive test following HCV-Ab (&#x00B1; HCV-Ag) screening. RNA PCR also remains the gold-standard approach to monitoring progress during and after treatment and is required for genotyping which is currently still important to underpin optimum choice of DAA regimen, despite an ultimate desire to develop pan-genotype treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Ultimately, therefore, reducing the cost of PCR may be a more desirable outcome than focusing on improving the sensitivity of antigen detection.</p>
<p>The small proportion of all diagnosed patients who access clinical care and receive successful treatment is in keeping with that reported in other centres including recently by a London centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], reflecting many challenges for HCV elimination. Our data highlight the particular attention that is needed for the vulnerable prison population; with a worldwide estimate of 15&#x0025; HCV prevalence in prisoners worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], this is an issue that demands urgent international attention. Offering treatment within the prison system has now become a realistic possibility, on the basis of oral DAA therapy, shortened treatment regimens (regimens of 12 to 24-weeks, and possibly shorter), and a low rate of side-effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].</p>
<p>In the longer term, bigger datasets are required to improve our insights into this patient population, and to identify areas where additional resource and investment is required. Substantial efforts are underway, with funding underpinned by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) through the NHIR Health Informatics collaborative (NHIC), to improve the collation of clinical and laboratory data for patients with viral hepatitis, in order to develop and strengthen links between patient care, laboratory microbiology, and research questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Significance of male excess</title>
<p>There are emerging data to suggest a genuine discrepancy in susceptibility to, and outcomes of, infection between males and females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], but in this instance the male predominance may be accounted for by behaviour (e.g. among MSM and PWID) rather than biological differences. In the context of this study we do not have the careful prospective socio-demographic data that would be required to investigate this further.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Caveats and limitations</title>
<p>Our analysis must be set in the overall context of the low prevalence of HCV in our setting, and the retrospective approach to data collection. Such approaches to estimation of epidemiology underestimate the true prevalence, as a result of a large pool of individuals who are HCV-infected but never receive a test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The rate of false negative HCV tests is our population is likely to be low, but quantifying this was not possible within this study, as we relied on identifying samples that initially tested positive. In order to ascertain the PPV of the HCV-Ab test in-house, we referred to a Reference Laboratory test as &#x2018;gold standard&#x2019;. However, this repeat testing in a Reference Laboratory setting is itself subject to an error rate, and therefore may lead to a misrepresentation of our overall assay performance.</p>
<p>We found evidence that the HCV-Ab test performs poorly in individuals predicted to be of African origin; similarly, a similar high rate of false positive tests has previously been reported from Polynesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. This illustrates how tests that have been developed and tested in white European/Caucasian populations cannot necessarily be robustly applied in other settings, potentially contributing to global healthcare inequalities. Although name can be a reliable surrogate for ethnic background, and the tools used here have been validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], this remains an imperfect way to derive ethnic origin and is potentially confounded by a variety of factors, the most obvious of which is individuals who change their name (usually in the setting of marriage).</p>
<p>In our setting, the sexual health clinic anonymises patient data which prevents robust linkage between services, and we are unable to trace outcomes for patients who were diagnosed via this route (8&#x0025; of the total; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Likewise, consistent identification and tracing of individuals who are drug users and/or in prison is challenging, and we cannot exclude the possibility of duplication of some of these individuals within our dataset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Performance of HCV-Ag test</title>
<p>We identified seven patients in this cohort in whom there was discordance between HCV-Ag (negative) and HCV RNA results (positive). There was no consistent feature (age, sex, patient location, genotype of HCV infection) that unified these individuals (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). One potential explanation for discrepancies is mutations in the core region of the HCV genome which could account for a failure of antigen detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], or potentially cause lack of PCR amplification if mutations occur in the regions required for primer binding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Global context</title>
<p>Moving towards the SDG target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] requires a multi-faceted approach, with focus on optimization of laboratory testing and reduction of costs in order to improve access to accurate diagnosis, advocacy for better testing and treatment for populations in resource-limited settings, allocating resources in order to deliver curative therapy supported by appropriate monitoring, targeting interventions at high-risk populations including MSM, PWID and prisons, and ensuring that individuals diagnosed with infection are offered &#x2013; and receive &#x2013; clinical care and follow-up.</p>
