<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Age-associated deterioration of cellular physiology leads to pathological conditions. The ability to detect premature aging could provide a window for preventive therapies against age-related diseases. However, the techniques for determining cellular age are limited, as they rely on a limited set of histological markers and lack predictive power. Here, we implement GERAS (GEnetic Reference for Age of Single-cell), a machine learning based framework capable of assigning individual cells to chronological stages based on their trans criptomes. GERAS displays greater than 90&#x0025; accuracy in classifying the chronological stage of zebrafish and human pancreatic cells. The framework demonstrates robustness against biological and technical noise, as evaluated by its performance on independent samplings of single-cells. Additionally, GERAS determines the impact of differences in calorie intake and BMI on the aging of zebrafish and human pancreatic cells, respectively. We further harness the predictive power of GERAS to identify genome-wide molecular factors that correlate with aging. We show that one of these factors, <italic>junb</italic>, is necessary to maintain the proliferative state of juvenile beta-cells. Our results showcase the applicability of a machine learning framework to classify the chronological stage of heterogeneous cell populations, while enabling to detect pro-aging factors and candidate genes associated with aging.</p>

<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>Aging is a universal phenomenon, during which cells undergo progressive transcriptional <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, genomic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> epigenetic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and metabolic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> changes. The age-related modifications can deteriorate the functional properties of cells. The accumulation of cellular defects can lead to a decline in organismal health and to the onset of age-related diseases. A major focus of the biology of aging is to identify factors that accelerate or slow-down, preferably even reverse, the cellular aging process. Biological studies have identified multiple modifiers of the aging process, including genetic and environmental factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. For instance, caloric restriction has been demonstrated to increase lifespan in multiple species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, including humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, the discovery of factors that influence aging relies on retrospective measures, after the impact of age has already manifested itself, and depends on a restricted set of indicators based on histological analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. It is therefore imperative to develop reliable indicators of cellular age that forgo the need for detrimental phenotypes. Predicting cellular aging before the defects manifest themselves would provide a window for therapeutic interventions. Preventive therapies during this window would bypass additional complications arising after the onset of the pathology.</p>
<p>The development of a reliable cellular age predictor requires two principal components. Firstly, it entails a reliable assessment of the transitions cells undergo with age. Secondly, the predictor should be capable of placing cells of unknown age along this transition path in order to estimate their age. The first objective, assessment of cellular transitions, has been enabled by recent advances in single-cell mRNA expression profiling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Cellular progression through the transitions is increasingly being described by both heuristic methods and probabilistic models. These methods are categorized as pseudotemporal estimation algorithms and use techniques such as dimensionality reduction, graph theory, bifurcation analysis and optimal-transport analysis to place cells along a transition trajectory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. All the methods make explicit or implicit assumptions about the smoothness of mRNA expression profiles along the trajectories and seek to explain part of the variation across the cells by location along the trajectory. Unwanted variation that cannot be explained by trajectory location can confound the analysis. Some methods protect against confounding effects by using a prior over pseudotime that leverages information about the time cells were assayed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> whilst others do not. Although current methods can reveal cellular transitions during a differentiation process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, they have only been shown to work retrospectively, that is they have no predictive ability to insert <italic>de-novo</italic> samples into the trajectories. Thus, their predictive utility on unseen cells, the second objective, remains unresolved.</p>
<p>Prediction of the position of <italic>de-novo</italic> samples in a cellular transition trajectory requires discrimination of the transcriptional features of importance from the confounding factors that accompany single-cell measurements. The three main confounding factors are: 1) biological noise due to fluctuations in mRNA expression levels, 2) technical noise inherent in single-cell mRNA sequencing, and 3) cell-type diversity within an organ. Biological noise can arise due to the stochasticity in biochemical processes involved in mRNA production and degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, heterogeneity in the cellular microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and many more unknown factors. Although mechanisms such as the passive transport of newly transcribed mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm exist to reduce the level of biological noise <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, it can never be eliminated completely <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In fact, aging might enhance fluctuations in mRNA expression levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, in certain contexts, fluctuations in expression levels are beneficial to the organism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Technical noise, on the other hand, arises due to the sensitivity and depth of single-cell sequencing technology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Sequencing involves conversion of mRNA into cDNA and amplification of the minute amounts of cDNA. These steps could omit certain mRNA molecules, muting their detection. Moreover, amplified cDNA molecules might escape sequencing due to the limits on the comprehensiveness of the technology. In effect, expression noise is inherent to single-cell measurements.</p>
<p>The diversity in cell types within an organ adds a second layer of complexity to the inherent noise in mRNA expression. Diverse types of cells express unique sets of genes and regulatory networks. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of cellular sub-populations within nominally homogenous cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. For example, pancreatic beta-cells have been shown to consist of dynamic sub-populations with different proliferative and functional properties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and liver cells were demonstrated to display variability in gene expression depending on their location within the organ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> Thus, the inherent cell-to-cell heterogeneity adds to the challenge of extracting age-specific transitions from mRNA expression profiles. Furthermore, cellular heterogeneity makes it difficult to extrapolate the results from studies at the tissue-scale to the aging of individual cells and to identify common molecular signatures of aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we provide a framework that efficiently &#x2018;learns&#x2019; the cellular transitions of aging from single-cell gene expression data in the presence of expression noise and cellular heterogeneity. First, the age predictor is trained to recognize the age of individual cells based on their chronological stage. Chronological stage is an easily measurable fact, and hence provides a ground truth for the training. Second, we show that the trained predictor can place robustly cells of unknown ages along the aging path. To show the utility of the age predictor, we apply it to the pancreatic beta-cells, which represent an excellent system for studying aging. In mammals, the beta-cell mass is established during infancy and serves the individual throughout life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The long-lived beta-cells support blood glucose regulation, with their dysfunction implicated in the development of Type 2 diabetes. Older beta-cells display hallmarks of aging, such as a reduced proliferative capacity and impaired function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We first focus on the zebrafish beta-cells due to the potential for visualization and genetic manipulation of beta-cells at single-cell resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and extend our framework to human pancreatic cells using publicly available published datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the predictor&#x2019;s utility in identifying age-modifying genetic and environmental factors.</p>

<title>Machine learning based framework accurately and robustly predicts chronological stage</title>
<p>To capture the transcriptional dynamics of beta-cells with age, we performed singlecell mRNA sequencing of beta-cells in primary islets dissected from animals belonging to three chronological stages: Juvenile (1 month post-fertilization (mpf)), Adolescent (3, 4 and 6 mpf) and Adult (10, 12 and 14 mpf). Using <italic>Tg(ins:Betabow)</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, a transgenic line that specifically marks zebrafish beta-cells with red fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. S1), we isolated and sequenced 827 beta-cells in multiple batches. Sequencing was performed using the Smart-Seq2 protocol, which has been demonstrated to provide higher transcriptional coverage than other methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The sequenced cells were quality-controlled to yield a total of 645 beta-cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). To identify age-specific transitions, we first attempted to order the cells using an unsupervised pseudotemporal analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, the beta-cells from the three chronological stages were broadly spread along the predicted temporal trajectory. The shortfall of unsupervised pseudotemporal ordering prompted us to consider an alternative approach in which we modeled the data using the ground truth provided by the chronological stage. For this, we developed a supervised deep learning framework to predict the stage of the cellular origin: Juvenile, Adolescent or Adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). As input to the classifier, genes detected in all the cells were ranked in descending order of their variability and the top 1000 genes were selected for training (Supplementary Table S1). Since neural networks are prone to overfitting, two normalizing hyperparameters were added: L2 regularization (which penalizes a strong focus on few inputs) and dropout regularization (which helps &#x2018;averaging&#x2019; across connections). This framework was named GERAS (GEnetic Reference for Age of Single-cell) in reference to the Greek God of old age.</p>

</fig>
<p>For training GERAS, 80&#x0025; of the beta-cells were randomly chosen. Optimal normalizing hyperparameters determined by cross-validation were used for training the final predictor. Following development, we estimated the contribution of the 1000 input genes towards accurate predictions (Supplementary Fig. S4, Supplementary Table S1). The estimation showed that the input genes displayed a wide distribution of importance towards the accuracy of prediction. Notably, some of these genes were previously implicated in diabetes (Supplementary Fig. S4b). Using the trained GERAS, internal validation was carried out with a test set comprising the remaining 20&#x0025; of the cells from each chronological stage. The cells of the test set had never been shown to GERAS. Internal validation achieved an overall accuracy (proportion of cells for which the predicted stage matched the real stage) of 91&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This demonstrates the success of GERAS in classifying individual cells into chronological stages based solely on their mRNA expression profile.</p>
<p>Next, we wanted to understand the robustness of GERAS under biological and technical noise, typically encountered in batch measurements of single-cells. To this end, we performed external validation using independently sequenced beta-cells. We sequenced a new batch of beta-cells from adolescent animals (4 mpf) and used GERAS to predict their chronological age. All cells from this independent cohort were classified as &#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019; (100&#x0025; accuracy), the ground truth for the stage of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Additionally, we tested the performance of GERAS with beta-cells sequenced using alternative pipelines.</p>
<p>Specifically, we utilized the C1-Chip platform from Fluidigm to sequence a new batch of beta-cells from adolescent animals (3 mpf). GERAS achieved 92.3&#x0025; success in correctly classifying the cells from the new batch as &#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). These data underscore the potential of GERAS in effectively handling batch effects.</p>
<p>To test the performance of GERAS on a regression task, we evaluated the model&#x2019;s ability to classify cells obtained from time-points in-between the discrete chronological stages we used for training. For interpolation, we collected beta-cells from animals aged 1.5 mpf (juvenile) or 9 mpf (adult) since these ages were not part of the model&#x2019;s constituent stages. GERAS classified 50&#x0025; of the beta-cells from 1.5 mpf animals as &#x2018;Juvenile&#x2019;, and 47.3&#x0025; as &#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Thus, GERAS classified 97.3&#x0025; of beta-cells in time-periods neighboring the actual age of the sample. Similarly, 31&#x0025; of the beta-cells from 9 mpf animals were classified as &#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019;, and 69&#x0025; as &#x2018;Adult&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). None (0&#x0025;) of the cells were attributed to the &#x2018;Juvenile&#x2019; stage, further strengthening the interpolation capacity of GERAS. Taken together, these results demonstrate that our model divides the continuous time variable into discrete but linearly-ordered stages, thereby allowing regression analysis of the data.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>GERAS evaluates the impact of an environmental factor on cellular age</title>
<p>The rate of aging is susceptible to modifications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and nutritional cues have been noted to alter aging in many organisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. To investigate the effect of altering nutritional cues on cellular age, we employed the ability of GERAS to handle batch effects and interpolation. Specifically, we focused on studying the impact of calorie intake on beta-cell aging. We separated 3 mpf adolescent zebrafish siblings into two groups. One group was fed three times a day with <italic>Artemia</italic>, a typical fish diet consisting of living prey with a relatively high amount of fat and carbohydrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The other group was placed on intermittent feeding with normal feeding performed on alternate days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). After one month, the beta-cells were isolated and the age of individual beta-cells was evaluated using GERAS for each group. The analysis showed a striking difference in age between the two sets of beta-cells obtained from coeval adolescent zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). While 65&#x0025; of the beta-cells from zebrafish on intermittent feeding were classified as &#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019;, only 23&#x0025; of the beta-cells from three-times-a-day-fed animals were similarly classified; the rest 77&#x0025; were categorized as &#x2018;Adult&#x2019;. This difference in classification of the beta-cells isolated from animals of the same age suggests that higher-caloric intake expedites the aging of young beta-cells. Moreover, it shows the utility of GERAS in evaluating a pro-aging factor.</p>

<title>GERAS-based predictions lead to discovery of a molecular factor involved in aging</title>
<p>To identify molecular players underlying the accelerated aging of beta-cells with higher-calorie intake, we harnessed the heterogeneity in the chronological stage predictions along with the inherent heterogeneity in gene expression within single cells. In our framework, chronological stage predictions can be easily converted to classification probability by using the output of &#x2018;softmax&#x2019; layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref> and Methods). This transforms discrete classifications into a continuous probability distribution (Supplementary Fig. S5). Taking advantage of this approach, we calculated the correlation between the probabilities of the beta-cells to be classified in the younger (&#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019;) stage with the mRNA expression levels of all 11,570 genes expressed in the beta-cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). For correlation analysis, genes with positive correlation increase the chance of the cell being classified in the younger stage, while a negative correlation enhances the chance of classification in the older stage. The correlation analysis for beta-cells from three-times-a-day fed animals revealed 1158 genes exhibiting high (positive or negative) correlation with predictive probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>, Supplementary Table S2 and S3). Unbiased gene ontology analysis using DAVID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> revealed involvement of the highly correlated genes in aging-related pathways, including cellular differentiation, protein transport <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, amino acid biosynthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, NAD&#x002B; ADP-ribosyltransferase activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and basic-leucine zipper domain containing transcription factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In particular, there was a positive correlation with the transcription factors <italic>junba</italic> and <italic>fosab</italic>, suggesting a role for these genes in the classification of the beta-cells to the younger, &#x2018;Adolsecent&#x2019;, stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Additionally, in our primary mRNA expression data of beta-cells from three chronological stages, <italic>junba</italic> and <italic>fosab</italic> displayed significant down-regulation with age (Supplementary Fig. S6). Notably, <italic>junba</italic>, was not one of the 1000-input genes utilized by GERAS for generating predictions, demonstrating the capacity of correlation analysis to identify genome-wide candidate genes.</p>
<p>Based on the observation that <italic>junba</italic> expression in beta-cells declines with age, and its positive correlation with the classification of beta-cells from animals on a higher-calorie diet to the younger stage, we decided to investigate the biological impact of reducing <italic>junba</italic> function. For this, we overexpressed a dominant negative version of <italic>junba</italic> specifically in beta-cells (using an <italic>ins:nls-BFP-2A-DN-junba</italic> construct) (Supplementary Fig. S7a). The expression of <italic>nls-BFP-2A-DN-junba</italic> was induced in the background of the beta-cell specific fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI)-reporters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, allowing identification of beta-cell&#x2019;s cell-cycle stage (Supplementary Fig. S7b, c). Comparison between the juxtaposed <italic>DN-junba</italic>-expressing and control cells within islets from juveniles (1 mpf), a stage associated with high rates of beta-cell proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, showed a 50&#x0025; decline in proliferation upon <italic>DN-junba</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). Thus, blocking <italic>junba</italic> function can reduce the proliferation of juvenile beta-cells. Since the reduction in proliferation of beta-cells is a hallmark of aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, our results suggest that declining <italic>junba</italic> expression might underlie this reduction.</p>

<title>A single model for chronological stage classification of the entire human pancreatic cells</title>
<p>Next, to test the applicability of our framework beyond the scope of zebrafish beta-cells, we developed a classifier for human cells using the entire ensemble of pancreatic cells. The pancreas, a gland located in the abdomen, is involved in metabolic regulation and food digestion. Metabolic regulation is accomplished by the endocrine part of the pancreas, which chiefly consists of beta-, alpha-, and delta-cells. Food digestion, on the other hand, is contributed by the exocrine part of the pancreas, composed of ductal and acinar cells. An important characteristic of pancreatic cells is the presence of cell-specific marker genes, allowing computational segregation of the various cell-types based on mRNA expression levels (Methods). To develop the classifier for human pancreatic cells, we obtained singlecell mRNA expression profiles from Enge et al. Their study generated single-cell transcriptomes from pancreatic cells of eight healthy individuals belonging to three discrete stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>: Juvenile (1 month, 5 and 6 years), Young (21 and 22 years), and Middle (38, 44 and 54 years) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Without segregating the data by cell-type, we trained GERAS to predict the chronological stage for the entire ensemble of pancreatic cells. The trained GERAS, utilizing inputs from multiple genes (Supplementary Fig. S8, Supplementary Table S4), achieved an overall accuracy of 95&#x0025; on the test set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Upon segregating the results by cell type, based on the expression of their respective markers, we found that GERAS displayed &#x003E;90&#x0025; accuracy for each major cell-type of the pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>&#x2019;), demonstrating the feasibility of developing a single age classifier for the multiple cell types of the pancreas.</p>

</fig>
<p>As an additional validation, a second assessment with human cells was undertaken by utilizing the single-cell mRNA expression profiles of human pancreatic cells from a publication by Segerstolpe et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. This independent cohort contains single-cell transcriptomes from pancreata of six healthy individuals ranging from 22 - 48 year of age. Additionally, the body mass index (BMI) for each individual was reported, allowing comparisons between individuals with similar chronological age but different body weight. Using GERAS trained with the human data from Enge et al., we predicted the chronological stage of the cells from two individuals (aged 43 and 48 years) belonging to the &#x2018;Middle&#x2019; age group (38 - 54 years). The predictions displayed &#x003E;93&#x0025; classification accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This high accuracy of prediction on data from a second independent source further strengthens the external validation of our model. Next, we utilized the data from two individuals, aged 23 and 22 years. Despite the proximity in their chronological age, these two individuals differed in their BMI values (21.5 - normal and 32.9 - obese, respectively). Strikingly, our analysis revealed different classification pattern for data from each of these individuals: while 32&#x0025; of the cells from the 23 year old with normal BMI were classified in the younger stages, none of the cells from the 22 year old with obese BMI fell in similar stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Following this observation, we calculated the classification probability of the all six individuals in relation to their BMI. The probability results from our analysis suggest that an obese BMI correlates with an increased probability for the cells to be classified in an older stage (Supplementary Fig. S9). We recommend exercising caution while interpreting this result due to the multiple confounding factors associated with human samples that we could not control for. A GERAS developed with cells from individuals encompassing a wider distribution of age and BMI range would be desired for stronger conclusions. Nevertheless, the successful age classification of an entire human organ and its external validation, demonstrate the adaptability of our framework to diverse cell-types, thereby establishing the universality of the approach.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this study, we have presented a method that provides the blueprint for developing predictive classifier for cellular aging. Our chronological stage predictor efficiently handles biological and technical noise, and functions robustly on a diverse cell population. The temporal classifier was developed in an unbiased, data-driven manner. Genes for building the predictor were not selected based on their differential expression with time. The classifier predicted the chronological age solely from the expression profile of the top 1000 most variable genes. The algorithm, however, did not use all genes uniformly. Instead, varying levels of importance were attributed to the input genes (Supplementary Fig. S4, S8). Multiple genes exhibiting high importance for successful classification show an existing association with metabolic and age-related degenerative disorders. For instance, the human pancreatic GERAS ascribes high importance to Amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is associated with Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, and also recently implicated in pancreatic biology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> In the future, it would be worthwhile to test the biological functions for the genes selected by the classifier, and to follow-up on them as potential biomarkers of the aging process.</p>
<p>The predictive power of the framework is not restricted to classification tasks. The discrete classifications can be readily converted to a continuous probability distribution (Supplementary Fig. S5). This characteristic can be exploited to shed light on the molecular factors controlling the rate of aging. We used this feature on beta-cells displaying accelerated aging in response to a higher calorie diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Correlating the probability distribution with gene expression enabled identification of candidate genes involved in the aging process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). Such analysis was possible due to the single-cell-centric nature of our approach, and would be missed out with bulk sequencing in which the cellular variability is averaged out. Follow-up analysis using a genetic technique (Supplementary Fig. S7) verified the role of one candidate gene, <italic>junba</italic>, in regulating the proliferation of beta-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). It is important to note that the mosaic analysis was performed in whole islets without any tissue dissociation, thus avoiding any dissociation-specific modification in cell physiology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. However, a reduction in proliferation represents one aspect of the aging process, and additional roles for <italic>junba</italic> activity during the aging process still need verification. Nonetheless, the age-dependent reduction of <italic>Junb</italic>, the mammalian homologue of <italic>junba</italic>, has been implicated in post-natal maturation of mouse beta-cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. It would be of interest to follow-up on these results and study the connection between aging and <italic>Junb</italic> activity in mammalian models.</p>
<p>Importantly, beta-cells from animals fed three-times-a-day revealed a diversity in their classification. Notably, 23&#x0025; of the beta-cells were classified in the younger stage, suggesting cellular heterogeneity in the aging process. This was additionally observed during the interpolation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>), in which cells from intermediate time-points classified in the two adjacent stages. Asynchronous cellular aging in beta-cells was recently hypothesized using histological analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> Quantifying the extent of heterogeneity in the aging process while capturing the mRNA expression profile, made possible by our framework, provides an exciting opportunity for understanding the molecular underpinnings of heterogeneous cellular aging.</p>
<p>Our machine-learning based framework has high flexibility in its design and execution, which can be exploited to develop predictive models based on diverse biological parameters. Moreover, the inputs to the predictor are not limited to mRNA expression levels but can be extended to include other covariates. With improvements in single cell epigenetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, new models integrating both genetic and epigenetic changes could be built to improve accuracy and resolution.</p>
<p>Our framework is based on the assumption that chronological age provides a useful metric for the modeling of age. Chronological age is an easily observable fact, and this provided the ground truth for training and testing our models. The aging trajectory provided by the use of chronological age served as benchmark for all predictions generated by the framework. However, chronological age does not always correlate well with development of disease and mortality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> Previous studies have introduced the concept of biological age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, a metric that correlates better than chronological age with pathological conditions. However, the determination of biological age requires training, testing and verification of regression models. This leads to the biological age being defined as per the computation model, which can result in very low overlap between different measures of biological age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> In the future, it would be worthwhile to generate two-tier models combining the information from models based on chronological and biological age.</p>
<p>We developed our model with the idea in mind to be able to detect premature aging. However, individual responses might differ towards the factors that lead to accelerated aging. For instance, within the population of humans with an obese BMI, the &#x2018;metabolically healthy obese&#x2019; group exhibits lower risk for complications as compared to the &#x2018;metabolically unhealthy obese&#x2019; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Further work needs to be done to identify individual risk-factors associated with premature aging. This would be necessary for recommendations of preventive therapies.</p>
<p>The predictors presented in this study are restricted by sequencing platforms and the specific tissues utilized for training them. This limits their immediate adaptation. The predictors are built with data generated from Smart-Seq2 sequencing pipeline, which captures the full-length mRNAs with high transcriptome coverage. The predictor might be unable to handle the data from Drop-seq or MARS-seq, protocols that sequence the 3&#x2019;-end of mRNA and provide lower-coverage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> Computational efforts for eliminating the idiosyncrasies of individual platforms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> would help to remove this restriction. Additionally, the predictors do not extend beyond the currently described tissues. Investigators interested in the aging of other cells, for instance muscle, would need to develop and validate <italic>de-novo</italic> predictive models. Nevertheless, we expect the groundwork presented here to help with the development of predictive models. Further improvements of our approach could expedite the identification of age-modifying factors, which are important regulators of development and disease.</p>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>Here we developed a machine learning based platform that successfully predicts the chronological stage of individual cells. We show the framework&#x2019;s robustness in handling multiple sample processing pipelines, time-points that fall between the discrete chronological stages, and diversity in cell types. The framework&#x2019;s capability to characterize aging factors was demonstrated through evaluation of the impact of a higher-calorie feeding on beta-cell aging. The predictive power of the framework was further harnessed to discover <italic>junba</italic> as a candidate gene that maintains the proliferative beta-cell state, a characteristic trait of younger beta-cells. Broad applicability of the framework was demonstrated by predictions on the entire human pancreatic tissue. We anticipate that the robustness and flexibility exhibited here will enable the development of aging models for multiple tissues, opening the possibility of detecting premature aging and preventing pathological developments.

<title>Development of GERAS for zebrafish beta-cells</title>
<p>For development of GERAS for zebrafish beta-cells, read counts were used from seven ages of zebrafish: 1 mpf, 3 mpf, 4 mpf, 6 mpf, 10 mpf, 12 mpf and 14 mpf. The 3 mpf and 6 mpf stages contained two batches of beta-cells collected and sequenced on different days. Each batch of cells originated from six zebrafish. Read counts were normalized to transcripts per million (TPM) using the formula:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="303214_ueqn1.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula> where for gene <italic>g</italic> and cell <italic>c</italic>, <italic>Transcript<sub>gc</sub></italic> are the number of transcripts calculated by dividing the read counts to the length of the gene in kb, and TPM is the proportion of the gene&#x2019;s transcripts among per million of total cellular transcripts.</p>
<p>The entire dataset containing 508 beta-cells were randomly divided into 80&#x0025;-20&#x0025; train-test set. Genes were sorted in descending order according to their expression variability (calculated by &#x2018;median absolute deviation&#x2019;) in the entire dataset. The top 1000 most variable genes were used for developing a four-layer fully connected neural network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The neural network contained two hidden layers with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, and a softmax output layer. The network was trained to classify the pancreatic cells into three chronological ages: Juvenile (1 month post-fertilization (mpf)), Adolescent (3, 4 and 6 mpf) and Adult (10, 12 and 14 mpf). During training, a five-fold cross-validation was repeated three times over a grid of values for regularization hyperparameters: dropout frequency (0.4 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1) and regularization constant (0.4 to 1.6 in steps of 0.2). The combination with the highest cross-validation accuracy was taken as the optimal value, and a final model was trained using the entire training set and the optimal regularization hyperparameters. The entire network was implemented in R using TensorFlow API. An Rmarkdown report detailing the development of zebrafish beta-cell GERAS is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sumeetpalsingh/GERAS2017/blob/master/GERAS_Tf_Zf.html">https://github.com/sumeetpalsingh/GERAS2017/blob/master/GERAS_Tf_Zf.html</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The trained model was used to predict the chronological age of the test set. Accuracy was calculated as the proportion of cells for which the prediction matched the chronological age. By considering each prediction as a binomial distribution (a &#x2018;Juvenile&#x2019; cell can be classified as &#x2018;Juvenile&#x2019; or &#x2018;Not Juvenile&#x2019;), the standard error was calculated using the following formula:

<title>Prediction of chronological age using GERAS for zebrafish beta-cells</title>
<p>For external validation (4 mpf and 3 mpf C1-sample) and interpolation (1.5 mpf and 9 mpf), new batches of zebrafish beta-cells were isolated in 96-well plates and sequenced. Quality controlled raw counts were obtained as outlined above. The raw counts were normalized to TPM values, which were then used to predict the chronological stage using pretrained GERAS. Results were depicted as balloonplots, where a grid contains dots whose size reflects the percentage of cells classified in the corresponding group.</p>

<p>Twelve zebrafish at 3 mpf from the same clutch were separated into two groups of 6 animals each.

The intermittent feeding group was fed on alternate day, while the other group was fed three times daily with intervals of at least two hours between the feedings. Amount of food eaten by each animal was not controlled. After a month, the beta-cells were isolated into 96-well plates using FACS. The cells were processed and sequenced together.

<title>Correlation analysis and gene ontology (GO) analysis</title>
<p>Correlation analysis was carried out for beta-cells collected from the three-times-a-day animals. These beta-cells classified in &#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019; and &#x2018;Adult&#x2019; stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The analysis calculated the correlation between the probability of a cell to be classified in the younger (&#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019;) stage and the mRNA expression of genes. To obtain the classification probability, the softmax for the &#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019; stage was calculated from the output layer of GERAS (Fig. S5). For this, a function (model_softmax) was written that takes the log2-transformed normalized values of single cells, performs forward propagation through GERAS till the softmax layer, and returns the output. The output contains the probability for the particular cell to classify in all the three stages (&#x2018;Juvenile&#x2019;, &#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Adult&#x2019;). The function is deposited as source/model_softmax.R <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. The probability for &#x2018;Adolescent&#x2019; stage was extracted from this output.</p>
<p>Correlation coefficient was calculating using the cor(classification probability, gene expression) function in R. The calculation was restricted to genes expressed in more than 10&#x0025; of the cells (11,570 genes). This gave a correlation value for each gene expressed in beta-cells from three-times-a-day animals. The values were sorted in ascending order and plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>. The genes with the highest positive correlation were identified as the top fifth-percentile, and the genes with the highest negative correlation were identified as the lowest fifth-percentile. These genes were further used for unbiased gene ontology (GO) analysis using DAVID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> As background for GO analysis, the list of expressed genes was used.</p>

The network was trained to classify the pancreatic cells into three chronological ages: Juvenile (1 month, 5 and 6 years), Young (21 and 22 years), and Middle (38, 44 and 54 years). During training, a five-fold cross-validation was repeated three times over a grid of values for regularization hyperparameters: dropout frequency (0.4 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1) and regularization constant (0.2 to 1.2 in steps of 0.2).

A cell was classified if the expression value of any cell-specific marker exceeded 50 RPM, else it was classified as &#x2018;Others&#x2019;. For classification, the cell-type marker with the highest expression determined the cell type. Thus, a (theoretical) cell with RPM values of 1000 INS, 3 GCG, 4 SST, 0 PRSS1, 0 KRT19 was classified as beta-cell, while another (theoretical) cell with RPM values of 3 INS, 5 GCG, 7 SST, 1777 PRSS1, 9 KRT19 was classified as acinar cell.
