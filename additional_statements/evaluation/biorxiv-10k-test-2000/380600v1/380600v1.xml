<title>Summary</title>
<p>Loss of function of the tumor suppressor p53 is generally thought to increase cell motility and invasiveness. Using 2-D confluent and 3-D spheroidal cell motility assays with bladder carcinoma cells and colorectal carcinoma cells, we report, to the contrary, that loss of p53 can decrease cell motility and invasion.</p>

<title>Abstract</title>
<p>For migration of the single cell studied in isolation, loss of function of the tumor suppressor p53 is thought to increase cell motility. Here by contrast we used the 2-D confluent cell layer and the 3-D multicellular spheroid to investigate how p53 impacts dissemination and invasion of cellular collectives. We used two human carcinoma cell lines, the bladder carcinoma EJ and the colorectal carcinoma HCT116. We began by replicating single cell invasion in the traditional Boyden chamber assay, and found that the number of invading cells increased with loss of p53, as expected. In the confluent 2-D cell layer, however, for both EJ and HCT, speeds and effective diffusion coefficients for the p53 null types compared to their p53 expressing counterparts were significantly smaller. Compared to p53 expressers, p53 null cells exhibited more organized cortical actin rings together with reduced front-rear cell polarity. Furthermore, loss of p53 caused cells to exert smaller traction forces upon their substrates, and reduced formation of cryptic lamellipodia. In a 3-D collagen matrix, p53 consistently promoted invasion of the multicellular spheroids into surrounding matrix. Together, these results show that p53 expression in these carcinoma model systems increases collective cellular migration and invasion. As such, these studies point to paradoxical contributions of p53 in single cell versus collective cellular migration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Among human cancers, the tumor suppressor p53 is the most mutated gene and serves not only as an inducer of cancer cell senescence and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], but also as a central suppressor of cancer cell migration and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. For example, in 3-dimensional (3D) Matrigel assays, loss of p53 increases single cell invasion by enhancing cell contractility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In wound healing assays, p53 can decrease the migration distance of leading cells by the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In addition, p53 can inhibit cancer cell metastasis by suppressing focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] and preventing degradation of the extracellular cell matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Most studies to date have emphasized effects of p53 on single cell invasion in the Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. It is now recognized, however, that metastatic disease is dominated by collective cellular migration rather than single cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. In the case of collective cellular migration, the cell-cell interactions can be quite strong and highly cooperative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Moreover, the cellular collective can become jammed, immobile, and solid-like, or unjammed, mobile, and fluid-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. In the case of single cell migration, by contrast, none of these potent mechanisms are operative. It remains unclear, however, how p53 functions in the context of such collective phenomena.</p>
<p>To address that issue, here we studied migration and invasion in 2D confluent cell layers and 3D multicellular spheroids. Two human cell lines were used, the bladder carcinoma EJ and the colorectal carcinoma HCT116. We first replicated single cell invasion assays in the Boyden chamber and found results consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]; loss of p53 increased the invasion of the single carcinoma cell. To our surprise, however, loss of p53 in either EJ or HCT 116 cells suppressed cellular dissemination in 2-D confluent cell layers. In that case, loss of p53 was associated with reduced lamellipodia formation and weaker cell-substrate interactions. To better mimic tumor biology we also conducted studies using 3D multicellular spheroids embedded in collagen matrix. We found these results in the 3D multicellular spheroidal assay to be consistent with the 2-D confluent assay. These results, taken together, demonstrate paradoxical contributions of p53 in single cell versus collective cell migration.</p>

<title>In 2D confluent cell layers, p53 increases collective cellular motility</title>
<p>To determine the function of p53 in collective cell motility, we used both gain and loss of p53 function in colorectal and bladder carcinoma cell lines: stable wild type (p53<sup>&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup>) and stable p53 null (p53<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>) HCT 116 and Tet-off inducible EJ cell line (Methods). In EJ cell line, p53 knocking out (EJ p53 off) was established by the addition of doxycycline to the culture media. We began by replicating assays of single cell invasion in the Matrigel-coated Boyden chamber as reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], and found consistent results; loss of p53 increased cell invasion (125&#x00B1;53 versus 415&#x00B1;101 cells per well for EJ, p &#x003D; 0.009 249&#x00B1;65 versus 891&#x00B1;239 for HCT 116, p &#x003D; 0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>We then went on to assays of cell migration in the 2-D confluent cell layer. The confluent cell layer was cultured on 1.2 kPa polyacrylamide gel, and red fluorescent beads embedded in the gel surface. We used Leica DMI8 with living cell culture system to require phase images of the cell layer and fluorescent images of the read beads at 10 minutes interval for 24 h. Based on the phase images we calculated cell velocity and displacement in the confluent layer by using optical flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Using Traction Force Microscopy, we measured the traction forces exerted by the confluent layer on the gel (Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To our surprise, mean cell speeds for the p53 null version (EJ p53 off and HCT116 p53<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>) were significantly smaller compared to their p53 expressing counterparts (0.12&#x00B1;0.003 versus 0.16&#x00B1;0.01&#x03BC;m min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, p&#x003D;0.002 for EJ; 0.11&#x00B1;0.02 versus 0.18&#x00B1;0.02 m min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, p&#x003D;0.0003 for HCT 116; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref>). When cell motions were expressed as an effective diffusion coefficient, the diffusivities of p53 null cells were consistently smaller than those of p53 expressing controls (0.36&#x00B1;0.07 versus 0.77&#x00B1;0.23, &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup> min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, p&#x003D;0.003 for EJ; 0.20&#x00B1;0.05 versus 0.43&#x00B1;0.06 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup> min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, p&#x003D;0.0003 for HCT 116 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1E</xref>, Movies S1 and S2).</p>

As such, p53 null cells were less diffusive than p53 expressing counterparts. D was calculated by linear fitting the mean squared displacements MSD&#x003D; 4D&#x002A;T&#x002B;b after 70 min, as shown in the representative MSD in the insets.

<title>P53 null cells show weaker cell-substrate interactions</title>
<p>Cell-substrate interaction plays a critical role in collective cellular migration. To our knowledge, the effects of p53 on cell-substrate interactions have not yet been reported. Over 24h we continuously measured the traction forces. As shown in the representative traction maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>) the p53 null cells had fewer hot spots than did p53 expressing cells. Root mean square traction (RMST) from p53 null cells was smaller than in p53 expressing counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>). Mean RMST was 23.3&#x00B1;0.3 versus 35.9&#x00B1;4.1 Pa, p&#x003D;0.01 for EJ; 8.2&#x00B1;0.3 versus 10.2&#x00B1;0.3 Pa, p&#x003D;0.1 for HCT 116. Thus expressing p53 caused cells to exert larger traction forces upon their substrates.</p>

<title>P53 null cells exhibit more organized cortical actin rings together with reduced front-rear cell polarity</title>
<p>In the bladder carcinoma EJ p53 on and EJ p53 off, and in the colorectal carcinoma HCT116 p53<sup>&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> and HCT116 p53<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>, western blots confirmed expected p53 expression or lack thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Fluorescent staining with phalloidin showed that the apical cortical F-actin rings found in both of the p53 null carcinomas (EJ p53 off and HCT116 p53<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>) were more round and intact than their p53 expressing counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, expression of E-cadherin varied in EJ and HCT 116. In western blotting and fluorescent staining assays, E-cadherin was not detectably expressed in both EJ p53 on and EJ p53 off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>, fluorescent staining not shown). Alternatively, E-cadherin was expressed and localized to the cell-cell junctions in both HCT116 p53<sup>&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> and HCT116 p53<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>, with the latter showing &#x007E;2.5-fold greater levels of E-cadherin than the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). While a consistent relationship existed between loss of p53, reduced motility and increased cortical actin in these two different carcinomas, no such correlations was found regarding their E-cadherin expression.</p>

<title>P53 null cells show reduced formation of cryptic lamellipodia</title>
<p>Fluorescent images of F-actin were obtained using an inverted confocal microscope (Leica SP8, Method). Near the basal plane of both EJ and HCT 116 carcinomas, the F-actin images showed cryptic lamellipodia (the F-actin tips labeled by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). We found that loss of p53 was associated with reduced appearance of the cryptic lamellipodia, which are typically associated with collective cell migration. Moreover, normalized intensity measurements of fluorescent F-actin showed that near the basal plane expressing p53 increased F-actin intensity, 1.5&#x00B1;0.2 times for EJ cells, 1.8&#x00B1;0.4 times for HCT 116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>).</p>

Compared to their p53 expressing counterparts, p53 null carcinomas (EJ p53 off and HCT 116 p53<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>) exhibited less frequent escape of individual cells from the spheroids and less efficient dissemination (Movies. S3 and S4). These results from 3D multicellular spheroids are consistent with those from 2D confluent layer, which both suggest that p53 promotes carcinoma invasion and collective cellular migration.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using bladder and colorectal carcinoma cell lines, here we confirmed that p53 suppresses single cell invasion in the Boyden chamber assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Paradoxically, however, in both the 2D and 3D assays p53 increased collective cellular migration and invasion. Together, these results suggest that the function of p53 in cell motility depends on context, that is, single cell migration versus collective cellular migration.</p>
<p>Function of p53 depends on its target genes and proteins, which can exert paradoxical, context-dependent, effects on the same cellular process, including apoptosis, metabolism, differentiation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. For example, evidence for regulation of cell migration by p53 is conflicting. The preponderance of the evidence suggests that the tumor suppressor p53 attenuates cell motility and invasiveness through pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] such as suppressing the RhoA-Rock or Rac1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Limited evidence suggests, to the contrary, that p53 promotes in vitro and in vivo invasion of ovarian carcinoma cells isolated from PTEN; KRas mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], and also promotes migration and invasion of human lung, colorectal carcinoma and osteosarcoma cells by activating Rac1 or Rap2a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. These studies exemplify the paradoxical regulation by p53 in the cell migration from the perspective of different target signal pathways. As regards the contexts of single cell versus collective cellular migration, however, the function of p53 has remained unclear. Here we suggest paradoxical contributions of p53 in single cell versus collective cellular migration.</p>

<title>P53 promotes the dissemination and invasion of carcinoma cellular collectives</title>
<p>In the cellular collective, results from both bladder and colorectal carcinomas support the notion of the tumor suppressor p53 as a promoter of dissemination and invasion. To manipulate p53, two distinct methods were used in the two human carcinoma cell lines: p53 tet-off system of the bladder carcinoma EJ, and wild-type p53 cells and knock out p53 cells of colorectal carcinoma HCT 116 (Method). To quantify the cell dissemination in the 2-D confluent cell layer, we measured cell speed, mean squared displacement (MSD), and the diffusion coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). To our surprise, in both EJ and HCT 116 these metrics from the cells expressing p53 were all higher than those from the p53 null counterparts. As such, the tumor suppressor p53 was associated with faster collective cellular migration and easier escape of trapped cells from their neighbors (Movies S1 and S2). Both the bladder and colorectal carcinoma spheroids in collagen matrix, which better mimic tumor microenvironment, showed consistent results; the tumor suppressor p53 promotes the carcinoma spheroid to invade a larger area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). These results demonstrate that the tumor suppressor p53 promotes carcinoma cell escape from their neighbors and more efficient invasion into matrix.</p>

<title>P53 increases formation of cryptic lamellipodia and migratory traction forces</title>
<p>Our results show that p53 promotes the dissemination and invasion of the cellular collectives. Compared to p53 expressing counterparts, the p53 null carcinomas shared the features of having highly organized rings of cortical F-actin, and more rounded and less polarized cell shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results are consistent with the general consensus that loss of p53 promotes cellular rounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Moreover recent studies have established cell rounding (i.e., lower aspect ratio) as a key physical mechanism to make cell collectives less diffusive and more jammed by increasing the energy barrier for cells to escape from their neighbors (i.e., exchange neighbors in confluent layers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Cryptic lamellipodia represent a critical structure for collective cellular migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Near the basal planes of both the bladder and colorectal carcinoma cellular collectives, fluorescent images of F-actin showed that loss of p53 was associated with the reduced formation of the cryptic lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>), which is consistent with the lower motility of the p53 null cells. These results support the notion that p53 can activate the formation of cryptic lamellipodia to promote cell dissemination and invasion in the cellular collectives.</p>
<p>To our knowledge these studies are the first to quantify the mechanical effects of p53 on cell-substrate interaction. Measurements in both EJ and HCT 116 suggest that the loss of p53 consistently causes these carcinoma cells to exert smaller traction forces on their substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). It remains unclear, however, if reduction in traction forces might be attributable to reduced lamellipodia formation and less motility.</p>

<title>Discordant relationship between p53-dependant regulation of collective carcinoma migration and E-cadherin expression</title>
<p>Many studies suggest that p53 can prevent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increase E-cadherin expression to decrease cancer cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Nevertheless, at least one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] suggests that loss of p53 does not decrease the E-cadherin expression. Our current studies in the 2-D confluent cell layers also show a discordant relationship between p53 and E-cadherin expression. The bladder carcinomas do not express E-cadherin regardless of expressing p53 or not, which suggests that in this context the effects of p53 on the motility of collective carcinomas are not mechanistically related to E-cadherin expression. Nevertheless, in the bladder carcinoma collective it remains unclear whether the effects of p53 on cell migration are associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and whether p53 increases expression of other cadherins, such as P- and N-cadherin. For the colorectal carcinoma cells, loss of p53 increases E-cadherin expression, which might contribute to increased cell-cell interaction so as to cage cells by their neighbors, although theoretical models suggest, to the contrary, that increasing cell-cell adhesion decreases the energy barrier for cells to escape from their neighbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. These results suggest that regulation of E-cadherin expression by p53 is context-dependent, and may differ for different carcinoma types.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study points to paradoxical contributions of the tumor suppressor p53 in single cell versus collective cellular migration. P53 inhibits migration of the single cell studied in isolation, but both in 2D and 3D assays p53 promotes the dissemination and invasion of the confluent cellular collective. P53 was also associated with changes in the F-actin cytoskeleton, cell morphology, lamellipodia, traction forces as well as E-cadherin expression, all of which are thought to be linked with migration of the cellular collective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Mechanism by which p53 regulates the collective carcinoma cell migration remains unclear. P53 suppresses RhoA to inhibit the amoeboid migration of single cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. But in the context of collective cellular migration, it remains unclear if p53 suppresses RhoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], or activates Rac1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] to cause elongation, formation of cryptic lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], and stronger cell-substrate interactions, all of which might promote migration of the cellular collectives. In addition unanswered questions concern context-dependent regulation by p53 in senescence and apoptosis. P53 mutations show gain of function in promoting cancer cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], but how these p53 mutations function in cellular collectives remains unclear. Evidence presented here demonstrates that the tumor suppressor p53 paradoxically promotes carcinoma invasion and collective cell migration, and, in the case of cancer therapeutics, implies the possibility that p53 might act to promote collective carcinoma migration rather than suppress it.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Human bladder carcinoma EJ cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#x2019;s modified Eagle&#x2019;s medium (DMEM, Corning, 10-013-CV) containing 10&#x0025; Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologics), 100 &#x03BC;g/ml of Hygromycin (Sigma, H3274), and 200 &#x03BC;g/ml Geneticin G418 (Teknova, G5005). P53 knock-out EJ cells (EJ p53 off) and p53 expressing EJ cells (EJ p53 on) were established respectively by the presence and the absence of 1 &#x03BC;g/ml doxycycline (Sigma, D9891) in the culture media. Human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10&#x0025; FBS. Both EJ and HCT 116 cells were maintained at 5&#x0025; CO2 and 37&#x00B0;C. All the human cell lines and experimental protocols were approved by Harvard Institute Review Board and carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.

<caption><title>Illustration for the differences between the p53 null and p53 expressing collective cells.</title>
<p>Compared to p53 expressers, p53 null cells exhibit more organized cortical actin rings together with reduced front-rear cell polarity and less formation of cryptic lamellipodia. Moreover our study show that p53 increases the traction exerted by the collective cells on substrate, and promotes dissemination and invasion of the collective cells.</p></caption>
