<title>Motivation</title>
<p>Delivering high quality distance-based courses in resource limited settings is a challenging task. Besides the needed infrastructure and expertise, effective delivery of a bioinformatics course could benefit from hands-on sessions, interactivity, and problem-based learning approaches.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>In this article, we discuss the challenges and best practices in delivering bioinformatics training in limited resource settings taking the example of hosting and running a multiple-delivery online course, Introduction to Bioinformatics (IBT), that was developed by the H3ABioNet Education and Training Working Group and delivered in 27 remote classrooms across Africa in 2017. We take the case of the University of Khartoum classroom. Believing that our local setting is similar to others in less developed countries, so we also reflect upon aspects like classroom environment and recruitment of students to maximize outcomes.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rapid advancements in genomics and molecular biology research and applications necessitates adequate, up-to-date and complimentary training in biology and computer science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Attwood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Mulder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>].</p>
<p>Physical face-to-face bioinformatics training workshops are one way to address this need, by providing opportunities for networking and first hand discussions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brazas and Ouellette, 2013</xref>]. However, when run in settings of limited access to local bioinformatics expertise, funding and proper infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bishop <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>], this model becomes very expensive to run and modest in students&#x2019; intake. Of question is the relevancy and applicability of skills acquired from such a training to the bioinformatician&#x2019;s own environment in the long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>].</p>
<p>Learning methods connecting distant learners and educators have evolved with technology, from postal services to Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Moore and Kearsley, 2011</xref>]. For bioinformatics training, both edX and Coursera, 2 popular MOOC providers, offer complete specializations for both biologists (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.edx.org/micromasters/bioinformatics">https://www.edx.org/micromasters/bioinformatics</ext-link>) and computer scientists (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics">https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics</ext-link>). Yet, some MOOCs may be inaccessible for developing countries&#x2019; learners due to conditions like technological access, digital literacy, cultural relevance and social identity threats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Castillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kizilcec <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>], and other typical caveats associated with MOOCs - competing priorities of learners and information overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Hew and Cheung, 2014a</xref>].</p>
<p>H3ABioNet, the pan African Bioinformatics Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Mulder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>], is making strides towards bridging the bioinformatics training gap in Africa by designing and offering a 3-months multiple-delivery-mode training course, Introduction to Bioinformatics (IBT), across all its nodes including Sudan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>]. The IBT model blends local in-person tutoring sessions with online elements delivered via the course website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://training.h3abionet.org/IBT_2017/">https://training.h3abionet.org/IBT_2017/</ext-link>), the on-line learning management system, Vula (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cilt.uct.ac.za/cilt/vula">http://www.cilt.uct.ac.za/cilt/vula</ext-link>), and the open source videoconferencing system, Mconf (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mconf.sanren.ac.za/">https://mconf.sanren.ac.za/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>This study assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of the 2017 iteration of the IBT (IBT_2017) training model from the local learner&#x2019;s and Teaching Assistants&#x2019; (TAs) perspectives in the H3ABioNet Node of Sudan based at the University of Khartoum. We investigated factors contributing to training success, as inferred from responses to surveys disseminated to both local learners and TAs. Our results agree with empirical data suggesting that local group discussions improved students&#x2019; ability to access the course materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Yousef <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>], especially when facilitated by volunteering course alumni [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Murugesan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>]. Also, the African context ingrained into the course made the content relevant to the local learners, and hence the training aligned with their expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Castillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>]. Our setting resembles others in less developed countries, so we further reflect upon aspects like classroom environment and recruitment of learners to maximize outcomes.</p></sec>

<title>Relevant literature</title>
<p>The effectiveness of MOOCs in less developed countries is hindered by barriers of technology and context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Castillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>]. Efforts addressing these barriers include &#x002B;Acumen (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.plusacumen.org">https://www.plusacumen.org</ext-link>), which aims at empowering social change and provides MOOCs employing in-video transcripts, culturally-diverse case studies, and content that is viewable off-line and platform-agnostic. Consequently, &#x002B;Acumen attracts participants from a diverse pool of countries, including Afghanistan, Botswana and Sri Lanka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cheney, 2017</xref>]. Successful participation from those countries and other top Fragile States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">OECD, &#x003F;&#x003F;&#x003F;&#x003F;</xref>] was also reported in AuthorAID&#x2019;s offering on Scientific research writing, which utilized low-bandwidth friendly format via mainly text-based content, and voluntary course alumni as facilitators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Murugesan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kizilcec <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref> have demonstrated significant improvement in persistence and completion rates of less-developed countries&#x2019; learners in MOOCs by brief psychological interventions to lessen social identity threats, like value affirmations and social belonging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kizilcec <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>]. Furthermore, studies reporting on the application of the blended MOOC (bMOOC) paradigm, combining online MOOC components with in-class interactions, have systematically shown positive educational indicators; even when applied in resource limited settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ghadiri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Yousef <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Nkuyubwatsi, 2016</xref>].</p>
<p>Especially for bioinformatics, there are huge, urgent, unmet training needs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Attwood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>] exacerbated by the breadth of the discipline and its rapid evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Mulder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>], notwithstanding difficulty of curricula design to learners of diverse backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bishop <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>], and the shortage in experienced qualified trainers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Attwood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>]. Therefore, various international efforts were exerted to bridge this skills gap, like GOBLET, ELIXIR, BD2K TCC and H3ABioNet. These efforts focused on short face-to-face and online courses which is preferable by researchers in their later career stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Attwood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>].</p>
<p>However, For basic bioinformatics users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Welch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>], both Coursera and edX provide introductory level training. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> compare these offerings with H3ABioNet&#x2019;s bMOOC in different aspects. Their accessibility to learners in less developed countries is yet to be investigated.</p>

<title>The 2017 iteration of the IBT</title>
<p>In its 2017 iteration, the IBT course started on May 9th, with 2 days/week for in-person interactive sessions. Building on its first iteration of 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>], the IBT_2017 was composed of 6 modules: Introduction to databases and resources, Linux, Sequence alignment theory and application, Multiple sequence alignment, Genomics, Molecular evolution and phylogenetics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The design, learning objectives and contents of these modules are already described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>], so here we only comment on the local supporting set up of the classrooms.</p>
<p>In the H3ABioNet Node of Sudan, 73 students registered in the IBT_2017. The majority of these students (participants or learners herein) have been selected from a waiting list from the IBT 2016 iteration, based on their interest and basic understanding of the central dogma of molecular biology, and hence they came from diverse specializations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Figure SF3), at different educational levels (6&#x0025; were at the BSc level, 41&#x0025; current MSc students, 11&#x0025; current PhD students and 34&#x0025; were MSc and PhD graduates not pursuing any degree) and career affiliations (66&#x0025; in academic institutes, 4&#x0025; in governmental ministries, 7&#x0025; in Research centers, 3&#x0025; in private companies and hospitals, with 12&#x0025; unemployment rate) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (C and A respectively). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 B</xref> further shows that the highest educational institute for the majority of participants is the University of Khartoum (73&#x0025;, compared to 13&#x0025; from the other Sudanese universities, and 4&#x0025; who studied abroad).</p>

<p>To accommodate this large number, two classrooms were set up for physical interactions within University of Khartoum main campus: the CBSB laboratory, equipped with 20 PCs and network ports to accommodate an additional 12 PCs/laptops; and the Main Library computer lab that can accommodate up to 70 participants. Collectively, these two locations hosted the 73 registered participants, split to 33 and 40 respectively. These two locations vary in their infrastructure as well: the PCs in the CBSB lab are appropriate for bioinformatics training and research with larger screen sizes and more CPU and memory capacities, while those in the Main library needed more effort from the local IBT team and University of Khartoum Information Technology Network Administration (ITNA) staff to set them up.</p>
<p>This larger intake (compared with 22 participants in 2016) has been managed by a local staff, which besides the node Principle Investigator, was composed of 7 teaching assistants (TAs) who are among the alumni of the IBT_2016 iteration with previous excellent background in genetics &#x0026; molecular biology. Their prior IBT experience helped them provide actionable support to the new course participants, and their facilitation job was tremendously eased with the on-line staff training sessions provided by the IBT core team. Only a single system administrator was available for the duration of the IBT_2017, given the physical proximity of both classrooms.</p></sec>

<title>Measurement and evaluation</title>
<p>While we lack data on the performance details of our IBT_2017 course participants (individual assessments and tests&#x2019; results were managed by the IBT core team in South Africa, and only shared directly with each participant), we have alternative aggregate data from the following sources:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The waiting list from the previous IBT_2016, containing demographic data on our course participants.</p></list-item>

<title>Attendance &#x0026; Withdrawal patterns</title>
<p>Students attendance and retention is a major concern contributing to a successful MOOC experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Hew and Cheung, 2014b</xref>] especially that to many learners, the problem is about committing the needed study hours despite their busy schedules.</p>
<p>In this 3 months course, we noted that for our local 73 registered participants, the attendance rate was higher at the beginning of the course (&#x007E;85&#x0025;), then it dropped progressively towards mid-June and early July (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), concurrent with gradual increase in withdrawal. Poor response rate from withdrawn students to the exit survey (Supplementary SM6) limits our ability to conclusively reason about it, except to note that it can be related to 2 factors: 1) Co-occurring with the Linux module, which requires a mode of thinking a bit alien to wet lab biologists. 2) Culturally, the IBT_2017 started just a few weeks before the holy month of Ramadan, coinciding with end-of-year/semester holidays in many universities and colleges. Taken in light of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, during the few starting weeks it was easy to follow up with the progress of material and activities for students (53&#x0025; of the total IBT_2017 participants)- both full-time (44&#x0025;) and part time (9&#x0025;), and other academic staff (22&#x0025; of the total IBT_2017 participants). However, once these holidays were over, participants (collectively, 75&#x0025; of the total) needed to be back to full-time working hours and classes in their respective institutes, making it harder for them to attend IBT_2017 sessions in person and timely work towards their assessments and tests. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the withdrawal pattern plateaued after this point in time, totaling 5 and 14 participants from the CBSB and Main Library classrooms respectively, summing to 19 participants (26&#x0025; of the total).</p>
<p>Remarkably, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows that the majority of the IBT_2017 participants (73&#x0025;) have graduated from University of Khartoum, as do the local course staff. This could justify why &#x007E;63.6&#x0025; of the participants heard of the course through friends, 27.3&#x0025; from their supervisors or mentors, and the remaining 14.5&#x0025; through social media (Supplementary SF1). It also suggests that local circles of friends/ acquaintances were already in place before the course had actually started. This support system in place could explain why for those participants who didn&#x2019;t withdraw (54), only 3 participants (6&#x0025;) failed the course requirements.</p>
<p>We investigate predictive models of learner&#x2019;s performance (Success, Failure or Withdrawal) based on the demographics of the classrooms in the Discussion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, Supplementary SF4, SF5, Mathematical models), noting poor response rate to the exit survey (Supplementary SM6) of only 1 response. We also note limitations impinged from unmoderated personal circumstances; like traveling, health problems and unwaivable work/study duties.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<label>4.2</label>
<title>Participants&#x2019; perceptions &#x0026; expectations</title>
<p>Here, data were collected from 3 surveys (Supplementary SM1, SM2, SM3) disseminated at the start of the course, the mid-point and the end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Out of the 73 participants, only 33 (45&#x0025;) filled all the 3 surveys, while 15 (21&#x0025;) never filled any (Supplementary SF2).</p>
<p>The experience of the IBT_2017 is both unique and new to our participants considering its blended multi-delivery learning model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>], and extended 3-months duration. Our surveys aimed to check the alignment between participants&#x2019; expectations and course scope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Via <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>]. On a labeled five-point Likert scale, we asked participants about their perspectives in terms of their prior experience level in each module (start survey); the extent to which the content was appropriate, and the level it met their expectations (in mid-course and end surveys, for each module taught until that point).</p>
<p>Participants&#x2019; perceptions on each of the six modules largely followed the same trend (Supplementary SF6 - SF11), hence their average across all modules is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Not surprisingly, most participants were initially largely unfamiliar with the various modules (with the 75th percentile of responses below neutral familiarity level), especially Linux (Supplementary SM8). Progressively however, we see higher satisfaction levels (with the median of the averaged responses at a level above Comfortable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in terms of appropriateness of the taught material and meeting participants expectations.</p>

<p>Another aspect, is the extent to which our participants made use of the local and remote classroom elements to ameliorate their learning experience.

The responses depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, show a positive trend as the course advanced, suggesting more familiarity with the blended MOOC model. Yet, we remark a modest and steady amount of networking with other IBT classrooms throughout the course (In total, 38 participants filled both the mid-course and end surveys, with 2 and 5 unique responses for each survey respectively (Supplementary SF2)).</p>

<title>Classroom demographics &#x0026; performance</title>
<p>Consistent with the largely female students&#x2019; body in faculties related to natural sciences, health, and agriculture in Sudan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Huyer, 2015</xref>], the majority of the IBT_2017 participants in both classes of the H3ABioNet node of Sudan were females (80&#x0025;); and they were also more likely to satisfy the course requirements in comparison with their male peers (Supplementary SF3). Utility of gender as a performance predictor can also be seen from Recursive Partitioning (rpart) tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Therneau and Atkinson, 2018</xref>] of (Supplementary SF4, Listing1) built by selecting splitting covariates to minimize the Gini coefficient as an information measure.</p>
<p>However, when changing the partitioning algorithm to a conditional inference tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hothorn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>], the location of the local IBT_2017 classroom (the CBSB lab or Main Library), is the most important covariate in predicting performance (Supplementary SF5). This is expected considering the inherent infrastructure differences between the 2 locations. The CBSB lab is designed to facilitate bioinformatics training and research in terms of stable internet connection and more powerful computers; whereas the Main Library classroom had Internet connectivity issues at the beginning of the course, which was frustrating to some of the participants (and in occasions encouraged some to withdraw early on).</p>
<p>Modeling differences of these algorithms (Supplementary SF4, SF5), are alterable to the high degree of class imbalance in the entire dataset (70&#x0025; Success, 26&#x0025; Withdrawal and 4&#x0025; Failure), even when seen in each classroom independently (85&#x0025;, 15&#x0025; and 0&#x0025; for CBSB class, and 58&#x0025;, 35&#x0025; and 8&#x0025; for the Main Library respectively). We therefore built a multinomial classification model to further examine all demographic factors collectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, ST2 and Listing2). While a potential problem with this model is the assumptions of independence and constant performance, we see that both the physical location of the classroom and Gender are the only statistically significant demographic factors, with a note that MSc and PhD participants had higher odds of success than BSc level candidates; as did unemployed participants and those working in research centers or the private sector. Whether a participant is currently a student or has graduated from the said level had slight effect on their odds of success (see SF3).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> underscores that about half the entire local IBT_2017 classes (53&#x0025;) are students, 15&#x0025; of whom are part-timers with affiliations in either governmental ministries or research laboratories. We reckon the better odds of success for students to their interest in a specific problem at hand. We see no statistical evidence of interaction between part/full time status and studentship, hence it is not shown in the ST1 model. However, the ability of part-timers to satisfy the course requirements and acquire higher odds of success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, supplementary SF3, SM8), suggest the appreciation of these institutes to staff training; and possibly hints at avenues for local sustainable research collaborations.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="431361_fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Yet, there is the 12&#x0025; unemployment ratio among our participants. While we didn&#x2019;t explicitly investigate the employability of typical biological sciences graduates in Sudan, by large, those participants indicated their pursuit of graduate education was motivated by hopes in better career opportunities. It is inconclusive that graduating the IBT_2017 enhanced participants&#x2019; employability, but the feedback collected 9 months upon the course end (filled by 30/51 of the successful participants) indicate that many of the then-students participants have completed their degrees and were offered jobs based on their new skills (Supplementary SF12, SF13). The same pattern was observed with the IBT_2016 MSc and PhD alumni who received teaching positions offers in local newly established faculties to teach bioinformatics-related courses or computational laboratories (personal communications).</p>

<title>Participants&#x2019; perceptions &#x0026; expectations</title>
<p>By design, the IBT course is taught over 3 months, to train basic bionformatics users. Besides providing relevant and high standard content, the IBT core team and various instructors have placed great emphasis on defining clear learning objectives and outcomes prior to each taught module, and maintained the logical structure of the course despite removing the structural proteomics module from the IBT_2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>].</p>
<p>Therefore course participants had clear expectations out of each module, manifested as largely positive indicators in their responses to our surveys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and Supplementary SF6-SF11), and high success rate (excluding early withdrawals, 94&#x0025; of the participants satisfied the course requirements, see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5a">section 5.1</xref>). Considering that the majority of the participants were current graduate students (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Supplementary SF3) in a domain related to genetics or molecular biology (Supplementary SM8), they were exposed to concepts and uses of Databases; but less familiar with Linux, Genomics and related topics, because there is none or limited postgraduate degrees in bioinformatics currently in Sudan.</p>
<p>Regarding utilizing local and remote classroom resources, we make few observations. While we see that our participants were comfortable networking with each other, we see less interactions with participants from other classrooms. Partially, this is attributable to the demographics of the classrooms (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5a">section 5.1</xref>). While a few minutes were spared at the beginning of each session for the scattered classrooms to introduce themselves via Mconf, this was ineffective in linking our participants with other classrooms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) because often times the connection would be too noisy for a meaningful conversation. The same issue often arose during the discussion time at the end of each session when the instructors are typically available and answering questions live. Alternatively, our participants tended to discuss issues through the forum or the chat rooms available through Vula. There is more engagement in these avenues towards the end of the course from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p>
<p>Another element explaining the high success rate of the 2 classrooms is the local help provided to the participants through the local TAs who were alumni of the 2016 iteration. From one perspective, testimonials from successful alumni have been shown to improve the sense of belonging in MOOCs, and there by learners&#x2019; performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kizilcec <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>]. This is especially true as the IBT_2017 included training sessions for the local team in each classroom on how to best facilitate the course. These training sessions employed the Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII) model [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Kizilcec and Cohen, 2017</xref>] in equipping the local staff with best strategies for course facilitation by asking them to set goals for the course, and then predict future challenges and devise contingency plans. While not all identified challenges were within direct control (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5c">section 5.3</xref>), the exercise gave a sense of confidence to the local staff. Additionally, the majority of our volunteering staff already had prior teaching experience (7/8 TAs, in addition to the class PI). The responses from those TAs indicate that they benefited from their previous experience, so they were comfortable facilitating demographically diverse classes (Supplementary SF14). On the personal level, the TAs were highly satisfied with the experience, even though they had other pressing commitments playing at the same time as the IBT_2017 (Supplementary SF15).</p>
<p>A final element in examining the IBT_2017 is its non-cognitive factors. These include the expected load incurred by participating in the IBT, which many found to be overwhelming when compared with commercial 1 week bioinformatics courses with no exams or assignments. This perception has exacerbated especially with the Linux module as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Another factor may be the course language. Sudan is officially an Arabic speaking country, though university educated graduates have some competency in English. However, one teaching style commonly employed, especially at the undergraduate level, is to deliver teaching curricula in Arabic, while maintaining English keywords and having English-based handouts (Supplementary SF16). This means that for many of the participants, complete course delivery in English is challenging. Collectively, these factors could explain the large withdrawal from the course before the mid-point (26&#x0025; of the total participants, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A possible workaround might be for the course participants to take a preliminary Scientific English course, either in a professional center in Sudan, or via MOOCs, like the positively reviewed Couresera offering of <italic>&#x201C;English for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics&#x201D;</italic> available on (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/stem">https://www.coursera.org/learn/stem</ext-link>)</p>

<title>Reflections on local logistics</title>
<p>The IBT_2017 used a blended MOOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ghadiri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>], or multi-delivery model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>], for learners to access, discuss and submit their assessments and tests. The online resources used: Mconf for example, were open source and were not network intensive; which made them appropriate to the local set up. Also, the geographical distribution of modules&#x2019; instructors across Africa provided a familiar context for participants to relate to. These aspects, technological infrastructure and relevant context, are effective in making a MOOC accessible to participants, and hence improving performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Castillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>]. We didn&#x2019;t compare with similar students&#x2019; performance on the offerings from edX and Coursera (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>), but it is interesting to pursue in the future.</p>
<p>By large, one can see that the design and running of the IBT_2017 followed the <italic>Ten simple rules for developing a short bioinformatics training course</italic> of <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Via <italic>et al.</italic> [2011]</xref>. Particularly, we comment on the application of the following rules (as they pertain to the local classrooms in the University of Khartoum):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Setting Practical and Realistic Expectations&#x002D; achieved by specifying target audience (Rule1, <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Via <italic>et al.</italic> [2011]</xref>)</bold>: The target audience for the IBT are participants with molecular biology background. Those were the participants able to satisfy the course requirements, while graduates from certain faculties (like Computer Science) withdrew early on. Otherwise, in our case, it did help in yielding a high success rate that we had a long waiting list in place.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Class diversity:</bold> in terms of academic backgrounds, graduating universities and career stage (1; Supplementary SF3). Additionally, proper advertising, and conscious selection of participants (in lights of the drop out factors we highlighted) should help in a better educational outcome.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Ensuring Computational Equipment Preparedness and Support Availability (Rule3, <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Via <italic>et al.</italic> [2011]</xref>)</bold>: Before and throughout the IBT, the local IBT_2017 team would meet weekly and update on resources needed and tasks assigned. A myriad of platforms were used for this: Trello boards for planning and follow up (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://trello.com/">https://trello.com/</ext-link>), a Google mailing list for emails, and Authorea (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.authorea.com">https://www.authorea.com</ext-link>) for collaboratively working on this manuscript. For some of the members, a chatting app like Whatsapp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">https://www.whatsapp.com/</ext-link>) was needed, but overall, experiencing other platforms was deeply appreciated and highly regarded.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Allowing Interactivity and Providing Time for Reflection, Individual Analysis, and Exploration (Rule 9, <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Via <italic>et al.</italic> [2011]</xref>)</bold>: This was achieved via the in-person sessions, with some of the IBT_2016 alumni as teaching assistants. Those sessions assured accessible local support to the IBT_2017 participants and thereby reduced their anxiety-which is otherwise a major MOOC withdrawal reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Hew and Cheung, 2014a</xref>]. Also, for learners from less developed countries, success stories from previous course alumni have been shown to improve performance [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Kizilcec and Cohen, 2017</xref>]</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Career progress and capacity building</bold>: The IBT aims to equip African researchers with the skills and knowledge to launch their careers and establish their science. The 30 responses from the follow up survey sent 9-months upon the end of the IBT_2017 show that many participants have moved from being students (53.3&#x0025; at the time of the IBT) to being junior or middle staff (collectively 56.3&#x0025;)(Supplementary SF12). For some of them, the IBT helped in securing new job offerings (Supplementary SF13).</p></list-item></list></p>

<title>Sessions and Modules learning outcomes</title>
<p>At the first session of each IBT module, trainers identified and emphasized on the learning outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>]. This gave participants clear expectations, so they were able to evaluate their progress which is a good course success indicator. This was also reflected by the percentage of participants who were able to meet the course requirements.</p></sec>

<title>Trainers interactive sessions with course participants</title>
<p>Trainers were available for live discussions with participants and could activate their cameras for more personal experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="s6a3">
<title>Hands-on sessions &#x0026; Teaching assistants</title>
<p>During this free 3-months course, a large amount of time was dedicated to hands-on sessions, where participants practice what they are learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>] with the help of local TAs. This is of great importance, as often trainees fail to appreciate the applicability of theoretical material to real data.</p></sec>
<sec id="s6a4">
<title>Video Conferencing System</title>
<p>The IBT classrooms connected trainers to all African classrooms via Mconf, an open-source video conferencing platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mconf.sanren.ac.za/">https://mconf.sanren.ac.za/</ext-link>), and classrooms either activated their microphones or entered text into a chat box to ask questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gurwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>]. Considering it was a free resource, Mconf features were mostly satisfactory (real-time chat, screen sharing, file sharing and classroom mode). Issues with sound clarity and disconnection is motivating the IBT core team to consider alternative platforms in future IBT iterations (personal communication).</p></sec>
