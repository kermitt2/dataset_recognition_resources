<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Serial and parallel processing in visual search have been long debated in psychology but the processing mechanism remains an open issue. Serial processing allows only one object at a time to be processed, whereas parallel processing assumes that various objects are processed simultaneously. Here we present novel neural models for the two types of processing mechanisms based on analysis of simultaneously recorded spike trains using electrophysiological data from prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys while processing task-relevant visual displays. We combine mathematical models describing neuronal attention and point process models for spike trains. The same model can explain both serial and parallel processing by adopting different parameter regimes. We present statistical methods to distinguish between serial and parallel processing based on both maximum likelihood estimates and decoding the momentary focus of attention when two stimuli are presented simultaneously. Results show that both processing mechanisms are in play for the simultaneously recorded neurons, but neurons tend to follow parallel processing in the beginning after the onset of the stimulus pair, whereas they tend to serial processing later on. This could be explained by parallel processing being related to sensory bottom-up signals or feedforward processing, which typically occur in the beginning after stimulus onset, whereas top-down signals related to cognitive modulatory influences guiding attentional effects in recurrent feedback connections occur after a small delay, and is related to serial processing, where all processing capacities are being directed towards the attended object.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>A fundamental question concerning processing of visual objects in our brain is how a population of cortical cells respond when presented with more than a single object in their receptive fields. Is one object processed at a time (serial processing), or are all objects processed simultaneously (parallel processing)? Inferring the dynamics of attentional states in simultaneously recorded spike trains from sensory neurons while being exposed to a pair of visual stimuli is key to advance our understanding of visual cognition. We propose novel statistical models and measures to quantify and follow the time evolution of the visual cognition processes right after stimulus onset. We find that in the beginning processing appears to be predominantly parallel, which develops into serial processing 150 &#x2013; 200 <italic>ms</italic> after stimulus onset in prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A fundamental question in theories of visual search is whether the process is serial or parallel for given types of stimulus material (for comprehensive reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]). In serial search, only one stimulus is attended at a time, whereas in parallel search, several stimuli are attended at the same time. The question of serial versus parallel search has been extensively investigated by behavioral methods in cognitive psychology, but it is still highly controversial. In this article, we briefly review extant empirical methods and their results and then present and exemplify a new method for distinguishing between serial and parallel visual search. The method is based on analysis of spike trains measured in prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys while being exposed to a pair of stimuli, which the animal should detect and later respond to with a saccade towards a target object, first presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. A spike train is a sequence of recorded times at which a neuron fires an action potential, and it is believed that spike times are the primary way to transmit information in the nervous system. Point process modelling is a natural mathematical framework for addressing such phenomena, and we embed this into models of visual attention, which provides means to quantify parallel versus serial visual processing.</p>

<title>Behavioral methods for distinguishing between serial and parallel visual search</title>
<p>In typical experiments on visual search, the task of the observer is to indicate as quickly as possible if a certain type of target is present in a display. Positive (target present) and negative (target absent) mean response times are analyzed as functions of the display set size <italic>N</italic> (the number of items in the display). The method of analysis was laid out by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] and further developed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The foundation is as follows.</p>
<p>In a simple serial model, the <italic>N</italic> items are scanned one at a time. When an item is scanned, it is classified as a target or a distractor. The order in which items are scanned is independent of their status as targets versus distractors. A negative response is made when all items have been scanned and classified as distractors. Thus, the number of items processed before a negative response is made equals <italic>N</italic>. Furthermore, the rate of increase in mean negative response time as a function of <italic>N</italic> equals the mean time taken to process one item, &#x0394;<italic>t</italic>. A positive response is made as soon as a target is found. Because the order in which items are scanned is independent of their status as targets or distractors, the number of items processed before a positive response is made varies at random between 1 and <italic>N</italic> with a mean of (1 &#x002B; <italic>N</italic>)/2. Thus, the rate of increase in mean positive response time as a function of <italic>N</italic> equals &#x0394;<italic>t</italic>/2 (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] for experimental evidence of serial processing in a behavioral task).</p>
<p>In a parallel model of attention, several stimuli can be attended at the same time. The first detailed parallel model of visual processing of multi-element displays was the independent channels model proposed by Eriksen and his colleagues (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]). It was based on the assumption that display items presented to separated foveal areas are processed in parallel and independently up to and including the stage of pattern recognition. The independent channels model has been used to account for effects of <italic>N</italic> on error rates. The linear relations between mean response time and <italic>N</italic> predicted by simple serial models are difficult to explain by parallel models with independent channels. However, the linear relations can be explained by parallel models with limited processing capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>A multi-feature whole-report paradigm for investigating serial versus parallel processing was introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]: Suppose two features must be processed from each of two stimuli (i.e., a total of four features). Let processing be interrupted before all of the four features have completed processing. If, and only if, processing is parallel, there will be cases in which just one feature from each of the two stimuli completes processing before the interruption. This event, in which the observer has only partially encoded each of the two stimuli, should never happen when processing is serial. Thus, states with partial information from more than one stimulus are strong indicators of parallel processing. In the experiment of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] for replications and extensions), observers were presented with brief exposures of pairs of colored letters and asked to report both the color and the identity of each letter. The results showed strong evidence of states of partial information from each of the two stimuli (e.g., information of just the identity of one of the letters and just the color of the other one), and the results were fitted strikingly well by a simple parallel-processing model assuming mutually independent processing of the four features.</p>

<title>Method based on neurobiological data</title>
<p>As exemplified above, previous methods for distinguishing between serial and parallel visual search have been based on behavioral data, and the evidence obtained by these methods has been somewhat indirect. Moreover, these methods are all based on the assumption that processing is either serial or parallel, and that it stays the same throughout the trial. In this article, we present a new method for distinguishing between serial and parallel visual search, a method based on analysis of electrophysiological data. Furthermore, we propose measures to quantify the processing mechanism in a continuum between serial and parallel processing. The method relies on the probability-mixing model for single neuron processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], derived from the Neural Theory of Visual Attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], which states that when presented with a plurality of stimuli a neuron only responds to one stimulus at any given time. By probabilistic modeling and statistical inference using multiple simultaneously recorded spike trains, we infer and decode what the recorded neurons are responding to, providing a way to distinguish between parallel processing and serial processing on a neuronal level. The new method appears more direct than previous methods, and it is possible to analyze the time evolution of the processing mechanism over the course of a trial.</p>
<p>Consider an experiment in which we record the action potentials or spikes from each of a number of neurons of the same type, e.g., a set of functionally similar neurons in visual cortex with overlapping receptive fields (see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]), or neurons in prefrontal cortex that are believed to be dynamically allocated to process task-relevant information (see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]), which are the neurons we analyze in this paper. Suppose two stimuli (Stimulus 1 and 2) are both within the classical receptive fields of all of the recorded neurons, but otherwise the receptive fields are empty. In this situation, we may test whether processing is parallel in the sense that on any given trial, some of the recorded neurons represent Stimulus 1 throughout the trial, while others represent Stimulus 2 throughout the trial. We may assume that a neuron represents Stimulus 1 rather than Stimulus 2 if the likelihood of the observed spike trains becomes higher by assuming that the neuron represents Stimulus 1. We may also test whether processing is strictly serial (i.e., one stimulus at a time) by testing, for example, whether there is a time interval &#x0394;<sub>1</sub> in which all of the neurons represent Stimulus 1 and a time interval &#x0394;<sub>2</sub>, nonoverlapping with &#x0394;<sub>1</sub>, in which all of the neurons represent Stimulus 2.</p>
<p>Strictly parallel or strictly serial processing of two or more stimuli may hardly be expected in a biological system, and must be regarded as idealizations. However, we will show how to measure the goodness of approximation of search processes in the brain to simple serial and parallel search, as well as the time evolution of the processing mechanism.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we first present the statistical methods and probabilistic models that we employ to distinguish between parallel and serial processing, and then show and discuss the results obtained using both simulated data and experimental data.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">section 2</xref>, we introduce the experimental data that we rely on to measure the degree of parallel and serial processing in a realistic biological situation, and explain our proposed statistical criteria and measures to distinguish between parallel and serial processing. We propose two models, the hidden Markov model (HMM) and the correlated binomial model (CBM), to account for the spike train data in an attention framework, and calculate their likelihood functions. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) provide a prior measurement of parallel versus serial processing. We then describe methods to decode the momentary focus of attention given the fitted models, which provides a posterior measurement. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">section 3</xref> we present the results of the analysis conducted on the experimental data.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We present two models that relate the theories of visual attention to neuronal behavior, providing a tool to distinguish or quantify between parallel and serial processing through spike train analysis. Under the assumption of serial processing, the neurons are correlated, acting together as a population. This dependence can arise through two different pathways: 1) There exists an underlying variable driving the neurons towards attending to the same stimulus, creating a dependence, even if the neurons are conditionally independent given the state of this underlying variable. 2) The neurons are directly positively correlated, driving them to synchronize their attention.</p>
<p>The first pathway is naturally described by a HMM, where the hidden Markov chain switches between different states influencing the neuronal attention. If time is discretized and there are two stimuli, this leads to a mixture of binomials at each discretized time step, where the number of components in the mixture distribution equals the number of states of the Markov chain. The binomial distributions provide probabilities of the number of neurons attending to each stimulus, in dependence of the hidden state of the Markov chain. The second pathway can be represented by a CBM, a mixture of an ordinary binomial and a modified Bernoulli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], which is used independently at each discretized time step. For both models, the attended stimulus for each neuron is unobserved, and the inference is based on spike train data. We estimate parameters using MLE by marginalizing out the unobserved attention variables. The estimated parameters in either model describe neuronal properties and are used to obtain a <italic>prior</italic> measurement of the degree of parallel or serial processing. For both models, we also decode the hidden states from the posterior probabilities of the latent attention variables, i.e., an estimate of the stimulus the neurons were most probably attending to given their observed spike trains. The decoding of attentional behavior provides a <italic>posterior</italic> measurement of the degree of parallel or serial processing. The diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref> summarizes the flow of the analysis including parameter estimation, decoding and interpretation.</p>

<title>Experimental Data</title>
<p>To distinguish between parallel and serial processing, we use the neural spike train data recorded from neurons in prefrontal cortex of two rhesus monkeys presented with two visual stimuli from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. They studied dynamic attentional construction, and found that in the early stage after stimulus onset when processing competing stimuli, the global attention is distributed among all objects with each neuron having a tendency towards its contralateral hemifield. In the late stage, the global attention is reallocated and neurons are redirected to the target stimulus. The data contain multiple simultaneously recorded neurons responding to two competing stimuli. The data are organized in daily sessions, and each session consists of a different set of recorded neurons. We only analyze the sessions where at least five neurons are recorded to have enough data to distinguish between parallel and serial processing, yielding a total of 48 sessions. The monkey fixed attention on a central red dot on a computer screen, then each trial began with a central cue indicating the target object of the specific trial. Each of two cues was paired with one of the two alternative targets. After a brief delay, a choice display was presented for 500ms containing two objects, one to the right and one to the left of the fixation point. The objects could be either the cued target (T), an inconsistent non-target (NI) because it was used as a target on other trials, a consistent non-target (NC) never serving as a target, or nothing but a gray dot (NO). After a brief delay, the monkey was rewarded with a drop of liquid for a saccade to the T location if a T had been shown, or if no T had been presented, for maintaing fixation (no-go response) for later reward. In the following we call a combination of two stimuli a <italic>condition</italic>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> shows the 12 possible conditions. The stimulus locations were denoted by whether they were contra-or ipsilateral with respect to the recorded neuron. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1 Fig a</xref> shows an example of the structure of the data in one session. To get an overall idea of the sample sizes, histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1 Fig b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">c</xref> show the average number of trials per condition over the 48 sessions, and the average number of simultaneously recorded neurons per trial over sessions, respectively.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Conditions can be merged into three groups, indicated by table cells: target in the contralateral side, target in the ipsilateral side, and all combinations with no target. Contra- and ipsilateral sides are with respect to the recorded neuron. T: Target; NI: Inconsistent non-target; NC: Consistent non-target; NO: No display.</p>
<p>We analyze the choice phase where the two stimuli are shown. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref> are shown the recorded spike trains of an example cell during this phase and 100 <italic>ms</italic> before and after. The red curves are kernel smoothing estimates of firing rates over time, plotted on top of the spike trains. The 12 subplots show the 12 conditions with the titles indicating stimulus on the contra- (left) and ipsilateral (right) sides with respect to the recorded neuron. The neuron seems to favor the target T with a higher firing rate, and its attention starts from the contralateral stimulus and is later redirected to the target stimulus, following the overall tendency of most neurons reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2 Fig</xref> we show a complementary example neuron, which shows a tendency to the ipsilateral stimulus in the early stage, and later the attention is redirected to the target stimulus.</p>

<p>Furthermore, for this neuron there is more variability between trials under the same condition.</p>
<p>These figures present repeated trials of a single neuron. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3 Fig</xref>, we show simultaneously recorded neurons in two conditions of an example session. The comparison of serial and parallel processing catches the difference among simultaneously recorded neurons within one trial in terms of their attended stimulus, which is hard or impossible to analyze by traditional methods by averaging across neurons and trials. We thus develop a new methodology modeling each single spike train and the correlation between spike trains. The serial and parallel processing can be distinguished using the estimated parameters. To account for neuronal response times, we discard the first 100 <italic>ms</italic> after stimulus onset, using the interval from 100 to 500 <italic>ms</italic> in the choice phase when estimating the parameters of the two models.</p>

<title>Measures for parallel versus serial processing</title>
<p>Here we define different measures of the degree of serial and parallel processing based on the estimated parameters of the models when a population of <italic>n</italic> neurons are presented with two non-overlapping stimuli in their receptive fields. These measures will vary with time, i.e., depend on the time since stimulus onset, but for ease of notation, we suppress time from the notation here. Later we will introduce the time dependency. We assume a homogeneous situation where all neurons follow the same distribution and are exchangeable, except for individual firing rates as responses to single stimuli. These measures are based on the basic probability-mixing model for the attention of single neurons employed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], where a neuron responds to a stimulus mixture with certain probabilities, such that the single neuron at any given time represents only one of the stimuli in the mixture. First, we consider the marginal distribution of the attended stimulus for each neuron. Let <italic>p</italic> denote the marginal probability of attending to one of the stimuli, say stimulus 1, such that the probability of attending stimulus 2 is 1 &#x2212; <italic>p</italic>, where 0 &#x003C; <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 1. If the neurons are independent, then the probability that all neurons attend the same stimulus is <italic>p<sup>n</sup></italic> &#x002B; (1 &#x2212; <italic>p</italic>)<sup><italic>n</italic></sup>, and if the neurons are positively correlated, this is a lower bound of the probability that all neurons attend the same stimulus. Thus, <italic>p</italic> provides a measure of the tendency of serial or parallel processing. A narrow distribution (extreme probability, <italic>p</italic> either close to 0 or 1) favors serial processing, since in this case most neurons will attend the same stimulus. A wide distribution (non-extreme probability, p close to 0.5) favors parallel processing, since in this case neuronal attention will tend to split between the two stimuli. Second, we consider correlations between neurons. Since the neurons are exchangeable, the correlation coefficient, denoted by <italic>&#x03C1;</italic>, between any two neurons (pairwise correlation) is identical. Stronger positive correlation implies more tendency to serial processing, no matter what <italic>p</italic> is. Thus, if either the correlation is strong (<italic>&#x03C1;</italic> close to 1) or <italic>p</italic> is close to 0 or 1, serial processing is favored, while if both the correlation is weak and the probability is not extreme, parallel processing is favored. We summarize the different cases in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 2.</label>
<caption><p>Effects of neural attentional probability and correlation to serial and parallel processing.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="383596_tbl2.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Extreme probability implies a probability close to 0 or 1, and strong correlation implies a correlation close to 1.</p>
<p>We now propose a single statistic as an alternative measure to distinguish between serial and parallel processing. Again, we suppose to have a stimulus mixture of two components and a population of <italic>n</italic> neurons attending to the mixture. The number of neurons, <italic>Z</italic>, attending to the first stimulus follows a distribution with probability mass function (PMF) <italic>f</italic>(<italic>z</italic>) for <italic>z</italic> &#x2208; &#x007B;0,1,&#x2026;,<italic>n</italic>&#x007D;, such that <italic>P</italic>(<italic>Z</italic> &#x003D; <italic>z</italic>) &#x003D; <italic>f</italic>(<italic>z</italic>), which depends on the specific model. A distribution centered around <italic>n</italic>/2 indicates apparent parallel processing, and a distribution centered at 0 and/or <italic>n</italic> indicates apparent serial processing. Note that this population distribution incorporates both the marginal probability of attention of the single neurons and the correlation between neuron pairs. We define a statistic <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> as a measure of the degree of serial or parallel processing, given by
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="383596_eqn1.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The statistic <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> can be explained as a normalized expected deviation between the number of neurons attending to one stimulus and the half of the total number of neurons. If we split the neuron population according to which stimulus they attend giving two proportions (summing to 1), then <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> is the average difference between the two proportions, and it can take values between 0 and 1. The smaller <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> is, the more parallel processing is favored. The <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> statistic depends on the total number of recorded neurons <italic>n</italic>. However, if we consider specific models for the PMF, for example the binomial models introduced below, the dependence of <italic>n</italic> can be removed by using the asymptotic version
<disp-formula>
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="383596_ueqn1.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula>
which provides a measure for the entire neuronal population relevant for the given task, not only the measured ones.</p>
<p>To summarize, to measure the degree of serial and parallel processing, we can use the attentional probability <italic>p</italic>, the correlation of neuronal attention <italic>&#x03C1;</italic>, and the deviation statistics <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> or <italic>D</italic>&#x002A;.</p>

<title>Models</title>
<p>In this section we present two models to explain the spike train data in an attention framework.

<title>Hidden Markov Model and a Mixture of Binomial Distributions</title>
<p>To combine the visual attention hypotheses with neuronal dynamics, we adopt a HMM. The HMM assumes some underlying unobserved variable that drives the attention of the neurons. The HMM is defined over the <italic>T</italic> time steps. We let the probabilities <italic>p</italic> of the single neurons, which can be interpreted as attentional weights, depend on the state of the underlying HMM, which introduces correlation between neurons, even if they are conditionally independent given the hidden state, and the probabilities evolve over time following the dynamics of the HMM. Note that this implies that within each of the <italic>T</italic> intervals, model parameters governing the stochastic neuronal activity (the spike train generation) are constant. We use three hidden states, which can describe three attentional regimes: attention directed to the contralateral side, to the ipsilateral side, or equal attention to both sides. A transition between hidden states introduces a weight reassignment of the attention to the stimuli, and thus, new laws for the generation of spike trains. Let <italic>C<sub>t</sub></italic> &#x2208; &#x007B;1, 2, 3&#x007D; denote the hidden state at time <italic>t</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref> shows a diagram of the HMM for <italic>T</italic> &#x003D; 3.

In this model the number of neurons <italic>z</italic> attending stimulus 1 follows a mixture of two distributions.

We do not assume a dependence structure over time, as in the HMM, and the behavior at each time step is independent of the behavior at other time steps.

<p>For all spike trains in trial <italic>k</italic>, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="383596_inline33.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, we have thus obtained the discrete posterior distributions of the hidden states <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="383596_inline34.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and the attended stimulus of each spike train <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="383596_inline35.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, at all time steps <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 1,&#x2026;, <italic>T</italic>.

<p>At each time step <italic>t</italic>, conditional on <italic>C<sub>t</sub></italic>, spike trains are independent and the posterior probabilities <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="383596_inline37.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> are different from spike train to spike train. Thus, the attended stimuli of all neurons follow a Poisson binomial distribution, a generalization of the ordinary binomial distribution where each Bernoulli trial has a distinct success probability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The PMF of the Poisson binomial distribution is calculated numerically using methods from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Marginalizing out <italic>C<sub>t</sub></italic>, at each time step t we then have a mixture of three Poisson binomial distributions. The PMF of this mixture distribution can be regarded as probabilities of the number of neurons that have attended stimulus one, conditional on their observed spike trains. The deviation statistic <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> can also be obtained from the PMF.</p>

<title>Decoding in the correlated binomial model</title>
<p>In the CBM, spike trains between different time steps and different trials are independent (except for the memory component, the exponential term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">Eq. (15)</xref>). Thus, decoding can simply be done independently for each discretized time step in each trial. Now, let <italic>C<sub>t</sub></italic> be an index indicating either the binomial or the Bernoulli component in the mixture. As previously, we first decode <italic>C<sub>t</sub></italic> by calculating <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="383596_inline38.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, then find the PMF by calculating <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="383596_inline39.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. We have

where the two cases <italic>C<sub>t</sub></italic> &#x003D; 1 and <italic>C<sub>t</sub></italic> &#x003D; 2 are given by the two components in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn19">Eq.

When <italic>C<sub>t</sub></italic> &#x003D; 1, i.e., the binomial case, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="383596_inline41.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is obtained for each spike train independently with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="383596_inline42.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, resulting in a Poisson binomial distribution.

<title>Simulated data</title>
<p>We first simulate spike train data and check if our models and methods work properly on the simulated data. For both the HMM and the CBM, we consider three parameter settings. In all cases, we use 10 simultaneously recorded neurons, repeated for 20 trials. The parameters, including base rates and response weights, are the same for the three cases. We consider only one stimulus condition, such that each neuron only has two base rate parameters, one for the contralateral and one for the ipsilateral sides.</p>
<p>The parameter values used in the simulations are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>. For the HMM, we use a time step of 0.1s and a total of 10 time steps. For the CBM, we use a time step of 0.1s and a total of 5 time steps. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4 Fig</xref> shows the probabilities, correlations, <italic>D</italic>&#x002A; and <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> values as functions of time.

<title>Parameter estimation in HMM</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8</xref> illustrates parameter estimates for the HMM using different condition and step number settings. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8a</xref> shows the probability of attending to the stimulus at the contralateral side, <italic>p<sub>t</sub></italic> &#x003D; <italic>P</italic>(<italic>X<sub>t</sub></italic> &#x003D; 1), as kernel density plots from all 48 estimates. Three line types (solid, dashed and dotted) indicate the three time steps, and four colors represent four types of conditions. At <italic>t</italic> &#x003D;1 all conditions follow the same distribution, so there is a single black curve. For the subsequent time steps, the condition types are: stimulus pairs with T on the ipsilateral side; stimulus pairs with T on the contralateral side; stimulus pairs with NO on the ipsilateral side; and stimulus pairs with NO on the contralateral side. It illustrates that neuronal attention slightly prefers the contralateral stimulus in the beginning right after stimulus onset (the black density curve is centered slightly towards larger values than 0.5), and later on tends to follow T and avoid NO. Note that here we conduct model inference using all 12 conditions, and only combine similar conditions together for presentation.</p>

There are 48 estimates in the leftmost panel at <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 1 (no difference between conditions), and 48 &#x00D7; 12 estimates in the remaining panels from 12 conditions in 48 sessions. A straight line is plotted on the anti-diagonal for easier reading. The lower left region of the heatmap represents a tendency of parallel processing, and all other regions represent a tendency of serial processing. In the leftmost panel corresponding to the first time step, a big portion of the estimates fall in the lower left region. At later time steps, the estimates tend to move to the right and upper regions. This implies that, in an early stage stimuli tend to be processed in parallel. Later on more and more neurons share the same attended stimulus in the form of serial processing. Despite the moving tendency, there are points lying on both sides of the straight line at all time steps. This is evidence supporting both processing mechanisms for all time steps throughout the entire spike train.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8c</xref> we investigate the asymptotic deviation statistic <italic>D</italic>&#x002A;.

<title>Parameter estimation in correlated binomial</title>
<p>The estimates of the CBM is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9</xref>. The results are similar to the HMM. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9b</xref>, we see apparent parallel processing at <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 1, while later on the correlation for most estimates goes to either 1 or 0, and the probability becomes more extreme. For <italic>t</italic> &#x003E; 1, in most of the 48 &#x00D7; 12 estimates the weight parameter of the mixture (the correlation coefficient) is close to either 1 or 0, meaning one component is dominating over the other. This is because of the small number of simultaneously recorded neurons in most trials (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1 Fig</xref>), which is insufficient for obtaining good estimates in a mixture model. This is a weakness of the CBM since it only contains two extreme components representing either full independence or full correlation. Model fitting of the CBM on limited sample sizes can bias the correlation parameter. To check this suspicion, we looked at the estimates from session &#x201C;MN110411&#x201D;, the right-most neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1 Fig</xref> <italic>c</italic> with the largest number of simultaneously recorded neurons, and found that the estimates of the correlation lie almost uniformly across 0 to 1, indicating that the estimates of either 0 or 1 of the correlation in other sessions can be an artefact of small sample sizes.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig 11</xref> we show box-plots of the <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> values from multiple trials across all sessions as a function of time. Again we include four cases: HMM with <italic>T</italic> &#x003D; 3, 5 and 10, and CBM with <italic>T</italic> &#x003D; 3. If a trial has too few simultaneously recorded spike trains, the <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> values will be biased, and there will be large variance across trials. For example, in the simulation study in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>, we see large quantiles for the decoding results even with very good parameter estimates. For this reason, we only consider trials with at least 10 simultaneously recorded spike trains. Note that the minimum number in a trial here is different from the number of simultaneously recorded neurons in a session, because in many trials not all simultaneously recorded neurons are used. We pre-selected data such that the number of simultaneously recorded neurons in a session is at least 5, but in most trials the simultaneously recorded spike trains can be fewer. We see a similar trend as in the encoding results: The <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> values are increasing with time, indicating stronger serial processing. The degree of serial processing becomes maximal starting from around the middle of the spike train. In particular, for HMM with <italic>T</italic> &#x003D; 5 (top right), the <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> box-plot at <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 2 shows smaller median and larger variance than <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 3. For HMM with <italic>T</italic> &#x003D; 10, the box-plots at <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 2, 3, 4 show large variance (reaching low values) compared with <italic>t</italic> &#x2265; 5. Note that the similar results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs 8c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9c</xref> are <italic>prior</italic> measures based on estimated parameters, and the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig 11</xref> are <italic>posterior</italic> measures based on the decoded attended stimulus for specific spike train data. Finally, in all models and at all time steps, there is evidence of both parallel and serial processing, implied by the wide box-plots.</p>

<title>Specific initial probabilities for each condition</title>
<p>Previously we have used the same initial probabilities for all conditions, i.e., neuronal attention in the beginning right after stimulus onset is only affected by stimulus locations and not by stimulus types, which is supported by the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Here we conduct a further analysis discarding this assumption and allowing each condition to have its own initial probabilities. Doing so will greatly increase the number of parameters to estimate, and the estimation and inference results of the mixture models become increasingly unreliable given limited data size and large noise. We only analyze the most simple example for the HMM using three time steps with three merged conditions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig S6</xref> Fig are shown the <italic>D</italic>&#x002A; statistics obtained using parameter estimates, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs 8c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9c</xref>, but for the two settings: fixing the same initial probabilities or assuming different initial probabilities for each condition. Though the <italic>D</italic>&#x002A; results are different in the two plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig S6</xref> Fig, the conclusion remains the same; neuronal attention is more parallel right after stimulus onset and becomes more serial later on.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we combine the point process neuron models describing spike trains with the neural interpretations of serial and parallel processing hypotheses in visual search. We propose a HMM and a CBM to describe neuronal attention in neurophysiological measurements from prefrontal cortex in rhesus monkeys. Results show that parallel processing is favored in some sessions while serial processing is favored in other sessions, and there is evidence for both parallel and serial processing at all time steps. Overall, we see a tendency towards parallel processing in the early stage after stimulus onset, and serial processing in the late stage. This means that, right after stimulus onset, neurons tend to split to attend different stimuli, and later neurons become more synchronized sharing the same attended stimulus. Furthermore, at the early stage neurons prefer the contralateral stimulus, while in the late stage neurons favor the T and avoid NO, which agrees with the study conducted by averaging across spike trains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>The early state of parallel processing can be related to feedforward or bottom-up processing, where the sensory inputs are being processed before higher level cognitive modulatory influences of recurrent feedback or top-down processing has begun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In the later stage, where top-down signals have had time to modulate the attention, the neural activity tends to synchronize around the attended object, resembling serial processing. Similar results have been observed in event-related potentials in electroencephalography (EEG) measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. They found that forward connections are sufficient to explain the data in early periods after stimulus onset, whereas backward connections become essential after around 220 <italic>ms</italic>. Even if the exact timing of the switch between bottom-up and top-down signals is not clear, there is evidence that after 200 <italic>ms</italic> back projections play a prominent role, even if selective responses are elicited already after 100 <italic>ms</italic> after stimulus onset (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and references therein). Quantification of the relative contribution of feedforward and feedback signals characterizing visual perception remains unclear, and thus, the concepts of parallel and serial processing and our suggested analysis tools provide a useful mean for elucidating these questions.</p>
<p>Decoding analysis provides posterior probabilities of neuronal attentions, yielding an estimate of the PMF and therefore also of <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic>. This can be used to analyze attentional behavior for any given simultaneously recorded spike trains in future trials. The conclusions regarding parallel and serial processing from the overall distribution of <italic>D<sub>n</sub></italic> on all trials and sessions from the decoding analysis are the same as in the prior analysis using only parameter estimates. Note that although both the prior and posterior analysis provide similar results, the conclusions regarding neuronal attentional properties should be drawn from the prior analysis based on the MLE. The MLE gives the optimal estimation of the neuronal properties based on all the available data. The decoding analysis, on the other hand, estimates what the neuron&#x2019;s attention could have been during a specific trial based on the data from this trial, and the uncertainty of the decoding is represented by posterior distributions.</p>
<p>In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], parallel processing in the early stage was reported. The same conclusion is drawn from our analysis, where we find that the neurons prefer the contralateral stimulus in the early stage, and integrating both hemispheres gives simultaneous parallel processing. Furthermore, there exists not only such parallel processing considering the whole brain, but also parallel processing based on neurons in a single recording site, as supported by our finding. Though the simultaneously recorded neurons in one location show a tendency towards the contralateral stimulus in the early stage, there is strong evidence showing they split their attention between stimuli located on both sides in a parallel way.</p>
<p>The models here are fitted to the specific data set from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] and the model structure contains the experimental conditions specific for this data set. However, with trivial adjustments, the models also apply to generic neurophysiological data that consist of simultaneously recorded spike trains. Currently the models and methods only support two stimuli, and a future extension is the generalization to an arbitrary number of stimuli.</p>
<p>The two models, the HMM and the CBM, yield different results regarding the degree of serial and parallel processing. This is partly because the two models are based on different assumptions. The biological reality of attention, which we try to describe with these simple models, is complicated, and the two models approximate the reality and explain neural attention from different perspectives. Further, the experimental data are noisy with limited sample size and the models contain a large number of parameters, which leads to large variance of estimators. For one trial or session, the difference between the two models could be large, but the overall results of the two models over a large number of sessions produce similar conclusions. However it makes more sense to make comparisons under the same model. For example, we compare different conditions or different time steps only under the same model.</p>
<p>Another issue is the variability between sessions for the same model. We assume the whole prefrontal area follow a probabilistic model and we want to estimate the model parameters. However, in each session we only have a small subset with 5 to 20 simultaneously recorded neurons from a recording site, and the number is even smaller for single trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1 Fig</xref>), with each neuron having its distinct firing rate and attentional pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2 Fig</xref>). Thus, there is a large variance of the estimates from session to session, and we obtain the overall result by averaging and applying kernel density estimation. To obtain more stable and accurate results it would be beneficial to use a larger simultaneously recorded population of neurons.</p>
