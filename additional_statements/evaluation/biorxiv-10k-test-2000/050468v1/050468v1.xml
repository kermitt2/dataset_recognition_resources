<title>MAIN</title>
<p>Super resolution techniques such as STORM and PALM achieve &#x007E;20 nm resolution in the lateral (xy) plane. However, achieving comparable resolution in the axial (z) direction is more difficult. Single molecule techniques (either through point spread function engineering or multi-focal imaging) usually reach &#x007E;50 nm resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Using interference techniques (e.g. iPALM), sub-20-nm axial resolution can be obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], but the complexity of the optics limits its wide use. Alternatively, surface-generated fluorescence interference contrast methods, including <underline><italic>fl</italic></underline>uorescence <underline><italic>i</italic></underline>nterference <underline><italic>c</italic></underline>ontrast (FLIC) microscopy or <underline><italic>s</italic></underline>canning <underline><italic>a</italic></underline>ngle <underline><italic>i</italic></underline>nterference <underline><italic>m</italic></underline>icroscopy (SAIM), are capable of nanometer resolution axial measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Unlike STORM and PALM, these methods usually acquire images from large numbers of fluorophores, rather than single molecules. While utilizing relatively simple optics available on commercial microscopes, difficulties with calibration and the lack of available analysis software have hampered the widespread adoption of SAIM. Here, we describe a tool for automated angle calibration and freely available, open source software, which together create a straightforward pipeline for SAIM analysis.</p>
<p>In these interference contrast methods, the sample is placed on top of a transparent spacer on top of a mirror (silicon wafer with silicon oxide spacer) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). Incident excitation light interferes with its own reflection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>), resulting in an intensity field that varies with axial distance in a manner that is theoretically predictable (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>, Supplementary Note</bold>). By varying the angle of excitation, different intensity profiles can be obtained. After acquiring images at many different angles and fitting the intensities pixel by pixel to the theoretical prediction, one can determine the average height of each spatial element at nm resolution.</p>

<p>Our SAIM pipeline begins with an improved calibration procedure (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>, left). We designed a simple apparatus, controlled by a &#x03BC;Manager plugin, that consists of an interchangeable, transparent acrylic front plate through which the laser beam travels, and two linear CCDs detecting light emerging from the front plate. The color of acrylic used for the front plate must be chosen to optimally scatter or fluoresce upon illumination by the laser being calibrated. This system defines the relation between motor position and angle of illumination by transferring the measurements to the &#x03BC;Manager plugin and fitting with a trinomial function (<bold>Supplementary Protocol</bold>). Compared to manual procedures using a protractor or similar method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], automated angle measurement provides a faster, more thorough calibration with sub-pixel localization of the laser position, and the ability to measure angle at finer motor steps due to the dramatic decrease in time needed for calibration. Automated calibration is especially advantageous for multicolor measurements, as it reduces the time required to calibrate each laser from 30-60 min to less than 5 min. Furthermore, this automated method is highly reproducible, which is important because errors in calibration of a few degrees can translate into errors in height measurements of greater than 10 nm (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1</bold>). The building plans for this device, firmware and computer interface code are freely available (<bold>Supplementary Protocol</bold>).</p>
<p>After calibration, the sample can be analyzed by varying the angle of illumination by controlling a motorized illuminator with open source &#x03BC;Manager software (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>, middle) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. The acquired images then are analyzed to determine z-axis information (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>, right). Our SAIM analysis software is a Fiji [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] plugin that: 1) plots the predicted excitation intensity at a given distance from the surface of the oxide layer as a function of angle, 2) fits the theoretical model to an experimentally determined intensity profile at a given region of interest (ROI) as a function of angle by varying estimators for height, intensity and background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], and 3) carries out fits for all pixels in an image. The code uses an unbounded Levenberg-Marquard optimizer that minimizes the square of the difference between observed and predicted values. Parameters are restricted to physically relevant values (for instance, no negative heights are allowed). Execution speed depends on image content, though we routinely analyze every pixel in a dataset of 86 images at 1024 &#x00D7; 1024 pixels in 2.5 minutes on a MacBook Pro with a 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor. In practice, masking images to fit only relevant pixels can accelerate processing dramatically.</p>
<p>Samples for SAIM are prepared on commercially available silicon substrates with an oxide spacer. Any thickness of the oxide spacer can be used, but we found that spacers of &#x007E;1900 nm provided the optimal periodicity of the SAIM function in the range of angles that could be sampled using a 1.20 NA water immersion objective (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2a</bold>). In order to measure the true height of a sample by SAIM, it is critical to know the precise thickness of the oxide spacer. We measured the oxide thickness of SAIM substrates using ellipsometry (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2b</bold>). Oxide spacer thickness also can be estimated using SAIM by imaging a monolayer of surface-bound fluorescent dyes of defined thickness and fitting theoretical predictions for different oxide heights to the data until the known height of the sample is derived. We used a DiO, DiI, and DiD triple labeled supported lipid bilayer (SLB) for this purpose, and fit the oxide to the known height of 6.4 nm for a phospholipid bilayer (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2b-c</bold>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. We recommend performing this measurement on the day of an experiment to minimize variability in measurements due to changes in the microscope and/or calibrations (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2d</bold>). Once calibrated, this technique can be used to measure the SLB height with a standard deviation around one nanometer (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>) at approximately 10<sup>6</sup> photons per pixel (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1f-g</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To further test accuracy and limitations of SAIM and our analysis pipeline, we measured fluorescent nano-sized beads using both SAIM and negative stain electron microscopy. For SAIM, beads were adsorbed onto silicon substrates with an oxide spacer of &#x007E;1900 nm. Angle dependent changes in bead fluorescence intensity were fit to the optical model to obtain the axial position of the bead center. These measurements were repeated for beads with nominal 20- or 50-nm radii, and fluorescence excitation wavelengths of 488 or 561 nm (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). SAIM heights were similar to those derived from the EM measurements (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Next, we sought to measure nanometer scale changes in height in a biological sample. We measured the deformation of a microtubule (25 nm diameter) as it crossed on top of an axoneme (a relatively rigid, structured bundle of microtubules in a specific arrangement with a diameter of about 200 nm). The average microtubule height change at an axoneme crossing was measured by our SAIM technique to be 227 &#x00B1; 44 nm (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>, modeled in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). The standard deviation in the height measurements of the microtubule in areas away from crossings was 6 nm. Thus, the additional variability at axoneme crossings likely reflects heterogeneity in microtubule bending. Our automated SAIM method also is capable of measuring microtubule deformations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, as described in other cell types (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have developed open source tools for automated angle calibration, image acquisition and analysis methods to implement <underline><italic>s</italic></underline>canning <underline><italic>a</italic></underline>ngle <underline><italic>i</italic></underline>nterference <underline><italic>m</italic></underline>icroscopy (SAIM). With these tools, any lab with a motorized TIRF microscope supported by &#x03BC;Manager should be able to perform SAIM experiments to measure the axial organization of fluorescently-tagged molecules at nm resolution.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>The SAIM calibration device</title>
<p>The calibration device is based on an Arduino open-source electronics platform. The device uses two linear CCDs (AMS-TAOS USA Inc., TSL-1412S) positioned above the microscope objective lens to detect fluorescence emitted by an acrylic faceplate when illuminated by an excitation laser (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>, left). Based on the known, fixed vertical displacement between these two detectors the angle of that excitation light can be determined (<bold>Supplementary Protocol</bold>).</p>

<title>The SAIM calibration plugin</title>
<p>This &#x03BC;Manager [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] plugin controls the SAIM calibration device described above to execute SAIM calibration and data acquisition. This plugin consists of two parts. 1) The &#x201C;Calibration&#x201D; panel communicates with the calibration device to measure the relation between the refractive index corrected angle of excitation light and position of a motorized TIRF illuminator. The plugin will store calibrations for multiple channel groups that can be accessed from the acquisition panel. 2) The &#x201C;Acquisition&#x201D; panel reads the calibration for a given channel group, takes a user provided range of angles and the number of steps for sampling this range, and then runs a series of acquisitions at these angles.</p>

<title>The SAIM analysis plugin</title>
<p>This Fiji [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] plugin consists of three parts. &#x201C;SAIM Plot&#x201D; plots theoretical predictions for the intensity distribution as a function of distance from the surface of the oxide layer. &#x201C;SAIM Inspect&#x201D; and &#x201C;SAIM Fit&#x201D; are very similar; however, SAIM Inspect will act on the average values of the ROI (for instance, the pixel under the cursor) and executes only a single fit, whereas SAIM Fit will analyze all pixels of the image stack. SAIM Fit will fit each pixel in the input stack and output a stack with 4 images. The first one is the height map (in nm), the second image has the r-squared values (an indication of the goodness of fit with values between 0 and 1, the closer to 1, the better the fit), the third image shows the values for &#x201C;A&#x201D;, a scaling parameter that accounts for variation in intensity, and the last image shows the values for &#x201C;B&#x201D;, an offset parameter that accounts for background fluorescence. This plugin uses the equations from the Paszek et al. paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] with a few extensions (<bold>Supplementary Note</bold>).</p>

<title>Optical setup</title>
<p>SAIM imaging was performed on one of two Nikon TI-E microscopes equipped with a Nikon 60x Plan Apo VC 1.20 NA water immersion objective, and four laser lines (405, 488, 561, 640 nm), either a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 or Andor iXon EM-CCD camera, and &#x03BC;Manager software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. A polarizing filter was placed in the excitation laser path to polarize the light perpendicular to the plane of incidence. Angle of illumination was controlled with either a standard Nikon TIRF motorized positioner or a mirror moved by a motorized actuator (Newport, CMA-25CCCL).</p>

<title>Preparation of reflective substrates with supported lipid bilayers</title>
<p>Silicon wafers with 1900 nm oxide spacers were obtained from Addison Engineering, cut, and cleaned using the same process as for for nanobead imaging.

SUVs made by this method were stored at 4&#x00B0;C and used within two weeks of formation. To make labeled supported lipid bilayers, wafers were submerged in PBS in freshly plasma cleaned custom PDMS chambers on RCA cleaned glass coverslips. 100 &#x00B5;l of SUV solution containing 0.5 to 1 mg/ml lipid was added to the coverslips and incubated for 30 min. Unadsorbed vesicles were removed by washing three times with PBS, then bilayers were stained for 20 min with approximately 100 ng/mL DiO, DiI and/or DiD solution in PBS (Invitrogen). Wafers were again washed three times with PBS prior to imaging.</p>
