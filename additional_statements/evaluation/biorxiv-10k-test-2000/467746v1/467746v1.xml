<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>The results of completed clinical trials build the backbone of evidence-based medicine and inform the design and review of future trials. Many investigations, however, have found that a large proportion of trial results are not disseminated or disseminated with a substantial delay. For most clinical trials, university medical centres (UMCs) take the academic lead. The UMC-specific proportion of timely disseminated trial results thus becomes a &#x201C;responsible metric&#x201D; that can inform alternative national and international benchmarking of UMCs.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We sampled and tracked all registered trials for all German UMCs that were officially completed between 2009 and 2013. We present our results in several formats, including percentages, Kaplan-Meier graphs and logistic regression modelling. The results, together with an interactive website, benchmark all German UMCs with regard to their performance in results dissemination.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We identified and tracked 2,132 clinical trials. For 1,509 trials, one of the 36 German UMCs took the academic lead. Of these 1,509 &#x201C;lead trials&#x201D;, 39&#x0025; published their results via journal publications or summary results in a timely manner (&#x003C;24 months after completion date). This publication rate varied from 20&#x0025; to 64&#x0025; across all 36 German UMCs. More than six years after study completion, 26&#x0025; of all eligible lead trials still had not disseminated results, accounting for an average of more than 8,000 trial participants each year that were included in trials without any knowledge gain.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite substantial attention to the topic in the last decade, there is still a delay or even absence of results dissemination of trials, which is unethical, wastes public resources, and negatively affects decision making in medical research and health care. German UMCs have many unique opportunities to improve this situation. The timely dissemination of trial results should become a principle of &#x201C;Good Scientific Practice&#x201D; guidelines and play a role in institutional reward and incentive schemes. Funders may consider dissemination practices when reviewing applications for clinical studies. Further research should evaluate whether and how a transparent benchmarking of UMC performance in trial results dissemination and other &#x201C;responsible metrics&#x201D; helps to increase value and reduce waste in medical research.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The results of clinical trials build the backbone of evidence-based medicine. They inform clinical decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] and health technology assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], They also inform decision making within ongoing trials and decision making related to the design, review, and funding of new trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], Because non-dissemination or delayed dissemination of trial results negatively affects all of these decision-making processes, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] it has been investigated and criticized for over three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In 2013, the revised Declaration of Helsinki included the requirements that every study involving human subjects should be prospectively registered and that all results should be made publicly available &#x2013; irrespective of the results&#x2019; direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. The joint statement by the World Health Organization in 2015 defined &#x201C;timely publication&#x201D; as &#x201C;24 months for publication in a peer-reviewed journal (preferably open-access) and 12 months for publication of the key results in the registry&#x2019;s result section&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The current dissemination of clinical trial results looks quite different. Recently, Chen et al. analysed the publication of more than 4,000 interventional clinical trials across all 51 US university medical centres (UMCs) that were completed between October 2007 and September 2010. Only 29&#x0025; of trials published their results within 24 months after study completion, and only 13&#x0025; of trials posted their results in the registry. Overall, as of July 2014, 35&#x0025; of all trials were found to be unpublished. Pica et al. analysed 455 registered paediatric clinical trials completed by December 2012 and found 21&#x0025; (n&#x003D;94) to be unreported in September 2015.</p>
<p>In recent years, journals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], agencies (the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], ethical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], and most recently, funding bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] have all explicitly highlighted the need to reduce publication bias and developed policies to proactively achieve this objective. UMCs, however, which function as trial sites and host the responsible principle investigators (PIs), have remained surprisingly silent about this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. A transparent benchmarking for how complete and timely UMCs are in reporting their trial results could incentivize the implementation of more effective UMC policies in this regard. Such benchmarks could also raise public and media awareness about this issue. The findings from Chen et al. allow such a benchmarking for U.S. UMCs based on nine different data sets presented in their paper (e.g., &#x201C;overall rate of results reported or published&#x201D; and &#x201C;rate of publication &#x003C;24 months after study completion&#x201D;). The &#x201C;TrialsTracker&#x201D; for the FDA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fdaaa.trialstracker.net">https://fdaaa.trialstracker.net</ext-link>) and the EU (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eu.trialstracker.net">http://eu.trialstracker.net</ext-link>) is another source that provides automatically updated data for benchmarking activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. TrialsTracker increases its public outreach by presenting results via a publicly accessible website and by mentioning the performance of individual centres on Twitter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. TrialsTracker, however, has two limitations. First, it focuses on trials that fall under mandatory reporting rules according to the FDA Amendment Act (FDAAA) or the European Commission guideline 2012/c302/03. Second, its method is restricted to the automated search of registry entries and national clinical trial (NCT) identifiers in PubMed.</p>
<p>In this study, we further develop the concept and practice of benchmarking UMCs in three ways. First, with regard to the sample, we sampled and followed up trials that were officially completed between 2009 and 2013 for all German UMCs. Germany is ranked second in the world and first in Europe for the number of active clinical trial sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Second, with regard to the search strategy, we extended the standard publication search strategies to comprehensive hand searches in Google Scholar to better understand the full picture of available results published outside registry websites and PubMed. Third, with regard to benchmarking, we developed a website, including a Shiny app, that allows the interactive visualization of benchmarking according to the different variables that influence publication measurement, such as time to publication, publication format, sponsor, timing of registration, and completion date.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The protocol for this project, including all methodological details for sampling and following up clinical trials for data extraction, and statistical analyses were preregistered with the Open Science Framework (OSF) and continuously updated for amendments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/fh426/">https://osf.io/fh426/</ext-link>). In the following sections, we summarize the methods.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Retrieval of trials</title>
<p>We downloaded the AACT dataset, which aggregates information from ClinicalTrials.gov into a relational database, from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/">http://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/</ext-link> (version date: April 17, 2017). We further downloaded the dataset from the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS) from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drks.de">www.drks.de</ext-link> on July 27, 2017. We used an R script to combine all relevant datasets and search criteria needed to retrieve clinical trials from all 36 German UMCs and to extract their study characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Inclusion and exclusion of studies</title>
<p>R was also used to restrict the resulting dataset to studies with a primary completion date (AACT) or study end date (DRKS) in the years 2009-2013, as well as to exclude observational studies, incomplete entries (missing NCT, affiliation or primary completion date), and duplicates.</p>
<p>For the AACT dataset, a trial was assigned to a UMC if the UMC was either mentioned as a &#x201C;responsible party&#x201D; (e.g., lead sponsor or principal investigator) or as a &#x201C;facility&#x201D;. For the DRKS dataset, the affiliation of the primary sponsor in the &#x201C;address&#x201D; and &#x201C;recruitment location&#x201D; fields was used. After automatic filtering for the UMC names, the correct assignment of trials to UMCs was verified manually. Only studies with the status &#x201C;Completed&#x201D;, &#x201C;Terminated&#x201D;, &#x201C;Suspended&#x201D;, or &#x201C;Unknown&#x201D; (or the equivalent DRKS categories; see detailed methods on OSF) were included. Studies from the DRKS sample that also appeared in the AACT sample were identified by searching for NCT IDs and subsequently removed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Publication search</title>
<p>For each of the included studies, a results publication was searched independently by two researchers in a 3-step process between July 2017 and December 2017 (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, search strategy). 1) The clinical trial identifier (NCT ID or DRKS-ID) was entered on ClinicalTrials.gov/DRKS.de, and the earliest result publication linked in the registry was searched. Reviews and other background literature were excluded. 2) The clinical trial identifier was entered on PubMed. 3) Google Scholar and (if no hit was found) Web of Science were searched by subsequently entering the following search terms: clinical trial identifier, official title, brief title (not available for DRKS data), both intervention name and principal investigator (DRKS: name associated with primary sponsor). The first 2 results pages were screened. Publications that did not contain the registry identifier were matched using a list of explicit criteria (i.e., study design, intervention, and outcomes). All criteria needed to be met to be counted as a match.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="467746_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>If, after all three searches, there was still no result, the study was characterized as &#x201C;no publication found&#x201D;. Additionally, the researchers checked if a summary result was posted on CT.gov.</p>
<p>For further information on interrater reliability, data extraction, R-scripts, and statistics (logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier), see the abovementioned protocol registered with OSF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/fh426/">https://osf.io/fh426/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Demographic data</title>
<p>We identified 2,132 clinical trials via clinicaltrial.gov (n&#x003D;l,905) and DRKS (n&#x003D;227) that i) recruited trial participants from at least one German UMC and ii) had their primary completion date (PCD, last visit of last patient for a primary outcome measure) between 2009 and 2013. These trials included 506,876 anticipated participants.</p>
<p>Altogether, in 71&#x0025; (n&#x003D;l,509) of all trials, the corresponding German UMC either was the lead sponsor or hosted the PI and was thus legally determined to be the &#x201C;responsible party&#x201D;. Of these 1,509 &#x201C;lead trials&#x201D;, 516 (34&#x0025;) investigated drugs, and 276 (18&#x0025;) investigated devices; the rest were &#x201C;behavioural&#x201D;, &#x201C;procedure&#x201D; or &#x201C;other&#x201D; interventions. Only a minority of these lead trials (n&#x003D;371; 25&#x0025;) were registered prospectively, and 909 (60&#x0025;) were registered more than 21 days after the given start date of the study, with 258 (17&#x0025;) registered after the completion date (CD). 118 lead trials (8&#x0025;) included more than 500 anticipated participants. A total of 1,095 trials (73&#x0025;) were completed, and 138 (10&#x0025;) were either terminated early or suspended; for 276 trials (18&#x0025;), the status was unknown.

<title>Overall results reporting and the Shiny app website</title>
<p>In the following sections, we report the most essential findings of our study. Our fine-grained analysis, however, allows the combination of different measurement variables in different ways, e.g., i) the proportion of summary results reported after 12, 24, or 60 months, ii) the proportion of result publications in peer-reviewed journals after 24 months for all non-drug trials, or iii) the proportion of results reported after more than 6 years for all trials with industry as sponsor. Because our paper cannot report on all different combinations, we developed an interactive website (based on a Shiny app) that allows users to select and combine the measurement variables in which they are most interested and develop a corresponding benchmark for all 36 German UMCs. The website is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://s-quest.bihealth.org/intovalue/">http://s-quest.bihealth.org/intovalue/</ext-link></p>
<p>Of all 1,509 lead trials, we could follow up 1,490 for a minimum of 24 months after the CD. Of those trials, 39&#x0025; published their results via journal publications or summary results within 24 months after the CD. At the level of German UMCs, this publication rate varied from 20&#x0025; to 64&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Across &#x201C;high-volume&#x201D; centres (&#x003E;50 completed trials), the publication rate varied from 29&#x0025; to 49&#x0025;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> presents the percentage of unpublished trials over time. By April 2017, summary results were reported in the registry for 94 (7&#x0025;) of 1,295 lead trials registered with clinicaltrials.gov.</p>

<p>Of the 1,509 lead trials, there was a subgroup of 666 trials that we could follow up for more than six years after the CD. For this subgroup, we found an overall publication rate of 74&#x0025;, with a variation across universities of 56&#x0025; to 100&#x0025;. Altogether, 18,345 participants were planned to be included in the 173 trials that have not published their results. Extrapolated to the full sample of lead trials (18,345 &#x00D7; 1,509 &#x00F7; 666 &#x00F7; 5 years) an average of 8,313 planned participants per year were included in trials from German UMCs that did not disseminate their results after more than six years.</p>
<p>All the results presented above were generated by time-intensive searches, including searches in Google Scholar and Web of Science (see Methods), that were performed independently by two researchers with training in literature searching. When restricting our search efforts to more convenient standards (registry and PubMed; see Methods), we could identify results for only 26&#x0025; of trials within 24 months after CD (vs. 39&#x0025; with our extensive search) and for 45&#x0025; of trials followed up for more than six years (vs. 74&#x0025; with our extensive search). Thus, we could identify 33&#x0025; of all timely publications and 39&#x0025; of all publications with a six-year follow-up period only via the additional search strategies.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Subgroup analyses</title>
<p>The overall publication rates (for more than six years after CD) differed substantially (more than 10&#x0025;) according to the following factors:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>sample size (72&#x0025; for trials with 1-100 participants but 92&#x0025; for trials with &#x003E;500 participants),</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>trial status (49&#x0025; for trials with terminated/suspended/unknown status but 84&#x0025; for completed trials).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The timely publication rates (within 24 months after CD) differed substantially according to the following factors:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the completion year (37&#x0025; for trials completed in 2009 up to 51&#x0025; for trials competed in 2013)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the lead sponsor (52&#x0025; for trials with industry as the lead sponsor and 39&#x0025; for trials with academia as the lead sponsor).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The logistic regression analysis yielded consistent results and identified similar variables with a strong effect on timely publication (see the supplementary file on OSF), although the associations were too weak to predict which studies will be reported in time with great confidence.</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that only 39&#x0025; of all registered clinical trials conducted at one of the 36 German UMCs published their results in a timely manner within 24 months after the trial&#x2019;s completion date (CD). This rate further decreases when applying standard search strategies: only 26&#x0025; of trials published results in both a &#x201C;timely&#x201D; and &#x201C;easily accessible&#x201D; manner. Even more than six years after the CD and with the most extensive search strategies, 26&#x0025; of all trials remain unpublished and do not report summary results in the registry.</p>
<p>For the following reasons, this high proportion of delayed or omitted result dissemination is unethical and a substantial waste of important research resources. First, the fact that 26&#x0025; of all clinical trials withhold the knowledge they gained or delay its dissemination negatively impacts i) the design of future, non-redundant translational research and ii) patient-oriented, evidence-based medical decision making. Second, every year, more than 8,000 participants on average were included in lead trials from German UMCs that did not generate any knowledge gain and thus no social value. Social value, however, is the basic ethical principle justifying research that adds burdens and risks to participants. Moreover, most trial participants are patients who already suffer from a disease. Third, administrative efforts to report summary results in the tabular format required by ClinicalTrials.gov are minimal, and this type of results reporting does not prevent more detailed and contextualized result publications in peer-reviewed journals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], Despite the ethical rationale and the low administrative burden, only 7&#x0025; (n&#x003D;94) of clinical trials conducted at German UMCs (&#x201C;lead trials&#x201D;) reported their summary results in clinicaltrials.gov. The recently published EU TrialsTracker that evaluated the compliance with summary results reporting in the EU Clinical Trials Registry (EUCTR) confirmed these low reporting rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast to most other trial tracking activities our search strategy included additional hand searches in Google Scholar that identified many publications that were not indexed at clinicaltrials.gov or PubMed. To increase the value of clinical trials, authors of peer-reviewed publications should proactively link their publications at the trial&#x2019;s registry entry.</p>
<p>German UMCs have many unique possibilities to improve the current situation. A minimally timeconsuming option would be to develop policies highlighting the ethical duty of PIs to publish on time. In Germany, all UMCs put much emphasis on the so-called &#x201C;Good Scientific Practice&#x201D; guideline (&#x201C;Gute Wissenschaftliche Praxis&#x201D;), which was published by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Timely and unbiased reporting of research results is not but should become a core principle of guidelines defining good scientific practice or research integrity. A second option would be to reward those PIs who manage to publish their results in a timely manner and/or report summary results in the registry. At German UMCs, the performance-oriented allocation of funds (&#x201C;LOM/Leistungsorientierte Mittelvergabe&#x201D;) currently only rewards aggregated impact factors and third-party funding. A third and harsher option would be to sanction those PIs who do not manage to report at least summary results in the registry within 24 months after CD.</p>
<p>The timely publication rates (within 24 months after CD) for German UMCs (39&#x0025;) and US UMCs (36&#x0025;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] are similar. However, the U.S. study by Chen et al. defined &#x201C;study completion&#x201D; as the PCD. In contrast, our study referred to the CD, which is 7 months later on average than the PCD. When following the German trials from the PCD, the timely publication rate decreases to 31&#x0025;. Further differences in results between the U.S. and the German sample highlight the importance of developing default measures for assessing publication rates. We will publish a more detailed commentary on how different measurement variables influence the assessment of publication rates elsewhere.</p>
<p>Even though some study characteristics were related to an increased probability of timely publication (i.e., industry sponsored, large sample size and completion year), this information cannot be used to reliably distinguish studies that will be published in a timely manner and those that will not. This finding suggests that a plethora of causal factors determine timely publication; thus, the solution to this issue is probably multifaceted, with changes needed at several levels.</p>
<p>Our study, however, has several limitations. Our results might underestimate the true publication rates because we did not search in scientific databases other than PubMed and Web of Science, and we did not contact the responsible parties. However, our study included additional hand searches in the broad search engine of Google Scholar, and we identified higher publication rates than all former tracking studies. Our results might also overestimate the true publications rates for several reasons. First, most included trials were retrospectively registered. These trials had substantially higher publication rates, which might reflect a registration and reporting bias. Furthermore, we did not include observational clinical studies in our sample. Former tracking studies that sampled at the level of German institutional review boards (IRBs) reported substantially lower publication rates for observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>],</p>
<p>Finally, but importantly, the substantial improvement in timely publication (within 24 months after CD) over time, with 70&#x0025; for trials completed in 2015 or later, is very promising. In contrast, the very low proportion of trials (7&#x0025;) that report summary results in the registry is alarming, as most trials thus forego an important opportunity to increase their scientific and social value. Additionally, more recent trials might get published in a timely manner, but old trials still have relevant information that remains unavailable and unused. These results, which are both promising and alarming, should encourage German UMCs and other stakeholders, such as patient and funding organizations, to further improve their efforts and develop policies for the timely publication of trial results for future trials, as well as already finished yet unpublished trials. The publicly available Shiny app (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://s-quest.bihealth.org/intovalue/">http://s-quest.bihealth.org/intovalue/</ext-link>) might further be used to raise awareness about this element of good scientific practice in the scientific community and in the public.</p>
