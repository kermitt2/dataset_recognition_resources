<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The Ccr4-Not complex removes mRNA poly(A) tails to regulate eukaryotic mRNA stability and translation. RNA-binding proteins contribute to specificity but this is not fully understood. Here, we reconstitute accelerated and selective deadenylation of RNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) and Pumilio-response elements (PREs). We find that the fission yeast homologues of Tristetraprolin/TTP and Pumilio/Puf (Zfs1 and Puf3) act as molecular tethers: They recruit Ccr4-Not via multiple regions within low-complexity sequences, and bind specific RNA sequences via RNA-binding domains. Using a two-color assay to simultaneously monitor poly(A) tail removal from different RNAs, we demonstrate that Puf3 can distinguish between RNAs of very similar sequence. This is primarily due to differences in the dissociation rate constants. As a result, motif quality is a major determinant of mRNA stability for Puf3 targets <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, we provide new insight into the selective deadenylation of specific mRNAs by Ccr4-Not, and the prediction of targeted mRNAs.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Shortening or removal of mRNA poly(A) tails (deadenylation) represses gene expression in eukaryotes. The Ccr4-Not complex is a conserved deadenylase that can initiate cytoplasmic mRNA decay, and reduce translation by releasing poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1/PABPC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tucker et al., 2001</xref>). Ccr4-Not contains seven core subunits, including two poly(A)-specific exonucleases, Ccr4/CNOT6/CNOT6L and Caf1/Pop2/CNOT7/CNOT8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wahle and Winkler, 2013</xref>). It can be specifically recruited to mRNAs by RNA-binding proteins and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Ccr4-Not recruitment can also be modulated by codon optimality and covalent modifications of the RNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eulalio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wahle and Winkler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Webster et al., 2018</xref>). Diverse biological processes depend on deadenylation, including embryogenesis, germline maintenance, cell proliferation, and attenuation of the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carballo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leppek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yamaji et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>RNA-binding proteins such as Pumilio/Puf and Tristetraprolin/TTP can recognize sequence motifs in mRNAs, and also bind Ccr4-Not to target those RNAs for deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wahle and Winkler, 2013</xref>). The set of transcripts targeted for repression and decay by a given RNA-binding protein is therefore defined by the distribution of its binding motifs across the transcriptome, and often includes groups of mRNAs that encode functionally related proteins. This generates RNA regulatory networks, structured such that a single protein can regulate the expression of numerous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Keene, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lapointe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wilinski et al., 2015</xref>). Targets of RNA-binding proteins often include factors that regulate gene expression themselves, thereby forming gene expression cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barckmann and Simonelig, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lapointe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shyu et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wells et al., 2012</xref>). Identification of the mRNAs within these networks allows a better understanding of gene expression and the roles of RNA-binding proteins that regulate them.</p>
<p>Recently, three sequence elements that strongly promote mRNA destabilization were identified in an unbiased screen in zebrafish embryogenesis: the Pumilio-response element (PRE), the AU-rich element (ARE) and the miR-430 seed sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rabani et al., 2017</xref>). PRE- and ARE-mediated mRNA destabilization is conserved from yeast to human but the set of mRNAs that contain these motifs are different across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wells et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wilinski et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, the biological processes regulated by orthologous RNA-binding proteins are diverse across organisms.</p>
<p>The PRE sequence motif is recognized by a conserved RNA-binding domain found within the Pumilio protein family. A direct interaction between the Pumilio RNA-binding domain and the CNOT7/Caf1 exonuclease has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Van Etten et al., 2012</xref>), but it is unknown if this is the only site of interaction on Ccr4-Not. The PRE that interacts with human PUM1 and PUM2 (UGUANAUA) is found in mRNAs encoding proteins involved in signaling pathways and neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bohn et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>Sc</italic>), there are six Pumilio proteins. Of these, <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 is most closely related to homologs in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>). The RNA motif recognized by <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 resembles that of the human PUM proteins but, additionally, cytosine is preferred in the -1 and -2 positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). The closest homolog to human PUM in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Puf3) also contains residues that define this additional selectivity pocket, and is therefore predicted to bind sequences containing an upstream cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Puf3 is a key regulator of mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lee and Tu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Saint-Georges et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with this, its mRNA targets encode proteins localized to the mitochondria and involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>; 2018). Many transcripts proposed to be regulated by <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 do not, however, show a clear link to this role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore unclear whether the function of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 is limited to mitochondrial regulation. Puf3 homologs in other organisms (including <italic>S. pombe</italic>) do not necessarily regulate mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hogan et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The nine-nucleotide ARE motif (UUAUUUAUU) was identified in unstable mRNAs encoding cytokines and lymphokines in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Caput et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen and Shyu, 1995</xref>). This sequence is recognized by tandem zinc finger (TZF) proteins including tristetraprolin (TTP). TTP attenuates immunological responses by binding directly to Ccr4-Not via the CNOT1 and CNOT9 subunits, targeting ARE-containing transcripts for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bulbrook et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fabian et al., 2013</xref>). Phosphorylation of TTP occurs as part of the p38 MAPK pathway, and this disrupts Ccr4-Not recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Marchese et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>S. pombe</italic> Zfs1 protein is homologous to TTP, and recognizes the same RNA motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cuthbertson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wells et al., 2015</xref>). An interaction between Zfs1 and Ccr4-Not has not been characterized in fission yeast and the Ccr4-Not-interacting amino acid sequences of TTP are not clearly conserved in Zfs1.</p>
<p>Understanding the molecular basis of accelerated deadenylation has been limited by the lack of a biochemical system containing purified components that reconstitutes this process. Previous studies have shown that a purified domain of the budding yeast Pumilio protein Mpt5 stimulates the activity of immunoprecipitated Ccr4-Not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goldstrohm et al., 2006</xref>), and that isolated Caf1 is stimulated by addition of purified BTG2 and PABPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stupfler et al., 2016</xref>). We recently purified the complete seven-subunit <italic>S. pombe</italic> Ccr4-Not complex after overexpression of the subunits in insect cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>). Biochemical assays revealed that this recombinant complex was substantially more active than the isolated nuclease enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Webster et al., 2018</xref>). Co-expression of the conserved subunits of Ccr4-Not with Mmi1, an RNA-binding protein found in fission yeast, generated a complex that deadenylated Mmi1-target RNAs more rapidly than non-target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we reconstitute accelerated and selective deadenylation of PRE- and ARE-containing RNAs using recombinant <italic>S. pombe</italic> proteins. We find that Puf3 and Zfs1 act as molecular tethers capable of inducing accelerated and RNA-selective deadenylation by Ccr4-Not <italic>in vitro</italic>. Biochemical and biophysical analyses of Puf3 binding to RNA reveal a high degree of sequence selectivity. Correspondingly, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RNA motif quality is a critical determinant of the RNAs stably bound by Puf3 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Collectively, our findings show that a substantially improved understanding of RNA-binding protein regulatory networks can be obtained through detailed analysis of motif quality.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Deadenylation is stimulated by Puf3 and Zfs1 <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To characterize substrate-selective deadenylation in the presence of RNA-binding proteins, we reconstituted this process using purified proteins. Full-length Zfs1 and Puf3 were expressed recombinantly as N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins, and intact recombinant seven-subunit <italic>S. pombe</italic> Ccr4-Not was purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>). Pull-down assays revealed that Puf3 and Zfs1 interact with isolated Ccr4-Not (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, like metazoan homologs, <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3 and Zfs1 bind directly to Ccr4-Not.</p>
<p>By using a short model RNA substrate, deadenylation can be visualized at single-nucleotide resolution, and can be accurately quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Webster et al., 2017</xref>). To investigate whether Puf3 and Zfs1 stimulate the deadenylation activity of Ccr4-Not <italic>in vitro</italic>, we designed model RNA substrates containing the sequence motif recognized by either Puf3 or Zfs1 (PRE UGUAAAUA, or ARE UUAUUUAUU respectively, <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 1B</xref>). These motifs were embedded within a synthetic 23-nucleotide sequence, upstream of a 30-adenosine poly(A) tail. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that Puf3 and Zfs1 bind stably to their respective target RNAs (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 1C</xref>). The 1:1 stoichiometric protein-RNA complexes formed under these conditions were used as substrates in assays measuring the deadenylation activity of Ccr4-Not.</p>
<p>Ccr4-Not removed the poly(A) tails of both Puf3 and Zfs1 substrate RNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Puf3 and Zfs1 each stimulated deadenylation of their target RNAs: In the absence of Puf3, complete removal of the poly(A) tail from PRE-containing RNA occurred in approximately 32 minutes, whereas in the presence of Puf3 the reaction was complete in less than 2 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). Therefore, addition of Puf3 increased the rate of deadenylation more than 20-fold. Zfs1 similarly increased the rate of deadenylation of its target RNA to less than 2 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). Thus, both Puf3 and Zfs1 have striking effects on the rate of deadenylation.</p>

Synthetic RNA substrates were designed to contain a 30-adenosine poly(A) tail downstream of 23 non-poly(A) ribonucleotides including the recognition elements of Puf3 (PRE) or Zfs1 (ARE). RBP-RNA complexes were prepared at a 1:1 molar ratio before the addition of Ccr4-Not. Reactions were stopped at the indicated times and analyzed by denaturing PAGE. The sizes of the RNA substrate with and without the poly(A) tail are indicated by dashed lines.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="478008v1_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Non-adenosine residues upstream of the poly(A) tail were also rapidly removed by Ccr4-Not when Puf3 or Zfs1 were present. The exonucleases stop when they reach nucleotides that correspond to the binding site of the protein, suggesting that either the RNA-binding proteins cannot be released by Ccr4-Not, or that deadenylation becomes very slow after release of the RNA binding protein. This is consistent with a model in which the specificity of Ccr4-Not for adenosine is substantially less evident when it is tethered to the RNA substrate for a prolonged period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Finoux and S&#x00E9;raphin, 2006</xref>). In addition, the deadenylation reaction appeared to be more processive in the presence of Puf3 or Zfs1 because RNA lacking a poly(A) tail was visible when RNA with an intact tail was still present in the reaction (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 1F</xref>). This indicates that the RNA-binding protein increases the stability of the interaction of Ccr4-Not with the target RNA substrate during the course of the reaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Ccr4-Not has an intrinsic RNA preference</title>
<p>In the absence of additional protein, Ccr4-Not is approximately 3-fold more active on the ARE-containing substrate than on the PRE-containing substrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 1E</xref>). It is generally believed that additional protein factors confer mRNA-selectivity to Ccr4-Not, but this finding indicates Ccr4-Not may possess a moderate degree of intrinsic mRNA selectivity. We previously observed that Ccr4-Not was less active on RNA substrates with secondary structure in the upstream 3&#x2032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>). The free energies of the predicted most stable structures calculated with RNAfold software are -1.2 kcal/mol (Puf3-target RNA) and -0.2 kcal/mol (Zfs1-target RNA). Thus, neither of the substrates tested here is predicted to form stable RNA secondary structure. Our data suggest that the rate at which different mRNAs are deadenylated <italic>in vivo</italic> may be modulated by sequence-selectivity intrinsic to the Ccr4-Not complex.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Puf3 and Zfs1 recruit Ccr4-Not via extended low-complexity sequences</title>
<p>To dissect the mechanism of accelerated deadenylation, we made a series of Puf3 and Zfs1 mutations and truncations, and tested their abilities to stimulate deadenylation. First, we tested whether the RNA-binding domains alone (Puf3<sup>PUM</sup> and Zfs1<sup>TZF</sup>, <xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 1A</xref>-B) affected deadenylation. Addition of Puf3<sup>PUM</sup> caused a modest acceleration (complete deadenylation in &#x007E;20 min compared to &#x007E;32 min; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). This is consistent with a reported interaction between the Pumilio domain and the Caf1/CNOT7 subunit of Ccr4-Not, that tethers RNA directly to the nuclease subunit to accelerate deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goldstrohm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Van Etten et al., 2012</xref>). Since stimulation by Puf3<sup>PUM</sup> was much less than with full-length Puf3, regions outside the Pumilio domain likely play an important role in the recruitment of Ccr4-Not. Interestingly, Zfs1<sup>TZF</sup> was inhibitory to deadenylation. This may be because this domain conceals sequence elements that confer the higher level of intrinsic activity on the ARE-containing RNA.</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<caption><title>Recruitment of Ccr4-Not by Puf3 and Zfs1</title>
<p>Accelerated deadenylation by RNA binding proteins requires both a low-complexity region and RNA-binding activity. (<bold>A</bold>) Deadenylation by purified Ccr4-Not in the presence of the indicated RNA-binding protein variants was analyzed by denaturing PAGE. Puf3<sup>PUM</sup> and Zfs1<sup>TZF</sup> each comprise the RNA-binding domain alone; Puf3<sup>Mut</sup>, Zfs1<sup>Mut</sup> are full-length proteins with point mutations that abolish RNA binding. Panels for no Puf3, no Zfs1, and wild-type proteins are reproduced from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. (<bold>B</bold>) The low-complexity domains of Puf3 and Zfs1 contain multiple regions that contribute to deadenylation by Ccr4-Not. The upper panel shows diagrams of Puf3 and Zfs1 with regions of predicted disorder and truncated construct lengths. The bottom panel shows deadenylation by purified Ccr4-Not in the presence of the indicated protein variants, analyzed by denaturing PAGE. The most abundant RNA size decreased linearly with time, and average reaction rates in number of adenosines removed/min were determined by linear regression on triplicate measurements.

<graphic xlink:href="478008v1_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To confirm that RNA binding is essential to the function of Puf3 and Zfs1, we generated full-length proteins with mutations in the RNA-binding interface (Puf3<sup>Mut</sup>: Y449A/Y671A and Zfs1<sup>Mut</sup>: F349A/F387A). Compared to the wild-type proteins, these mutants had a substantially reduced ability to bind their substrate RNAs, and to accelerate deadenylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 1B-E</xref>). Together, these data show that the strong stimulatory effect of Puf3 and Zfs1 depends on RNA binding, but the RNA-binding domains alone are not sufficient.</p>
<p>In addition to a C-terminal RNA-binding domain, both Puf3 and Zfs1 contain an extended N-terminal region of low amino acid sequence complexity that is predicted to be predominantly disordered (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We hypothesized that short sequence motifs within the low-complexity regions of Puf3 and Zfs1 interact with Ccr4-Not, as has been demonstrated for other interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhandari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fabian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Raisch et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we generated a series of N-terminal truncations and measured their effects on the deadenylation activity of Ccr4-Not (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 1F-G</xref>). For both proteins, no single truncation accounted for the stimulatory effect on deadenylation. Instead, as the length of low-complexity sequence was reduced, the stimulatory effect on the deadenylation rate was also reduced. It is therefore likely that multiple sequence elements, distributed throughout the low-complexity regions, interact with Ccr4-Not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Non-enzymatic subunits of Ccr4-Not contribute to the interaction with Puf3 and Zfs1</title>
<p>Two of the seven core subunits of Ccr4-Not are poly(A)-selective exonucleases, Caf1 and Ccr4. To determine whether Puf3 and Zfs1 can stimulate deadenylation in the absence of the non-enzymatic subunits, we performed reactions with a purified dimeric subcomplex comprised of Caf1 and Ccr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>). Puf3 accelerated the rate of deadenylation by Caf1-Ccr4 substantially less than it accelerated intact Ccr4-Not (2-fold and &#x003E;20-fold respectively, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> left compared to 1A). Fully-deadenylated and non-deadenylated RNA was observed simultaneously during both reactions, suggestive of a processive reaction. Furthermore, non-adenosine nucleotides were also readily removed by the Caf1-Ccr4 complex. This suggests that Puf3 interacts with Caf1-Ccr4, but association occurs more slowly when these subunits are not incorporated into the intact Ccr4-Not complex.</p>
<p>Zfs1 did not substantially affect the deadenylation activity of the Caf1-Ccr4 dimeric complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, right). Thus, our data are consistent with Puf3 and Zfs1 recruiting the Ccr4-Not complex primarily through an interaction between their low-complexity regions and the non-enzymatic subunits of Ccr4-Not.</p>

<title>Puf3 accelerates the release of Pab1</title>
<p>Poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1) contributes to translation initiation, and its release from mRNAs can repress translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Parker, 2012</xref>). Ccr4-Not efficiently releases Pab1 from the poly(A) tail through removal of the nucleotides to which it is bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Webster et al., 2018</xref>). It is not known, however, how Pab1 influences accelerated deadenylation. We therefore examined deadenylation of Pab1-bound RNA in the presence of Puf3.</p>
<p>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that stoichiometric amounts of Puf3 and Pab1 could be simultaneously loaded onto the RNA substrate (<xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 2A</xref>). In deadenylation assays, the addition of Puf3 increased the rate at which the Pab1-bound poly(A) tail was removed by &#x007E;8-fold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, Puf3 can promote release of Pab1 by accelerating deadenylation by Ccr4-Not. Still, Pab1 slows the overall rate of Puf3-accelerated deadenylation, suggesting that the rate of Pab1 release limits the very fast rate of deadenylation that occurs when Ccr4-Not is recruited by Puf3.</p>
<p>We previously reported that Caf1 and Ccr4 have similar activities within the purified Ccr4-Not complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, we showed that the presence of Pab1 differentiates the activity of Ccr4 and Caf1: only Ccr4 removes adenosines bound by Pab1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Webster et al., 2018</xref>). It is not known, however, whether Caf1 and Ccr4 are differentially active when RNA-binding proteins recruit Ccr4-Not to specific mRNAs. We tested the contribution of Ccr4 and Caf1 to Puf3-accelerated deadenylation using purified Ccr4-Not variants with point mutants that abolish the catalytic activity of either nuclease.</p>
<p>Using our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, Puf3 accelerated deadenylation by both Ccr4-inactive and Caf1-inactive complexes (<xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 2C</xref>). This indicates that deadenylation in the presence of Puf3 is mediated by either nuclease. In the presence of Puf3 and Pab1, Ccr4-inactive Ccr4-Not did not proceed beyond &#x007E;20 adenosines (<xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 2C</xref>). This is similar to when Puf3 was not present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Webster et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, Pab1, and not Puf3, differentiates the two nucleases of Ccr4-Not.</p>

<title>Puf3 and Zfs1 induce substrate-selective deadenylation by Ccr4-Not</title>
<p>Having established that Puf3 and Zfs1 are capable of accelerating Ccr4-Not activity, we sought to test whether they are also sufficient for substrate-selectivity. We began by examining whether the presence of the target motif recognized by each protein was essential for accelerated deadenylation. The effect of Puf3 and Zfs1 on its own target RNA was compared with its effect on a non-target RNA. For the latter, we used the RNA target of the other protein (Puf3 with Zfs1-target RNA, and Zfs1 with Puf3-target RNA). We were surprised to find that each protein stimulated deadenylation of an RNA that did not contain its target motif (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Quantification of deadenylation rates showed that on-target deadenylation was approximately 3&#x2212;4 fold faster than off-target deadenylation, which was in turn 2&#x2013;5 fold faster than when no additional protein was present (<xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hence, the correct target RNA motif contributes to the ability of an RNA-binding protein to accelerate deadenylation <italic>in vitro</italic>, but is not absolutely required.</p>

</fig>
<p>Since Puf3 with a mutated RNA-binding domain still stimulates deadenylation, allosteric activation of Ccr4-Not by the Puf3 low complexity region may contribute to this accelerated deadenylation of off-target RNAs (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, mutant Zfs1 that does not bind RNA doesn&#x2019;t accelerate deadenylation. Thus, allosteric activation is not likely to be a general mechanism. Instead, we hypothesized that off-target stimulation of deadenylation in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments is due to off-target RNA binding.</p>
<p>To determine the binding affinities of full-length Puf3 and Zfs1 for the RNA substrates, we performed fluorescence polarization RNA binding assays with RNAs containing the target motif of Puf3 or Zfs1, as well as 30-mer polyadenosine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Each RNA-binding protein bound to its respective target RNA sequence with high affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> &#x003D; 1&#x2212;2 nM). In contrast, Puf3 bound to the off-target ARE sequence with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 120 nM, while Zfs1 bound the off-target PRE sequence with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 850 nM. In both cases, poly(A) was bound with &#x007E;100-fold lower affinity than the target RNA. Hence, both Puf3 and Zfs1 are selective in RNA binding, with &#x003E;100-fold higher affinity for their target RNA than off-target RNAs. Still, Puf3 and Zfs1 bind off-target sequences with nanomolar affinities and this could account for their abilities to stimulate deadenylation of off-target RNAs.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that Puf3 and Zfs1 would select their targets from a mixture of target and non-target RNAs to promote targeted deadenylation. To test this, we developed a system to directly examine selective deadenylation by Ccr4-Not. Two polyadenylated RNA substrates labelled with different fluorophores were combined in stoichiometric quantities before the addition of Ccr4-Not and analysis of deadenylation activity. The same gel could therefore be used to monitor deadenylation of both the fluorescein-labelled Puf3-target substrate, and the Alexa647-labelled Zfs1-target substrate, displayed in blue and red respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In this two-color assay, the Zfs1-target RNA was deadenylated by Ccr4-Not 3-fold faster than the Puf3-target RNA in the absence of additional protein. This is consistent with intrinsic selectivity of Ccr4-Not that was observed when each RNA was examined in isolation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We then performed a series of reactions using three different concentrations of Puf3 or Zfs1, and each RNA at 100 nM. With 50 nM Puf3 or Zfs1, deadenylation was accelerated only on the target RNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, top; blue for Puf3-target and red for Zfs1-target). A fraction of the target RNA was unaffected, consistent with incomplete occupancy of the RNA-binding protein on its target. With 250 nM Puf3 or Zfs1, deadenylation of all target RNA was substantially increased while deadenylation of the non-target RNA was unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, middle). Thus, Puf3 and Zfs1 promote selective, accelerated deadenylation. Selectivity was lost when an excess of the RNA-binding protein was added (1000 nM) and all RNA was deadenylated rapidly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, bottom).</p>
<p>To examine RNA binding by Puf3 and Zfs1 under the same conditions, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Consistent with deadenylation assays, target RNA binding is complete and selective at 250 nM, but is non-selective at 1000 nM (<xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 1B</xref>). In conclusion, Puf3 and Zfs1 are sufficient for substrate-selective deadenylation by Ccr4-Not, within a given concentration window. At higher concentrations, they also bound to and accelerated deadenylation on RNAs that do not contain their target motif.</p>

<title>Puf3 distinguishes between very similar motifs</title>
<p>In the cell, RNAs with very similar sequences are present but RNA-binding proteins distinguish between these to act preferentially on specific targets. Yeasts possess multiple Pumilio proteins, and these recognize RNA motifs similar in sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>). For example, an RNA target of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>Sc</italic>) Puf3 differs from a target of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5/Mpt5 in two nucleotide positions within a core 8-nt motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goldstrohm et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, top). Given that Puf3 binds off-target RNAs at higher concentrations (<xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 1B</xref>), we investigated whether the fission yeast Puf3 distinguishes between the very similar motifs of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 and <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<p>We used fluorescence polarization experiments to examine RNA binding and found that <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3<sup>PUM</sup> binds to both the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 target and the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5 target with high affinity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom). The affinity for the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 motif is &#x007E;2-fold higher than for the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5 motif, but the binding affinity in both cases is in the picomolar range. Surprisingly, in deadenylation activity assays with 100 nM Puf3, we found that the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 target was selectively deadenylated in preference to the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5 target (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, Puf3 can distinguish between very similar RNAs and selectively target them for deadenylation by Ccr4-Not.</p>
<p>Selective deadenylation only occurred within a narrow range of Puf3 concentrations where the quantity of Puf3 protein is less than or equal to the quantity of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B, C</xref>). With less Puf3 (50 nM Puf3), not all <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target RNA was rapidly deadenylated. Conversely, when a molar excess of Puf3 was present (200 nM Puf3), both the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3- and <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5-target RNAs were deadenylated rapidly. We performed RNA EMSAs and found that the ability of Puf3 to stimulate deadenylation correlated with RNA binding: binding to <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5-target RNA occurred only when Puf3 protein was in molar excess to the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Complete and selective binding by Puf3, and selective deadenylation by Ccr4-Not, therefore only occurs within a narrow window of Puf3 protein concentration.</p>
<p>We next examined whether Puf3 can distinguish between sequences that are even more similar. Within the 8-nucleotide motif recognized by <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3, the fifth position is the most variable, and A or U are thought to be tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>). This is a property shared by the human homologs PUM1 and PUM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Galgano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Morris et al., 2008</xref>). In the previous experiments, the RNA motif contained A at position 5 (now called <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target(5A)). We tested whether there is a preference for A or U at position 5 using the two-color deadenylation assay and found that the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target(5A) RNA was deadenylated in preference to <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target(5U) RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, Puf3 has a remarkable capacity to distinguish between sequences within the current definition of its target motif. The identity of the nucleotide in position 5 likely affects &#x201C;motif quality&#x201D;, and Puf3 interacts with sequences of different quality in a priority-based manner.</p>

<title>Kinetic basis of selective RNA binding by Puf3</title>
<p>To gain insight into the selective RNA binding by Puf3 that allows it to distinguish between RNAs of very similar sequences, we analyzed the binding kinetics using SwitchSENSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Knezevic et al., 2012</xref>). Switchable nanolevers were functionalized with RNAs containing each of the three RNA motifs tested in the deadenylation reactions: <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target(5A), <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target(5U), and <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5-target. We measured the rates of association (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub>) and dissociation (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>) of fission yeast Puf3<sup>PUM</sup> binding to each of these, as well as to polyadenosine as a negative control.</p>
<p>Rates of association followed the same pattern of priority binding that we had identified by deadenylation assays and EMSA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>): Association with the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target(5A) was &#x007E;25&#x0025; faster than with <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target(5U) and &#x007E;three-fold faster than with the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5-target. Association with polyadenosine was even slower (&#x007E;seven-fold). Thus, RNA sequence affects the rate of Puf3 association. Importantly, however, all sequences were bound rapidly: at a concentration of 20 nM, binding to all RNAs took place on the timescale of seconds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, right).</p>

<p>When we examined rates of dissociation, we found that Puf3 remained bound to the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target with A at position 5 for twice as long as it remained bound to the RNA with U at position 5, and &#x007E;three times as long as it was bound to the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5-target RNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Dissociation from polyadenosine occurred more than 100-fold faster. Thus, rates of Puf3 dissociation also reflected the preference order that we had observed in deadenylation experiments. Combining our association and dissociation measurements, sequence-selective binding by Puf3 is expected to occur by the combination of rapid sampling of all RNAs with slower dissociation from sequences with higher motif quality.</p>

<title>Motif quality affects <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-bound transcripts <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>The ability of Puf3 to discriminate between similar sequences is likely to play a role in defining the mRNAs within its regulatory network. To examine the contribution of RNA motif quality to Puf3 binding <italic>in vivo</italic>, we analyzed several published studies of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Puf3. The mRNAs that contain Puf3 motifs are different between species, but we expected motif quality to be similarly important in all organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hogan et al., 2015</xref>).

<p>We compiled a list of 1331 putative <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 mRNA targets from three published sources.

A more recent study using RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq) identified 1132 significantly enriched transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>): the larger number of targets identified was attributed to the improved sensitivity of deep sequencing.

<p>We began by computationally identifying the most enriched sequence motif in the complete set of 1331 mRNAs using MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>). This had seven conserved nucleotides within an 8-nt motif (UGUANAUA), and was present in 627 mRNAs (41&#x0025; of total) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, top). The nucleotide at position 5 is variable, consistent with previous analyses of transcriptome-wide data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The best-characterized <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 binding site is within the <italic>COX17</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Olivas and Parker, 2000</xref>). This mRNA was also the most highly enriched following RNA-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, it has sequence features outside the seven core nucleotides that contribute to the particularly high affinity binding of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3: cytosine at position &#x2013;2 and adenosine at position &#x002B;5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). Having identified that fission yeast Puf3 has the capacity to distinguish between similar sequences, we hypothesized that these additional sequence features might provide a better definition of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 targets transcriptome-wide. Thus, we categorized target mRNAs by the presence of a <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target motif as well as the nucleotide identity at positions &#x2013;2 and &#x002B;5. We ranked these four groups by motif quality based on previously measured affinity values (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and Supplementary File 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). Many of the predicted <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target transcripts that do not fit into one of these four groups do not contain any of these sequences but have a motif in which one of the core seven nucleotides are altered (denoted here as &#x201C;&#x0394;core&#x201D;).</p>
<p>mRNAs that increase in steady-state abundance upon deletion of <italic>PUF3</italic> represent high-confidence targets of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-mediated mRNA decay. 82 such mRNAs were identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>), and we found that motif 1, 2 or 3 is present in 73 of these (89&#x0025;) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and Supplementary File 1). Furthermore, in 71 of the mRNAs that are increased in abundance upon <italic>PUF3</italic> deletion, the motif is located within the 3&#x2032; UTR. Hence, the quality and the location of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 motifs both contribute to mRNA-destabilization.</p>
<p>We examined whether motif quality is correlated with the amount of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 bound to mRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> and found that transcripts that were most enriched in <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>) had motif 1, 2 or 3 located in their 3&#x2032;-UTR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and Supplementary File 1). In contrast, transcripts containing a group 4 motif, or a mismatch within the core seven nucleotides, generally had less <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 bound. Interestingly, mRNAs with high quality motifs located within the coding sequence were detected but were consistently bound by less <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3. Whether this reflects a lower occupancy of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3, or a reduced stability of the interaction, is unknown. In summary, RNA sequence is an excellent predictor of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 binding <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

Furthermore, the 14 mitochondrion-specific tRNA aminoacylation enzymes, but none of the 5 that are both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic, have a high quality <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 motif. Interestingly, transcripts encoding proteins that assemble the respiratory chain complexes, but not nuclear-encoded subunits of the complexes subunits themselves, are <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 targets. Most components of the mitochondrial protein import complexes TIM22, TIM23 and TOM; mitochondrial chaperones; and membrane insertion factors are also targets. In contrast, mRNAs containing group 4 motif or &#x0394;core were not generally related to mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>Compared to previous lists of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 target candidates, analysis of motif quality yields a list of mRNA targets that is shorter and more functionally coherent (<xref rid="fig6S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6&#x2013;figure supplement 1A</xref>). To assess the limitations of predicting RNA-binding protein targets directly from mRNA sequence motif we examined <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 binding and the sequence features of transcripts that had motif 1, 2 or 3 in the 3&#x2032;-UTR but encoded proteins not evidently related to mitochondrial biogenesis (33 in total), as well as mRNAs related to mitochondrial biogenesis but with motif 4 in the 3&#x2032;-UTR (33 transcripts). These represent possible false-positives and false-negative predicted targets respectively. mRNAs with motif 1, 2 or 3 that were not related to mitochondrial biogenesis had significantly less <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 association than those that were related to mitochondria (<xref rid="fig6S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6&#x2013;figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that despite the presence of a high-quality motif, <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 binding is less enriched. Similarly, mRNAs with motif 4 that were related to mitochondrial biogenesis had higher levels of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3, suggesting that despite sequences with lower motif quality, <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 is selectively bound. Analysis of sequences surrounding the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target motif revealed no consistent differences between functional groups (<xref rid="fig6S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6&#x2013;figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, factors other than motif quality also influence <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 binding and this is correlated with encoded function.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The recruitment of enzymatic multi-protein complexes by RNA-binding adaptor proteins often facilitates post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rissland, 2017</xref>). Here, we show by biochemical reconstitution that Puf3 and Zfs1 function as molecular tethers during deadenylation, bringing together specific mRNAs and exonucleases (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Interactions between the low-complexity regions of Puf3/Zfs1 and non-enzymatic subunits of Ccr4-Not are critical to this process. Sequence-selectivity of the RNA-binding proteins largely determines the selection of target RNAs for deadenylation. Moreover, the stability of the interaction between Puf3 and RNA is exquisitely sensitive to the RNA sequence. <italic>In vivo</italic>, this plays a major role in defining the functionally coherent RNA regulatory network of Puf3 in budding yeast, and likely in other organisms.</p>

<title>Ccr4-Not recruitment by RNA-binding proteins</title>
<p>RNA-binding proteins that interact with the mRNA decay machinery typically contain a canonical RNA-binding domain, and regions of low sequence complexity that are predicted to be structurally disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2013</xref>). Short linear motifs within these regions can adopt secondary structure, and this may facilitate interaction with other proteins, including Ccr4-Not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhandari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fabian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Raisch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sgromo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>). Recent work showed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nanos utilizes two short linear motifs to contact the NOT1 and NOT3 subunits of Ccr4-Not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Raisch et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, the N- and C-terminal regions of human TTP interact with the CNOT1 and the CNOT9 subunits respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bulbrook et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fabian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lykke-Andersen and Wagner, 2005</xref>). We show that multiple regions within fission yeast Puf3 and Zfs1 contribute to Ccr4-Not recruitment, and these are distributed throughout the 300&#x2013;400 amino acid region that is predicted to be predominantly disordered. Thus, the multi-partite mode of interaction for Puf3 and Zfs1 may be a general feature of RNA-binding proteins that interact with Ccr4-Not. The <italic>in vitro</italic> deadenylation assays described here represent a powerful tool for testing the importance of particular sequence regions in interaction partners and evaluating their redundancy.</p>
<p>The Pumilio family of RNA-binding proteins appeared to represent an exception to the pattern that Ccr4-Not recruitment occurs exclusively via short linear motifs within intrinsically disordered regions. The RNA-binding Pumilio domain of human PUM1 and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Puf4 and Puf5 interacts directly with Caf1/CNOT8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goldstrohm et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, in our study the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3 PUM domain stimulated the rate of deadenylation by Ccr4-Not (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 1C</xref>), and full-length Puf3 stimulated deadenylation by a Caf1-Ccr4 subcomplex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, however, both of these effects were weak relative to the stimulation of intact Ccr4-Not by full-length Puf3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the low-complexity region of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3 and the non-enzymatic subunits of Ccr4-Not play important roles in the interaction. The Pumilio proteins are therefore likely similar to other Ccr4-Not interaction partners.</p>
<p>Intrinsically disordered regions are common sites of post-translational modification such as phosphorylation. TTP is a phosphorylation target in the p38 MAPK pathway, and this disrupts the recruitment of Ccr4-Not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Marchese et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, phosphorylation occurs throughout the low-complexity region of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Puf3, and this stops the rapid decay of transcripts to which it is bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lee and Tu, 2015</xref>). Given that the low-complexity region is involved in the recruitment of Ccr4-Not, it is likely that phosphorylation regulates this interaction. Rates of mRNA decay may be tuned by the extent of phosphorylation within the extended interface that contacts Ccr4-Not.</p>

<title>A priority model of selective RNA binding</title>
<p>The correct recognition of mRNA targets by RNA-binding proteins is critical for recruitment of effector complexes, such as Ccr4-Not. We found that Puf3 and Zfs1 stimulate deadenylation of off-target RNAs, but they can discriminate between mixtures of RNA substrates to select their target. Titration of Puf3 under conditions where two similar RNA sequences were present showed that binding of RNA occurs by a model of priority: Puf3 binds to an optimal target when it is available, but after saturation of all available sites, it will readily associate with a sub-optimal target (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This model of RNA target selection, where an RNA-binding protein has a distribution of affinities for different RNA sequences, challenges the model where there is a sharp distinction between affinities for specific and non-specific RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jankowsky and Harris, 2015</xref>). The relative abundance of RNA-binding proteins and RNA therefore determines occupancy, and is integral to the definition of the target motif.</p>
<p>We propose that tight control of RNA-binding protein abundance in the cell is essential for maintenance of a stable set of target mRNAs. Interestingly, the mRNA encoding Puf3 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is itself a target of Puf3 (Supplementary File 1). This predicts a potential feedback mechanism by which <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 protein abundance is auto-regulated. Furthermore, the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-recognition motif within the <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 mRNA is within group 4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) and this is at the boundary that separates targets from non-targets. The <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 mRNA may only become destabilized when <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 protein abundance becomes high enough that it begins to destabilize mRNAs containing motifs of lower quality that are not related to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>
<p>Increasing the level of human PUM1 by overexpression causes a number of mRNAs to be repressed, indicative of off-target RNA binding, and PUM1 availability may be regulated by a long noncoding RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tichon et al., 2018</xref>). In mice, PUM1 is expressed constitutively, but heterozygotes that contain only a single gene copy display reduced PUM1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gennarino et al., 2015</xref>). This haploinsufficiency produces severely impaired neuronal function that is due, at least in part, to impaired destabilization of the <italic>ATAXIN1</italic> mRNA. Thus, consistent with our model of RNA binding, the dosage of RNA-binding proteins is also important to maintain on-target mRNA expression.</p>

<title>Identification of mRNA targets of RNA-binding proteins</title>
<p>Even when the consensus motif recognized by an RNA-binding protein is known, it is often difficult to predict which transcripts are targeted by that protein <italic>in vivo</italic>: A high affinity interaction is not sufficient for the sequence to be a preferred target, as is exemplified by the tight binding of fission yeast Puf3 to the RNA motif recognized by <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Our kinetic analysis of Puf3 binding to RNA revealed a fast rate of association with RNA that does not contain the optimal sequence motif. We conclude that Puf3-RNA dissociation rates are likely major contributors to the rates of deadenylation.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, Puf3 likely samples numerous mRNAs before remaining stably associated with an mRNA containing an optimal sequence motif. An important consequence of this is that RNA-immunoprecipitation (and especially use of covalent crosslinking) will detect mRNAs that are not genuine targets. An indication of <italic>in vivo</italic> dissociation rates of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 were previously obtained using RNA tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>). In this method, an enzyme that adds uridines to the 3&#x2032; end of RNA is attached to the RNA-binding protein of interest. The length of the U-tail on an mRNA correlated with whether the mRNAs are regulated by <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 in the cell and is also expected to correlate with the duration the RNA-binding protein is associated with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>). This study differentiated between Puf3 &#x2018;sampling&#x2019; of RNAs where the U-tails were short and the off-rate was too fast to allow regulation (deadenylation), and Puf3 &#x2018;regulation&#x2019; where the U-tails were longer, the off-rate is slower, and the interaction leads to a productive output (deadenylation). In addition to cellular concentration of RNA binding proteins and their targets, competition among RNA binding proteins with similar sequence preferences will also influence this kinetic model for productive interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lapointe et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, there is a striking convergence between the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> (this study) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>) studies. Our analysis also correlates well with a more recent study that combined multiple methods to identify 91 Puf3 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lapointe et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>A major limitation in all experimental approaches is that the threshold separating genuine from non-genuine targets is difficult to define. Our analysis of the mRNA targets of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Puf3 demonstrates, however, that accurate prediction may be possible from examination of the 3&#x2032;-UTR sequence. If, as our data suggests, the function of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Puf3 is limited to mitochondrial biogenesis, &#x007E;88&#x0025; of mRNAs with a high-quality motif are genuine targets. The workflow we have used should therefore be informative in defining the regulatory network of other RNA-binding proteins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>How specific mRNAs can be rapidly and specifically targeted for degradation in response to cellular signals remains a major question in understanding eukaryotic gene expression. Our priority model for RNA binding to an adapter protein that acts as a tether to the deadenylation machinery provides new mechanistic insight and brings us closer to being able to predict RNA stability from sequence.</p>

<p>Intact Ccr4-Not complex was purified as described previously after overexpression of the seven core subunits of the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> complex (Ccr4, Caf1, Not1, Not2, Not3, Not4/Mot2 and Rcd1/Caf40) in <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>DNA sequences encoding full-length <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3 and Zfs1 were synthesized with codon optimization for <italic>E. coli</italic> (GenScript). Primers Puf3_Fwd and RBP_Rev were used to amplify the Puf3 sequence, and primers Zfs1_Fwd and RBP_Rev were used to amplify the Zfs1 sequence (Supplementary File 3). DNA was inserted into pMAL-c2X expression vector using an In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech). DNA encoding variants with N-terminal truncations were amplified using primers Puf3_res{63, 125, 181, 240, 300, 378}_Fwd and RBP_Rev for Puf3 and Zfs1_res{34, 71, 182, 248, 322}_Fwd and RBP_Rev for Zfs1. These were also inserted into pMAL-c2X. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a Quikchange Lightning Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) to generate mutations in the Puf3 RNA-binding domain (Puf3<sup>Mut</sup>: Y449A/Y671A) and the Zfs1 RNA-binding domain (Zfs1<sup>Mut</sup>: F349A/F387A). Primers used to introduce mutations (Puf3_Quikchange and Zfs1_Quikchange) are listed in Supplementary File 3. Sequences of all expression vectors were confirmed by Sanger sequencing with primers pMAL_Seq_Fwd and pMAL_Seq_Rev.</p>
<p>Puf3 and Zfs1 were expressed as N-terminal MBP fusions in BL21 Star (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transformed cells were grown at 37 &#x00B0;C to an A<sub>600</sub> nm of 0.6 before the temperature was reduced to 18 &#x00B0;C and protein expression induced by the addition of IPTG to 0.5 mM. Growth was continued for 18 h before cells were harvested by centrifugation and flash frozen for storage at -80 &#x00B0;C. Cells were defrosted and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and DNase I (5 &#x00B5;g/ml) (Sigma). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 &#x00D7; g for 30 min at 4 &#x00B0;C. Supernatant was applied to amylose affinity resin (1 ml bed volume per 2 l culture; New England Biolabs), and incubated with rotation for 1 hour at 4 &#x00B0;C. Resin was separated from lysate with an Econo-Column (Bio-Rad) and washed three times with 50 ml of RBP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP). Protein was eluted from the resin with RBP buffer supplemented with 50 mM maltose. Sample was loaded onto a HiTrap Q HP 5-ml column (GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted with a gradient of 20 column volumes into RBP buffer containing 1 M NaCl. Protein in the elution peak was concentrated to 0.5 ml with an Amicon Ultra concentrator (4 ml, 50 kDa MWCO, Millipore) by centrifugation at 3000 &#x00D7; g at 4 &#x00B0;C. Sample was then applied to a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in RBP buffer. The column was run at 0.5 ml/min at 4 &#x00B0;C. Full-length protein eluted at 10&#x2013;13 ml, typically together with smaller protein species identified by tandem mass spectrometry to be truncated protein lacking C-terminal residues. The sample was applied to a HiTrap Heparin HP 5 ml column (GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted with a gradient of 20 column volumes into RBP buffer containing 1 M NaCl. Full-length protein eluted at &#x007E;250 mM NaCl, while shorter fragments eluted at 100&#x2013;200 mM NaCl.

<p>The RNA-binding PUM domain of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Puf3 was defined as residues 378&#x2013;714, while the RNA-binding TZF domain of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Zfs1 was defined as residues 699&#x2013;769. DNA sequences encoding the RNA-binding domains of Puf3 (Puf3<sup>PUM</sup>) and Zfs1 (Zfs1<sup>TZF</sup>) were amplified from vectors encoding full-length proteins using primers Puf3_PUM_Fwd and Puf3_PUM_Rev or Zfs1_TZF_Fwd and Zfs1_TZF_Rev (Supplementary File 3). These were inserted into pGEX-6P-2 expression vector using an In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech). Puf3<sup>PUM</sup> and Zfs1<sup>TZF</sup> were expressed as N-terminal GST fusions in BL21 Star (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Expression and cell lysis were performed as described for full-length MBP-Puf3 and MBP-Zfs1. Clarified lysate was applied to glutathione sepharose 4B affinity resin (1 ml bed volume per 2 l culture; New England Biolabs), and incubated with rotation for 1 hour at 4 &#x00B0;C. Resin was separated from lysate with an Econo-Column (Bio-Rad) and washed three times with 50 ml of RBP buffer. Protein was eluted from the resin in 20 ml of glutathione elution buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP, 50 mM glutathione). The GST tag was cleaved by incubation with 1 mg of 3C protease for 16 h at 4 &#x00B0;C. Cleaved protein was buffer-exchanged into 20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP with a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). The sample was applied to a Mono S 5/50 GL cation-exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted over 20 column volumes into buffer supplemented to 1 M NaCl.

Error bars indicate the standard error in three replicate measurements. Association rate (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub>) was calculated by linear regression analysis of the protein concentration series.</p>
<p>For analysis of dissociation rate, 20 nM Puf3<sup>PUM</sup> was loaded onto RNA as described above. Binding buffer was then flowed across the chip at 20 &#x00B0;C with a flow rate of 30 &#x00B5;l/min. Data points from dissociation experiments with <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3-target and <italic>Sc</italic>Puf5-target RNAs were averaged in 10 sec intervals to improve the signal-to-noise. Dissociation rates (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>) were estimated by fitting of an exponential function with <italic>GraphPad Prism 6</italic>.</p>

<title>Bioinformatic analysis of <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 mRNA targets</title>
<p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mRNAs that are candidates for Puf3 regulation were collated from published sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kershaw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lapointe et al., 2015</xref>). Proportional Venn diagram of gene overlap was generated with Biovenn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hulsen et al., 2008</xref>) and redrawn for publication. 3&#x2032;-UTR sequences were defined using poly(A) sites previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ozsolak et al., 2010</xref>). The most statistically enriched RNA motif from the combined set of 1331 mRNAs was identified with MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>). Analysis of sequence context around the target motifs (10 nucleotides in each direction) was performed with WebLogo 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Crooks et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Motifs were identified in mRNA sequences with <italic>Geneious</italic> v 7.0.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kearse et al., 2012</xref>) with the following general expressions: motif 1 (CNUGUAAAUA), motif 2 (CNUGUANAUA), motif 3 (UGUAAAUA) and motif 4 (UGUAAAUA). Sequences within motif category 1 are by definition within 2, 3 and 4. Once it was evident that mRNAs with motif 1 were significantly enriched in <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 relative to the remainder of mRNAs in categories 2, 3 and 4, they were assigned to a distinct category. No significant differences in <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 enrichment were detected between mRNAs with other permutations not presented (-2: A, U or G; -1 any nucleotide; &#x002B;5 C, G or U). For this reason, these sequences were treated as equivalent and the mRNAs containing them analyzed as a group. We do not exclude the possibility that differences in <italic>Sc</italic>Puf3 binding exist because statistically evaluation is limited to the number of endogenous genes containing each permutation. Motifs were assigned to the category 3&#x2032;-UTR if at least part of the motif contained nucleotides 3&#x2032; of the coding sequence (including the stop codon). Statistical significance was evaluated with a Mann-Whitney rank comparison test in GraphPad Prism.</p>
<p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed with PANTHER over-representation test using the dataset released on 2018-02-02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mi et al., 2017</xref>). Comprehensive GO term analysis of significant over-representation is available in Supplementary File 2. Detailed analysis of individual gene function was performed with the Saccharomyces Genome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org">http://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>) and the references contained therein.</p>
