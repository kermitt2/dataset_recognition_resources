<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Plants with purple abaxial leaf surfaces are very common in nature but the ecophysiological aspects of this phenotype are not well known. We have shown that the purple color of the abaxial surfaces generates an interesting contrast between the color of the stomata arranged on the epidermis, generally green, and the purple color of the pavement. This contrast makes the stomata completely visible to optic microscopy of the extant plants. This phenomenon made possible the proposition of a strategy to measure the distance between the stomata of the layer. The measurement of the distance between stomata generates accurate information of the distribution of stomata on the epidermis of living purple plants. In future ecophysiological inferences will be established from the information brought about by the measurements of the distance between stomata in purple plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A purple coloration of lower abaxial leaf surfaces is commonly observed in deeply-shaded understorey plants, especially in the tropics. However, the functional significance to pigmentation, including its role in photosynthetic adaptation, remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The pigments responsible for the coloring are known by anthocyanins, it can be found in plant species across a broad range of habitats, especially common in understoreyplants of the tropics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] The leaf coloration of the abaxial surface may be transient or permanent depending of environmental conditions and plant species, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Although the distribution of abaxial coloration among tropical taxa are widespread, it is not known the physiological significance of this phenotype. Some studies regarding the ecophysiological relationships involved in the foliar anthocyanin in upper adaxial surface have demonstrated that pigmentation play a rule in light-attenuation, protecting underlying cells from photoinhibition through the absorption of high energy blue-green wavelengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Photoprotection have also been implicated in the physiological rules played by anthocyanins in plants in which exposed abaxial leaf surfaces are vulnerable to high-incident light. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] Some studies have observed that the purple abaxial leaf surfaces appeared to reflect more red light than green surfaces. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. This observation induces the hypothesis that anthocyanin pigments may function to reflect adaxially-transmitted red light back into the mesophyll, in order to capture red photons in environments where light is limiting. This hypothesis is known as back-scatter propagation, it has not yet received a complete experimental validation but could explain the color of leaves in understorey plants. It is known that the abaxial surface of leaves some species of purple plants presents a high concentration of green stomatal cells which generates an interesting contrast between the color of the floor of the epidermis (purple) and the stomata (green), making this cells completely visible in studies of density and distribution pattern on the leave epidermis. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] The stomatic density varies according to the environmental light exposure. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], then the color of the epidermis may also influence the distribution of stomata. In the current study we evaluate measures of distance between stomata at epidermis of purple plants as a derived parameter of stomatic density, through a automated method. Moreover we describe the variation of this parameter in 6 species of known purple plants: <italic>Tradescantia pallida, Tradescantia zebrina, Tradescantia minima, Callisia repens, Ctenante oppenheimiana Oxalis atropurpurea</italic>. Moreove the whole plant and microscopic images of 6 different types of Brazilian purple plants of species not known or not described in this work, are also provided for future studies.</p>

<title>Plant material</title>
<p>Purple plants of species not known had their collection sites referenced and a photograph of the whole plant was collected. The leaves of each plant were analyzed by optical microscopy. The unknown purple plants were named with the codes USP1, USP2, USP3, USP4, USP5, USP6 for proper assignment. Cuttings of 0.5 <italic>cm</italic><sup>2</sup> of the leaves of each plant were put in slides, with the abaxial surface facing up, covered with water, over covered with coverslips, and submitted to optic microscopy at microscope Axio-Lab A1-Zeiss at magnifications 50&#x00D7; and 100&#x00D7;.</p>

<title>Stomata morphometry</title>
<p>The stomata from a microscopic image of the abaxial surface from a purple leaf is manually assigned. The geometric center of each stomata is determined by an algorithm written in the matlab language, from which the cartesian coordinates of the centroid pixel (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) of each point are obtained. The distance between each pair of points in the image is given by the equation below:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="294553_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where d is the measure of the distance between two stomatal centroids (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) and (<italic>x</italic>(<italic>i</italic> &#x002B; 1),<italic>y</italic>(<italic>j</italic> &#x002B; 1)). An array of distances between stomata of a generic image is then defined as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Fully visible stomata contrasting with the purple epidermis were also found in 12 other species of plants with purple abaxial leaf, investigated in this work of which 6 are of known species. Microscopic and whole plant images for the 6 unknown species are available at [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>

<p>The microscopic magnification values used to collect the images of the <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, give the dimension of the size of the stomata in the studied species. For example, the length of the stomata from <italic>Tradescantia pallida</italic>, the largest among all the plants studied, is on the order of more than 10 times the stomata of the plant <italic>Oxalis atropurpurea</italic>, the smallest.</p>
<p>Although all plants have the pavement color contrasting with the color of the stomata, the color of the abaxial face has plasticity, especially in the species <italic>Oxalis atropurpurea</italic> and <italic>Tradescantia minima</italic> in which they varied from green to purple according to environmental variations (Data not shown).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<label>1.1</label><title>Morphometrics</title>
<p>It is noted that depending on the species and environmental condition, the size of the stomata may range from 10 to 100 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>M in length and occur at densities ranging from 5 to 1000 stomata per <italic>mm</italic><sup>2</sup>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] In spite of this great variability, there is a general tendency in the relationship between stomatal density and stomata size for different plants, usually plants with high stomatal density, presenting small stomata and vice versa. Many studies have reported the inverse relationship between leaf stomata density and stomatal cell area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. We found the same relationship for the 6 species studied in this paper. The graph shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> quantifies the measurements.</p>

<p>The observation of the microscopic images from purple abaxial leaves, make full the observation of stomata in extant purple plants and generates the spatial inference that the distances between stomata vary in relation to their densities. The distance measurements of neighbor stomata quantify how the plasticity of the leaf can be measured from the distribution of these cells in the epidermis. The measurements of the mean distances between neighboring stomata relative to the stomatal densities can be evidenced in the graphs of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, which show the dispersion of the density values as a function of the mean distance between the stomata neighbors for the six species of purple plants.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="294553_fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The results shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> indicate that the mean distances between neighboring stomata are inversely proportional to their stomatic densities and vary linearly therefrom in each species independently. These measurements are, therefore, direct evidence of plasticity as regards the variation of stomata distribution on leaf epidermis. When transposing the mean values of the measurements indicated in the graphs shown above, for a single graph that quantifies the relation distance &#x00D7; density between plant species, it can be observed a tendency of geometric decay of distances between stomata with respect to density. The graph showing this trend is shown in the <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig6" position="float" fig-type="figure">

The error bars indicate the standard deviation of the measurements in relation to the mean values of distances between stomata and stomatal densities by species. (N &#x003D; 5 plants per species, 3 images per plant).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="294553_fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>It can be inferred from the graph of <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> that the distance between stomata decays geometrically with the increase in stomatal density in plants of different species, the same trend to that shown for the density area of the stomata seen earlier in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. This trend probably applies to any set of plants of different species with significant differences in mean stomatal densities.</p>
<p>The measures of distance between stomata have been little used as criterion of estimation of phenotypic plasticity in plants. The results shown here indicate that this measure quantifies the dispersion of the stomata and precisely measures its distribution on the leaf. Plants with a purple abaxial surface exhibit a natural color contrast with stomata, which are usually green due to the large amount of chlorophyll and chloroplasts present within the guard cell. Therefore the measurement of distance between stomata in purple abaxial surface plants, seems to be a powerful strategy for observation of changes in the physiology of plants, generated by changes in the environment. Thus ecophysiological aspects in plants will be approached more accurately from the estimation in distribution of stomata on the leaves. It is known that the stomata feel the environmental changes, being natural sensors of the plant the conditions of the environment, at the same time that they are responsible for the climate change. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] However, it is not known exactly how the great amount of physical-chemical factors of the environment alters the distribution of stomata.</p>
<p>Thus the strategy of stomata morphometry in purple plants, shown in this paper, may provide valuable answers to the understanding of how plants respond to climate change.</p>
