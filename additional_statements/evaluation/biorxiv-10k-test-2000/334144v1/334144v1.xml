<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Algal blooms in lakes are often associated with anthropogenic eutrophication; however, they can occur naturally. In Spring of 2016 Mono Lake, a hyperalkaline lake in California, was near the height of a rare bloom of the algae Picocystis strain ML and at the apex of a multi-year long drought. These conditions presented a unique sampling opportunity to investigate microbiological dynamics during an intense natural bloom. We conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis along a depth transect near the center of the lake from surface to 25 m depth during June 2016. Across sampled depths, rRNA gene sequencing revealed that Picocystis associated chloroplast were found at 40-50 &#x0025; relative abundance, greater than values recorded previously. Despite the presence of the photosynthetic oxygenic algal genus Picocystis, oxygen declined below detectible limits below 15 m depth, corresponding with an increase in microorganisms known to be anaerobic. In contrast to previously sampled years, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data suggested a loss of sulfate reducing microorganisms throughout the lake&#x2019;s water column. Gene transcripts associated with Photosystem I and II were expressed at both 2 m and 25 m, suggesting that limited oxygen production may occur at extremely low light levels at depth within the lake. Oxygenic photosynthesis under low light conditions, in the absence of potential grazing by the brine shrimp Artemia, may allow for a cryptic redox cycle to occur in an otherwise anoxic setting at depth in the lake with the following effects: enhanced productivity, reduced grazing pressure on Picocystis, and an exacerbation of bloom.</p>

<title>IMPORTANCE</title>
<p>Mono Lake, California provides habitat to a unique ecological community that is heavily stressed due to recent human water diversions and a period of extended drought. To date, no baseline information exists about Mono Lake to understand how the microbial community responds to drought, bloom, and what genetic functions are lost in the water column. While previously identified anaerobic members of the microbial community disappear from the water column during drought and bloom, sediment samples suggest these microorganisms seek refuge at lake bottom or in the subsurface. Thus, the sediments may represent a type of seed bank which could restore the microbial community as a bloom subsides. Our work also sheds light on the activity of the halotolerant algae Picocystis strain ML during a bloom at Mono Lake, its ability to potentially produce oxygen via photosynthesis even under extreme low-light conditions, and how the remainder of the microbial community responds.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mono Lake is a large hypersaline alkaline lake with a maximum depth of &#x2248; 50 m in the Mono Basin near the eastern foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). It formed from the remnant of Paleolake Russell (a Pleistocene glacial lake) and has existed as a closed basin for at least 50,000 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Diversion of tributary streams to Mono Lake by the city of Los Angeles began in 1941, and resulted in a drop of over 13 m in lake level by 1978 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) with a corresponding increase in water salinity from 48 g/L to 81 g/L by the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) and a current alkalinity of 30,400 ppm HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The steep decline in lake level also resulted in increasing concentrations of other solutes (including arsenic), resulting in unusual lake geochemistry and a the absence of large macrofauna (e.g., fish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Mono Lake is home to a photosynthetic eukaryotic algae, <italic>Picocystis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) that is the primary food source of a brine shrimp endemic to the lake, <italic>Artemia monica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In turn, <italic>Artemia</italic> is a crucial food source for birds along the North American Pacific Flyway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) where Mono Lake&#x2019;s microbial / eukaryotic ecosystem serves a unique, multi-compartment, interlinked ecosystem role.</p>

<p>Beyond the visible macrofauna that overfly and nest at Mono Lake, the water and sediment both contain high concentrations of arsenic that have made the lake a prime location to study arsenic cycling in a natural setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Populations of <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> from the family Helicobacteraceae, capable of phototrophic arsenate reduction, are commonly found within Mono Lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Recently, genes associated with sulfate reduction were identified below the oxycline (&#x2248; 15 m) in Mono Lake while the lake was meromictic (i.e., stratified) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Prior to 2017, microbial community surveys of the lake during meromixis were only carried out using 16S rRNA gene clone library sequencing or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Clone library sequencing using dideoxy chain terminator sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) is limited by sequencing coverage, and recent work using 454 Pyrosequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) at Mono Lake provided additional diversity information for the lake during the onset of meromixis. However, the PCR primers chosen for previous high-throughput and clone library based amplicon surveys at Mono Lake were potentially biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and more recent primers for Illumina based amplicon sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) could provide a more accurate representation of lake microbial community. Furthermore, community distribution and profiling within Mono Lake during monomixis, or mixing of lake waters during a single time in a year, has yet to occur. Transcriptional profiling was recently carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) with the same samples sequenced for rRNA gene analyses in another recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) that describes the microbial activity from surface to below the oxycline at Mono Lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). A thorough description of the eukaryote responsible for much of the primary productivity in Mono Lake however, remains lacking from recent research. Such description for how, for example, the algae responsible for this primary productivity, <italic>Picocystis strain ML,</italic> is distributed within Mono Lake during a bloom and its impact on the ecophysiology of the lake is of crucial importance to ensure that a critical food source for migratory macrofauna is not lost.</p>
<p><italic>Picocystis</italic> is a genus of phototrophic algae, previously characterized in other saline or alkaline environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). <italic>Picocystis</italic> strain ML identified in Mono Lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), is a near relative of <italic>Picocystis salinarium</italic>, isolated from the San Francisco Salt Works in a high-salinity (&#x223C; 85 &#x2030;) pond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In addition to <italic>P. salinarium,</italic> other near relatives have been identified from hypersaline environments in inner Mongolia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). <italic>Picocystis</italic> strain ML at Mono Lake is responsible for 100 mmol C m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> d<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of the primary productivity in the lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Although <italic>Picocystis</italic> is nitrogen limited, if sufficient concentrations of ammonia are present during lake mixing and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), a bloom can occur often coinciding with periods of lake anoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). It is also unknown, but possible that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) may be a N source utilized by this eukaryote. The population density of <italic>Picocystis</italic> varies throughout the year, often reaching a maximum in early spring before falling as <italic>Artemia</italic> graze on them, reproduce and greatly reduce their number as measured by cell count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). A possible key strategy for survival is that <italic>Picocystis</italic> strain ML is adapted to low-light conditions and anoxia near the bottom of Mono Lake, which prevents overgrazing by <italic>Artemia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), or population decline when overgrowth reduces light transmission. Elevated concentrations of chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> and <italic>Picocystis</italic> are commonly detected below the oxycline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Yet, it is unknown if <italic>Picocystis</italic> is actively producing photosynthetic pigments and photosynthesizing under low-light conditions <italic>in situ</italic>, at depth. If <italic>Picocystis</italic> is capable of phototrophic growth below the oxycline, localized production of oxygen may disrupt localized anaerobic microbial communities in the bottom waters of Mono Lake. During a recent study, sulfate reducing microorganisms were identified alongside strictly anaerobic Clostridia at a depth of 15 m below the oxycline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), yet conditions may not be conducive for anaerobic microbial sulfate reduction during a bloom of phototrophic algae that produce&#x2019;s oxygen throughout the water column.</p>
<p>Mono Lake entered into a period of monomixis in 2012 corresponding to the onset of a near-record drought in the Eastern Sierra, resulting in a subsequent bloom of <italic>Picocystis</italic> in 2013 that failed to subside over the subsequent three years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and corresponded with a near record low of <italic>Artemia</italic> present within the lake in 2015. Lake clarity was at near-record lows and measured chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> concentrations were high in 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Here, we describe the effects of an algal bloom during a period of intense drought within Mono Lake during the summer of 2016 on the distribution and abundance of the bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic planktonic microbial community and compare this to previously sampled years within the lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The possibility that the microbial community within Mono Lake could be re-populated by the sediment, groundwater, and streams that feed Mono Lake is also addressed. Finally, we determined if <italic>Picocystis</italic> strain ML is transcriptionally active under extremely low light levels in the lake.</p>

<title>Major Ion Chemistry and Microbial rRNA Gene Copy Number within Mono Lake</title>
<p>At depths between 5 and 15 m, the water temperature decreased from &#x2248;15 to &#x2248;7 &#x02DA;C. Dissolved oxygen and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) declined rapidly within the first 10 m, yet, fluorescence was above detectable limits throughout the sampled depths (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Microbial density estimated by bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene copy number varied by less than 10&#x0025; from 2 to 25 m. In contrast, a eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene copy number maximum was present at 20 and 25 m (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Major anions including sodium (Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) were consistent, and near previously reported values (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Only minimal differences in anion or cation concentrations were detected within Mono Lake. Nitrate, nitrite, and sulfate were elevated at 10 m relative to 2, 20, and 25 m. No phosphate was detectable by ion chromatography (IC) from 2 to 25 m within Mono Lake, though surface water taken near shore had an average value of 0.02 mM (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Total dissolved phosphorus (potentially including phosphate and organophosphorus) measured by ICP-AES ranged from 0.59 to 0.63 mM (&#x00B1;0.08 mM) from surface to 25 m depth, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Most major anions and cations, and dissolved inorganic carbon, were below detectable limits in the sampled stream water and well water, with the exception of calcium which was elevated relative to Mono Lake water samples (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).Individual replicate results for ICP-AES and IC are shown in supplemental table S1.</p>

<title>Bacterial and Eukaryotic Microbial Community of Mono Lake, Sediment, and Surrounding Streams</title>
<p>After quality control a total of 694,948 DNA sequence reads were obtained, clustering into 831 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Additional summary statistics are found in Supplementary Table S2. Chloroplast sequences were abundant across all lake water samples and were removed from further analysis. The bacterial and archaeal community differed in structure above and below the oxycline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Samples taken from sediment at 10 m depth near the water sampling site also were distinct in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic community structure from those in the sampled water column. Two OTUs most closely related to genera within the order Bacteroidetes decreased in relative abundance steadily with depth: <italic>Psychroflexus</italic> and ML602M-17, whereas unclassified Bacteroidetes remained relatively constant in abundance throughout the water column (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). An OTU most closely related to the genus <italic>Thioalkalivibrio</italic> increased in abundance as depth increased. Unique to the sediment were the Euryarchaeota and the bacterial genus <italic>Desulfonatroibacter</italic>. An increase in the relative abundance of chloroplast sequence was noted at 20 m, increasing from 39.7 at the surface to 48.4 at 10 m, and then to 61.9 percent relative abundance at 20 m (Supplemental Figure S1). Well water taken to compare to lakewater samples contained an abundant population of OTUs most closely related to sulfur oxidizing Proteobacteria including <italic>Thiothrix</italic> and <italic>Thiobacillus,</italic> as well as Actinobacteria (<italic>Rhodococcus</italic>), and an abundant unclassified OTU within the Hydrogenophilaceae. Mono Lake influent stream water samples collected and examined from Rush, Mill, Lee Vining, and Wilson were distinct from samples taken from the lake itself, with the Flavobacteria, <italic>Sediminibacterium</italic>, and the hgcI clade of the Actinobacteria being the most abundant OTUs across all stream samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Mill was an outlier to other stream water samples, lacking abundant populations of Actinobacteria (candidatus <italic>Planktophila</italic>, and hgcI clade) and a lower abundance of the <italic>Sediminibacterium</italic> relative to Lee Vining, Rush, and Wilson streams. Community membership and distribution in the lake water column profile samples were significantly influenced (p = 0.002, R<sup>2</sup>= 0.90) by depth and the transition to anoxia visualized by weighted UniFrac PCoA ordination and a corresponding ADONIS test (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>).</p>

<p>Compared to the observed bacterial and archaeal community, the eukaryotic community contained far fewer OTUs. Within the water column at Mono Lake, an almost homogenous distribution of OTUs most closely related to the genus <italic>Picocystis</italic> was observed at all depths,with a maximum of to 97.9&#x0025; relative abundance at 10 m depth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>) during the sampled bloom event of 2016. Within the sediment, an OTU of unclassified Branchiopoda was most abundant, comprising 90.9&#x0025; of all sediment eukaryotic sequence. BLAST results of this OTU suggest it is most likely <italic>Artemia monica,</italic> endemic to Mono Lake, although because of the short sequence read length of 250 bp the identification is ambiguous. Influent stream water samples were distinct from the water and sediment of Mono Lake, with few overlapping OTUs among the samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). Specifically, multiple OTUs most closely related to the Ochrophyta (Heterokont algae), Ciliophora, and Chytridiomycota were unevenly distributed across the stream and well water sampled. Community membership and distribution within the water column at Mono Lake was significantly influenced (0.017, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.61) by depth and the transition to anoxia visualized by weighted UniFrac PCoA ordination and a corresponding ADONIS test, although less significantly than the bacteria and archaeal community (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>).</p>

<title>Metagenomic and Transcriptomic Profiling of Mono Lake and Sediments</title>
<p>A summary of assembly statistics for sediment and water samples are available in Table S3. The abundance of sulfate (&#x003E; 100 mM) and the lack of oxygen beg the question of whether active sulfate reduction is occurring in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) rich waters of Mono Lake. No sulfite oxidase genes (<italic>sox</italic>) were identified, however genes for the complete reduction of sulfate to sulfide were identified in the sediment metagenome, and genes for reverse-dissimilatory sulfite reductases (<italic>dsrA</italic>) were identified in water metagenomes. No true reductive <italic>dsrA</italic> genes were identified in the water metagenomes. Dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes within the sediment metagenome had high (&#x003E; 80 &#x0025;) homology to known Deltaproteobacterial sulfate reducing microorganisms. Reductive <italic>dsrA/B</italic> genes were identified within the water column, identified putatively via BLAST that most closely related to known <italic>Thioalkalivibrio dsrA/B</italic> genes. Sulfite reductase genes did not appear to be expressed within the metatranscriptome (Table S4). Nitrate and nitrite reductases were found at 20, 25 m and within the sediment, while nitric oxide reductase (<italic>nor</italic>) was only identified within the sediment (Table S3). Genes associated with nitrogen fixation, including <italic>nifH</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, and <italic>K</italic> were found at 20 m within the water, and within the sediment metagenome. No genes associated with ammonium oxidation by bacteria or archaea (AOB/AOA) were identified. Formate-dependent nitrite reductases were identified as both genes and transcripts (Supplemental Table S4).

<title>Metagenome Assembled Genomes of Mono Lake and Sediment</title>
<p>After refinement binning, a metagenomic analysis identified 80 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of varying completion and contamination (Supplementary Table S3). Of the 80 identified MAGs, 38 were greater than 50 percent complete, and less than 10 percent contaminated with other DNA sequence. A subset of XX of these MAGs contained rRNA gene sequence, and a putative identification was produced from these data (Supplemental figure S2). Like the rRNA gene sequencing data, MAGs indicate that microbial community composition shifted by depth and correlated to the decline in oxygen at 10 m (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). A large number of MAGs were unique to the sediment, including a Euryarchaeon (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). No archaea were found in abundance throughout the sampled water column. However, no genes associated with the production of methane were identified. Multiple MAGs were recovered from uncultivated orders within the Actinobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes (Table S3) including MAGs with 16S rRNA gene sequence previously identified by rRNA gene clone library sequencing at Mono Lake such as ML602J-51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). A summary of each genome is available in Supplementary Table S3, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>. No MAGs were identified with the genes required for sulfate reduction, with only reverse-dsr genes found in MAGs. Nitrogen fixation genes (<italic>nifH</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, and <italic>K</italic>) were identified within 3 MAGs, two within the Gammaproteobacteria (Bin 10 and 23), as well as a single unclassified bin (Bin_11_2). One bin (Bin 45) contained photosystem II associated genes, identified within the Epsilonproteobacteria (Table S3, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Three MAGs were identified in the EukRep filtered metagenomic sequence. A single MAG was identified with 18S rRNA gene sequence closely related to that of <italic>Picocystis</italic> strain ML (Supplemental Figure S2). However, this MAG appears to be contaminated with bacterial sequence, although putative searching of the identified sequence returns homology to other known algae. While the MAG should be interpreted with caution, it represents a partial genome sequence of <italic>Picocystis</italic> sp. from Mono Lake. The annotated genome contained no genes related to sulfur cycling, and other incomplete metabolic cycles (Supplemental Figure S3).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Beginning in late 2012, Mono Lake exhibited signs of persistent <italic>Picocystis</italic> blooms. Subsequently, from 2013 to 2016 both lake clarity and <italic>Artemia</italic> abundance declined dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Surface concentrations of chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> averaged 3.8 &#x00B5;M in July (1994-2013), yet 2016 concentrations were ten times higher, 33.9 &#x00B5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The elevated chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> concentration and Secchi disk values (indicative of lake clarity) above 1 m suggest that Mono Lake was well within a bloom of <italic>Picocystis</italic>. The relative abundances of microorganisms presented here and the well-mixed major ions of Mono Lake relative to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), indicated that our sampling represents the first high-throughput molecular study of Mono Lake during a <italic>Picocystis</italic> bloom and concurrent monomixis. Genes required for sulfate reduction to sulfide were detected only in the sequenced lake sediment, while both metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated a near complete loss of the anaerobic sulfate reducing potential within the water column of Mono Lake. Instead, a mixed algal and facultatively anaerobic microbial community was present below the detectable oxycline, more similar to the near-surface microbial community than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). It is yet unknown how the microbial community of Mono Lake will rebound after such a significant algal bloom and a decline in the population of <italic>Artemia</italic> within the lake.</p>
<p>Our survey allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the genomic potential, and expressed genes associated with metabolic processes throughout the water column. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) appeared active, with formate-dependent cytochrome c nitrite reductases detected within the transcriptome (Table S4) and formate-dependent nitrite reductase subunits within the assembled metagenomes (Table S3). No genes associated with ammonium oxidation (AOB) were identified in contrast to previous years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) in either the transcriptome or metagenome, suggesting that the ammonia produced within the lake was assimilated, likely by the dense population of growing <italic>Picocystis</italic>. In addition to nitrate reduction another key anaerobic respiratory process, sulfate reduction, was largely absent from the water column.</p>
<p>Previous work during meromixis/non-bloom intervals has shown that sulfate reduction is a key respiratory process in Mono Lake, supporting the growth of multiple species of sulfide oxidizing aerobic microorganisms above the oxycline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). We found that microorganisms capable of sulfate reduction were only identified in sediment metagenomic samples during the bloom.</p>
<p>Dissimilatory-type reverse sulfite reductases associated with sulfur oxidizing gammaproteobacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) taxa were identified at 20 and 25 m, but no true reductive sulfite reductases were found in sequenced water samples. Taxa known to reduce sulfate were also only identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in stark contrast to previously sampled years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Instead, the most abundant microorganisms with identifiable <italic>dsrA/B</italic> gene clusters were reverse-<italic>dsr</italic> type reductases identified previously in the Gammaproteobacterium genus <italic>Thioalkalivibrio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). While lake sulfate reduction rates are typically very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) our data suggest a complete loss of sulfate reducing activity in the water column during a bloom. It is likely that during a bloom, sulfate reduction is repressed as more oxidizing conditions are present throughout the water column due to an increased abundance of oxygenic photosynthetic algae. Members of the Bacteroidetes were in high abundance throughout the water column, including OTUs most closely related to ML310M-34, which remained abundant through the water column and <italic>Psychroflexus</italic>, which decreased in abundance from 2 to 25 m as oxygen levels declined. The eukaryotic microbial community was more evenly distributed throughout the water, with <italic>Picocystis</italic> detected in near equivalent relative abundance throughout the water column (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), agreeing with reported chlorophyll levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), as well as fluorescence values measured as a part of this study (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>
<p>Eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene copy number was greater at 20 and 25 m than above the oxycline by approximately 40 percent. The results were similar to previous estimates of <italic>Picocystis</italic> biomass during bloom events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). <italic>Artemia</italic> grazing pressure was unusually low during 2016, likely allowing for the increase in <italic>Picocystis</italic> abundance throughout the sampled water column and accounting for the similarly low visibility (Secchi disk) readings. Additional primary productivity in the lake could also account for the oxycline shallowing from 15 m depth in 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) to 10 m depth in July 2016. This expansion of anoxic waters likely limits <italic>Artemia</italic> populations from grazing on <italic>Picocystis.</italic> Lake temperature decreases at the surface relative to previous studies may also slow the metabolism of <italic>Artemia,</italic> resulting in reduced fecundity and increased mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). A decline in <italic>Artemia</italic> population could also impact bird mortality, though this was outside the scope of this study, and should be investigated at a later date.</p>
<p>A key finding of this study is the confirmation that <italic>Picocystis</italic> strain ML appears capable of photosynthesis under very low light conditions near the bottom of Mono Lake. Previous work suggested that <italic>Picocystis</italic> strain ML is capable of growth under very low light conditions, and showed elevated concentrations of chlorophyll below 15 m at Mono Lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Chloroplast 16S rRNA gene sequence was most abundant at 20 m, corresponding to a peak in total 16S rRNA copy number (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). 18S rRNA gene sequence identified as <italic>Picocystis</italic> were most abundant at 10 m, yet chloroplast relative abundance peaked at 20 m, near previously recorded peak depths in other recorded bloom events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Despite the high relative abundance of <italic>Picocystis</italic> throughout the water column, isolation and characterization of the <italic>Picocystis</italic> genome remains elusive. Binning resulted in a partial MAG with an incomplete 18S rRNA gene fragment with high similarity to the published sequence of <italic>Picocystis</italic> strain ML. Genome sequencing of <italic>Picocystis,</italic> recently isolated and sequenced twice independently (Ronald Oremland, personal communication), will allow for its genome to be removed from subsequent sequencing efforts which will simplify assembly, and enhance the resolution of bacterial and archaeal binning efforts in the future, yielding a better understanding of the microbial community responsible for the diverse metabolic potential in both the sediments and water of Mono Lake. Despite the lack of a reference genome, our transcriptomic sequencing was able to recover <italic>Picocystis</italic> chloroplast associated transcripts. At 25 m depth, a significant upregulation of Photosystem II was observed (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplemental Table S4). This, combined with the 40 percent increase in the number of 18S rRNA gene copies at 25 m relative to 2 m suggest that there is, at a minimum, a near equivalent amount of transcription of photosynthesis-associated genes throughout the water column. Recently, photosynthesis in a microbial mat was shown to be capable under extremely low light concentrations, although in a bacterial system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Still, the presented data suggest that under extreme low light conditions, photosynthesis may still occur. This is the first transcriptomic evidence from Mono Lake to support previous laboratory observations of <italic>Picocystis</italic> growing under low light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study represents the first study of Mono Lake during the height of an algal bloom and suggests significant shifts in both the bacterial and archaeal microbial community and its metabolic potential from non-bloom years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). <italic>Picocystis</italic> was present throughout the water column, and apparently carrying out oxygenic photosynthesis even at extremely low levels of light at depth within the lake. While Picocystis bloomed throughout Mono Lake, there was also a loss of sulfate reducing microorganisms. The lack of sulfate reduction at and below 20 m within Mono Lake is in contrast to previous work and is possibly linked to the intense drought experienced by Mono Lake from 2012 to 2016. During such a drought anaerobic microorganisms may seek refuge within the underlying sediment. By sequencing nearby sediment, we have shown that even if sulfate reduction is temporarily lost in the planktonic community of Mono Lake, the sediment may act as a &#x201C;seed bank&#x201D; or refugia for organisms capable of this, and likely other necessary metabolisms dependent upon overlying water / lake conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, the sulfate reducing microorganisms may find a better reduced substrate or fewer inhibitors in the sedimentary environment. Furthermore, the recovery of microbial populations within Mono Lake must come from its&#x2019; sediment or underlying groundwater, not from the streams that feed it as no overlapping taxa exist. Establishing if, and how, the chemistry and microbiota of Mono Lake recover after monomixis, drought, and algal bloom should be the focus of future work. Such research can be compared against our metagenomic and transcriptomic during bloom as well as previous metatranscriptomic sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) to better understand how, or if, the microbial community of Mono Lake returns to its previous state after extended periods of both monomixis and algal bloom.</p>

<title>Metatranscriptomic Analysis</title>
<p>Metatranscriptome libraries were first filtered for quality and adapter removal using PEAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). After quality control, sequence files were concatenated into a single set of paired-end reads in FASTQ format, and then assembled <italic>de novo</italic> using Trinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Post-assembly the Trinotate package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://trinotate.github.io/">https://trinotate.github.io/</ext-link>) was used to annotate assembled transcripts. After assembly,reads were mapped against transcripts using Bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), and differential significance was assessed using DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Assembly, annotation, mapping, and statistical analyses were carried out using XSEDE compute resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).</p>

<p>We wish to thank all participants from the International GeoBiology Course 2016 and the Agouron Institute for course funding. Ann Close and Amber Brown of USC were critical in logistics of the 2016 course and beyond. We wish to thank Tom Crowe for access to his well, and for transport on Mono Lake. Sequence data were generated by the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. The University of Oklahoma Supercomputing Center for Education and Research (OSCER) provided archival storage prior to sequence data submission to the NCBI SRA. This work used the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), including the SDSC Comet and the TACC/IU Jetstream clusters under allocation ID TG-BIO180010, which is supported by National Science Foundation grant number ACI-1548562. A California State Parks permit to USGS and Geobiology 2016 allowed us to conduct sampling on and around Mono Lake. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</p>
