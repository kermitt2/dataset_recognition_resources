<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Large-scale studies such as the &#x200B;<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> 1001 Genomes Project aim to understand genetic variation in populations and link it to phenotypic variation. Such studies require routine genotyping of stocks to avoid sample contamination and mix-ups. To genotype samples efficiently and economically, sequencing must be inexpensive a&#x200B;nd data processing simple. Here we present SNPmatch, a tool which identifies the most likely strain (inbred line, or &#x201C;accession&#x201D;) from a SNP database. We tested the tool by performing low-coverage sequencing of over 2000 strains. SNPmatch could readily genotype samples correctly from 1-fold coverage sequencing data, and could also identify the parents of F1 or F2 individuals. SNPmatch can be run either on the command line or through AraGeno (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arageno.gmi.oeaw.ac.at">https://arageno.gmi.oeaw.ac.at</ext-link></underline>), a web interface that permits sample genotyping from a user-uploaded VCF or BED file.</p>

<title>Background &#x0026; Summary</title>
<p>Sample contamination is an unavoidable problem when large-scale experiments are performed. For example, cell lines are frequently misidentified or contaminated, and the need for validation has long been underappreciated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The same problem applies to any germplasm collection. With an increasing number of experiments utilizing natural variation, plant seed resources are growing rapidly. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the genomes of 1135 strains have recently been sequenced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and this panel is now widely used. The need for verifying seed stock is clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Routine quality checks of seed stock genotypes can guard against common mistakes such as tube mislabeling, seed contamination during harvesting, or sample mix ups. In principle, genotyping can easily be performed by short-read sequencing, which has high throughput and low error rates. Sequencing and library preparation costs are dropping rapidly, whether for reduced-representation methods like restriction-site-associated-DNA sequencing strategy (RAD-seq), or whole-genome sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. On the other hand, user-friendly tools for the analysis of sequencing data are only starting to become available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Here we present SNPmatch, a simple tool for efficiently identifying the most likely strain from a database of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> strain based on a likelihood model for the given markers (SNPs) in each sample. We validated SNPmatch using the sequenced 1135 genomes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p>
<p>SNPmatch readily identified correct genotypes with only a few thousand random SNP markers &#x2014; many fewer than expected from any sequencing effort. We then used SNPmatch to perform a quality check of a lab seed stock collection comprising most of the &#x201C;1001 Genomes&#x201D;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and RegMap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> panels &#x2014; a total of &#x007E;2000 strains. We performed inexpensive (12&#x0024;/sample) low-coverage sequencing of the seed stock collection by multi-plexing 192 libraries into a single Illumina sequencing lane, resulting in a median sequencing coverage of 1.8X per sample. Using SNPmatch, a staggering 10&#x0025; of the strains were found to be incorrect, either due to mix-ups within the collection, or with unknown strains. These mistakes are currently being investigated and remedied. This clearly demonstrates the need for and utility of quality control by sequencing.</p>
<p>SNPmatch is a Python library which can be run on the command line, and we have also developed AraGeno (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arageno.gmi.oeaw.ac.at">https://arageno.gmi.oeaw.ac.at</ext-link></underline>), a simple web interface that allows user to query their own SNP data against the public polymorphism databases.</p>

<title>Sequencing preparation</title>
<p>3-5 gas-sterilised seeds of each <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> strain were sown directly on soil and stratified for 6 days at 4&#x00BA;C in the dark. Plants were grown at 10&#x00BA;C under long days (16 h light, 8 h dark) with 60 &#x0025; humidity. DNA from 2-3 leaves was extracted using the NucleoMag Plant Kit (Macherey Nagel, cat. # 744400). During the procedure of verifying our lab seed stock collection we modified the library preparation protocol as described below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>For the first round of sequencing (1<sup>st</sup> replicate of the 1001 Genomes collection &#x002B; RegMap panel) libraries were prepared as described by Baym<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Briefly, 2.5 ng of DNA was tagmented and adapter ligated in a 2.5 ul reaction volume using Illumina Nextera&#x2122; Kit. Libraries were amplified by Illumina TrueSeq Primers and VeraSeq High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Biozym, cat #280390). Size selection and PCR clean-up was performed with Agencourt AMPure Beads (Beckman Coulter, cat. #A63882). Libraries were validated with Fragment Analyzer&#x2122; Automated CE System (Advanced Analytical) pooled in equimolar concentration for 96-multiplex. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq&#x2122; 2500 Analyzers using manufacturer&#x2019;s standard cluster generation and sequencing protocols in 125 bp PE mode.</p>
<p>For the second round of sequencing (2<sup>nd</sup> replicate of the 1001 Genomes collection) we used a Tn5 transposase, which was generated in-house according to the method described by Picelli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. For transposome assembly 0.143 vol of a 100 uM equimolar mixture of preannealed Tn5MEDS-A and Tn5MEDS-B adapters was added to a 1:20 in dilution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 &#x0025; glycerol, 0.1 &#x0025; Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT) diluted Tn5 stock and incubated for 30 min at 37&#x00BA;C. Assembled Tn5 was stored at -20 degrees and used for up to two months. Newly assembled Tn5 was tested on different DNA concentrations each time before usage. Tn5 reactions were assembled in small volumes (2.5 ul total) by mixing 0.5 ul TAPS buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2, 50 &#x0025; DMF), 0.1 ul of preassembled Tn5, 1.0 ul DNA (2.5 ng/ul) and 0.9 ul H2O. Reactions were incubated for 7 minutes at 55&#x00BA;C. Tagmented DNA was used directly for PCR amplifications. PCR was performed by mixing 2.5 ul of tagmented DNA with 11.2 ul VeraSeq High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Biozym, cat #280390) and 8.8 ul of 0.5 uM index oligos. The PCR program was as follow: 3 min 72&#x00BA;C, 5 min 98&#x00BA;C, 8-14 cycles of 10 sec 98&#x00BA;C, 30 sec 63&#x00BA;C, 30 sec 72&#x00BA;C, and 5 min 72&#x00BA;C. PCR reactions were purified by adding 23 ul AMPure XP beads (cat. # A63882, Beckman Coulter) to 22.5 ul PCR volume. DNA was eluted in 25 ul H<sub>2</sub>O. Libraries were validated with Fragment Analyzer&#x2122; Automated CE System (Advanced Analytical) pooled in equimolar concentration for 192-multiplex. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq&#x2122; 2500 Analyzers using manufacturer&#x2019;s standard cluster generation and sequencing protocols in 50 bp PE mode.</p>
<p>The modified sequencing protocol of second round were validated by comparing SNPmatch results with that of first round sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Even with a lower coverage for the samples in second round due to the higher multi-plexing, they gave an unambiguous match to strains as good as for the samples in first round sequencing, indicating a sufficient coverage and library preparation to genotype the samples using SNPmatch.</p>

<p>All sequencing reads for all the samples were processed accordingly to a standard pipeline, outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>. In brief, reads were aligned to the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> reference genome (TAIR10, <underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/index.jsp">https://www.arabidopsis.org/index.jsp</ext-link></underline>) using bwa mem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> with default parameters.

SNP and indel calls were obtained from alignment files using GATK HaplotypeCaller<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> following precisely &#x2018;Best Practice&#x2019; instructions on joint genotyping for all the samples per plate.

<title>AraGeno</title>
<p>SNPmatch is a Python library and primarily used as a command line tool. We made sure that the installation of SNPmatch is as simple and straightforward as possible by hosting SNPmatch on the official Python software repository PyPi (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">https://pypi.python.org/pypi</ext-link></underline>). Nevertheless we wanted to go one step further and provide SNPmatch as a service to the Arabidopsis community and thus taking care of the installation process and data handling. To this end we developed AraGeno (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arageno.gmi.oeaw.ac.at">https://arageno.gmi.oeaw.ac.at</ext-link></underline>), a web-application that exposes a web based frontend to SNPmatch. Users only have to provide a VCF or BED file and AraGeno will take care of validating the data, running SNPmatch on our High Performance Cluster (HPC) and displaying the results of the analysis in an interactive web-interface.</p>
<p>Users can download the results and run as many analysis as they like. By using our HPC system we can easily process many analyzes concurrently. Furthermore AraGeno also provides a RESTful API for programmatic access to the SNPmatch pipeline. AraGeno is hosted on our on-premises cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>It is a Python based web-application using the Django framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">https://www.djangoproject.com/</ext-link>) and Django REST framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/">http://www.django-rest-framework.org/</ext-link>) for the backend and Vue.js (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vuejs.org/">https://vuejs.org/</ext-link>) for the interactive front end side.</p>
<p>In the future we plan to extend the service to additionally allow researchers to mail us samples for genotyping and identifying.</p>

<title>Technical Validation</title>
<p>We validated SNPmatch using the raw data from published 1001 genomes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic><sup><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic></sup>, thinning the data to one, three and six million reads for each sample to test the effect of coverage (one million reads roughly correspond to multiplexing 192 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> samples in a single Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 lane, or roughly 1 x coverage). The results were essentially unaffected by this level of thinning, indicating that even 192-fold multiplexing yielded more than enough SNPs to distinguish the strains.</p>
<p>To investigate the required number of SNPs further, we randomly selected subset of SNPs, and ran SNPmatch using those subset only. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, the number of strains identified uniquely is largely independent of the number of SNPs, provided that number exceeds a few thousand &#x2014; as long as we do not try to distinguish very closely related strains. In the 1001 genomes panel, there are 78 North American strains and 40 other pairs of strains that differ by fewer than 1k SNPs, and there are 60 pairs of strains that differ by less than 50k SNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. These strains are difficult to distinguish from each other even with millions of SNPs.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="109520_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we used SNPmatch to validate our own seed stocks. We resequenced almost complete sets of the &#x201C;1001 Genomes&#x201D;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and &#x201C;RegMap&#x201D;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> collections using the protocols described in Methods. Of a total of 1998 sequenced strains, 1991 yielded sufficiently good SNP data for analysis. Of these, 1797 were assigned to the correct strain (or set of strains differing by less than 5000 SNPs in the databases). Of the remaining 194 strains, 82 (30 of the &#x201C;1001 Genomes&#x201D; and 52 of the &#x201C;RegMap&#x201D; collections) were unambiguously assigned to the wrong strain (or set of closely related strains), indicating sample or strain mix-up (suppl. Table 1). Finally, the remaining 112 (44 of the &#x201C;1001 Genomes&#x201D; and 68 of the &#x201C;RegMap&#x201D; collections) did not match any strain in the databases (suppl. Table 1). These samples could represent unknown strains, DNA contamination, or outcrossed individuals, however DNA contamination and outcrossing should both result in an unusually large number of heterozygous calls, which we do not observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the ambiguous calls are most likely due to sample mix-up with unknown strains. We are currently collecting and verifying the 194 incorrect strains from different sources in order to make sure that the stock center has the right germplasm.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="109520_fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>At least when the parent strains are in the database, SNPmatch can be used to identify hybrid individuals. Such individuals will not find an unambiguous match in the database, but will be equally closely related to both parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). For such individuals running SNPmatch in windows across the genome will quickly reveal its hybrid nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
