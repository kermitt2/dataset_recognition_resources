<title>Abstract</title>
<p>To characterize latent components of genetic associations, we applied truncated singular value decomposition (DeGAs) to matrices of summary statistics derived from genome-wide association analyses across 2,138 phenotypes measured in 337,199 White British individuals in the UK Biobank study. We systematically identified key components of genetic associations and the contributions of variants, genes, and phenotypes to each component. As an illustration of the utility of the approach to inform downstream experiments, we report putative loss of function variants, rs114285050 (<italic>GPR151</italic>) and rs150090666 (<italic>PDE3B</italic>), that substantially contribute to obesity-related traits, and experimentally demonstrate the role of these genes in adipocyte biology. Our approach to dissect components of genetic associations across human phenotypes will accelerate biomedical hypothesis generation by providing insights on previously unexplored latent structures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human genetic studies have been profoundly successful at identifying regions of the genome contributing to disease risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Despite these successes, there are challenges to translating findings to clinical advances, much due to the extreme polygenicity and widespread pleiotropy of complex traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In retrospect, this is not surprising given that most common diseases are multifactorial. However, it remains unclear exactly which factors, acting alone or in combination, contribute to disease risk and how those factors are shared across diseases. With the emergence of sequencing technologies, we are increasingly able to pinpoint alleles, possibly rare and with large effects, which may aid in therapeutic target prioritization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, large population-based biobanks, such as the UK Biobank, have aggregated data across tens of thousands of phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, an opportunity exists to characterize the phenome-wide landscape of genetic associations across the spectrum of genomic variation, from coding to non-coding, and rare to common.</p>
<p>Singular value decomposition (SVD), a mathematical approach developed by differential geometers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, can be used to combine information from several (likely) correlated vectors to form basis vectors, which are guaranteed to be orthogonal and to explain maximum variance in the data, while preserving the linear structure that helps interpretation. In the field of human genetics, SVD is routinely employed to infer genetic population structure by calculating principal components using the genotype data of individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To address the pervasive polygenicity and pleiotropy of complex traits, we propose an application of truncated SVD (TSVD), a reduced rank approximation of SVD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, to characterize the underlying (latent) structure of genetic associations using summary statistics computed for 2,138 phenotypes measured in the UK Biobank population cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We applied our novel approach, referred to as DeGAs &#x2013; Decomposition of Genetic Associations &#x2013; to assess associations among latent components, phenotypes, variants, and genes. We highlight its application to body mass index (BMI), myocardial infarction (MI), and gallstones, motivated by high polygenicity in anthropometric traits, global burden, and economic costs, respectively. We assess the relevance of the inferred key components through GREAT genomic region ontology enrichment analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and functional experiments. Further, we experimentally demonstrate a role of newly discovered obesity-related genes in adipocyte biology.</p>

<title>DeGAs method overview</title>
<p>We generated summary statistics by performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 2,138 phenotypes from the UK Biobank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Tables S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">S2</xref>). We perform variant-level quality control, which includes linkage-disequilibrium (LD) pruning and removal of variants in the MHC region, to focus on 235,907 variants for subsequent analyses. Given the immediate biological consequence, subsequent downstream implications, and medical relevance of predicted protein-truncating variants (PTVs), commonly referred to as loss-of-function variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, we perform separate analyses on two variant sets: (1) all directly-genotyped variants and (2) PTVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). To eliminate unreliable estimates of genetic associations, we selected associations with p-values &#x003C; 0.001, and standard error of beta value or log odds ratio of less than 0.08 and 0.2, respectively, for each dataset. The Z-scores of and <italic>M</italic> denote the number of phenotypes and variants, respectively. <italic>N</italic> and <italic>M</italic> were 2,138 and 235,907 for the &#x201C;all&#x201D; variant group; and 628 and 784 for the PTV group. The rows and columns of <italic>W</italic> correspond to the GWAS summary statistics of a phenotype and the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of a variant, respectively. We applied TSVD to each matrix and obtained a decomposition into three matrices <italic>W</italic>&#x003D;<italic>USV</italic><sup>T</sup> (U: phenotype, S: variance, V: variant). This reduced representation of <italic>K</italic> &#x003D;100 components altogether explained 41.9&#x0025; (all) and 75.5&#x0025; (PTVs) of the variance in the original summary statistic matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b-c</xref>, Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

<p>To characterize each latent component, we defined phenotype squared cosine score, phenotype contribution score, variant contribution score, and gene contribution score. The squared cosine scores quantifies the relative importance of component for a given phenotype or gene, and are defined based on the squared distance of a component from the origin on the latent space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>, Methods). Contribution scores quantify relative importance of a phenotype, variant, or gene to a given component and is defined based on the squared distance of a phenotype, variant, or gene from the origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We then performed biological characterization of DeGAs latent components with the genomic region enrichment analysis tool (GREAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> followed by functional experiments in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>

<title>Applying DeGAs components for BMI, MI, and gallstones</title>
<p>To illustrate the application of DeGAs in characterizing the genetics of complex traits, we selected three phenotypes, BMI, MI, and gallstones given the large contribution of anthropometric traits on the first five components, that ischemic heart diseases is a leading global fatal and non-fatal burden, and that gallstones is a common condition with severe pain and large economic costs where polygenic risk factors are largely unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.

<title>Functional experiments for candidate genes in cellular models of adipocytes</title>
<p>We sought to illustrate the potential application of DeGAs in prioritizing therapeutic targets using functional follow-up experiments. Several of our most interesting findings were observed for obesity-related traits, including the top two candidate genes (<italic>PDE3B</italic> and <italic>GPR151</italic>) contributing to PC1 &#x2013; the leading component associated with obesity. For this reason, we chose to study these two genes in relation to adipocyte biology. Specifically, the expression and function of <italic>PDE3B</italic> and <italic>GPR151</italic> were evaluated in mouse 3T3-L1 and human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) cells, two well-established preadipocyte models used for studying adipocyte differentiation (i.e. adipogenesis) and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>First, we demonstrated that both genes were expressed in preadipocytes, but showed different expression patterns when cells were transforming into mature adipocytes: <italic>PDE3B</italic> increased dramatically during both mouse and human adipogenesis, while <italic>GPR151</italic> maintained a low expression level throughout the differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a-b</xref>). Next, to explore the causal relationships between gene expression and adipogenesis, we introduced short interfering RNA (siRNA) against <italic>Pde3b</italic> and <italic>Gpr151</italic>, respectively, into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and monitored the impact of gene knockdown on conversion of preadipocytes to adipocytes. Knockdown of <italic>Gpr151</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c</xref>) drastically impaired adipocyte differentiation, as evidenced by lowered expression of adipogenesis markers (<italic>Pparg, Cebpa and Fabp4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5d</xref>), as well as the reduced formation of lipid-containing adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5e-f</xref>). Further, to test the functional capacity of the fat cells lacking <italic>Gpr151</italic>, we performed a lipolysis assay - an essential metabolic pathway of adipocytes and thus, a key indicator of adipocyte function - on mature adipocytes derived from preadipocytes transfected with either scrambled siRNA (scRNA) or si<italic>Gpr151</italic>. Not surprisingly, <italic>Gpr151</italic>-deficient lipid-poor adipocytes showed dramatically lower lipolysis, along with impaired capability of responding to isoproterenol (ISO), a &#x03B2;-adrenergic stimulus of lipolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5g</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>GPR151</italic> knockdown in adipocyte progenitor cells may block their conversion into mature adipocytes; thus, preventing the expansion of adipose tissue. These results are directionally consistent with our DeGAs and univariate regression analysis showing that <italic>GPR151</italic> PTVs are associated with lower obesity and fat mass, especially central obesity (e.g. waist circumference and trunk fat mass) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>

<p>To further analyze the functional impact of GPR151 in adipocytes, we generated an overexpression model of GPR151 by infecting 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with virus expressing Flag-tagged human <italic>GPR151</italic> driven by either EF1&#x03B1; or aP2 promotor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Supplementary Fig. S13a</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>GPR151</italic> by both constructs were confirmed at the gene and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Supplementary Fig. S13b-d</xref>). However, despite the substantial effect of <italic>Gpr151</italic> knockdown on adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), overexpression of <italic>GPR151</italic> in preadipocytes failed to influence adipocyte differentiation significantly, as shown by similar levels of adipogenic markers compared to the non-infected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Supplementary Fig. S13e-f</xref>). To eliminate the potential masking effects of any unperturbed cells in the partially infected cell population, we specifically selected <italic>GPR151</italic>-overexpressing cells by staining Flag-<italic>GPR151</italic> positive cells with APC-conjugated flag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Supplementary Fig. S13g-h</xref>) and sorted APC&#x002B; and APC-cells from the differentiating adipocyte cultures. In both EF1&#x03B1;- and aP2-driven <italic>GPR151</italic> overexpression models, <italic>GPR151</italic> mRNA levels were enriched in APC&#x002B; cells compared to APC-cells. However, APC&#x002B; cells expressed genes characteristics of differentiating adipocytes in a similar level to that of APC-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Supplementary Fig. S13i-j</xref>). These data conclude that overexpression of GPR151 in preadipocytes cannot further enhance adipogenesis, suggesting that the endogenous level of GPR151 in preadipocytes may be sufficient to maintain the normal differentiation potential of preadipocytes. Although GPR151 is predominantly expressed in the brain, especially in hypothalamic neurons that control appetite and energy expenditure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, we identified for the first time that the GPR151 protein is present in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue from mice (SAT and VAT), albeit in a very low level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Supplementary Fig. S13k</xref>). Together with our gain- and loss-of-function studies of <italic>GPR151</italic> in preadipocyte models, we infer that the regulatory role of <italic>GPR151</italic> in body weight may involve both central and peripheral effects. The minimal but indispensable presence of GPR151 in adipose progenitor cells in generating lipid-rich adipocytes seems to represent an important mechanism by which GPR151 promotes obesity.</p>
<p>In contrast to <italic>GPR151</italic>, knockdown of <italic>Pde3b</italic> in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS14">Supplementary Fig. S14a</xref>) showed no significant influence on adipogenesis and lipolysis (under either basal or &#x03B2;-adrenergic stimulated conditions), as compared to scRNA-transfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS14">Supplementary Fig. S14b-e</xref>). Since PDE3B is expressed primarily in differentiated adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a-b</xref>), future research efforts should be concentrated on studying the metabolic role of PDE3B in mature adipocytes. As an essential enzyme that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP, PDE3B is known to be highly expressed in tissues that are important in regulating energy homeostasis, including adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. <italic>Pde3b</italic> whole-body knockout in mice reduces the visceral fat mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and confers cardioprotective effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. There is a growing body of evidence that cardiometabolic health is linked to improved body fat distribution (i.e. lower visceral fat, higher subcutaneous fat) in a consistent direction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Our PheWAS analysis suggests that <italic>PDE3B</italic> PTVs have the strongest association with subcutaneous and lower-body adiposity (e.g. hip and leg fat mass) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). Therefore, understanding the fat depot-specific metabolic effects of PDE3B may help uncover the mechanism underlying the positive relationship of <italic>PDE3B</italic> PTVs with peripheral fat accumulation and favorable metabolic profiles.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We developed DeGAs, an application of TSVD, to decompose genome-and phenome-wide summary statistic matrix from association studies of thousands of phenotypes for systematic characterization of latent components of genetic associations. Applying DeGAs, we identified key latent components characterized with disease outcomes, risk factors, comorbidity structures, and environmental factors, with corresponding sets of genes and variants, providing insights on their context specific functions. With additional biological characterization of latent components using GREAT, we find enrichment of relevant phenotypes in mouse phenotype ontology. This replication across species highlights the ability of DeGAs to capture functionally relevant sets of both coding and non-coding variants in each component.</p>
<p>Given that DeGAs is applied on summary statistics and does not require individual level data, there is substantial potential to dissect genetic components of the human phenome when applied to data from population-based biobanks around the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. As a proof of concept, we report novel potential therapeutic targets against obesity or its complications based on combination of quantitative results from DeGAs, phenome-wide analyses in the UK Biobank, and functional studies in adipocytes.</p>
<p>Taken together, we highlight the directional concordance of our experimental data with the quantitative results from DeGAs and PTV-phenotype associations: <italic>GPR151</italic> inhibition may reduce total body and central fat, while deletion of <italic>PDE3B</italic> may favor subcutaneous, rather than visceral, fat deposition; both are expected to have beneficial effects on cardiometabolic health. Although these two genes were recently reported to be associated with obesity in another recent study based on the UK Biobank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, we are the first to experimentally identify <italic>GPR151</italic> as a promising therapeutic target to treat obesity, partly due to its requisite role in regulating adipogenesis. We also suggest <italic>PDE3B</italic> as a potential target of adipocyte-directed therapy. In this study, we focused on evaluating the functional effects of these genes on adipocyte function and development. We do not exclude the contribution nor the importance of other tissues or mechanisms underlying body weight changes. Indeed, some lines of evidence support additional effects of <italic>GPR151</italic> on obesity via the central nervous system &#x2013; possibly on appetite regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The resource made available with this study, including the DeGAs app, an interactive web application in the Global Biobank Engine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, provides a starting point to investigate genetic components, their functional relevance, and new therapeutic targets. These results highlight the benefit of comprehensive phenotyping on a population and suggest that systematic characterization and analysis of genetic associations across the human phenome will be an important part of efforts to understand biology and develop novel therapeutic approaches.</p>

We included phenotypes with at least 100 cases for binary phenotypes and 100 individuals with non-missing values for quantitative phenotypes. For disease outcome phenotypes, cancer, and family history, we used the same definitions as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. We used specific data fields and data category from the UK Biobank to define the phenotypes in the following categories as well as 19 and 42 additional miscellaneous binary and quantitative phenotypes: medication, imaging, physical measurements, assays, and binary and quantitative questionnaire (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>Some phenotype information from the UK Biobank contains three instances, each of which corresponds to (1) the initial assessment visit (2006-2010), (2) first repeat assessment visit (2012-2013), and (3) imaging visit (2014-). For binary phenotype, we defined "case" if the participants are classified as case in at least one of their visits and "control" otherwise. For quantitative phenotype, we took a median of non-NA values. In total, we defined 1,196 binary phenotypes and 943 quantitative phenotypes.</p>

<title>Genome-wide association analyses of 2,138 phenotypes</title>
<p>Association analyses for single variants were applied to the 2,138 phenotypes separately. For binary phenotypes, we performed Firth-fallback logistic regression using PLINK v2.00a (17 July 2017) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. For quantitative phenotypes, we applied generalized linear model association analysis with PLINK v2.00a (20 Sep. 2017). We applied quantile normalization for phenotype (--pheno-quantile-normalize option), where we fit a linear model with covariates and transform the phenotypes to normal distribution while preserving the original rank. We used the following covariates in our analysis: age, sex, types of genotyping array, and the first four genotype principal components computed from the UK Biobank.</p>

<title>Summary statistic matrix construction and variant filters</title>
<p>We constructed two Z-score summary statistic matrices. Each element of the matrix corresponds to summary statistic for a particular pair of a phenotype and a variant. We imposed different sets of variant filters.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Variant quality control filter: Our quality control filter described in the previous section on genotype data preparation.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Non-MHC variant filter: All variants outside of major histocompatibility complex region. With this filter, variants in chr6:25477797-36448354 were excluded from the summary statistic matrix.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>PTVs-only: With this filter, we subset to include only the variants having the VEP LOFTEE predicted consequence of: stop gain, frameshift, splice acceptor, or splice donor.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>By combining these filters, we defined the following sets of variants</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>All-non-MHC: This is a combination of our variant QC filter and non-MHC filter.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>PTVs-non-MHC: This is a combination of our variant QC filter, non-MHC filter, and PTVs filter.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to phenotype quality control and variant filters, we introduced value-based filters based on statistical significance to construct summary statistic matrices only with confident values. We applied the following criteria for the value filter:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>P-value of marginal association is less than 0.001.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Standard error of beta value or log odds ratio is less than 0.08 for quantitative phenotypes and 0.2 for binary phenotypes.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>With these filters, we obtained the following two matrices:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>All-non-MHC dataset that contains 2,138 phenotypes and 235,907 variants. We label this dataset as <bold>&#x201C;all&#x201D; dataset</bold>.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>&#x201C;PTVs-non-MHC&#x201D; dataset that contains 628 phenotypes and 784 variants. We label this dataset as <bold>&#x201C;PTVs only&#x201D; dataset</bold>. This contains a fewer number of phenotypes because not all the phenotypes have statistically significant associations with PTVs.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The effects of variant filters are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>. Finally, we transformed the summary statistics to Z-scores so that each vector that corresponds to a particular phenotype has zero mean with unit variance.</p>

<title>Truncated singular value decomposition of the summary statistic matrix</title>
<p>For each summary statistic matrix, we applied truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD).

<title>Selection of number of latent components in TSVD</title>
<p>In order to apply TSVD to the input matrix, the number of components should be specified. We apply <italic>K</italic> &#x003D; 100 for our analysis for both datasets. We computed the expected value of squared eigenvalues under the null model where the distribution of variance explained scores across the full-ranks are uniform. This can be computed with the rank of the original matrix, which is equal to the number of phenotypes in our datasets:

<p>For all of the two datasets, we found that that of 100-th component is greater than the expectation. This indicates even the 100-th components are informative to represent the variance of the original matrix. In the interest of computational efficiency, we set <italic>K</italic> &#x003D; 100</p>

<title>Factor scores</title>
<p>From these decomposed matrices, we computed <bold>factor score</bold> matrices for both phenotypes and variants as the product of singular vector matrix and singular values. We denote the one for phenotypes as <italic>F</italic><sub>p</sub> &#x003D; (<italic>f</italic><sub>i,j</sub><sup><italic>p</italic></sup>)<sub>i,j</sub> the one for variants as <italic>F<sub>v</sub></italic> &#x003D; (<italic>f<sub>i,j</sub><sup>v</sup></italic>)<sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub> and defined as follows:

<p>Since these factor scores are mathematically the same as principal components in principal component analysis (PCA), one can investigate the contribution of the phenotypes or variants for specific principal components by simply plotting factor scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a-b</xref>). Specifically, phenotype factor score is the same as phenotype principal components and variant factor score is the same as variant principal components. By normalizing these factor scores, one can compute contribution scores and cosine scores to quantify the importance of phenotypes, variants, and principal components as described below.</p>

<title>Scatter plot visualization with biplot annotations</title>
<p>To investigate the relationship between phenotype and variants in the TSVD eigenspace, we used a variant of biplot visualization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Specifically, we display phenotypes projected on phenotype principal components (<italic>F<sub>p</sub></italic>&#x003D;<italic>US</italic>) as a scatter plot. We also show variants projected on variant principal components (<italic>F<sub>v</sub></italic> &#x003D; <italic>VS</italic>) as a separate scatter plot and added phenotype singular vectors (<italic>U</italic>) as arrows on the plot using sub-axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">6</xref>). In scatter plot with biplot annotation, the inner product of a genetic variant and a phenotype represents the direction and the strength of the projection of the genetic association of the variant-phenotype pair on the displayed latent components. For example, when a variant and a phenotype share the same direction on the annotated scatter plot, that means the projection of the genetic associations of the variant-phenotype pair on the displayed latent components is positive. When a variant-phenotype pair is projected on the same line, but on the opposite direction, the projection of the genetic associations on the shown latent components is negative. When the variant and phenotype vectors are orthogonal or one of the vectors are of zero length, the projection of the genetic associations of the variant-phenotype pair on the displayed latent components is zero. Given the high dimensionality of the input summary statistic matrix, we selected relevant phenotypes to display to help interpretation of genetic associations in the context of these traits.</p>

<sec id="s4k">
<title>Contribution scores</title>
<p>To quantify the contribution of the phenotypes, variants, and genes to a given component, we compute <bold>contribution scores</bold>. We first define <bold>phenotype contribution score</bold> and <bold>variant contribution score</bold>. We denote phenotype contribution score and variant contribution score for some component <italic>k</italic> as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="442715_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="442715_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, respectively. They are defined by squaring the left and right singular vectors and normalizing them by Euclidian norm across phenotypes and variants:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="442715_ueqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where, <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> denote indices for phenotype and variant, respectively. Because <italic>U</italic> and <italic>V</italic> are orthonormal, the sum of phenotype and variant contribution scores for a given component are guaranteed to be one, i.e. <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="442715_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula></p>
<p>Based on the variant contribution scores for the <italic>k</italic>-th component, we define the <bold>gene contribution score</bold> for some component <italic>k</italic> as the sum of variant contribution scores for the set of variants in the gene:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="442715_ueqn4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where, <italic>g</italic> denotes indices for the set of variants in gene <italic>g</italic>. To guarantee that gene contribution scores for a given component sum up to one, we treat the variant contribution score for the non-coding variants as gene contribution scores. When multiple genes, <italic>g</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>g</italic><sub>2</sub>,&#x2026;, <italic>g</italic><sub>n</sub> are sharing the same variants, we defined the gene contribution score for the union of multiple genes rather than each gene:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="442715_ueqn5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>With these contribution score for a given component, it is possible to quantify the relative importance of a phenotype, variant, or gene to the component. Since DeGAs identifies latent components using unsupervised learning, we interpret each component in terms of the driving phenotypes, variants, and genes, i.e. the ones with large contribution scores for the component.</p>
<p>The top 20 driving phenotypes, variants, and genes (based on contribution scores) for the top five TSVD components and the top three key components for our phenotypes of interest are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>.</p>
<p>We used stacked bar plots for visualization of the contribution score profile for each of the components. We represent phenotypes, genes, or variants with large contribution scores as colored segments and aggregated contributions from the remaining ones as &#x201C;others&#x201D; in the plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). To help interpretation of the major contributing factors for the key components, we grouped phenotypes into categories, such as &#x201C;fat&#x201D;, &#x201C;fat-free&#x201D; phenotypes, and showed the sum of contribution scores for the phenotype groups. The list of phenotype groups used in the visualization is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>.</p>

<sec id="s4l">
<title>Squared cosine scores</title>
<p>Conversely, we can also quantify the relative importance of the latent components for a given phenotype or variant with <bold>squared cosine scores</bold>. We denote phenotype squared cosine score for some phenotype <italic>i</italic> and variant squared cosine score for some variant <italic>j</italic> as (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="442715_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>) and (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="442715_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>), respectively. They are defined by squaring of the factor scores and normalizing them by Euclidian norm across components:
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="442715_ueqn6.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>By definition, the sum of squared cosine scores across a latent component for a given phenotype or variant equals to one, i.e. (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="442715_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>). While singular values in the diagonal matrix quantify the importance of latent components for the global latent structure, the phenotype or variant squared cosine score quantifies the relative importance of each component in the context of a given phenotype or a variant. The squared cosine scores for the phenotypes highlighted in the study is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>.</p>
<p>Note that squared cosine scores and contribution scores are two complementary scoring metrics to quantify the relationship among phenotypes, components, variants, and genes. It does not necessarily have inverse mapping property. For example, it is possible to see a situation, where for a given phenotype <italic>p</italic>, phenotype squared cosine score identifies <italic>k</italic> as the top key component, but phenotype contribution score for <italic>k</italic> identifies <italic>p</italic>&#x2032; (<italic>p</italic> &#x2032; &#x2260; <italic>p</italic>) as the top driving phenotype for the component <italic>k</italic>. This is because the two scores, contribution score and squared cosine score, are both defined by normalizing singular vector and principal component vector matrices, respectively, but with respect to different slices: one for row and the other for column.</p>

<title>Lipolysis assay</title>
<p>Glycerol release into the culture medium was used as an index of lipolysis. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum starved overnight and then treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or the lipolytic stimuli isoproterenol (ISO, 10&#x03BC;M) for 3 h. The culture medium was collected and the glycerol content in the culture medium was measured using an adipocyte lipolysis assay kit (ZenBio #LIP-1-NCL1). Glycerol release into the culture medium was normalized to the protein content of the cells from the same plate.</p>

<title>Overexpression of <italic>GPR151</italic> in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes</title>
<p>The <italic>GPR151</italic> construct was obtained from Addgene (#66327). This construct includes a cleavable HA signal to promote membrane localization, a FLAG epitope sequence for cell surface staining followed by codon-optimized human <italic>GPR151</italic> sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. We PCR-amplified the above sequence with stop codon and assembled it into a lentiviral plasmid (Addgene #85969) with either EF1&#x03B1; promoter (Addgene # 11154) or aP2 promoter (Addgene # 11424). EF1&#x03B1;-<italic>GPR151</italic> or aP2-<italic>GPR151</italic> lentiviral plasmid were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293T cells, together with the viral packaging vectors pCMV-dR8.91 and pMD2-G. 72 h after transfection, virus-containing medium was collected, filtered through a 0.45-&#x03BC;m pore-size syringe filter, and frozen at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at 50&#x0025; confluence were infected with the lentivirus stocks containing 8 &#x03BC;g/mL polybrene. Two days after transduction, lentivirus-infected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were subject to differentiation.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry analysis</title>
<p>Day 6 differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes were collected and washed with ice cold FACS buffer (PBS containing 2&#x0025; BSA). Cells were first resuspended into FACS staining buffer (BioLegend # 420201) at &#x007E;1M cells/100&#x03BC;l and incubated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 Fc Block (BioLegend # 101319) at room temperature for 10-15 min. Cells were then incubated with APC-conjugated FLAG antibody (BioLegend # 637307) for 20-30 min at room temperature in the dark. Following washing and centrifugation, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer and sorted using a BD Influx<sup>TM</sup> Cell Sorter. Cells without FLAG antibody staining were used to determine background fluorescence levels. Cells were sorted based on APC fluorescence and collected directly into TRIzol reagent for RNA extraction.</p>

<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Lysate aliquots containing 50&#x03BC;g of proteins were denatured, separated on a 4-10&#x0025; SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans-Blot<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5&#x0025; non-fat milk and incubated overnight at 4 &#x00B0;C with primary antibodies: anti-GPR151 (LSBio # LS-B6760-50) or anti-beta-actin (Cell Signaling #3700). Subsequently, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with IRDye<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> 800CW goat-anti-mouse antibody (LI-COR #926-32210). Target proteins were visualized using Odyssey<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Fc Imaging System (LI-COR).</p>
