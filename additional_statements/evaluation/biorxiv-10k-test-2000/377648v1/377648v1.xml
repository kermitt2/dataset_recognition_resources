<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Several imaging modalities, including T1-weighted structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI can show chronological age related changes. Employing machine learning algorithms, an individual&#x2019;s imaging data can predict their age with reasonable accuracy. While details vary according to modality, the general strategy is to: 1) extract image-related features, 2) build a model on a training set that uses those features to predict an individual&#x2019;s age, 3) validate the model on a test dataset, producing a predicted age for each individual, 4) define the &#x201C;Brain Age Gap Estimate&#x201D; (BrainAGE) as the difference between an individual&#x2019;s predicted age and his/her chronological age, and 5) estimate the relationship between BrainAGE and other variables of interest, and 6) make inferences about those variables and accelerated or delayed brain aging. For example, a group of individuals with overall positive BrainAGE may show signs of accelerated aging in other variables as well. There is inevitably an overestimation of the age of younger individuals and an underestimation of the age of older individuals due to &#x2018;regression to the mean&#x2019;. The correlation between chronological age and BrainAGE may significantly impact the relationship between BrainAGE and other variables of interest when they are also related to age. In this study, we examine the detectability of variable effects under different assumptions. We use empirical results from two separate datasets &#x005B;training=475 healthy volunteers, aged 18 &#x2013; 60 years (259 female); testing=489 participants including people with mood/anxiety, substance use, eating disorders and healthy controls, aged 18 &#x2013; 56 years (312 female)&#x005D; to inform simulation parameter selection. Outcomes in simulated and empirical data strongly support the proposal that models incorporating BrainAGE should include chronological age as a covariate. We propose either including age as a covariate in step 5 of the above framework, or employing a multistep procedure where age is regressed on BrainAGE prior to step 5, producing BrainAGE Residualized (BrainAGER) scores.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aging is a biological process that can affect behavioral and cognitive dimensions. Biological age as measured by telomere length deviates from an individual&#x2019;s chronological age as a result of environment, lifestyle, and genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Shammas, 2011</xref>). However, other measures of biological age that may be particularly relevant to psychopathology can involve structural and functional changes in the brain.</p>
<p>Several imaging modalities, including T1-weighted structural imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Franke et al., 2010</xref>), diffusion tensor imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), and functional MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Tian et al., 2016</xref>) have been used in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to predict an individual&#x2019;s age. Recently, integration of neuroimaging data of different feature types and across multiple modalities has been shown to improve age prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Erus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gutierrez Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Liem et al., 2017</xref>). While the details vary according to modality, the general strategy has been to 1) extract image-related features, 2) build a model on a training set composed of healthy participants using these features to predict participant age, 3) apply that model to a testing set, producing a predicted age for each individual, 4) compute the difference between a participant&#x2019;s predicted age and chronological age (often referred to as Brain Age Gap Estimate, BrainAGE, or brain predicted age difference, brain-PAD), 5) test for relationships between other variables of interest and BrainAGE, and 6) make inferences about accelerated or delayed brain aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Cole and Franke, 2017</xref>). Variables of interest have included physical fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ritchie et al., 2017</xref>), physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Steffener et al., 2016</xref>), cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Cole et al., 2015</xref>), mortality risk in elderly participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cole et al., 2018</xref>), acute ibuprofen administration in healthy participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Le et al., 2018</xref>) or status of various diseases and disorders such as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Franke et al., 2013</xref>), Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gaser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">L&#x00F6;we et al., 2016</xref>), psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Koutsouleris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Nenadi&#x0107; et al., 2017</xref>) and human immunodeficiency virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wilkins, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Support Vector Regression (SVR) with a radial kernel is a commonly used machine learning algorithm to predict age and compute BrainAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Franke et al., 2010</xref>), along with other methods such as Gaussian process and relevant vector regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Drucker et al., 1997</xref>). The residual error of these age-predicting models, BrainAGE, is necessarily correlated with age, which results in an overestimation of the age of younger individuals and an underestimation of the age of older individuals. This is due to the fact that these algorithms, like all regression methods, are subject to the fundamental phenomenon of &#x201C;regression towards the mean&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Galton, 1886</xref>). A theoretical basis for this phenomenon is presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2a">section 2.1</xref>. In practice, the correlation between chronological age and BrainAGE is visually evident in many figures of chronological versus predicted age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cole et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Franke et al., 2010</xref>). While most studies involving BrainAGE have not discussed the age-BrainAGE correlation, some have accounted for this correlation by using predicted age as the primary outcome, which is similar to the correction we propose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Erus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Habes et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The age-BrainAGE correlation may affect the apparent relationship between BrainAGE and variables of interest when these other variables are also related to age. In the clinical neuroscience domain, for example, we may be interested in covariates including physiological variables such as body composition or psychological measures of mood or testing performance, some of which have clear relationships with age. In this study, we examine the detectability of multiple covariate effects in both real and simulated data. Using real data, we characterized relationships between BrainAGE, age, and other variables of interest. Then, we generated a known &#x201C;ground truth&#x201D; with characteristics similar to what we observed in real data. In our simulation model, age has a direct effect on the variables of interest, which may in turn affect simulated imaging features. We include both linear and nonlinear effects at each level.</p>
<p>The goals of the current study are: 1) to highlight the universal correlation between chronological age and BrainAGE in theory and practice and 2) develop a general framework for simulating age-dependent data that can be used to investigate the effect of the age-BrainAGE correlation in subsequent analyses. One of the challenges of determining the best practices for using BrainAGE in statistical modeling is related to the fact that variables of interest may be related to age, but not directly related to accelerated or delayed brain aging. In that case, spurious relationships with BrainAGE may be observed. Our results strongly support the proposal that models including BrainAGE as an independent variable should be adjusted for chronological age as well.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We begin with a theoretical explanation for regression toward the mean and the concurrent correlation between the residuals and observed values for any regression. Then, we show in our own data the relationships between chronological age, BrainAGE, and other covariates of interest as a basis for the parameters in our simulations. Finally, we describe a simulation approach to generate data with a comparable age effect on brain image features and show how the age-BrainAGE correlation can contribute to observed relationships, even when the simulated independent variables do not associate with imaging features.

<title>Regression Toward the Mean</title>
<p>Consider <italic>n</italic> data points (<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), <italic>i</italic> &#x003D; 1, &#x2026;, <italic>n</italic> used to fit a simple linear regression <italic>y</italic> &#x003D; <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> &#x002B; <italic>&#x03B2;x</italic> &#x002B; <italic>&#x03B5;</italic>. Least-square estimation leads to
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="377648_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub> is the Pearson correlation between x and y, <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> are the standard deviation, respectively. Substituting the formulas into the fitted values <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> yields
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="377648_ueqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>In this setting, regression toward the mean refers to the phenomenon that the standardized predicted value of y is closer to its mean than that of x to its mean for any imperfect correlation, &#x2212;1 &#x003C; <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub> &#x003C; 1. The weaker the correlation, the greater the extent of regression toward the mean. For perfect correlations (&#x007C;<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>&#x007C; &#x003D; 1), the standardized distance between the predicted value in <italic>y</italic> to its mean equals that of <italic>x</italic> to its mean and there is no regression toward the mean. The implication for BrainAGE is that the age of younger individuals tends to be overestimated and the age of older individuals tends to be underestimated.</p>

<title>Partition of Variance or Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</title>
<p>In the general setting <italic>y</italic> &#x003D; <italic>&#x0192;</italic>(<italic>X</italic>) &#x002B; <italic>&#x03F5;</italic>, where <italic>X</italic> can be any dimension and <italic>&#x0192;</italic>(&#x00B7;) can be any regression model, the variance of <italic>y</italic> is partitioned into a part that can be explained by <italic>X</italic>, and a part due to random error: <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Then
<disp-formula id="ueqn3"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="377648_ueqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="ueqn4"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="377648_ueqn4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>For <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and
<disp-formula id="ueqn5"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="377648_ueqn5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Thus, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> unless <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline7.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> predicts y perfectly with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline8.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. The correlation formulas suggest that the correlation between residual and <italic>y</italic> decreases with the correlation between <italic>y</italic> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline9.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, i.e. prediction accuracy of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline10.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Figure S1 illustrates this phenomenon using a simple simulation where <italic>y</italic> was a function of x plus random normal noise. As the noise decreases (and fit increases), the correlation between <italic>y</italic> and the residuals decreases as well.</p>
<p>In the context of BrainAGE, the goal is to find <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline11.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> that best predicts chronological age (<italic>y</italic>) using brain measures as <italic>X</italic>, and BrainAGE is computed as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline12.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Because <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="377648_inline13.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> never predicts chronological age perfectly, BrainAGE remains correlated with age. When BrainAGE is used as the response variable in subsequent analyses to make inferences on a covariate <italic>Z</italic>, it is important to check whether <italic>Z</italic> is not associated with chronological age, then one may simply evaluate the bivariate association between BrainAGE and <italic>Z</italic>. On the other hand, if <italic>Z</italic> is associated with chronological age. If <italic>Z</italic> is associated with both chronological age and BrainAGE, chronological age may confound the relationship between BrainAGE and <italic>Z</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Elwood, 1992</xref>) and should be taken into account. Confounding effects can be addressed at study design (e.g., randomization and matching) or in statistical analysis (e.g., stratification of the confounder or including the confounder as a covariate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Pourhoseingholi et al., 2012</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Franke et al. (2010)</xref> considered a variable <italic>Z</italic> that represents two groups (ill versus healthy) and selected two groups of individuals with similar chronological age (so <italic>Z</italic> is not associated with chronological age) to compare their BrainAGE. In the current work, we include chronological age as a covariate and evaluate this approach in the context of BrainAGE.</p>

<title>Empirical Data</title>
<p>We used two separate datasets to illustrate the correlation between BrainAGE and chronological age and the effect this can have on associations with covariates of interest. All data were collected at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research between 2009 and 2017. All protocols were approved by Western Institutional Review Board (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wirb.com">www.wirb.com</ext-link>). Participants signed written informed consent and received financial compensation for their participation.</p>

<title>Training Dataset</title>
<p>Structural MRI data were collected from 475 healthy volunteers (mean age &#x00B1; sd &#x003D; 30.5 &#x00B1; 10.3 years; age range &#x003D; 18 &#x2013; 60 years; 259 female) between 2009 and 2017. Each participant was scanned in a 3T GE MR750 whole body scanner. Scans were acquired using axial T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequences with a 24cm FOV, 256&#x00D7;256 acquisition matrix, 8-degree flip angle and .9375x.9375mm in-plane resolution with no gap. Other parameters varied within the following ranges: 5.736 to 6.292ms TR, 1.896 to 2.104ms TE, 0.9 to 1.2mm slice thickness, with either an 8- (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) or 32- (Nova Medical Inc., Wilmington MA) channel phased array coil. Healthy neuropsychiatric status was assessed using either the MINI-international Neuropsychiatric Interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Sheehan et al., 1998</xref>) or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">First et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">First, Michael B., Spitzer, Robert L, Gibbon Miriam, and Williams, Janet B.W., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Testing Dataset</title>
<p>Structural MRI data were collected from 489 (mean age &#x00B1; sd &#x003D; 34.6 &#x00B1; 10.6 years; age range &#x003D; 18 &#x2013; 56 years; 312 female) participants as part of Tulsa 1000, a longitudinal observational study including people with mood/anxiety, substance use, eating disorders and healthy controls. Inclusion criteria for the participant populations were Patient Health Questionnaire &#x2265; 10, Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale &#x2265;8, Drug Abuse Screening Test &#x003E; 3, or SCOFF &#x2265; 2. Exclusion criteria included a history of significant brain trauma, neurological disorders, change in medication within six week prior to scanning, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Scanning parameters for this dataset were: 24cm FOV, 256&#x00D7;256 acquisition matrix, 186 axial slices, 0.9mm slice thickness with no gap, TR/TE=5/2.012ms, using an 8-channel phased array coil (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). Testing and training sets differed on mean age (t &#x003D; 6.2, p &#x003C; 0.0001, mean difference 4.2 years) and sex composition (&#x03C7;<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 8.2, p &#x003D; 0.004).</p>
<p>All participants in the testing dataset also underwent an intense battery of assessments including self-report, clinical interviews, neuropsychological testing, and body composition analysis. For full details, please see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Victor et al., 2018</xref>). From these, we selected 154 measures, which were used to illustrate the normal range of correlations with age and how these can affect the relationship between BrainAGE and covariates of interest.</p>

<title>Image Processing</title>
<p>All images in both the testing and training sets were processed using Freesurfer version 6.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dale et al., 1999</xref>) in order to produce grey/non-grey matter masks. Then, using a procedure similar to Franke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Franke et al., 2010</xref>) but implemented in AFNI, all grey matter masks were transformed to MNI space via affine transformation, smoothed with an 8mm gaussian kernel, and downsampled to 8&#x00D7;8&#x00D7;8mm voxels. This produced a set of 3707 voxels per participant, with the value at each voxel representing the fraction of that voxel comprised of grey matter.</p>
<p>R (version 3.2.2) and R package caret (version 6.0.76) were used to fit a support vector regression (SVR) model with radial basis functions. The <italic>&#x03B5;</italic> (tolerance margin) was fixed at and cost parameters were tuned using 5 repeats of 10-fold cross validation in the training set. The hyperparameter space was sampled using a grid search that fixed <italic>&#x03B5;</italic> at 0.000145 and allowed cost to vary from 0.25 to 4096. The final best model (cost &#x003D; 2) was then applied to the testing set to produce one predicted age for each participant. BrainAGE was taken to be predicted age minus chronological age.</p>
<p>Additionally, we define the Brain Age Gap Estimate Residualized (BrainAGER) to be the residual of the regression of BrainAGE on age to remove the remaining linear bias of age. This way, we have a measure of deviation from expected age that is linearly uncorrelated with chronological age.</p>

<title>Simulation</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of the age-BrainAGE correlation on subsequent modeling results, we simulated hierarchical correlation structures among brain features, chronological age and covariates using a generative biological model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). We then generated two groups of independent variables. Within each group of variables, some are dependent on age and others are not. One group was used in the simulation of neuroimaging features, while the other was not. We randomly split the data set into two subsets, trained SVR on the training set and computed BrainAGE on the testing set. On the testing set, we conducted linear regressions of BrainAGE on all independent variables, both with and without chronological age. With 1,000 replications, we assessed the significance of the contribution from the independent variables by examining the distribution of the resulting <italic>p</italic>-values.</p>

<title>Model Definition</title>
<p>A realistic simulation model should capture the properties of normal age-related brain volumetric data, such as brain region-dependent changes and nonlinear chronological age dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fjell et al., 2013</xref>). A realistic simulation should also include the ability to generate age-dependent deviations from the normal population and age-dependent covariates that may influence BrainAGE nonlinearly. We consider a biological causal path model and develop a novel age-basis-function approach for simulating BrainAGE data with covariates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, Fig. S2).</p>
<p>Denoting age by <italic>A</italic>, we assumed an underlying (unobserved) biological process represented by <italic>m</italic>, which we referred to as age basis functions (ABFs). Here, without a function space defined, the term &#x201C;basis&#x201D; is used loosely to indicate the elementary functions that can be combined linearly to form any variable of interest y:
<disp-formula id="eqn1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="377648_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>In this study, we implemented three monotone decreasing ABFs that can generate a wide range of non-linear functions (Fig. S3), and used these ABFs to simulate covariates of interest and the features extracted from an imaging modality.</p>

<p>Other measurable variables, Z<sub>j&#x003E;q</sub> do not contribute to the weights deviation.

Nevertheless, the choice of parameters and even the simulation design matrix do not affect the overall improvement in the regression that includes age as an explanatory variable from the regression without age.</p>
<p>Finally, we carried out linear regressions of the covariates of interest on BrainAGE, with and without including age as an explanatory variable in the model.

<title>Covariate Correlations with Age</title>
<p>Observed Pearson correlations between age and the 154 clinical variables ranged from -0.33 (PROMIS physical function) to 0.29 (waist circumference) (Fig. S4). Because any confounding effect of the correlation between age and covariates of interest is likely to be worse with larger correlations, we focused on simulated covariates that correlated with age with an r of up to 0.3.</p>

This is comparable to the cross-validated performance on the training set, where MAE was 5.1 years and R<sup>2</sup> was 0.59. The correlation between age and predicted age was 0.82. On the other hand, regression towards the mean lead to a negative relationship between age and BrainAGE (r &#x003D; -0.63, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>).

<title>Relationships among age-covariate, covariate-BrainAGE, and covariate-BrainAGER correlations</title>
<p>In order to investigate the effect that the correlation between BrainAGE and chronological age can have on the conclusions of an imaging study, we computed the correlations between each of the covariates and age, BrainAGE and BrainAGER. Larger age-covariate correlations lead to larger differences in measured correlation between that covariate and BrainAGER or BrainAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>, colored points far from the 45&#x00B0; line). When age did not correlate with a covariate, BrainAGE and BrainAGER tended to give similar results (grey points, near the 45&#x00B0; line). When age positively correlated with covariates (<italic>e.g.</italic>, BMI), BrainAGER gave more positive values, and when age negatively correlated with covariates (<italic>e.g.</italic>, PROMIS physical function), BrainAGER yields more negative values. Similarly, the greater the variance explained by age, the greater the squared difference in r between using BrainAGE or BrainAGER (3b).</p>

<title>Reduction of false discoveries in regression that include age as explanatory variable</title>
<p>In the linear models regressing BrainAGE on the 16 covariates of interest with simulated large effect sizes (FC &#x003D; 1.255), we observed the following: when age was not included as an explanatory variable, many age-related covariates were shown to have statistically significant association with BrainAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a, c</xref>), even when they did not contribute to the weights that made up the neuroimaging features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, <bold>orange</bold> boxplots above the horizontal). These false positives (FP) were simply the result of the relationship between these covariates and chronological age that are part of the BrainAGE&#x2019;s defining formula. Moreover, several covariates that were simulated to contribute to the brain structure volumes had p-values on average above 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>, <bold>blue</bold> boxplots below the horizontal).</p>

Further, the decrease in significance (increase in p-values) for unrelated covariates indicated a significant decrease in the number of false positives. Variation in the p-values across covariates came from their different (linear and nonlinear) age dependencies and effects on volumetric variation. In other words, the real &#x201C;significance&#x201D; of a covariate depended on from which age basis functions it was generated and how it affected the brain features (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>1k</italic></sub>, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>2k</italic></sub> or <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>3k</italic></sub>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study aims to highlight the relationship between chronological age and BrainAGE and its transitive effect on the relationship between BrainAGE and covariates of interest that are also related to age. We propose a solution to this problem: either use BrainAGER, or in the simple case of post-hoc linear regression, use chronological age as a covariate in subsequent analyses. We developed a simulation framework to generate data with complex, but known, relationships between the original imaging features, age, and a set of covariates that may also be related to age. Then, we were able to quantify the effect that accounting for age has on the ability to detect actual and spurious correlations with covariates in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>Our main findings can be separated into three parts: analytical, empirical, and simulated data results. The analytical results provide a theoretical basis for the age-BrainAGE correlation, and the analyses using real and simulated data demonstrate this effect in practice. For the empirical data, there were three main findings: 1) many variables that may be of interest are correlated with age with Pearson coefficients of up to r &#x003D; 0.3, 2) BrainAGE is strongly negatively correlated with chronological age (r &#x003D; -0.63 in our dataset), 3) BrainAGER provides a measure of deviation between predicted and actual age that is not dependent on age, and has substantially different correlations with covariates that are correlated with age when compared to BrainAGE.</p>
<p>Since it is unknown which covariates are actually related to premature aging, we then developed a simulation framework to generate synthetic data. Simulated data showed: 1) similar characteristics to actual data when used to train and test a model on separate datasets, and 2) increased detectability of true positives and decreased occurrence of false positives when accounting for the age-covariate relationship, with this being modulated by the size of the simulated effect on physiology.</p>
<p>Based on our observations in both real and simulated data, we recommend that the relationship between chronological age and BrainAGE should be accounted for. The two methods proposed in this study are either: 1) regress age on BrainAGE, producing BrainAGER, which is centered on 0 regardless of a participant&#x2019;s actual age or 2) include age as a regressor when doing follow-up analyses. In fact, these two methods will produce the same coefficients in the case of linear regression, with slightly larger t-statistics in the second case. The advantage of using BrainAGER is simplicity and generalizability; it could be used as the dependent variable in any arbitrary model, rather than being confined to simple linear regression. While the focus of this study is not to show specific correlates of premature aging, it is worth noting that 17 variables significantly correlated to BrainAGE whereas only 6 were related to BrainAGER, with 1 variable (PROMIS Alcohol Negative Consequences) overlapping between the two sets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, accounting for the age-BrainAGE relationship results in a vastly different set of positive findings and would lead to a remarkably different interpretation of these data. More explicitly, not correcting the age-BrainAGE correlation would lead to an extensive set of spurious results in this dataset.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are a few cases where the age-BrainAGE correlation is not relevant. When comparing two groups with matched age, any differences in BrainAGE are not likely to be caused by the relationship with age. When the individuals being examined are in a restricted age range, there is not likely to be much contribution from the age-BrainAGE correlation. Also, when the variable of interest is not related to age, removing the effect of age makes almost no difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3b</xref>). However, when these cases are not true, our findings suggest that we should include age as an explanatory variable in a final model that aims to detect association of brain anomalies with covariates of interest.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the age-BrainAGE correlation is directly related to the accuracy of the prediction model. The fact that the residuals are correlated with observed values is a characteristic of regression in general, regardless of the specific data domain, and has a theoretical basis described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2a">section 2.1</xref>. Several factors may decrease the model performance on our testing set, and thereby increase the age-BrainAGE correlation. Specifically, the distribution of age ranges in our samples is non-uniform, which may lead to more weight being given to the middle of the distribution. There are substantial differences between the testing and training sets we used including age, sex, and diagnosis. It may therefore be possible to improve model performance on the testing set by subsampling the training set to have a more uniform distribution of ages and to match the testing set on several factors. However, model performance is already comparable across testing and training sets (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.59 and MAE of 5.1 years, compared to 0.64 and 4.84) and is comparable with what has been previously reported.</p>
<p>Although the simulation was carefully designed and executed, because of the model&#x2019;s complexity, we have not fully explored all scenarios with different simulation parameters. However, we have identified effect size as the most important parameter and showed how it influenced the results. When varying other parameters, we still observed a reduction in the number of false positives when age is included as an explanatory variable in the final regression (results not shown). Moreover, while determining the parameters, we aimed to obtain realistic patterns as we observed in real data, such as similar distributions of the correlation values.</p>
<p>By constructing and studying an appropriate generative model containing covariates that have linear and non-linear relationship with age, we demonstrated that the correlation between covariates and age should be considered when making inferences about the relationship between BrainAGE and these covariates.</p>
