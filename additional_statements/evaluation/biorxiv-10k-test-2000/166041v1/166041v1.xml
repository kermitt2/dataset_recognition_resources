<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Human herpesviruses 6A and 6B (HHV6-A and HHV-6B; species <italic>Human herpesvirus 6A</italic> and <italic>Human herpesvirus 6B</italic>) have the capacity to integrate into telomeres, the essential capping structures of chromosomes that play roles in cancer and ageing. About 1&#x0025; of people worldwide are carriers of chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (ciHHV-6), which is inherited as a genetic trait. Understanding the consequences of integration for the evolution of the viral genome, for the telomere and for the risk of disease associated with carrier status is hampered by a lack of knowledge about ciHHV-6 genomes. Here, we report an analysis of 28 ciHHV-6 genomes and show that they are significantly divergent from the few modern non-integrated HHV-6 strains for which complete sequences are currently available. In addition ciHHV-6B genomes in Europeans are more closely related to each other than to ciHHV-6B genomes from China and Pakistan, suggesting regional variation of the trait. Remarkably, at least one group of European ciHHV-6B carriers has inherited the same ciHHV-6B genome, integrated in the same telomere allele, from a common ancestor estimated to have existed 24,500 &#x00B1;10,600 years ago. Despite the antiquity of some, and possibly most, germline HHV-6 integrations, the majority of ciHHV-6B (95&#x0025;) and ciHHV-6A (72&#x0025;) genomes contain a full set of intact viral genes and therefore appear to have the capacity for viral gene expression and full reactivation.</p>
<sec>
<title>IMPORTANCE</title>
<p>Inheritance of HHV-6A or HHV-6B integrated into a telomere occurs at a low frequency in most populations studied to date but its characteristics are poorly understood. However, stratification of ciHHV-6 carriers in modern populations due to common ancestry is an important consideration for genome-wide association studies that aim to identify disease risks for these people. Here we present full sequence analysis of 28 ciHHV-6 genomes and show that ciHHV-6B in many carriers with European ancestry most likely originated from ancient integration events in a small number of ancestors. We propose that ancient ancestral origins for ciHHV-6A and ciHHV-6B are also likely in other populations. Moreover, despite their antiquity, all of the ciHHV-6 genomes appear to retain the capacity to express viral genes and most are predicted to be capable of full viral reactivation. These discoveries represent potentially important considerations in immune-compromised patients, in particular in organ transplantation and in stem cell therapy.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Given the complex roles that human telomeres play in cancer initiation and progression and in ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), it is remarkable that the genomes of human herpesviruses 6A and 6B (HHV6-A and HHV-6B; species <italic>Human herpesvirus 6A</italic> and <italic>Human herpesvirus 6B</italic>) can integrate and persist within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Human telomeres comprise double-stranded DNA primarily composed of variable lengths of (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> repeats and terminated by a 50-300 nucleotide (nt) 3&#x2019; single-strand extension of the G-rich strand. Telomeres, bound to a six-protein complex called shelterin, cap the ends of chromosomes and prevent inappropriate double-strand break repair. They also provide a solution to the &#x2018;end replication problem&#x2019; via the enzyme telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>The double-stranded DNA genomes of HHV-6A and HHV-6B consist of a long unique region (U; 143-145 kb) encoding many functional open reading frames (ORFs U2-U100), flanked by identical left and right direct repeats (DR<sub>L</sub> and DR<sub>R</sub>; 8-10 kb) encoding two ORFs (DR1 and DR6). Each DR also contains near its ends two variable regions of telomere-like repeat arrays (T1 and T2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), terminated by the viral genome packaging sequences (PAC1 and PAC2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Telomeric integration by HHV-6A or HHV-6B (yielding chromosomally integrated HHV-6, ciHHV-6) results in loss of the terminal PAC2 sequence at the fusion point between the telomere and DR<sub>R</sub>-T2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) and loss of the DR<sub>L</sub>-PAC1 sequence at the other end of the integrated viral genome when the DR<sub>L</sub>-T1 degenerate telomere-like repeat region becomes part of a newly formed telomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>)).</p>

<p>Once the HHV-6 genome has integrated in the germline it can be passed from parent to child, behaving essentially as a Mendelian trait (inherited ciHHV-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The telomere carrying the ciHHV-6 genome shows instability in somatic cells, which can result in the partial or complete release of the viral genome as circular DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). This could represent the first step towards viral reactivation, and in this respect telomeric integration may be a form of HHV-6 latency. To date, reactivation of ciHHV-6 has been demonstrated in two settings: first, in a child with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency who was also a carrier of inherited ciHHV-6A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>); and second, upon transplacental transmission from two ciHHV-6 carrier mothers to their non-carrier babies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that ciHHV-6 carriers bear an increased risk of angina pectoris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), although it is not known whether this arises from viral reactivation, a deleterious effect on the telomere carrying the viral genome, or some other mechanism.</p>
<p>A small proportion of people worldwide are carriers of inherited ciHHV-6A or -6B but very little is known about the HHV-6 genomes that they harbor, although that may influence any associated disease risk. To investigate ciHHV-6 genomic diversity and evolution, the frequency of independent germline integrations, and the potential functionality of the integrated viral genomes, we analysed 28 ciHHV-6 genomes. We discovered that ciHHV-6 genomes are more similar to one another than to the few sequenced reference HHV-6 genomes from non-integrated viruses. This is particularly marked among the ciHHV-6B genomes from Europeans. We also found that a subset of ciHHV-6B carriers from England, Orkney and Sardinia are most likely descendents from a single ancient ancestor. Despite the apparent antiquity of some, possibly most, ciHHV-6 genomes, we concluded that the majority contain a full set of intact HHV-6 genes and therefore in principle retain the capacity to generate viable viruses.</p>

<title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Population screening to identify ciHHV-6 carriers</title>
<p>ciHHV-6 carriers were identified by screening a variety of DNA sample collections of individuals from across the world, using PCR assays to detect either U11, U18, DR5 (HHV-6A) or DR7 (HHV-6B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), or U7, DR1, DR6A or DR6B ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and manuscript in preparation). DR5, DR6A, DR6B and DR7 correspond to ORFs in the original annotation of the HHV-6A genome (GenBank accession X83413 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>)), but DR5 is in a non-coding region of the genome, and DR6A, DR6B and DR7 are in exons of DR6 in the reannotation used (RefSeq accession NC_001664). From the populations screened, 58 samples with ciHHV-6 among 3875 individuals were identified (Supplementary Table 1). The number of individuals screened in most populations was small and therefore cannot be used to give an accurate estimate of ciHHV-6A or -B frequencies, although a larger number of ciHHV-6B-positive samples was identified overall. The frequency of ciHHV-6B carriers in Orkney (1.9&#x0025;), a collection of islands off the north coast of Scotland, is higher than that reported from England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Screening of the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) will be described elsewhere (RFJ manuscript in preparation). Ethical approval for the GS:SFHS cohort was obtained from the Tayside Committee on Medical Research Ethics (on behalf of the National Health Service).</p>

<title>Generation of overlapping amplicons and sequencing</title>
<p>The 32 primer pairs used to generate overlapping amplicons from ciHHV-6A genomes, and the PCR conditions employed, were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The primer pairs used to amplify ciHHV-6B genomes were based on conserved sequences from the HHV-6B non-integrated HST and Z29 strains (Genbank accessions AB021506.1 and AF157706 respectively; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table S2. The amplicons from each sample were pooled in equimolar proportions and then sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq or IonTorrent (Life Technologies) next-generation sequencing platforms, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Some sequences were verified by using Sanger dideoxy chain termination sequencing on PCR-amplified products.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Assembly and analysis of DNA sequence data</title>
<p>DNA sequence data were processed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), except that SPAdes v. 3.5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) was used for <italic>de novo</italic> assembly into contigs, ABACAS v. 1.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) was used to order contigs, and Gapfiller v. 1-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) was used to fill gaps between contigs. The integrity of the sequences was verified by aligning them against the read data using BWA v. 0.6.2-r126 and visualizing the alignments as BAM files using Tablet v. 1.13.08.05. Nucleotide substitutions, indels and repeat regions were also verified by manual analysis using IGV v. 2.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/home">http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/home</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Alignments of the seven iciHHV-6A genomes with the three published HHV-6A genomes from non-integrated strains U1102, GS and AJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and alignment of the 21 iciHHV-6B genomes with the two previously published HHV-6B genomes from non-integrated viruses HST and Z29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) were carried out by using Gap4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Variation across the iciHHV-6 genomes was studied by a combination of manual inspection and automated analysis by using an in-house Perl script. The script performed a sliding window count of substitutions using the aligned GAP4 files, reporting the count according to the mid-point of the window. For analysis across the genome, the window size was 1 kb and the step size was 1 nucleotide. For analysis of individual ORFs, a file with a list of annotated positions was generated.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using two different methods. Maximum likelihood trees were built by using the Maximum Composite Likelihood model (MEGA6.0) and bootstrap values obtained with 2000 replications. Model selection was carried out for HHV-6A and HHV-6B separately, and the substitution model with the lowest Bayesian information criterion was selected (the Tamura 3-parameter model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) for HHV-6B and the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model for HHV-6A). Median-joining networks were built by using Network 5.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fluxus-engineering.com">www.fluxus-engineering.com</ext-link>) with default parameters. Sites with missing data were excluded from all phylogenetic analyses for both HHV-6A and HHV-6B. The number of positions analysed for HHV-6B was 130412, and that for HHV-6A was 117900. Time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was calculated by using rho as implemented in Network 5.0. Rho values were transformed into time values by using the accepted mutation rate for the human genome, 0.5E-09 substitutions per bp per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), scaled to the number of sites analysed.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Comparison of tandem repeat regions</title>
<p>The copy number of repeat units in the DR-R, R0, R1, R2, R3 and R4 tandem repeat regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) were determined by manual inspection of the individual BAM files generated for each sequenced ciHHV-6 genome, with verification by checking the sequence alignments generated using Gap4. The numbers of copies of TTAGGG in each DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 region was determined from PCR amplicons generated using the DR8F and UDL6R primers (Supplementary Table S2). Each amplicon was purified using a Zymoclean&#x2122; gel DNA recovery kit, and then sequenced using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method. The sequence data were analysed using MacVector software. Variation at the (CA)<sub>n</sub> repeat array located immediately adjacent to T1 in HHV-6B was investigated in DR<sub>L</sub> specifically by reamplification of single telomere length analysis (STELA) products, using the primers DR1R and TJ1F. The short amplicons were purified and sequenced as above and compared with the same sequence in the reference HST and Z29 genomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Analysis of DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 region by TVR-PCR</title>
<p>The DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 regions from ciHHV-6B positive samples were amplified using the primers U100Fw2 and DR1R. Telomere variant repeat mapping by PCR (TVR-PCR) was conducted on each of these amplicons essentially as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) but using an end-labeled primer, HHV-6B-UDR5F and the unlabeled TAG-TELWRev. The TELWRev primer anneals to TTAGGG repeats allowing amplification of products that differ in length depending on the location of the TTAGGG repeat with respect to the flanking primer (HHV-6B-UDR5F). The labeled amplicons from the T1 region were size separated in a 6&#x0025; denaturing polyacrylamide gel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Analysis of HHV-6 ORFs</title>
<p>The frequency of nucleotide substitutions in each ORF was determined by a combination of manual inspection and automated analysis using a Perl script, as described above. The DNA sequences of each of the 86 HHV-6B ORFs from the 21 ciHHV-6B genomes were aligned to identify and compare the number of synonymous and non-synonymous codon changes within and among genes. In addition the predicted amino acid sequences for each gene in the 21 ciHHV-6B genomes were aligned to confirm the number of non-synonymous changes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Characterisation of chromosome-ciHHV-6 junctions</title>
<p>The junctions between the chromosome and the ciHHV-6 genome were isolated by PCR amplification using various primers that anneal to subterminal regions of a variety of human chromosomes in combination with the DR8F primer. The amplicons were purified as described above and sequenced by using the Sanger method with a variety of primers (Supplementary Table S2). The number of repeats present in each junction fragment and the interspersion of TTAGGG repeats with degenerate repeats was determined by manual inspection using the MacVector software.</p>

<title>Selection of ciHHV-6 carriers and sequence analysis of viral genomes</title>
<p>To investigate sequence variation among ciHHV-6 genomes, 28 samples were selected for analysis: seven with ciHHV-6A (including LEI-1501 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>)) and 21 with ciHHV-6B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The selected samples were identified in the various populations screened (Supplementary Table S1), and included additional individuals from the London area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), Scotland and the north of England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), the Leicester area of England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and the GS: SFHS (RJF manuscript in preparation). The chromosomal location of ciHHV-6 genomes, determined by fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (FISH), was available for some samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). For other samples the junction between the viral DR8 sequence (a non-coding region near one end of DR) and the chromosome subtelomeric region was isolated by PCR and sequenced (discussed below). Integration of each ciHHV-6 genome was confirmed by detection of a telomere at DR<sub>L</sub>-T1 using STELA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), or by detection of at least one copy per cell using droplet digital PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>

Full sets of HHV-6 amplicons were readily generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and Supplementary Table S2), demonstrating the robustness of this approach for enriching HHV-6 sequences from ciHHV-6 carriers. The HHV-6 amplicons generated from each carrier had the expected sizes, with variation only in amplicons encompassing repetitive regions (e.g. the DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 region of degenerate telomere-like repeats). This observation indicated that all of the ciHHV-6 genomes are essentially intact, with the exception of the terminal DR<sub>R</sub>-PAC2 and DR<sub>L</sub>-PAC1 sequences lost during integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>The ciHHV-6 genome sequences were determined by short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) with some verification by the Sanger method. De novo assemblies of each genome were generated with few gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The finished sequences were annotated and deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KY316030-KY316056. The ciHHV-6A genome reported previously by us was included in these analyses (LEI-1501, KT355575; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>)).</p>

<title>Sequence similarity is greater among ciHHV-6 genomes than to non-integrated HHV-6 genomes</title>
<p>Nucleotide substitution frequencies were analysed across the DR and U regions of the HHV-6B genome (excluding the tandem repeat regions R-DR, R0, R1, R2, R3 and R4, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>)) for each sequenced ciHHV-6B genome in comparison with the two available HHV-6B reference genomes from non-integrated strains (HST from Japan, GenBank accession AB021506, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) and Z29 from Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.Congo), GenBank accession AF157706, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>)). The ciHHV-6B genomes show different patterns of variation from the reference genomes, with greater divergence from strain Z29 in the distal portion of the U region (120-150 kb) and across DR (1-8 kb), reaching a maximum of 35 substitutions per kb in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Overall, there is less divergence from strain HST, although the frequency of substitutions is higher in part of the U region (45-64 kb) compared to strain Z29. To assess sequence variation among the ciHHV-6B genomes, comparisons were made using the genome in HAPMAP NA10863 (CEPH1375.02) as a reference. The substitution frequency is considerably less across the viral genomes for 18/20 of the ciHHV-6B genomes from individuals with European ancestry, indicating greater similarity among them. Notably, the other two ciHHV-6B genomes that showed a higher substitution frequency in this comparison were in individuals from Pakistan and China, HGDP00092 and HGDP00813, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Nucleotide substitution frequencies were also analysed across each of the seven ciHHV-6A genomes in comparison with three non-integrated HHV-6A reference genomes (strain U1102 from Uganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) (accession X83413, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>)); strain GS from the USA (accessions KC465951.1 (GS1) and KJ123690.1 (GS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)) and strain AJ from the Gambia (accession KP257584.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>)). This analysis shows that the ciHHV-6A genomes have similar levels of divergence from each reference genome from non-integrated HHV-6A and that divergence is highest across DR and the distal part of U (120-149 kb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Comparisons with the ciHHV-6A LEI-1501 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) as a reference, also showed greater similarity among the ciHHV-6A genomes although the substitution frequencies are higher than among European ciHHV-6B genomes, indicating greater diversity among the ciHHV-6A genomes sequenced here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Notably the ciHHV-6A in the Japanese individual (HAPMAP NA18999) shows greater divergence from the other ciHHV-6A samples of European origin.</p>
<p>In summary, comparisons of nucleotide substitution frequencies show that the viral genomes in ciHHV-6B carriers are more similar to each other than they are to reference genomes derived from clinical isolates of non-integrated HHV-6B from Japan (HST) and D.R.Congo (Z29). The ciHHV-6A genomes are also more similar to each other than they are to the three HHV-6A reference genomes, although this is less pronounced than seen among the ciHHV-6B genomes.</p>

<p>To explore variation only within HHV-6B genes, the frequency of substitutions in ORFs of each of the 21 ciHHV-6B genomes were compared with those in the HST and Z29 reference genomes and the ciHHV-6B genome in HAPMAP NA10863 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The patterns of variation were similar to those observed across the whole genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>) and consistent with the phylogenetic analysis showing greater similarity among ciHHV-6B in Europeans and with the subgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of specific genes, which were selected because they show greater sequence variation from the reference genomes or among the ciHHV-6B genomes, generated a variety of trees that are generally consistent with the phylogenetic analysis based on the U region but exhibited less discrimination between samples or groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> and Supplementary Fig. S2). For example, the phylogenetic tree based on U90 separates the European ciHHV-6B samples from the ciHHV-6B samples from China and Pakistan and from the HST and Z29 reference genomes but does not subdivide the European ciHHV-6B samples.</p>

<p>Phylogenetic analysis of the seven ciHHV-6A genomes and four reference genomes (U1102 (Uganda), AJ (Gambia) and two sequences from GS (USA)) shows a clear separation between the integrated and non-integrated genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref> and D), with two pairs of closely related ciHHV-6A genomes (LEI-1501 and GLA_25506; 7A-17p13.3 and GLA_15137). A similar separation of the integrated versus non-integrated genomes is also evident in the phylogenetic analysis of DR alone, irrespective of the geographic origin of the individual ciHHV-6A carrier (Supplementary Fig. S1).</p>
<p>Variation within HHV-6A genes was also explored by plotting base substitution frequency per ORF for each of the seven ciHHV-6A samples in comparison to the three reference genomes and the ciHHV-6A genome in LEI_1501 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The patterns of variation are similar to those observed across the whole genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of U83, U90 and DR6, selected because they show greater sequence variation, generally support the phylogenetic trees and networks generated from analysis of the Uand DR regions (Supplementary Fig. S3).</p>
<p>Overall, the sequence variation and phylogenetic analyses indicate a divergence between the integrated and non-integrated HHV-6 genomes but with some differences between the HHV-6A and HHV-6B. The ciHHV-6B samples from individuals with European ancestry showed divergence from both HST (Japan) and Z29 (D.R.Congo) reference genomes although the pattern of divergence varies across the genome. The 21 ciHHV-6B genomes from individuals with European ancestry are more similar to one another than to the ciHHV-6B genomes from China and Pakistan and can be subdivided into distinct groups. There is greater divergence among the seven ciHHV-6A genomes than among the ciHHV-6B genomes but despite this two pairs of closely related ciHHV-6A genomes were identified.</p>
<p>From these analyses we concluded that the three groups of closely related ciHHV-6B genomes and the pairs of ciHHV-6A genomes identified in the phylogenetic networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref> and D, respectively) could represent independent integrations by closely related strains of HHV-6B or HHV-6A. Alternatively, each group might have arisen from a single integration event, with members sharing a common ancestor. Further analyses were undertaken to explore these possibilities.</p>

<title>Comparison of tandem repeat regions in ciHHV-6 genomes</title>
<p>Tandem repeat arrays within the human genome often show length variation as a consequence of changes to the number of repeat units present (copy number variation). The greater allelic diversity in these regions reflects the underlying replication-dependent mutation processes in tandem repeat arrays, which occur at a higher rate than base substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). To explore diversity among the ciHHV-6B genomes further, tandem repeat regions distributed across the viral genome were investigated. The R-DR, R2A, R2B and R4 repeat regions analysed (location shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>) showed little or no copy number variation among the ciHHV-6B and non-integrated reference genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Copy number variation at R1 (location shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>) was greater but did not show a clear relationship with strains of ciHHV-6B or non-integrated HHV-6B. Greater copy number variation was detected at the pure array of TTAGGG repeats at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 (location shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>) with the largest number of repeats in the HHV-6B Z29 reference genome and ciHHV-6B in HGDP00813 from China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Ancestry of ciHHV-6B carriers in group 3</title>
<p>The repeat copy number variation observed within and among groups may have arisen before or after telomeric integration of the viral genome. To investigate further how many different integration events may have occurred among the ciHHV-6B carriers, we isolated and sequenced fragments containing the junction between the human chromosome and the ciHHV-6B genome, in addition to using the cytogenetic locations published previously for some samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>)). The junction fragments were isolated by a trial-and-error approach, using PCR between a primer mapping in DR8 in DR<sub>R</sub> and a variety of primers known to anneal to different subtelomeric sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>), including primers that anneal to the subterminal region of some but not all copies of chromosome 17p (17p311 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) and subT17-539 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>)). There was insufficient DNA for analysis from the sequenced ORCA1340 (singleton) or the ORCA1622 and ORCA3835 (group 3) samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, analysis of DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 and the other repeats showed that the 42 ciHHV-6B carriers from Orkney fall into two groups, that share the same length at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 with either ORCA1340 or with ORCA1622 and ORCA3835 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). For junction fragment analysis, we selected ORCA1006 as a substitute for ORCA1340, since it shares the same DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 length. Similarly, ORCA1043, ORCA2119 and ORCA1263 were used as substitutes for ORCA1622 and ORCA3835, since they share a different DR<sub>R</sub>-TI length. Using the chromosome 17p primers, junction fragments were generated from all the group 3 ciHHV-6B samples and from 1-ciHHV-6B (a singleton in the phylogenetic network, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). PCR products were not amplified using these primers from other ciHHV-6B samples in this study or from another sample with a reported location at 17p (5B-17p13.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), data not shown). The sequences of seven junction fragments from group 3 ciHHV-6B genomes (including NWA008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), which is another ciHHV-6B carrier having a viral genome that belongs to group 3 (data not shown)) were similar to each other but different from the fragment in sample 1-ciHHV-6B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>).

<p>Comparison of the junction fragments from group 3 ciHHV-6B samples shows remarkably similar TTAGGG and degenerate repeat interspersion patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). The differences among the interspersion patterns are consistent with small gains or losses that may have arisen from replication errors in the germline, after integration of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Therefore, it is most likely that the ciHHV-6B status of group 3 individuals arose from a single ancestral integration event. Using the levels of nucleotide substitution between the group 3 ciHHV-6B genomes, the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was estimated as 24,538 &#x00B1;10,625 years ago (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). This estimate is based on the assumption that once integrated the ciHHV-6B genome mutates at the same average rate for the human genome however, deviation from this would result in an under or over estimation of the TMRCA.</p>

<title>Genetic intactness of ciHHV-6 genomes</title>
<p>The evidence for an ancient origin of some, probably most, of the ciHHV-6B genomes analysed, and for post-integration mutations in repeat regions raised the question of whether these genomes contain an intact set of viral genes or whether they have been rendered non-functional by mutation. To explore the consequence of sequence variation among the ciHHV6B genomes, the amino acid sequences predicted from all genes in the ciHHV-6B genomes were aligned, and the cumulative frequencies of independent synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>). The ratio of synonymous:non-synonymous substitutions varies among genes. The great majority of non-synonymous changes (amounting to 34&#x0025; of the total) result in single amino acid substitutions, but one substitution in the U20 stop codon of HGDP00092 is predicted to extend the coding region by eight codons. Only one substitution, which creates an in-frame stop codon in U14 of 1-ciHHV-6B, is predicted to terminate a coding region prematurely. Two of the seven ciHHV-6A genomes also have in-frame stop codons, one in U79 of GLA_15137 and the other in U83 genes of GLA_4298 (data not shown).</p>

<p>The 21 iciHHV-6B genomes are likely to include mutations that arose before integration and represent variation among the parental non-integrated HHV-6B strains, as well as mutations that arose after integration. To explore the latter, five group 3 ciHHV-6B genomes were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Among the ten substitutions identified, three were in non-coding regions, one was a synonymous mutation in U77, and six were non-synonymous mutations. From these limited data, it seems likely that the accumulation of mutations after integration has been random in these ciHHV-6B genomes.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this study we have used comparative analyses to explore diversity among ciHHV-6 genomes, to understand the factors that influence the population frequencies of ciHHV-6 and to determine whether the integrated genomes retain the capacity for full functionality as a virus. We have found that the ciHHV-6B genomes are more similar to each another than to the two available HHV-6B reference genomes from Japan and D.R.Congo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S1). This is particularly noticeable among the 19 ciHHV-6B genomes from individuals with European ancestry, which are more similar to each other than they are to the ciHHV-6B genomes in HGDP00092 from Pakistan and HGDP00813 from China. This pointer towards a relationship between the integrated HHV-6B strain and geographical distribution warrants further investigation, if the association between carrier status and potential disease risk is to be understood fully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). The smaller group of seven ciHHV-6A genomes show higher levels of divergence from the three available HHV-6A reference genomes from the USA, Uganda and the Gambia. However, in making these observations, the possibility of sample bias should be considered, both in the geographic distribution of ciHHV-6 genomes analysed and, in particular, in the small number of non-integrated HHV-6A and HHV-6B genomes that are available for comparative analysis.</p>
<p>The isolation of chromosome junction fragments from eight ciHHV-6B samples (seven group 3 samples and 1-ciHHV-6B) by using primers from chromosome 17p subterminal sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) suggests integration in alleles of the 17p telomere. Given the variable nature of human subterminal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), the chromosome locations should be confirmed using a different approach. Nevertheless, comparison of the TTAGGG and degenerate repeat interspersion patterns at the chromosome-ciHHV-6B junction can be used to deduce relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) and, combined with the phylogenetic analyses, show that the individuals carrying a group 3 ciHHV-6B genome share an ancient ancestor. Group 3 includes individuals from Sardinia, England, Wales and Orkney, with greater divergence between the ciHHV-6B genomes in the two individuals from Sardinia (HGDP1065 and HGDP1077) than between the individual from Derby, England (DER512) and the Sardinian (HGDP1065) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). Moreover there is no evidence of a close family relationship between the two individuals from Sardinia. Overall the data are consistent with the group 3 ciHHV-6B carriers being descendants of a common ancestor who existed approximately 24,500 years ago, similar to the date of the last glacial maximum and probably predating the colonization of Sardinia and Orkney.</p>
<p>The population screen of Orkney identified 42 ciHHV-6B carriers (frequency 1.9&#x0025;, Supplementary Table S1) and no ciHHV-6A carriers, which also suggests a founder effect. However, the Orkney ciHHV-6B samples can be divided into two groups, based on the length of DR<sub>R</sub>-T1, the ciHHV-6B phylogenetic analyses and the different integration sites. Therefore, it is likely that the ciHHV-6B carriers in Orkney are the descendants of two different ciHHV-6B ancestors, who may have migrated to Orkney independently. This is consistent with the fine resolution genetic structure of the Orkney population and the history of Orkney, which includes recent admixture from Norway (Norse-Vikings) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the evidence that extant ciHHV-6B carriers in group 3 are descendants of a single ancient founder with a germline integration, it is plausible that other clusters in the phylogenetic tree have a similar history. For example the three individuals in group 2 may all carry a ciHHV-6B integrated in a chromosome 11p telomere. Further verification is required to support this speculation, and this will be valuable when assessing disease risk associated with ciHHV-6 integrations in different telomeres.</p>
<p>There is good evidence that ciHHV-6 genomes can reactivate in some settings, for example when the immune system is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). However, it is not known what proportion of ciHHV-6 genomes retain the capacity to reactivate. We investigated this question from various angles. We presented evidence that some ciHHV-6 genomes are ancient and therefore could have accumulated inactivating mutations while in the human genome. Most of the tandem repeats analysed in ciHHV-6B genomes showed minor variations in repeat copy numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). However, the function of these regions is unclear, and as copy number variation exits among the reference genomes, it is unlikely that the level of variation detected unduly influences the functionality of the viral genome. In the protein-coding regions of ciHHV-6B genomes, 34&#x0025; of substitutions are non-synonymous and are predicted to cause amino acid substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). A single potentially inactivating mutation was detected as an in-frame stop codon in gene U14 in 1-ciHHV-6B. Since this gene encodes a tegument protein that is essential for the production of viral particles and can induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), it seems unlikely that this integrated copy of ciHHV-6B would be able to reactivate. However, the other viral genes may be expressed in this ciHHV-6B genome and the presence of the viral genome may also affect telomere function. The stop codon in gene U20 in the individual from Pakistan (HGDP00092) is mutated, and this is predicted to extend the U20 protein by eight amino acid residues. U20 is part of a cluster of genes (U20-U24) that are specific to HHV-6A, HHV-6B and their relative human herpesvirus 7, and likely plays a role in suppressing an apoptotic response by the infected host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Further experimental analysis will be required to determine whether the extension affects the function of the U20 protein. Among the seven ciHHV-6A genomes, two contain novel in-frame stop codons. One of these is located in U83 in GLA_4298. The other is present in U79 in GLA_15137, but this inactivating mutation is absent from the closely related ciHHV-6A genome in 7A-17p13.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C and D</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we have shown that most ciHHV-6A and ciHHV-6B genomes contain an intact set of genes and therefore may have the potential to be fully functional. This observation needs to be taken into consideration when assessing whether ciHHV-6 carrier status is associated with disease risk and in understanding the underlying mechanisms of such associations (e.g. whether viral reactivation is involved). Among the individuals of European descent, we found strong evidence for the ancient common ancestry of some of the integrated viral genomes. The close similarity between ciHHV-6B genomes in the Europeans and the evidence of multiple different integration events by similar strains also indicate that we have effectively sequenced the ancient, non-integrated strains of HHV-6B that existed in European populations in prehistoric times. Based on these observations, it is possible that other populations, for example in China, South Asia and Africa, may show similar founder effects among ciHHV-6 carriers but from different ancient strains. Our limited knowledge of non-integrated HHV-6A and HHV-6B strains is based mostly on strains derived from Africa and Japan. There is now a real need to sequence non-integrated strains from other populations, including those in Europe, so that the relationship between non-integrated HHV-6 and ciHHV-6 can be fully understood. A major challenge will be to determine whether germline integration continues to occur <italic>de novo</italic> today, and, if so, at what rate and by which viral strains.</p>
