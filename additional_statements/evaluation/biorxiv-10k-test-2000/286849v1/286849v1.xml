<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The RsMYB1 transcription factor (TF) controls the regulation of anthocyanin in radish (<italic>Raphanus sativus</italic>), and its overexpression in tobacco and petunia strongly enhances anthocyanin production. However, no data exists on whether RsMYB1 is involved in the mechanism that leads to abiotic stress tolerance. Under normal conditions, transgenic petunia plants expressing RsMYB1 and WT were able to thrive by producing well-developed broad leaves and regular roots. In contrast, a reduction in plant growth was observed when they were exposed to heavy metals (CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, MnSO<sub>4</sub>, and K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>). However, RsMYB1-overexpressing plants were found to be more tolerant to the stresses than the WT plants because the expressions of stress tolerant genes (<italic>GSH</italic> and <italic>PCs</italic>) and antioxidant genes (<italic>SOD, CAT</italic>, and <italic>POX</italic>) were enhanced. In addition, according to the phylogenetic analysis, RsMYB1 has a strong sequence similarity with other MYB TFs that confer different abiotic stresses. These results suggest that overexpression of RsMYB1 enhances the expression levels of metal-induced stress tolerance genes and antioxidant genes, and the resultant increase in gene expression improves heavy metal stress tolerance in petunia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heavy metals naturally occur in the earth&#x2019;s crust. However, excess levels of the heavy metals due to natural or anthropogenic activities negatively affect living organisms. Over the past few decades, industrialization and the application of modern agricultural practices has increased worldwide, which has led to the contamination of cultivatable land with heavy metals released from agro-chemicals and from industrial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). Generally, some heavy metals, such as Zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and manganese (Mn), play an important role in plant physiological and biochemical processes, such as chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and DNA synthesis, etc. (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). For example, Zn has roles in the maintenance of membrane integrity, auxin metabolism, and reproduction because it interacts with enzymes and transcription factors associated with the mechanisms underlying these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Williams and Pittman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Prasad, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ricachenevsky et al., 2013</xref>). However, the toxic effects of the heavy metals at elevated concentrations have also been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fontes and Cox, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lewis et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Warne et al., 2008</xref>). Zinc at elevated concentrations can stop plant metabolic functions and causes growth retardation and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fontes and Cox, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Warne et al., 2008</xref>). It has also been reported that high Cu concentrations cause a similar range of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lewis et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, elevated Mn concentrations are toxic to many plant species (Rezia et al 2005; Izaguirre-Mayoral et al. 2008) and elevated Cr negatively affects cell division, and root and stem growth in many plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shanker et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zou et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fozia et al., 2008</xref>). Overall, these metals at elevated concentrations lowered biomass accumulation and crop productivity by inhibiting several plant mechanisms. Theoretically, the presence of excess heavy metals limits CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and reduces the photosynthetic electron transport chains in chloroplasts and mitochondria, which leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage plant cells and growth, which leads to reduced crop yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Davidson and Schiestl, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mittler et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Keunen et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand how plants respond to heavy metal stress physiologically and molecularly, and to develop plants that can resist stress-induced ROS so that crop productivity can be maintained.</p>
<p>The roles of glutathione (<italic>GSH</italic>) and phytochelatin synthase (<italic>PCs</italic>) genes in reducing heavy metals stress and ROS scavenging have also been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Millar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Freeman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hirata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Foyer and Noctor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shao et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the roles of antioxidants in scavenging ROS and reducing the oxidative stress caused by heavy metals have also been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hirschi et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tseng et al., 2007</xref>). Generally, a higher antioxidant content is found in anthocyanin-enriched plants, and these plants can survive abiotic and biotic stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Winkel-Shirley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dixon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dehghan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agati et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that improved abiotic stress tolerance when flavonoid accumulation is enhanced may be linked to increased ROS scavenging abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fini et al., 2011</xref>; Nakabayashi et al., 2014). Transgenic plants overexpressing the transcription factor IbMYB1 and Del showed enhanced anthocyanin production and improved abiotic tolerances (Cheng et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Naing et al., 2017</xref>). The results of previous studies suggested that to overcome abiotic stress conditions, it is important to produce anthocyanin-enriched plants that can provide antioxidants. A study by Lim et al. (2016) indicated that overexpression of the RsMYB1 transcription factor enhanced anthocyanin and antioxidant activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ai et al. (2017)</xref> also showed that overexpression of RsMYB1 enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in petunia. However, they did not investigate the role of RsMYB1 in abiotic stress tolerance. Therefore, the functional role of RsMYB1 in abiotic stress tolerance needs to be characterized.</p>
<p>This study used transgenic petunia that expressed RsMYB1. The plants were developed for a previous study by Ai et al. (2016). The role of RsMYB1 in petunia tolerance to heavy metal stress was investigated by examining several factors. These were plant height, root length, fresh weight, uptake of heavy metals, and stomata density. The transcript levels of RsMYB1, and the genes related to antioxidants and heavy metals resistance were also investigated.</p>

<title>Plants materials</title>
<p>The transgenic petunia expressing RsMYB1 was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ai et al. (2017)</xref>. However, the T<sub>2</sub>seeds were used as the material source in this study. Briefly, the seeds were soaked in 0.05&#x0025; sodium hypochlorite solution (Yuhan Co., Ltd., Seoul, South Korea) containing 0.01&#x0025; Tween 20 (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) for 10 minutes and then rinsed with sterile distilled water at least three times. The sterilized seeds were sown in MS basal medium containing 3&#x0025; sucrose and 0.8&#x0025; agar. The cultures were incubated at 25 &#x00B1; 2&#x00B0;C with a 16-h photoperiod and a light intensity of 50 &#x03BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for 30 days.</p>

<title>Heavy metal treatments</title>
<p>The 30-day-old transgenic seedlings that were red and of uniform size were selected for the heavy metal stress experiment. The 30-day-old non-transgenic seedlings were used as the wild type (WT) plants. The seedlings, including the WTs, were then stressed by continuous culturing in MS liquid medium containing serial concentrations of CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (25 &#x00B5;M, 50 &#x00B5;M, and 100 &#x00B5;M), or MnSO<sub>4</sub> (100 &#x00B5;M, 250 &#x00B5;M, and 500 &#x00B5;M) for 10 days on a rotary shaker set to 50 rpm. The MS liquid medium (without heavy metals) was used as the control. The culture conditions were the same as described above. Each treatment contained 20 seedlings and there were three replicates.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and gene expression analysis by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR)</title>
<p>The transcript levels of RsMYB1, two stress tolerant genes (<italic>GSH</italic> and <italic>PCs</italic>), and three antioxidant genes (<italic>SOD, CAT</italic>, and <italic>POX</italic>) in RsMYB1-overexpressing plants and WT plants under the stress and control conditions were investigated. Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of leaf tissue per treatment using TRI Reagent TM Solution (Ambion, USA). Exactly 1 &#x03BC;g of total RNA and an oligo dT20 primer were used for reverse transcription (ReverTra Ace-&#x00E1;, Toyobo, Japan). Then, the transcript levels of the genes (<italic>GSH, PCs, SOD, CAT, POX, RsMYB1</italic>) and ACTIN were measured using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Naing et al., 2017</xref>). The primers and PCR conditions for the detected genes are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Three samples per line were used, and the analysis was repeated three times.</p>

<title>Uptake of the heavy metals</title>
<p>Exactly 1 g of dried leaf tissue per treatment was collected from RsMYB1-overexpressing plants and the WT plants to determine heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Mn, and Cr) uptake. The analysis was carried out as described by Cataldi et al. (2003). There were three samples per treatment and three replicates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Determination of stomata density by SEM</title>
<p>To determine whether the heavy metals treatments affected stomata density in RsMYB1-overexpressing plants and the WT plants, 5-mm-long leaf segments were excised with scalpel blades from the stress treatment and WT plants. The excised leaf segments were immediately fixed in formalin&#x2013;acetic acid&#x2013;alcohol and kept overnight according to the protocol used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Naing et al. (2015)</xref>. The samples were then dehydrated for 10 min using serial ethanol concentrations (25, 50, 70, 85, and 100&#x0025;). The dehydrated samples were dried to their critical point at room temperature, coated with gold-palladium on a Quick Cool Coater (Sanyu-Denshi, Japan), and the stomata density from each sample was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Investigations were performed on three samples per treatment with three replicates.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were collected on the 30<sup>th</sup> day after the starting date of the experiment and statistically analyzed using SPSS version 11.09 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, USA).

<title>Assessment of plant growth parameters under heavy metal stress</title>
<p>Plant growth by the RsMYB1-overexpressing plants enriched with anthocyanin and the WT plants in response to the different heavy metals (CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, MnSO<sub>4</sub>, and K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) stresses, and the plants growing under normal growing conditions (without heavy metals) was evaluated 30 days after the treatments began. Under normal growing conditions, plant survival was high and they produced well-developed broad leaves and regular roots. Generally, there were no significant differences between the plants for the specific growth parameters, such as plant height, number of root and root length, and fresh weight. When they were treated with the 25 &#x00B5;M of CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, or 100 &#x00B5;M MnSO<sub>4</sub> for 10 days, their plant growth parameters were not significantly different from the plants grown under normal conditions (data not shown). However, these parameters started to decrease when the plants were treated with the 50 &#x00B5;M of CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, or 250 &#x00B5;M MnSO<sub>4</sub> for another 10 days (data not shown), and they significantly decreased when subjected to the 100 &#x00B5;M of CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, or 500 &#x00B5;M MnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment for a further 10 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In general, the RsMYB1-overexpressing plants were found to be more tolerant to heavy metal stress than the WT plants because the growth parameters evaluated in the RsMYB1-overexpressing plants were significantly higher than they were in the WT plants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Some WT plants did not produce roots at all and their shoots showed signs of water deficiency and chlorophyll degradation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), but this was not observed in the RsMYB1-overexpressing plants. In addition, the degree of tolerance to the heavy metals by the plants varied depending on the heavy metal used. The CuSO<sub>4</sub> and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> compounds were found to be the most toxic to the plants, particularly the WT plants. Overall, the presence of high concentrations of the different heavy metals significantly inhibited the plant growth of the treated plants compared to the normal growing conditions. Furthermore, severe toxicity was clearly observed in the WT plants compared to the RsMYB1-overexpressing plants. Therefore, these results suggested that anthocyanin enriched RsMYB1-overexpressing plants had enhanced resistance to heavy metal stress.</p>

<p>The qRT-PCR method was used to clarify whether overexpression of RsMYB1 affects the expression levels of the antioxidant genes (<italic>SOD, CAT</italic>, and <italic>POX</italic>). The results showed that the stress treatments increased the transcript levels of the tested genes in the WT and RsMYB1-overexpressing plants compared to the normal growing conditions. However, the genes were more highly expressed in the RsMYB1-overexpressing plant than in the WT plants under all heavy metal stress conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The expression levels of the genes were associated with the degree of tolerance to heavy metal stress because the RsMYB1 plants, which had higher expression levels of the antioxidant genes than the WT plants, were more tolerant to heavy metal stress than the WT plants. The results suggest that RsMYB1-overexpressing plants enriched with anthocyanin had higher antioxidant activities than the WT plants</p>

<title>Elevation of RsMYB1 under heavy metal stress</title>
<p>As described above, RsMYB1-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to heavy metal stress than the WT plants because they could induce higher expression levels of stress- and antioxidant-related genes. Therefore, it was important to investigate whether the RsMYB1 expression level was elevated by heavy metal stress and whether its expression was associated with the regulation of the genes mentioned above. As expected, its expression level was elevated under the heavy metal stress conditions (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref>), and this was linked to increased expressions of the stress- and antioxidant-related genes. This implies that RsMYB1 was involved in the regulation of the genes that are involved in abiotic stress defense. To clarify the role of RsMYB1 in abiotic stress tolerance, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the full-length amino acid sequences of thirty-five R2R3-MYB transcription factors isolated from different species that were found to be tolerant to different abiotic stresses (cold, drought, salt, and heavy metals). The resulting tree indicated that RsMYB1 was phylogenetically related to other MYB TFs and clustered with six TFs (IbMYB1, OsMYB4, GmMYB92, DwMYB2, OsMYB2, and TaMYB19) that confer different abiotic stress tolerances in various crops (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>). This suggested that RsMYB1 had the same functional role as the six TFs. According to the phylogenetic tree, RsMYB1 TF had strong sequence similarity with IbMYB1, which confers anthocyanin accumulation and salt-stress tolerance characteristics.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Anthropogenic activities have led to a continuous increase in the agricultural soils contaminated by heavy metals. This is becoming a major concern worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rascio and Navari-Izzo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Villiers et al., 2011</xref>) because these contaminated soils negatively affect plant physiological processes through the generation of ROS, which results in lower crop yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">DalCorso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hossain et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rascio and Navari-Izzo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Villiers et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, there have been many studies on heavy metals toxicity and the defense mechanisms used by plants to scavenge ROS and detoxify heavy metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rascio and Navari-Izzo, 2011</xref>). Previous studies have shown that antioxidants are involved in the mechanism that scavenges the ROS generated by heavy metal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mittler et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hirschi et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tseng et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the roles of <italic>GSH</italic> and <italic>PCs</italic> in the detoxification of heavy metals and ROS scavenging have also been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Millar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Freeman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hirata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Foyer and Noctor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shao et al., 2008</xref>). The enhancement of antioxidant activities and stress tolerances in anthocyanin-enriched plants has been reported for various plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Winkel-Shirley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dixon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dehghan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agati et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, overexpression of MYB TFs in various species has been shown to enhance anthocyanin accumulation and abiotic stress tolerance (Cheng et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Meng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Qi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, Lim et al. (2016) also claimed that overexpression of RsMYB1 TF enhanced anthocyanin and antioxidant activity. In a previous study, overexpression of RsMYB1 in petunia enhanced anthocyanin accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ai et al., 2017</xref>). However, other functional roles of RsMYB1 in the abiotic stress tolerance process were not investigated. Therefore, it was important to characterize the functional role of RsMYB1 in heavy metal stress tolerance by using RsMYB1-overexpressing and WT plants to determine the plant growth parameters and the expression levels of the genes involved in the mechanism that underlies tolerance to heavy metal stress.</p>
<p>In this study, RsMYB1-overexpressing and WT plants survived well under normal growth conditions, and the growth parameters (plant height, root length, and fresh weight) were not generally significantly different between the over-expressing and WT plants. However, when they were exposed to the different heavy metals (CuSO<sub>4</sub>, Zn SO<sub>4</sub>, MnSO<sub>4</sub>, and K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), there was a significant inhibition of the plant growth parameters for both plant types, especially with the WT plants. This was consistent with the results of previous studies, which reported that heavy metals were toxic to plants and caused injuries through the generation of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ebbs and Kochian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lewis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sharma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Scoccianti et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, the toxicity caused by CuSO<sub>4</sub> and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was more severe than the other heavy metals, because they strongly inhibited plant growth and caused leaf chlorosis. The occurrence of such symptoms after exposure to CuSO<sub>4</sub> and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> in this study confirmed the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ebbs and Kochian (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lewis et al. (2001)</xref>. The increased tolerance to heavy metals shown by RsMYB1-overexpressing plants compared to the WT plants is probably due to the increased anthocyanin levels in the RsMYB1-overexpressing plants because higher anthocyanin accumulation has been linked to a greater ROS scavenging ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fini et al., 2011</xref>; Nakabayashi et al., 2014) Theoretically, stomata play a critical role in photosynthesis because they are responsible for the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the release of oxygen as a waste product. In this study, inhibition of plant growth under heavy metal stress was associated with a reduction in stomata density. This suggested that the stomata density reduction caused by heavy metal stress decreased photosynthesis, which led to reduced plant growth. These results support the findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yilmaz et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kambhampati et al. (2005)</xref>, who also reported that heavy metals reduced stomata density.</p>
<p>The expression levels of the antioxidant genes (<italic>SOD, CAT</italic>, and <italic>POX</italic>) responsible for scavenging or neutralizing ROS were investigated to reveal the mechanisms which led to RsMYB1-overexpressing plants being more tolerant to heavy metal stress than WT plants. The expression levels of these genes were significantly higher under heavy metal stress than under normal growth conditions for both the overexpressing plants and the WT plants. This might be because the plants enhanced their expression levels to defend against ROS formation caused by the heavy metals. This supports the findings of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bashri and Prasad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). However, the greater inhibition of WT plant growth compared to the RsMYB1 overexpressing plants suggests that the antioxidant inducement in WT plants was significantly lower than in RsMYB1 overexpressing plants. Furthermore, gene inducement in the WT plants seems to have been insufficient to properly scavenge ROS. Under the same conditions, the higher expression of the genes in the RsMYB1-overexpressing plants than in the WT plants could be explained by the presence of anthocyanin, which is regulated by RsMYB1. High anthocyanin accumulation is linked to high antioxidant activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Naing et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Winkel-Shirley, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dixon et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dehghan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agati et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, this result supports the hypothesis that the higher stress tolerance in RsMYB1-overexpressing plants compared to WT plants depends on their antioxidant content.</p>
<p>The roles of other genes, such as <italic>GSH</italic> and <italic>PCs</italic>, which are involved in the antioxidant defense mechanism and heavy metal detoxification, were also investigated. When the overexpressing and WT plants were exposed to heavy metal stress, the <italic>GSH</italic> and <italic>PCs</italic> expression levels increased to defend against the heavy metals stress. Furthermore, the higher expression levels in the RsMYB1-overexpressing plants were positively associated with the degree of tolerance to heavy metals (RsMYB1 &#x003E; WT). The high expressions of these two genes suggested that they played major roles in scavenging ROS, the detoxification of xenobiotics and heavy metals, and the maintenance of ionic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Freeman et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Foyer and Noctor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hirata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shao et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the overexpression of these genes in other plants (<italic>Brassica juncea, Arabidopsis, Populus canescens</italic>, and <italic>Nicotiana tabaccum</italic>) also enhanced tolerance to heavy metal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bitts&#x00E1;nszkya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cairns et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Singla-Pareek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gasic and Korban, 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">b</xref>). In this study, despite the enhanced expression of the <italic>GSH</italic> and <italic>PC</italic>s genes under heavy metal stress, there was still a reduction in plant growth when the plants were exposed to heavy metals, which indicated that the <italic>GSH</italic> and <italic>PCs</italic> levels were not high enough to completely defend against heavy metal stress, particularly in the WT plants. This strongly suggests that the heavy metal tolerance mechanism requires high GSH and PC levels.</p>
<p>More heavy metals accumulated in the RsMYB1-overexpressing plant shoots than in the WT plant shoots. This also suggests that the RsMYB1-overexpressing plants could be more tolerant to heavy metals than the WT plants, which led to the increased uptake of heavy metals. Another explanation for this is that the roots of the RsMYB1-overexpressing plants were less damaged by the metals than the WT roots because of the increased anthocyanin levels (higher antioxidant activities), and the higher expression levels of antioxidant (<italic>SOD, CAT</italic>, and <italic>POX</italic>) and metal-induced stress tolerant genes (<italic>GSH</italic> and <italic>PCs</italic>). This would have led to greater alleviation of the negative effects on root water uptake caused by metal stress. These results supported the findings of Zhu et al. (1999) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wawrzynski et al. (2006)</xref>, who reported that plants expressing the <italic>GSH</italic> and <italic>PCs</italic> genes showed enhanced Cd accumulation and tolerance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bennett et al. (2003)</xref> also claimed that overexpression of <italic>GSH</italic> in mustard led the plant to accumulate 2.4-to 3-fold more Cr, Cu, and Pb than the wild-type plant.</p>
<p>In this study, the degree of stress tolerance was positively associated with the expression levels of antioxidant genes and stress tolerant genes. The expression levels of the antioxidant genes and stress tolerant genes were higher in RsMYB1-overexpressing plants than in WT plants under both growth conditions and particularly under heavy metal stress. Therefore, it was important to characterize the role of RsMYB1 and identify whether it was directly involved in the regulation of the genes, in addition to enhancing anthocyanin production. As expected, heavy metal stress elevated <italic>RsMYB1</italic> expression and this was linked to increased expressions of the stress- and antioxidant-related genes. Therefore, it is probable that RsMYB1 was not only responsible for enhancing anthocyanin production, but was also involved in the regulation of the genes participating in the mechanism that defends against abiotic stress. Recently, similar roles for MYB TFs have been reported (Cheng et al., 2013, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Meng et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Qi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the role of RsMYB1 was further confirmed by results of the phylogenetic tree because RsMYB1 has strong phylogenetical relationships with six TFs (IbMYB1, OsMYB4, GmMYB92, DwMYB2, OsMYB2, and TaMYB19) that confer different abiotic stress tolerances in various crops.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A previous study showed that RsMYB1 had a regulatory role during anthocyanin accumulation in petunia. However, its functional role in abiotic stress tolerance was not investigated. Therefore, this study characterized the functional involvement of RsMYB1 TF in tolerance to heavy metal stress using RsMYB1-overexpressing plants and WT plants. The results suggest that RsMYB1-overexpressing plants are more able to tolerate the heavy metal stress than WT plants because RsMYB1 induces higher expression levels of stress tolerant genes and antioxidant genes. In addition, it has a strong phylogenetic relationship with other MYB TFs that confer different abiotic stress tolerances. Therefore, these results suggest that RsMYB1 could be exploited as a dual function gene that will improve anthocyanin production and heavy metal stress tolerances in horticultural crops.</p>
