<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Proper regulation of germline gene expression is essential for fertility and maintaining species integrity. In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, a diverse repertoire of regulatory pathways promote the expression of endogenous germline genes and limit the expression of deleterious transcripts to maintain genome homeostasis. Here we show that the conserved TRIM-NHL protein, NHL-2, plays an essential role in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, modulating germline chromatin and meiotic chromosome organization. We uncover a role for NHL-2 as a co-factor in both positively (CSR-1) and negatively (HRDE-1) acting germline 22G-small RNA pathways and the somatic nuclear RNAi pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NHL-2 is a bona fide RNA binding protein and, along with RNA-seq data point to a small RNA independent role for NHL-2 in regulating transcripts at the level of RNA stability. Collectively, our data implicate NHL-2 as an essential hub of gene regulatory activity in both the germline and soma.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The conserved family of TRIM-NHL proteins have emerged as key regulatory points of gene expression to impact a variety of processes including stem cell self-renewal, developmental patterning and cellular differentiation in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tocchini and Ciosk, 2015</xref>). TRIM-NHL proteins contain a N-terminal tripartite motif (TRIM), composed of a zinc finger RING domain, one or two B-box zinc finger motifs (distinct from the RING domain), and a coiled-coil region, in association with six C-terminal NHL motifs (Supplemental Fig. S1). This combination of domains enables TRIM-NHL proteins to modulate gene expression in versatile ways, ranging from the ubiquitination of protein targets (via the RING domain and associated B-box motifs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ikeda and Inoue, 2012</xref>) to regulating mRNA stability or translation via the NHL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Loedige, et al., 2013</xref>). However, the full repertoire of gene regulatory activities and the developmental specificity of such functions by TRIM-NHL proteins remains to be fully elucidated.</p>
<p>How TRIM-NHL proteins regulate specific mRNAs is only beginning to become clear. The prevailing notion has been that TRIM-NHL proteins interact with mRNA via interactions with other proteins. For instance, the Drosophila TRIM-NHL protein Brat was long thought to recognize maternal mRNAs via an interaction with the RNA binding protein Pumilio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sonoda and Wharton, 2001</xref>). However, TRIM-NHL proteins have recently been shown to directly bind to RNA via NHL motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Laver, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Loedige, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Loedige, et al., 2014</xref>). For some TRIM-NHL proteins, such as Brat, this interaction occurs with a reasonable degree of sequence specificity, with a preference for U rich motifs, and leads to the post-transcriptional and/or translational regulation of target transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Laver, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Loedige, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Loedige, et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to binding and regulating RNA directly, several TRIM-NHL proteins have been implicated in miRNA-mediated regulation of transcripts, adding another layer of complexity to their gene regulatory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammell, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schwamborn, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Neumuller, et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>NHL-2 is one of five members of the TRIM-NHL family in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (including NHL-1, 2, 3; LIN-41; NCL-1). Thus far, these paralogs have been shown to control pluripotency (LIN-41) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tocchini, et al., 2014</xref>), oocyte growth and meiotic maturation (LIN-41) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tsukamoto, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Spike, et al., 2014</xref>), and inhibit translation (NCL-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yi, et al., 2015</xref>). In comparison, NHL-2 has been shown function the sex determination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">McJunkin and Ambros, 2017</xref>) and also acts as a co-factor in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> miRNA pathway where it is required for proper developmental timing and cell fate progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Karp and Ambros, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammell, et al., 2009</xref>). In the miRNA pathway, NHL-2 does not impact the biogenesis of miRNAs but exerts a positive influence on RNA Induced Silencing Complex activity (RISC, including small RNA or miRNA bound to the Argonaute effector, along with accessory proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammell, et al., 2009</xref>). NHL-2 associates with the miRNA specific Argonaute effectors, ALG-1/2, and other miRISC co-factors, including AIN-1/GW182 and the DEAD-box RNA helicase CGH-1/DDX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammell, et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, loss of <italic>nhl-2</italic> does not broadly affect miRNA activity, but instead specifically influences miRISC activity associated with two miRNAs: <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>lsy-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammell, et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the NHL-2 ortholog TRIM32 in <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> regulates a small number of miRNAs, including <italic>let-7a</italic>, while in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, Brat and Mei-P26 have also been shown to act broadly as miRNA co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Loedige, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schwamborn, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Neumuller, et al., 2008</xref>). Individual TRIM-NHL proteins exert positive or negative effects on the miRNA pathway, and thereby control developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Loedige, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schwamborn, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Neumuller, et al., 2008</xref>). Although the functions of NHL-2 in the soma are linked to miRNA function, what role, if any, NHL-2 plays in the germline remains unclear.</p>
<p>In addition to miRNAs, the small RNA regulatory repertoire in <italic>C. elegans</italic> includes endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs; 22G-RNAs, 26G-RNAs), and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs/21U-RNAs), which are part of an elaborate surveillance system to regulate homeostasis of the germline transcriptome (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Billi, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Youngman and Claycomb, 2014</xref>)). The 22G-RNA family of endo-siRNAs is the most functionally diverse class of germline small RNAs (named 22G because they are generally 22 nucleotides in length, and possess a 5&#x2019;-triphosphorylated guanosine residue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu, et al., 2009</xref>). It has been proposed that 22G-RNAs are selectively loaded onto either the Argonaute CSR-1 or the WAGO sub-family of AGOs, where they subsequently go on to fulfill distinct gene-regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">de Albuquerque, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Phillips, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Phillips, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Phillips, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Claycomb, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu, et al., 2009</xref>). The synthesis of 22G-RNAs relies on a complex containing an RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme (RdRP; EGO-1 or RRF-1), in association with the DEAD-box RNA helicase DRH-3 and the dual Tudor domain protein EKL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aoki, et al., 2007</xref>). Although it remains largely unclear how the 22G-RNAs are specified for their different AGO effectors, one notable feature of the two pathways is that the CSR-1 22G-RNAs are produced solely by the RdRP EGO-1, while the WAGO 22G-RNAs rely on both RRF-1 and EGO-1 for their biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Phillips, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Phillips, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Claycomb, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu, et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The CSR-1 22G-RNAs are required for normal chromosome organization in the germline and embryos, likely due to genome-wide effects on chromatin and/or transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wedeles, et al., 2013a</xref>). CSR-1 associates with genomic loci of its gene targets, and recent data point to a role for the CSR-1 pathway in promoting the transcription of these germline genes trans-generationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cecere, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Conine, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seth, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wedeles, et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Claycomb, et al., 2009</xref>), as well as post-transcriptionally fine-tuning the expression of target genes in embryos via its slicer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gerson-Gurwitz, et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the WAGO 22G-RNAs, namely those associated with WAGO-1 and HRDE-1, are required for silencing of endogenous pseudogenes, transposons, and protein-coding genes both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. These activities are largely downstream of the piRNA pathway, and function to recognize and silence foreign nucleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ashe, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buckley, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shirayama, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu, et al., 2009</xref>). Together, the CSR-and WAGO pathways provide an epigenetic memory of self (CSR-1) from non-self (WAGOs) nucleic acid and are critical for maintaining genomic and transcriptional integrity of the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wedeles, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Conine, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seth, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wedeles, et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Claycomb, et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we characterize the role of NHL-2 in the germline and provide evidence that, in addition to its role in the somatic microRNA pathway, NHL-2 is a biogenesis factor in the CSR-1 and WAGO germline 22G-RNA pathways. Like other 22G-RNA biogenesis factors and AGOs, including CSR-1 and WAGO-1, NHL-2 localizes to P granules in the germline. Characterization of <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants reveals phenotypes consistent with loss of CSR-1 pathway activity, including: embryonic lethality, defects in oocyte chromosome organization, and aberrant accumulation of the repressive histone modification, H3K9me2 on germline autosome chromatin. We also found an unexpected role for NHL-2 in the nuclear RNAi pathway, and accompanying temperature-sensitive transgenerational fertility defect. Using an RNAi screen, we demonstrate that <italic>nhl-2</italic> genetically interacts with the 22G-RNA pathway components <italic>drh-3, ekl-1, cde-1</italic> and <italic>csr-1</italic>, and physically associates with CSR-1, HRDE-1 and DRH-3. High throughput sequencing of small RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants reveals a depletion of 22G-RNAs for a subset of CSR-1 and WAGO target genes. Moreover, alterations in the distribution of 22G-RNAs across CSR-1 target genes suggest a mechanism of NHL-2 action in 22G-RNA biogenesis, and implicate NHL-2 in distinct roles for germline versus somatic small RNA pathways. RNA binding assays demonstrate that NHL-2 is a bona fide RNA binding protein that specifically associates with U-rich sequences, and mRNA-seq experiments on <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants support the model that NHL-2 regulates a large number of somatic transcripts via this intrinsic RNA binding activity. Together, our results show that NHL-2 is a key factor in multiple facets of germline and somatic gene regulation.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>NHL-2 is Required for Normal Germline Function and is Enriched in Germ Granules</title>
<p>While <italic>nhl-2</italic> mRNA is reported to be highly expressed in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ortiz, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Reinke, et al., 2004</xref>) its function in this tissue remains relatively unknown. To determine if NHL-2 is required for fertility, we analyzed the brood size of wild-type and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> deletion null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammell, et al., 2009</xref>) animals at 20&#x00B0;C, 23&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C. At all three temperatures, compared to wild-type worms, <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> displayed a significantly reduced brood size, and at 23&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C there was a significant increase in embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). This temperature-dependent fertility defect has been described for several strong loss of function or null alleles of germline genes, including factors involved in small RNA pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Phillips, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Van Wolfswinkel, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang and Reinke, 2008</xref>) and is likely to reflect temperature-sensitive processes in this tissue.</p>

</fig>
<p>To determine if there were any gross morphological defects that would lead to infertility, we examined dissected one-day-old hermaphrodite germlines using DAPI staining with DIC and fluorescence microscopy. DIC microscopy revealed no overt morphological differences between <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> and wild-type germlines (data not shown). However, when we examined the organization of diakinetic oocyte chromosomes in wild-type and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> animals via DAPI staining, we noted severe defects in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at all temperatures. While wild-type diakinetic oocytes displayed six discrete DAPI bodies, indicative of homologous chromosome pairs, <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> worms possessed a range of chromosomal abnormalities including aggregation into disorganized clumps, and greater than six DAPI bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). Together these data indicate that NHL-2 is required for normal reproductive capacity and germline chromosome organization.</p>
<p>We next examined where and when NHL-2 is expressed in the germline. To do this, we raised antibodies against the N-terminus of NHL-2 and confirmed that the antibodies were specific for NHL-2 by immunostaining <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutant germlines (Supplemental Fig. 2A). We then co-stained wild-type germlines for NHL-2 and CGH-1, a germline helicase with which NHL-2 was previously shown to interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammell, et al., 2009</xref>). We found that NHL-2 co-localizes with CGH-1 in the gonad in both perinuclear germ granules, known as P granules in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and in the cytoplasmic core of the syncytial germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). P granules are cytoplasmic aggregations of mRNA and protein that contribute to germ cell fate, and many RNA regulatory pathways, including those involved in small RNA pathways, localize to these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Voronina, et al., 2011</xref>). We also observed that NHL-2 localizes to P granules in early-stage embryos and was quickly lost from the somatic lineages after the 4-cell stage (Supplemental Fig. 2B and data not shown), consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hyenne, et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the interaction of NHL-2 and CGH-1 in the somatic miRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammell, et al., 2009</xref>), we next examined whether either factor is required for the proper localization of the other factor. First, the absence of NHL-2 does not appear to affect P granule formation, as the P granule markers PGL-1, CAR-1 and CGH-1 localized normally in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplemental Fig. S2A</xref> and data not shown). CGH-1 is essential for fertility and localization of several P granule components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnold, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sengupta and Boag, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boag, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Audhya, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boag, et al., 2005</xref>), however in a <italic>cgh-1</italic> loss of function mutant NHL-2 localized normally, while CAR-1 localized to &#x201C;sheet-like&#x201D; structures in the gonad core (Supplemental Fig. S2C). These data suggest that although NHL-2 has similar germline localization pattern to CGH-1 and functions with CGH-1 in the soma, NHL-2 may contribute to germline gene regulation through different mechanisms.</p>

<title><italic>nhl-2</italic> Genetically Interacts with the 22G-RNA Pathway</title>
<p>To uncover any pathways in which NHL-2 may function to regulate germline development, we conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen for synthetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Davis, et al., 2017</xref>). Out of 11,511 genes screened, we identified 42 genes, that when knocked down in the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> null background resulted in strong synthetic phenotypes, including sterility, embryonic lethality and larval arrest. Among the candidates are genes encoding factors required for biogenesis of the 22G-RNAs. These include the poly(U) polymerase CDE-1, along with the RdRP complex proteins EKL-1 (a dual Tudor domain protein) and DRH-3 (a Dicer related helicase), which have been shown to physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu, et al., 2009</xref>). CDE-1 was specifically implicated in the CSR-1 22G-RNA pathway, while DRH-3 and EKL-1 function in both CSR-1 and WAGO 22G-RNA pathways.</p>
<p>Notably, previous data demonstrated that CSR-1 pathway components display defects in diakinetic chromosome organization similar to <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Claycomb, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">She, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Van Wolfswinkel, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nakamura, et al., 2007</xref>). To more carefully assess the genetic interaction between <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> and these 22G-RNA factors, we examined diakinetic oocyte defects when we knocked down these genes in wild-type versus <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A-E</xref>). Because of the link between <italic>cde-1</italic> and <italic>csr-1</italic>, we also examined <italic>csr-1</italic> in these assays. Diakinetic oocyte chromosomal organization was binned into four categories in our assays: 1) normal morphology, where 6 pairs of homologous chromosomes were evident, 2) &#x003E;6 chromosomes, where univalent (unpaired) chromosomes were present, 3) aggregated chromosomes, where clumping of chromosomes was observed, 4) enhanced aggregation, where chromosomes were tightly clumped. Consistent with previous results, we observed chromosome anomalies when <italic>drh-3, csr-1, ekl-1</italic> or <italic>cde-1</italic> were knocked down in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A-E</xref>). Importantly, knockdown of each 22G-RNA factor in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants resulted in significantly enhanced chromosomal aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A-E</xref>) at both 20&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C. Furthermore, and consistent with these results, we observed an increase in the embryonic lethality of <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> animals depleted of CSR-1 pathway factors, pointing to a strong synthetic interaction (Supplemental Fig. S3).</p>

<p>Another phenotype common among CSR-1 22G-RNA pathway co-factors is the abnormal accumulation of the repressive histone modification, Histone H3, Lysine 9 di-methylation (H3K9me2) on autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">She, et al., 2009</xref>). Normally, chromosomes that do not possess a pairing partner during meiosis (including the male X chromosome) are enriched for H3K9me2 and transcriptionally silenced in a process termed Meiotic Silencing of Unpaired Chromatin (MSUC). Loss of the CSR-1 pathway leads to aberrant accumulation of H3K9me2 on autosomes and results in homologous pairing defects. Given the synthetic interaction of <italic>nhl-2</italic> with factors in the CSR-1 22G pathway, we examined if <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants displayed altered H3K9me2 distribution. Using an antibody specific for H3K9me2, we immunostained germlines from wild-type males depleted for <italic>drh-3</italic> or <italic>csr-1</italic> by RNAi and compared them to <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, depletion of <italic>drh-3</italic> or <italic>csr-1</italic> in wild-type males resulted in abnormal accumulation of H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang and Reinke, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> males also display abnormal H3K9me2 accumulation in a similar manner to that observed in <italic>drh-3(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>csr-1(RNAi)</italic> animals. We quantified the defects in H3K9me2 patterns as follows: 1) normal, where each germ cell displayed one strong H3K9me2 signal (as seen in wild-type), 2) elevated, where germ cells displayed one or more H3K9me2 markings that were greater than that of wild-type germ cells, 3) dispersed, where H3K9me2 markings were distributed on various chromosomes within a germ cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Abnormal autosomal H3K9me2 enrichment in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> germ cells suggests that <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants have errors in MSUC and meiotic synapsis similar to <italic>drh-3</italic> or <italic>csr-1</italic>, and are consistent with a role for NHL-2 in the CSR-1 pathway.</p>

<title>NHL-2 is required for nuclear RNAi inheritance</title>
<p>Multiple components of small RNA pathways have been shown to be required for nuclear RNAi and germline immortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Spracklin, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Weiser, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ashe, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buckley, et al., 2012</xref>), therefore, we next examined if NHL-2 is required for these pathways. To examine nuclear RNAi, we focused on the polycistronic pre-mRNA that encodes the non-essential gene <italic>lir-1</italic> and the essential gene <italic>let-26</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bosher, et al., 1999</xref>). In wild-type animals, RNAi targeting <italic>lir-1</italic> results in the silencing of the polycistronic pre-mRNA by the nuclear RNAi pathway, resulting in <italic>let-26</italic> phenotypes of larval arrest and lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bosher, et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> animals were resistant to <italic>lir-1</italic> RNAi and closely resembled <italic>nrde-2</italic> and <italic>rde-4</italic> nuclear RNAi mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Some RNAi factors, such as <italic>hrde-1</italic>, have a temperature-sensitive transgenerational mortal germline (Mrt) phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Spracklin, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Weiser, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ashe, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buckley, et al., 2012</xref>), therefore, we tested if <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> also displays this phenotype. Consistent with the Mrt phenotype, after 10-12 generations <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> worms grown at 25&#x00B0;C became sterile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>) while wild-type worms remained fertile. We next examined if shifting <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> worms grown at 25&#x00B0;C to 20&#x00B0;C could rescue the decline in fertility in subsequent generations. As has been demonstrated for other Mrt mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Spracklin, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ni, et al., 2016</xref>), when the F1 generation of <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> worms were moved at the L1 stage to 20&#x00B0;C it took 3 generations for the brood size to recover to the normal <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Similarly, embryonic lethality took a generation to recover to the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> 20&#x00B0;C level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>). These findings are consistent the Mrt phenotype observed in mutants in the nuclear RNAi pathway and suggests the decreased brood size observed at 25&#x00B0;C is not simply the result of DNA damage. Together these data are consistent with NHL-2 participating in nuclear RNAi and multigenerational epigenetic inheritance pathways.</p>

<title>NHL-2 Physically Interacts with CSR-1 and HRDE-1 Pathway Proteins</title>
<p>Because NHL-2 had previously been shown to physically interact with miRNA Argonautes, we decided to test for any association with the 22G-RNA-associated AGOs CSR-1 and HRDE-1. We first performed co-Immunoprecipitation of endogenous NHL-2 and probed for CSR-1 by western blotting. Indeed, we found that CSR-1 associates with NHL-2 by co-IP in adult hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We then moved on to test for interactions with other members of the CSR-1 pathway by similar experiments, and found an interaction between NHL-2 and the RdRP complex helicase, DRH-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu, et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). To test for additional protein interactions by a separate method, we incubated purified GST-tagged full-length NHL-2 with protein lysate and determined whether NHL-2 was able to interact with components of the 22G-RNA biogenesis machinery by western blotting. In these experiments, we observed that GST-NHL-2 associated with both CSR-1 and HRDE-1 from whole adult worm lysates, but not WAGO-1, or other components of the EGO-1, RRF-1 or EKL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>, data not shown). These data indicate that NHL-2 associates with CSR-1 and HRDE-1 pathway proteins at multiple points of pathway activity (with DRH-3 of the RdRP complex and with AGO effectors of the RISC).</p>

<p>The C-terminal RING domain of TRIM-NHL proteins is often associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and proteasome-mediated protein turnover.

We observed comparable levels of both CSR-1 and DRH-3 protein in wild-type and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> animals (Supplemental Fig. S4A and data not shown for DRH-3), suggesting that the association of NHL-2 and CSR-1 is not related to potential E3 ubiquitin ligase activity by NHL-2.</p>

<title>NHL-2 Is Required for Maintaining the Steady-State Levels of 22G-RNAs</title>
<p>To explore the role of <italic>nhl-2</italic> in the biogenesis or stability of the 22G-RNAs, we conducted small RNA high throughput-sequencing of wild-type and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> animals at 20&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C (Supplemental Table S1, S3). The overall size and first nucleotide distributions of small RNA species in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants are consistent with the wild-type controls at both temperatures (Supplemental Fig. S5, S6). However, when we began to examine particular classes of small RNAs in each genotype and at the different temperatures, we observed some interesting differences.</p>
<p>First, we observed overall changes in some small RNA populations in both wild-type and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at the higher temperature. There was an overall decrease in 21U-RNAs at 25&#x00B0;C compared with 20&#x00B0;C, for both wild-type and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants (Supplemental Figs. S5, S4, S6). This may reflect the temperature-dependent nature of the production or stability of these small RNAs. Notably, many mutants in the piRNA and 26G-RNA pathways exhibit temperature sensitive fertility defects that appear to be consistent with an overall decline in these small RNA populations at higher temperatures. 21-23nt siRNA levels (which encompass the 22G-RNA category) increased slightly in both wild-type and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C compared to 20&#x00B0;C, while miRNA levels were relatively unchanged in both strains between temperatures (Supplemental Figs. S5, S6, S7).</p>
<p>Next, we compared wild-type and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutant small RNA populations at each temperature. We observed a consistent decrease in 22G-RNA and 26G-RNA populations in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants relative to wild-type at 25&#x00B0;C (Supplemental Figs. S5, S6, S7). Concomitant with the 22G-RNA decreases, we observed an increase in the proportion of miRNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants. While it is possible that this change in miRNAs is biologically meaningful, it is more likely due to a &#x201C;filling in&#x201D; of the cloning space when small RNA populations are expressed as a proportion of the total reads, as previous reports observed little change in miRNA levels in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammell, et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, we observed decreases in the 21U-RNA populations of <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants relative to wild-type at 20&#x00B0;C, which are not evident at 25&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>Because of their abundance and the link between NHL-2, CSR-1, and the RdRP complex that synthesizes 22G-RNAs (via an interaction between NHL-2 and DRH-3), we examined this class of small RNAs in greater depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>, Supplemental Table S2). We observed that 573 and 724 genes display a two-fold or greater depletion of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants relative to wild-type at 20&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C respectively, with 381 genes in common between the two temperatures (the top-right Venn-pie diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

Consistent with this result, 74.5&#x0025; (427/573; q = 1.6E-296) of these genes were depleted of 22G-RNAs in a mutant strain that carries mutations in twelve <italic>wago</italic> (12-fold <italic>wago</italic> mutant including mutations in <italic>hrde-1</italic> and <italic>wago-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu, et al., 2009</xref>)). Notably, 33&#x0025; (189/573; q = 3.7E-5) of these genes are CSR-1 targets, with only 17 of these genes overlapping with HRDE-1 or WAGO-1 targets (CSR-1 targets are as defined in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tu, et al., 2015</xref>)).</p>
<p>Similar to the results at 20&#x00B0;C, 29.3&#x0025; of the 724 genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C are CSR-1 target genes (212/724; q = 3.7E-2), while 33.7&#x0025; and 37.2&#x0025; are WAGO-1 and HRDE-1 targets (244/724 and 269/724; q = 2.1E-85 and 4.7E-110; with 139 genes in common). Nearly 78&#x0025; (563/724, q &#x003C; 1E-300) of the genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C overlap with genes depleted of small RNAs in the 12-fold <italic>wago</italic> mutant. Finally, the majority of genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at either temperature significantly overlap with genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in RdRP complex mutants, <italic>ekl-1(tm1599), ego-1(om97)</italic>, and <italic>drh-3(ne4253)</italic> (all q-values &#x003C; 7.3E-195) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The overlap between genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants and the three well characterized germline small RNA pathways, coupled with the overlapping phenotypes of <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> and <italic>ago</italic> mutants point to a role for NHL-2 in germline small RNA pathways overall.</p>
<p>The <italic>glp-4(bn2)</italic> small RNA data set reveals the complete repertoire of germline genes targeted by 22G-RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tu, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu, et al., 2009</xref>), as these mutants do not possess significant germline tissue, and 5,971 genes show a two-fold or greater depletion of small RNAs. Consistent with the role of NHL-2 in fertility and germ cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), 83.8&#x0025; (480/573, q = 2.6E-166) and 83.4&#x0025; (604/724 q = 3.9E-209) of the genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 20&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C, respectively, are also depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>glp-4(bn2)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). These data indicate that the genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants are targeted by 22G-RNAs in the germline. Further comparison with the male- and female-specific gonad gene expression data indicated that 58.4&#x0025; (423/724; q-value = 0.0128) and 61.6&#x0025; (353/573; q-value = 1E-4) of the genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C and 20&#x00B0;C respectively overlap with genes generally expressed in the gonad (meaning that they are expressed in both the spermatogenic or oogenic gonads) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). We observed a subtle, but statistically significant enrichment for oogenic genes in the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> depleted gene sets (16.4&#x0025;, 119/724 genes at 25&#x00B0;C, q = 2.2E-11, 22.5&#x0025;, 129/573 genes at 20&#x00B0;C, q-value = 2.7E-24). This observation may simply be reflective of the developmental stage from which the samples were prepared (young adults undergoing oogenesis), but is also consistent with oogenesis defects we observed in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants.</p>

<title>NHL-2 Is Required for 22G-RNA Coverage at the 5<sup>'</sup> Portion of CSR-1 Target Genes</title>
<p>The decrease in steady-state levels for a subset of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants could indicate a defect in 22G-RNA synthesis or stability. Given the link between NHL-2 and the RdRP complex, we hypothesized that NHL-2 could affect 22G-RNA synthesis to a greater extent than turnover. Thus, we performed a metagene analysis to examine the distribution of 22G-RNAs across the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Supplemental Fig. S8</xref>). In wild-type worms, 22G-RNAs are distributed across the entire length of WAGO target genes and are present in greater abundance than CSR-1 22G-RNAs. Conversely, CSR-1 target genes generally have fewer 22G-RNAs targeting them overall, with a slight bias in small RNA coverage toward the 5<sup>'</sup> end. In <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C relative to wild-type, we noted that the distribution of 22G-RNAs at WAGO targets was generally unchanged over the entire locus.</p>
<p>For CSR-1 target genes, the distribution of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants was distinct from that in wild-type worms. At both 20&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C, there was a significant decrease in the abundance of 22G-RNAs over the 5<sup>'</sup> half of the gene in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants relative to wild-type controls (at 20&#x00B0;C, there was a 33.6&#x0025; reduction in 22G-RNAs, t-test p-value = 1.4E-79; at 25&#x00B0;C, there was a 15.5&#x0025; reduction in 22G-RNAs, t-test p-value = 1.77E-9). Examined a different way, the centroid of the 22G-RNA distribution for the group of CSR-1 target genes shifts by 5.77&#x0025; of the metagene length towards the 3<sup>'</sup> end in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants relative to the wild-type at 25&#x00B0;C (Wilcoxon rank-sum test p-value = 3.67E-29; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Supplemental Fig. S8</xref>). These data suggest that NHL-2 may influence the activity and/or processivity of the RdRP complex.</p>
<p>Because our small RNA results indicated a possible role for NHL-2 in RdRP complex processivity or activity, and we had observed genetic and physical interactions between NHL-2 and the RdRP complex via DRH-3, we asked whether NHL-2 was required for the formation or stability of the RdRP complex. Therefore, we tested whether the CSR-1 RdRP complex, as measured by an association between the key components DRH-3 and EGO-1, could properly form in the absence of NHL-2. To answer this question, we immunoprecipitated DRH-3 and probed for EGO-1 and EKL-1, three key components of the CSR-1 RdRP complex, and found that the association between DRH-3, EGO-1, and EKL-1 was maintained in the absence of NHL-2 (Supplemental Fig. S4). Thus, NHL-2 is not required for the formation or maintenance of the RdRP complex, and may play a different role in the biogenesis of 22G-RNAs, possibly in the handoff of newly synthesized 22G-RNAs to CSR-1 (because of its physical association with both CSR-1 and DRH-3), aiding the assembled RdRP complex in moving along the RNA template, or in the selection of particular mRNAs as templates for 22G-RNA synthesis.</p>

<title>The NHL Domain of NHL-2 Binds RNA</title>
<p>We went on to explore a role for NHL-2 in directly interacting with mRNA transcripts. The NHL domain of the TRIM-NHL protein Brat from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> was recently shown to be a sequence-specific RNA binding protein, which suggests other NHL domain proteins may also bind directly to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Loedige, et al., 2014</xref>). To determine whether the C-terminal NHL domain of NHL-2 binds RNA, we first generated a structural homology model based on the crystal structure of Brat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Edwards, et al., 2003</xref>). This modeling of the NHL domain revealed the canonical six-bladed "propeller" characteristic of this domain. It also showed that much of the surface of the protein was positively charged and therefore would likely interact with negatively charged RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). To explore if the NHL domain of NHL-2 binds to RNA we performed the RNAcompete <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ray, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ray, et al., 2009</xref>). We expressed and purified a GST-tagged NHL domain of NHL-2 and incubated it with a complex pool of 240,000 30-41mer RNAs. RNAs that copurified with the GST-tagged NHL domain were identified by microarrays and revealed a strong binding preference for U-enriched RNAs, with a core consensus of UUUU, and preference for U residues 5&#x2019; and 3&#x2019; to the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). We next examined the binding affinity of the NHL domain for a 5&#x2019;-Fluorescein labelled 17mer poly-U RNA oligonucleotide using fluorescence anisotropy. In these experiments, GST-tagged NHL domain at a range of concentrations was mixed with poly-U RNA oligonucleotide and allowed to reach equilibrium. These experiments yielded an equilibrium dissociation constant of <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> = 0.41 &#x00B1; 0.02 &#x03BC;M, and were consistent with a one-site binding model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). These data strongly suggest that NHL-2 is a bona fide RNA-binding protein with an ability to bind U rich sequences.</p>

<title>Steady State mRNA Levels are Altered Independent of Small RNA Levels in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> Mutants</title>
<p>Because of its link to multiple small RNA pathways and its capacity to bind RNA, we asked whether NHL-2 plays a role in transcript regulation. To test this, we performed mRNA-seq in wild-type (N2) and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> adult animals at both 20&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C, with three biological replicates each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>, Supplemental Table S3). At 20&#x00B0;C, we observed less extensive changes in steady-state mRNA levels in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, with 1,014 genes increased and 1,630 genes decreased by two-fold or greater. This is in contrast to 25&#x00B0;C, where we identified 3,554 genes with two-fold or greater increases in steady-state mRNA levels, and 4,370 genes with two-fold or greater decreased steady-state mRNA levels in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants relative to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>). There was a significant overlap of genes up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> between the two temperatures (643 genes; q-value = 6.2E-249). Similarly, there was a significant overlap between down-regulated genes at both temperatures (1,326 genes; q-value &#x003C; 1E-300). We then went on to examine the genes with altered expression in more detail.</p>

<p>Based on the previously described role for NHL-2 with <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>lsy-6</italic> in the miRNA pathway, we first asked whether predicted targets of these particular miRNAs were de-repressed upon loss of <italic>nhl-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Although several lines of data previously suggested that NHL-2 functioned with miRISC in the translational regulation of targets, no genome-wide transcriptome data in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants were available to test the possibility that NHL-2 and miRISC could impact targets via mRNA stability or turnover. Using TargetScan (Worm Release 6.2, June 2012), we identified 162 predicted targets of <italic>lsy-6</italic>, and 126 predicted targets of the <italic>let-7</italic> family of miRNAs. Only 33 of the 162 predicted <italic>lsy-6</italic> target mRNAs and 29 of the 126 <italic>let-7</italic> family predicted targets were up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C. Examining the data the other way around, we asked if the genes up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants were enriched for <italic>let-7</italic> or <italic>lsy-6</italic> predicted targets and found no correlation (data not shown). Overall, these data indicate that miRNA target genes are not regulated by NHL-2 at the level of transcript abundance or stability, and instead, NHL-2 is likely to exert a predominantly translational mode of regulation on these genes.</p>
<p>We next asked whether the genes with altered 22G-RNA levels in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C</xref>, Supplemental Fig. S7). First, we overlapped the sets of genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at either temperature and were surprised to find only modest effects overall. Of the 573 genes depleted of 22G-RNAs at 20&#x00B0;C, 78 displayed increased steady-state mRNA levels (13.6&#x0025;; 78/573 genes; q-value = 3.3E-14) and 11 had decreased steady-state mRNA levels (1.9&#x0025;; 11/573: not significant). At 25&#x00B0;C, 724 genes showed depleted 22G-RNA levels, and of these 210 were up-regulated (29&#x0025;; 210/724, q-value = 1.8E-13), while 81 were down-regulated (11.2&#x0025;; 81/724: not significant). Thus, overall, genes displaying altered 22G-RNA levels were not extensively affected at the mRNA level by the loss of <italic>nhl-2</italic>, and the fraction that were affected at the mRNA level tended to be repressed by NHL-2 under wild-type conditions. Overall, these data are consistent with a role for NHL-2 in the biogenesis, but not necessarily the effector steps, of a subset of 22G-RNAs. These data could also point to a role for NHL-2 in regulating the translation of this subset of germline small RNA target genes for which the 22G-RNA levels are altered in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, perhaps in a manner similar to the miRNA pathway.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the steady state levels by evaluating the levels of CSR-1 or WAGO pathway target genes in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, independent of any changes in 22G-RNA levels. In accordance with the opposing roles of the WAGO and CSR-1 pathways in germline gene regulation, we anticipated that the WAGO targets with decreased 22G-RNAs would display increased mRNA levels, while the CSR-1 targets with decreased 22G-RNAs would display decreased mRNA levels in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants. We observed that a statistically significant subset of WAGO-1 target genes (18&#x0025;; 141/1718 genes; q-value = 9.9E-8) were de-repressed at 20&#x00B0;C, and 291 out of 1718 WAGO-1 target genes were de-repressed at 25&#x00B0;C (16.9&#x0025;; q = 0.6790). HRDE-1 target genes also tended to be up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at both temperatures (141/1661; 8.5&#x0025; q-value = 9.9E-9 at 20&#x00B0;C, 335/1661; 20.2&#x0025;, q-value = 9.9E-2 at 25&#x00B0;C). These results are consistent with a cooperative role for NHL-2 in the repression of WAGO target genes, albeit in a small RNA-independent manner.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, CSR-1 target mRNAs were significantly up-regulated <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, and this effect occurred specifically at 25&#x00B0;C (2,025/4932; 41&#x0025;, q-value &#x003C; 1E-300). Similarly, when examined the behavior of total set of genes targeted by germline small RNAs using the <italic>glp-4(bn2)</italic> mutant, we found a strong overlap between genes depleted of small RNAs in the <italic>glp-4(bn2)</italic> mutant and genes up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants specifically at 25&#x00B0;C (60&#x0025;; 2155/3554, q-value &#x003C; 1E-300) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C</xref>). These results are consistent with a small RNA-independent role for NHL-2 in the repression of CSR-1 22G-RNA targets, and this activity is antagonistic to the action of CSR-1. Moreover, the functions of NHL-2 in regulating germline small RNA pathway target genes, especially those of the CSR-1 pathway, appear to be particularly important at high temperature (25&#x00B0;C) or perhaps other stressful conditions. Overall, the changes in steady-state mRNA levels for germline 22G-RNA pathway target genes point to a role for NHL-2 in regulating transcripts via its intrinsic RNA binding capacity.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> Impacts Genes Involved in Gametogenesis, Signaling, and Chromosome Organization</title>
<p>In an attempt to link alterations in gene expression to changes in phenotype for <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, we next compared the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> transcriptome data to spermatogenic versus oogenic gonad transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ortiz, et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7D</xref>). First, we found that a large fraction of genes that were mis-expressed in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at both temperatures were represented in total gonad transcriptomes (20&#x00B0;C up-regulated genes 41.1&#x0025;, 417/1014, q-value = 1; 20&#x00B0;C down-regulated genes 69.4&#x0025;, 1131/1630, q-value = 7.2E-46; 25&#x00B0;C up-regulated genes 75.9&#x0025;, 2696/3554, q-value = 5.0E-216; 25&#x00B0;C down-regulated genes 56.8&#x0025;, 2482/4370, q-value = 3.1E-9), indicating that most of the mis-regulated transcripts are expressed in the germline. Next, we found that genes up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C were significantly enriched for gender neutral and oogenesis-associated transcripts (46.1&#x0025;, 1637/3554; 25.2&#x0025;, 894/3554; hypergeometric test q-values = 3.8E-100, and 2.8E-259, respectively), while, for those genes up-regulated at 20&#x00B0;C, only oogenesis-associated transcripts were enriched (14&#x0025;, 142/1014; hypergeometric test q-value = 9.2E-8). Interestingly, down-regulated genes in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at both 20&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C were enriched for spermatogenesis-associated transcripts (47&#x0025;, 766/1630; 35.6&#x0025;, 1556/4370; hypergeometric test q-value = 1.8E-265 and &#x003C;1E-300, respectively). These data point to an overall misregulation of the germline transcriptome that leads to defects gametogenesis and decreased fertility.</p>
<p>Given that NHL-2 and CGH-1 have been shown to physically interact, we next compared the CGH-1 RNA-IP/microarray data with the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7D</xref>). In the germline, CGH-1 is required to protect specific maternal mRNAs (which overlap with those enriched in the oogenesis and gender neutral transcriptomes) from degradation, and is also involved in translational regulation of some transcripts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boag, et al., 2008</xref>). We observed a small, but significant, enrichment between CGH-1-associated and up-regulated transcripts in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C, (12.9&#x0025;, 458/3554; hypergeometric test q-values = 4.2E-76). These data suggest an antagonistic role between NHL-2 and CGH-1 in the regulation of the stability of these transcripts. To determine if there was any interaction with NHL-2 and other described germline RNP complexes we examined mRNA targets of the cytoplasmic poly(A) polyermase GLD-2 targets and the RNA-binding proteins OMA-1 and LIN-41, all three critical for post-transcriptional regulation of the oocyte-to-embryo transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tsukamoto, et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to CGH-1-associated transcripts, GLD-2 target mRNAs (16.5&#x0025;, 588/3554, q-value = 1.0E-207) and OMA-1 (20.4&#x0025;, 725/3554, q-value = 7E-67) and LIN-41-enriched transcripts (13&#x0025;, 462;3554, q-value = 8E-80) had a small but significant enrichment compared to up-regulated transcripts in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C. This is consistent with the strong overlap between genes expressed during oogenesis and those upregulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C. These data suggest that NHL-2 does not regulate the majority of mRNAs found in the key pathways governing the oocyte-to-embryo transitions, however, we cannot rule out any translational effects of NHL-2 in this context.</p>
<p>When we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we found that the genes that are down-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 20&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C shared consistent sets of GO terms, and are strongly enriched in cuticle/collagen proteins, kinases and phosphatases, and spermatogenesis proteins (FDR = 6.1E-20 <italic>protein kinase, core</italic>, 7.9E-25 <italic>phosphatase activity</italic>, and 1.5E-31 <italic>major sperm protein</italic>, respectively). Genes that are up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 20&#x00B0;C are weakly enriched in signaling molecules and oxidative metabolism (FDR = 1.4E-12 <italic>signal peptide</italic>, and 2.8E-3 <italic>oxidation reduction</italic>, respectively), and differ from the GO terms observed for the genes up-regulated at 25&#x00B0;C, which were enriched for cell cycle, <italic>kinetochore, RNA-binding</italic> and <italic>DNA replication</italic> and <italic>damage repair</italic> (FDR = 5.5E-35 cell cycle, 3.7E-12 <italic>kinetochore</italic>, 1.1E-16 <italic>RNA binding</italic>, and 3.7E-14 <italic>DNA replication</italic> and 9.6E-10 damage repair GO terms. In addition to analyzing the complete sets of up-regulated or down-regulated genes in the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, we also performed GO analysis on sets of transcripts that were expressed in the gonad, and observed comparable results (data not shown). Collectively, our data point to a role for NHL-2 in regulating the stability of a large fraction of gonad/germline transcripts that are involved in spermatogenesis, cellular signaling cascades, cuticle formation, and kinase/phosphatase activities, and chromosome organization. NHL-2 impacts these mRNAs both positively and negatively, and likely utilizes the intrinsic RNA binding properties of its NHL domain, perhaps in association with other protein binding partners, to do so.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>TRIM-NHL proteins have been shown to play a variety of crucial roles in the context of the proliferation versus differentiation decision in metazoans. With modular and varied domains, TRIM-NHL proteins can function as E3 ligases as well as sequence-specific RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schwamborn, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kudryashova, et al., 2005</xref>). TRIM-NHL proteins also engage the miRNA pathway, whereby, remarkably, their functions relate to only a few miRNAs, and impact the efficacy of the RISC both positively and negatively. With their intrinsic RNA binding activity, TRIM-NHL proteins could regulate RNA directly or function at various steps and in virtually any small RNA pathway.</p>
<p>NHL-2 is one of five TRIM-NHL proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (paralogs include NHL-1, -3, LIN-41, and NCL-1). NHL-2 has been shown to modulate miRISC via two specific miRNAs, <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>lys-6</italic>, which act in the soma to regulate developmental timing and cell fate transitions in multiple tissues. Recently it was also shown that NHL-2 is also required for sex determination, although the mechanism is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">McJunkin and Ambros, 2017</xref>). In spite of these intriguing roles for NHL-2 in the embryo and soma, little is known about its functions in germline development. Here, we set out to explore a role for NHL-2 in the germline and in germ cell development. We found that NHL-2 is required for proper germline chromatin organization and wild-type levels of fertility at high temperatures and for the somatic nuclear RNAi pathway. We also identified the AGOs CSR-1 and HRDE-1 and the RdRP component DRH-3 as genetic and physical interactors of NHL-2. High throughput sequencing of small RNA populations in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants revealed an additional role for NHL-2 in the WAGO-1, and HRDE-1 22G-RNA pathways, but as previous data suggested, little biologically meaningful perturbation in the overall miRNA population. Binding assays confirm that NHL-2 is a bona fide RNA binding protein, and examination of the mRNA transcriptome by mRNA-seq points to NHL-2 as a post-transcriptional regulator of a substantial set of mRNAs involved in signaling, phosphorylation and transcription independent of its small RNA activities. Together, our data, implicate NHL-2 as a regulator of mRNA stability for a significant portion of the genome, a likely translational regulator of miRNA targets, and a biogenesis factor and/or possible translational regulator of targets in the CSR-1 and WAGO 22G-RNA pathways.</p>
<p>We first identified a link between NHL-2 and the CSR-1 pathway by genetic and phenotypic studies, in which loss of CSR-1 pathway factors enhanced the aggregation of diakinetic oocyte chromosomes in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants. Loss of <italic>nhl-2</italic> also led to increased levels of H3K9me2 in pachytene germline nuclei and a spreading of this heterochromatin modification onto autosomes, where it is not normally observed. This phenotype is consistent with loss of CSR-1 pathway members, providing another phenotypic link between NHL-2 and the CSR-1 pathway. At this time, we do not entirely understand why this phenotype emerges in <italic>nhl-2</italic> or <italic>csr-1</italic> pathway mutants. It is possible that CSR-1 is not properly recruited to its target genes, due to mis-regulation of CSR-1 target transcripts in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants. This, in turn, could disrupt the formation or maintenance of euchromatin at these loci and allow for the mis-direction of chromatin modifiers throughout the genome, as observed in <italic>csr-1</italic> mutants (Christopher Wedeles and Julie Claycomb, unpublished results). This leads to the aberrant accumulation of histone modifications throughout the genome, which could impact chromosome structure. Future ChIP-seq studies for histone modifications and CSR-1 recruitment in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants will enable us to address this possibility. Alternatively, and based on the GO analysis, this chromosome organization defect could result indirectly from alterations in the levels of key transcripts associated with chromosome organization and metabolism, as has been proposed for CSR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gerson-Gurwitz, et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>It was somewhat surprising to observe little correlation between the genes depleted of 22G-RNAs and genes with altered mRNA levels in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants. Based on the known regulatory functions of these pathways we expected there would be a slight decrease in the level of CSR-1 target genes for which the 22G-RNAs were depleted, and an increase in the set of genes targeted by WAGO-1 or HRDE-1 for which the 22G-RNAs were depleted. Instead, we observed little change in the steady-state levels of transcripts with depleted 22G-RNAs, indicating that NHL-2 is involved in the translation of these genes, or that there is a different role for NHL-2 with regard to these genes in the 22G-RNA pathways.</p>
<p>The lack of correlation between mRNAs with altered levels and changes in 22G-RNAs raises another possibility: that NHL-2 is mainly involved mainly in the biogenesis of a subset of the 22G-RNAs. This model seems plausible for several reasons. First, DRH-3 and NHL-2 physically interact by co-IP. Second, our metagene analysis of the distribution of 22G-RNAs along the length of target mRNA transcripts is similar to the pattern observed for <italic>drh-3(ne4253)</italic> mutants, in which the 22G-RNAs are reduced along the length of the gene body, with most significant decreases present at the 5&#x2019; end of the transcript. This pattern is consistent with a role for NHL-2 in the processivity or activity of the RdRP complex on a subset of CSR-1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). The RNA binding activity of NHL-2 points to a model whereby NHL-2 could help to identify particular mRNAs as candidates for 22G-RNA synthesis. Furthermore, because NHL-2 also associates with CSR-1 and HRDE-1 as well as DRH-3, it could also act as a chaperone required efficient handoff of 22G-RNAs from the RdRP complex to the Argonaute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

Owing to its genetic and physical interaction with CSR-1, NHL-2 could also be involved in the handoff of 22G-RNAs from the RdRP complex to Argonaute.

<p>This potential role for NHL-2 with the RdRP complex is noteworthy for several reasons. First, because TRIM/NHL proteins have thus far only been implicated in the effector step of miRNA pathways, this is the first indication that NHL-2 (and thus TRIM/NHL proteins) could also be involved in the biogenesis of endo-siRNAs. Second, we still have relatively little insight into the factors that route particular transcripts into the 22G-RNA pathways, and NHL-2 provides an attractive candidate for one such factor. Third, the role for NHL-2 in biogenesis of a subset of germline 22G-RNAs and the effector steps of somatic miRNAs demonstrate differential roles for this intriguing protein in the germline versus soma, and points to differences in protein binding partners in each of these tissues that should be examined further.</p>
<p>Notably, many of the up-regulated genes in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants were the targets of 22G-RNAs, yet these genes did not display alterations in the levels of 22G-RNAs. These data point to a role for NHL-2 in regulating transcript stability, in cooperation with the WAGOs, and in opposition to CSR-1, and suggest a combinatorial regulatory mechanism that engages both small RNA pathways and <italic>bona fide</italic> RBPs such as NHL-2. The fact that <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants display temperature dependent fertility defects is consistent with several small RNA pathway factors, including both the piRNA/WAGO and the CSR-1 pathways and points to NHL-2 as a co-factor and/or co-regulator required for optimal pathway activity under stressful conditions. Although NHL-2 was not identified previously as a factor in the piRNA or 22G-RNA pathways, our results exemplify the power of synthetic genetic screens to identify accessory factors involved in the optimal function these pathways.</p>
<p>In light of our data, we propose that NHL-2 acts as a hub of gene regulation, where it works cooperatively with core factors in a diverse set of pathways that are central to both somatic and germline gene regulation (Fig.8). NHL-2 localizes to several ribonucleoprotein structures involved in RNA regulation, including P granules in the germline, CGH-1 granules in the gonad core, and cytoplasmic P bodies in the soma, placing it in key cellular positions to regulate multiple facets of gene expression and RNA metabolism throughout development. For instance, P granules and related Mutator Foci (to which NHL-2 does not appear to localize) are thought to be important sites for the synthesis of 22G-RNAs and 22G-RNA-mediated gene regulation, as RdRP components and Argonautes, including CSR-1, WAGO-1, and HRDE-1 also localize to these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Phillips, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Claycomb, et al., 2009</xref>). CGH-1 granules of the gonad core have a complex interplay with P granules and are enriched for translational regulators, including CGH-1 and IFET-1. The localization of NHL-2 to both P and CGH-1 granules in the germline supports the observation that NHL-2 and CGH-1 regulate the stability of a shared set of germline/oogenesis transcripts, and opens the possibility that NHL-2 and CGH-1 could regulate the translation of a shared set of targets. The intrinsic RNA binding capacity of NHL-2 via its NHL domain also makes it plausible that NHL-2 could regulate its own set of target mRNAs, independent of small RNA pathways or CGH-1. In fact, we observed that a large number of non-gonadal transcripts are regulated, both positively and negatively, in an NHL-2-dependent manner, and these transcripts are a separate group from those targeted by 22G-RNAs or CGH-1. Ultimately, quantitative proteomic studies, ribosome profiling in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, and NHL-2 RNA-IP or CLIP-seq experiments will enable us to identify the full repertoire of mechanisms of NHL-2 regulation.</p>

<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>In conclusion, we characterized the roles of NHL-2 in the germline and showed it localizes to P granules and impacts a subset of 22G-RNAs in both the CSR-1 and WAGO/HRDE pathways. This germline role in small RNA biogenesis is distinct from its role in the miRNA pathway in the soma, and implicates NHL-2 in RdRP activity in the germline. Interestingly, also NHL-2 was required for the nuclear RNAi pathway, suggesting that NHL-2 is a promiscuous co-factor of multiple distinct, but related small RNA pathways. NHL-2 displays intrinsic RNA binding ability via its NHL domain and thus is capable of binding and regulating the stability or translation of a large number of germline transcripts in a small RNA-independent manner. NHL-2 may exemplify a new class of co-factor that is required for optimal activity of small RNA pathways (both miRNA and 22G-RNA pathways). Although this type of co-factor appears to be extremely important for the fidelity and robustness of developmental gene expression programs, additional examples of such co-factors are not likely to be identified by forward genetic screens, but may be revealed through similar screens in sensitized backgrounds. Overall, our study highlights the complex roles of the TRIM-NHL protein NHL-2 and lays the foundation for deeper mechanistic insights into how these versatile and conserved proteins act to regulate gene expression in various tissues.</p>

Cell lysates were prepared by sonication, and the added to GST resin for binding. After washing off non-specific binders, tagged NHL-2 or GST protein was eluted off the resin using 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 30 mM reduced glutathione, 10 mM BME and 20&#x0025; Glycerol.

<title>Protein Expression, RNAcomplete and Fluorescence Anisotropy</title>
<p>RNA pool generation, RNAcompete pulldown assays and microarray hybridizations were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ray, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ray, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ray, et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, NHL domain of NHL-2 (residues 625-1032) was expressed as a GST-tagged fusion protein using the pGEX vector (pTH6838) (GE Healthcare). GST-NHL-2 (20 pmoles) and RNA pool (1.5 nmoles) were incubated in 1 mL of Binding Buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 80 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 10&#x0025; glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 &#x03BC;g/&#x03BC;L BSA) containing 20 &#x03BC;L glutathione sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) beads (pre-washed times in Binding Buffer) for 30 minutes at 4&#x00B0;C, and subsequently washed four times for two minutes with Binding Buffer at 4&#x00B0;C. One-sided Z-scores were calculated for the motifs as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ray, et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>For fluorescence anisotropy assays, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3) expresing GST-NHL-2 (7291032) were grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6-0.8 at 37&#x00B0;C and induced with the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG for 16 hr at 23&#x00B0;C. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris.Cl pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT supplemented with 1 x &#x2018;cOmplete&#x2019; Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), passed through a French press times at 16,000-18,000 psi. and the lysate clarified by centrifugation at 8,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 minutes. The GST-NHL-2 fusion protein was purified using a 5 mL GSTrap FF based on the manufactures specification (GE healthcare). Alterations to the protocol included washing the column 5 x volumes of binding buffer (1 x PBS pH 7.3) containing an additional 2 M NaCl to remove any DNA and RNA bound to NHL-2, followed by 5 column volumes of binding buffer. To elute the bound protein, the column was washed with elution buffer (1&#x00D7; PBS, 10mM reduced glutathione pH 8.0) and eluted fractions run on a SDS-PAGE gel to determine which fractions GST-NHL-2 eluted in, these fractions were then pooled and concentrated to be then further purified using size exclusion on the HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200. The NHL domain purity was &#x003E;95&#x0025; by SDS-PAGE and was quantitated by OD<sub>280</sub> using an extinction coefficient of 61935 M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (Pace et al., 1995).</p>
<p>To examine the RNA-binding ability of the NHL domain, a 12-point serial dilution (0-52.81 &#x03BC;M) of GST and GST-NHL-2 NHL domain was incubated with 1 nM 5&#x2019;-Fluorescein labelled 17 mer poly-U single-stranded RNA (Dharmacon GE, USA) in assay buffer (50 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 10&#x0025; glycerol pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature in 96-well non-binding black plates (Greiner Bio-One). Fluorescence anisotropy was measured in triplicate using PHERAstar FS (BMG) with FP 488-520-520 nm filters. Data were corrected for anisotropy of RNA alone samples, and then fitted to a one-site binding model using the Equation, A = (A<sub>max</sub> [L])/(<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>&#x002B;[L]), where A is the corrected fluorescence anisotropy; A<sub>max</sub> is maximum binding fluorescence anisotropy signal, [L] is the NHL concentration, and <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> is the dissociation equilibrium constant.

The only minor modification to these protocols was that we used 0.1X the normal amount of Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (enabling us to capture a greater proportion of miRNAs, while still sufficiently recovering 22G-RNAs). Small RNA analysis was conducted using custom Shell and Perl (5.10.0) scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tu, et al., 2015</xref>).

The snoRNAs annotated in GenBank were also included in the category of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sequences of pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs were fetched from miRBase (Release 19). After removing the barcodes from small RNA-seq reads for each sample, the insert size were extracted by allowing at most one mismatch in the first 6 nt of the 3<sup>'</sup> linker (CTGTAG). We first excluded the reads that could be aligned to the ncRNAs, and then aligned the remaining reads to the genome using Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Langmead, et al., 2009</xref>) without mismatches. Small RNA abundance were normalized to the sequencing depth (the sum of genome-mapping and junction-mapping reads but those known ncRNAs) as reads per million (rpm).

The TRIM-NHL family of proteins are conserved among metazoans, however, they often display variable domain organization. Canonical TRIM-NHL proteins have a three zinc-binding domains (a RING finger, one or two B-box motifs) and a coiled-coil domain in the N-terminal half of the proteins, and a series of NHL repeats at the C-terminal end of the protein. Examples shown are from: <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (BRAT and Mei-P26), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (NCL-1 and NHL-2) and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> TRIM32.</p></caption>
