<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Micronuclei (MN) arise from chromosomes or fragments that fail to be incorporated into the primary nucleus after cell division. These structures are a major source of genetic instability caused by DNA repair and replication defects coupled to aberrant Nuclear Envelope (NE). These problems ultimately lead to a spectrum of chromosome rearrangements called chromothripsis, a phenomenon that is a hallmark of several cancers. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism at the origin of this instability is still not understood. Here we show that lagging chromatin, although it can efficiently assemble Lamin A/C, always fails to recruit Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) proteins and that Polo-Like Kinase (PLK1) negatively regulates the NPC assembly. We also provide evidence for the requirement of PLK1 activity for the disassembly of NPCs, but not Lamina (A/C), at mitotic entry. Altogether this study reveals the existence of independent regulatory pathways for Lamin A/C and NPC reorganization during mitosis where Lamin A targeting to the chromatin is controlled by CDK1 activity (a clock-based model) while the NPC loading is also spatially monitored by PLK1.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>During open mitosis the nuclear envelope breaks down at the end of prophase to allow the separation of sister chromatids and starts to re-assemble during anaphase (reviewed in [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Lamin A phosphorylation by cdc2/cyclinB [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] allows lamina disassembly at the beginning of mitosis while multiple kinases appear to contribute to the disassembly of the NPC via phosphorylation of a crucial target, Nup98 [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. During mitotic exit, NE reformation (NER) occurs as a sequential and multi-step process where NUPs assemble to the chromatin earlier than Lamin A [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] but the overall mechanism is still poorly understood (recently reviewd in [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]).</p>
<p>A few studies have shown that this mechanism is regulated by the concerted action of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and 2A (PP2A) [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This ordered assembly suggests that sequential dephosphorylation events must occur to allow macromolecular complexes to form and target them to the correct place at the right time. This could be achieved by activation of different phosphatases at different times during mitotic exit (clock model) or by the position of the segregating chromatin within the anaphase cell (spatial model) or a combination of both. However the molecular effectors are still not known. Moreover, recent work in Drosophila has shown that an Aurora B gradient appears to regulate a surveillance mechanism that prevents both chromosome decondensation and NER until effective separation of sister chromatids is achieved [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and to delay Lamin A re-assembly [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we show for the first time that, in vertebrates, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is also participating in this NER control pathway, and that it is essential both for timely disassembly of the NPC at the onset of mitosis and for preventing the loading of the NPC on the chromatin of lagging chromosomes during mitotic exit.</p>
<p>This study proposes a sequential model for the NER where Lamin A targeting to the chromatin is under the control of the decreasing Cdc2/cyclinB activity (a clock-based model) while the NPC loading is also spatially regulated by PLK1 activity.</p>

<title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In order to understand the causes of MN instability, we have analysed the composition of the NE of MN in HeLa and U2OS cells by immunofluorescence.</p>
<p>While Lamin B1 was absent in all MN analysed in both cell lines (as previously reported [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), we noticed heterogeneity among the MN in relation to the presence/absence of Lamin A and Importin &#x03B2;or the NPC marker mAb414, which recognizes several FG nucleoporins, with the majority of the MN lacking Importin &#x03B2;(Supplementary Figure 1 A, B). Although the absence of Lamin B1 could indicate that the MN have already been disrupted (as reported by Zhang et al [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]), the presence or absence of the other nuclear membrane (NM) components suggested that the loading of Lamin A could be uncoupled from that of nucleoporins.</p>
<p>Indeed, Lamin A and NPC seem to have different loading times.</p>
<p>In order to understand how this variability could arise, we have focused on anaphase cells containing lagging chromosomes or chromatin bridges, the most common cause for MN formation [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. NER starts in anaphase in a sequential manner and the order of events have been well documented [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, NUPs (as judged by mAb414 staining) and Importin &#x03B2;recruitment precedes Lamin A and it starts loading at the pole-ward side of the segregating chromatids as shown in Supplementary Figure 1 C, D.</p>
<p>Lagging chromatids arise from chromosome fragments without kinetochores or merotelic-attached chromosomes [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], dwelling in the middle of the anaphase spindle and causing a delay in division. Using several antibodies that recognize different NPC sub-complexes (m414 for FG containing NUPs, Nup93 for the inner ring complex, POM121 for the transmembrane NUPs and MEL28 for the Y complex [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we have revealed that chromatin present in the middle of the anaphase/telophase spindle is competent for Lamin A assembly but fails to recruit either Importin &#x03B2;or NPC components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A-F</xref>). Therefore, while a fraction of interphase MN are loaded with NPC components (Supplementary Figure 1A-B), lagging chromatin is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A-F</xref>) but still does assemble Lamin A indicating that the normal order of assembly (first NPC then Lamin A) is not maintained in this type of chromatin. These observations suggest that: 1) the process of Lamina re-assembly and NPC reassembly after mitosis are independent of each other and they are under different regulatory systems; 2) recruitment of NPC components to the anaphase chromatin is negatively regulated directly or indirectly by factors (possibly kinases) acting at the central spindle or limited by the small amount of chromatin present. We discarded the latter hypothesis since we could identify cells with a substantial mass of lagging chromatin which was still negative for NPC components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 A</xref>).</p>

<p>We therefore started investigating a possible role for kinases as negative regulators of the NER. In Drosophila, it has recently been shown that Aurora B acts in anaphase to delay Lamin A and B re-assembly when chromatin is trapped in the midzone [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast, our experiments indicate that Lamin A can successfully assemble on lagging chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We therefore tested if inhibition of different kinases present in the anaphase midzone/midbody could allow NPC loading on lagging chromatin in vertebrates. Inhibition of PLK1 or Aurora B was able to release the inhibitory effect and allowed part of the NPC loading to the lagging chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While inhibition of Aurora B could have been expected based on the experiments conducted in Drosophila, the effect caused by PLK1 inhibition is surprising since this kinase has never been reported to act on NE reformation nor has it been shown to be able to generate a gradient in anaphase. Supporting our experiment, PLK1 was shown to be recruited to DNA tethers of acentric chromatin during cell division [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A further support to the implication of PLK1 in NPC regulation was provided by experiments where by overexpression of RFP:PLK1 in HeLa cells we were able to see a significant reduction of NPC at the NE of MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 C</xref>). This observation could either suggest that both kinases regulate a subset of NUPs or that one kinase activity depends on the other.</p>
<p>While it is known that Aurora B activates PLK1 at kinetochores in early mitosis both in Drosophila and human cells [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], its regulation in late mitosis is poorly understood. Only recently it has been suggested that in Drosophila, Map205 sequesters Polo kinase on central spindle microtubules and that upon phosphorylation mediated by Aurora B, active Polo is recruited to the midbody where it targets substrates locally. This model has the potential to serve as the regulatory mechanism for PLK1 and NPC loading. However, the vertebrate orthologue of Map205 is not known. We have therefore tested if a crosstalk between Aurora B and PLK1 could also exist in human cells. To this purpose we have treated HeLa cells for 30 min with the Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439 (ZM) and quantified the level of Phospho-PLK1 at the midbody relative to total PLK1. The results clearly show that Aurora B inhibition causes a significant decrease in Phospho-PLK1 at the midbody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 D, E</xref>) thus indicating that, as in Drosophila, activation of PLK1 in the midbody depends on Aurora B. These results could potentially indicate that the phosphorylation status of PLK1 could affect NPC re-assembly. In fact, NPC deposition around the chromatin appears to occur away from the presence of PLK1ph, where PLK1ph levels are below a threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 F, G</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to test the relevance of protein kinases in envelope re-assembly further, we analysed the process in a system where spatial clues are removed. Cells blocked in mitosis can be induced to biochemically recapitulate several physiological steps of mitotic exit when cyclin-dependent kinase 1(CDK1) is inactivated ([<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To this purpose, we used a chicken DT40 cell line engineered to express an analog sensitive version of CDK1 [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] thus removing the spatial clues from the system. This allele (CDK1<sup>as</sup>) can be specifically inhibited by the bulky ATP analogue 3MB-PP1. The cell line was also transfected with GFP:Lamin A (DT40 does not express Lamin A), blocked in prometaphase with nocodazole and the accumulation of NPC and lamina at chromatin was checked. These cells were then treated either with DMSO, BI2536, 3MB-PP1, ZM447439 or BI2536 &#x002B; 3M-PP1 for 15 minutes and fixed and stained with mAb414 or Importin &#x03B2;. In DMSO treated cells, both Lamin A and the NPC or Importin &#x03B2;are dispersed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A-D</xref>). Upon inhibition of CDK1, Lamin A is re-localised onto the chromatin but no further accumulation is produced by co-inhibition of PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). Inhibition of CDK1 also triggers NPC recruitment on the chromatin in this system but the additional inhibition of PLK1 produces a nuclear-rim like and more substantial accumulation of mAb414 and Importin &#x03B2;to the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A-C</xref>). No effect can be observed by inhibiting either PLK1 alone or Aurora B alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A-C</xref>). Inhibition of the kinases was effective within the 15 min treatments as judged by a parallel experiment where cells were treated with single drugs and MG132; the mitotic cells were negative for H3S10ph or showed monopolar spindles upon treatment with ZM447439 or BI2536 respectively (Supplementary Figure 2A) as expected when Aurora B or PLK1 are inactive. This data suggests that CDK1 is solely responsible for maintaining Lamin A off the chromosomes in mitosis but additional phosphorylations by PLK1 or kinases downstream of PLK1 are required to prevent the NPC loading in late mitosis. Taken together the observations so far provided, we can conclude that a conserved mechanism sustained by PLK1 activity (localised at the midzone in normal mitotic exit) negatively regulates the NPC reformation during anaphase. However this mechanism does not prevent Lamin A recruitment indicating therefore that the two processes are independent and they are monitored by different kinases/phosphatases.</p>

<p>This data reconciles with what is known for Lamin A dynamics in mitosis where CDK1 has been found responsible for phosphorylation of lam ins, a prerequisite for NE disassembly. At mitotic entry, the phosphorylation of lamins at specific sites by CDK1 and protein kinase C (PKC) is required to drive disassembly of the lamina [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and dephosphorylation of the CDK1 mitotic sites by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is required for lamina assembly during the telophase/early G1 transition [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is therefore expected that just inhibition of CDK1 would license Lamin A deposition on the chromatin.</p>
<p>Given the fact that PLK1 could play a role in NPC re-organisation during mitotic exit, we hypothesized that it could also be important for the dissolution of NPC at mitotic entry. Although a requirement for PLK1 in mitotic entry has been suggested, with p150<sup>Glued</sup> being one of the substrates involved in this process [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], little is known about PLK1 involvement in the dissolution of the NPC at the onset of mitosis. Nup98, a nucleoporin phosphorylated by multiple kinases, is essential for Nuclear Envelope Breakdown (NEBD) and is also a PLK1 substrate; however, mutation of the two identified PLK1 sites had no impact on NEBD in vitro [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, we have noticed that mcherry:PLK1 accumulates at the nuclear periphery in prophase, at a time consistent with its involvement in NE re-organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A, B</xref>). A similar observation was reported in Drosophila, where Polo kinase also localises to the NE at mitotic entry [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>To test therefore if PLK1 was required for the NPC dissolution at mitotic entry, we inhibited CDK1 with 3MB-PP1 in the DT40CDK1<sup>AS</sup> cell line for 6h to block cells at the G2/M boundary. After 30 min release, to allow the cells enter mitosis, we inhibited PLK1 or Aurora B for 15 min and analysed the distribution of Importin &#x03B2;or mAb414 in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 C</xref>). While in normal and Aurora B inhibited prometaphase/metaphase cells mAb414 and Importin &#x03B2;are both diffused and on the spindle, in PLK1 inhibited cells Importin &#x03B2;and the NUPs are either still around the condensed chromosomes or in distinct patches within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 D-G</xref>). Inhibition of Aurora B does not produce any detectable effect on NPC dispersal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 E, F</xref>). However, neither inhibition of PLK1 nor Aurora B affects dispersal of Lamin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 J-L</xref>). The same results were obtained in HeLa cells. In this system we have inhibited either PLK1 (using either BI2536 or MLN0905) or Aurora B for 1 h or 2 h and then stained the cells for mAb414 and Lamin A/C. Again the inhibition of only PLK1 causes a delay in the dissolution of the NPC but does not affect the disassembly of Lamin A/C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 H-L</xref>). These results clearly indicate that also at mitotic entry different kinases are required to complete NEBD and that the breakdown of Lamin A and the NPC follow different pathways.</p>

<p>At mitotic entry PLK1 localises at the nuclear rim in prophase where phosphorylates a subsetofnucleoporinscontributingtothedisassemblyoftheNPC.CDK1 phosphorylates Lamin A and is important for the NE disassembly. At mitotic exit, CDK1 inhibition is essential for triggering NE re-assembly and is sufficient for targeting Lamin A/C to the chromatin in vertebrates. The complete NPC re-assembly requires in addition the inhibition of PLK1 which activity is sustained by Aurora B at the cleavage furrow.</p></caption>

<p>Here we have shown that Lamina A/C and NPC dissolution and reformation are controlled by different mechanisms. CDK1 is necessary for Lamin A breakdown and its inhibition is sufficient for targeting it onto the chromosomes. However, the NPCs require the additional phosphorylation by PLK1 for their full dispersal at onset of mitosis, and PLK1 inactivation for the re-assembly at mitotic exit. These observations are consistent with the fact that mitotic phosphorylation of several nucleoporins depends onPLK1as suggested by published proteomic studies [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and supported by previous observations linking lack of PLK1 to delays of NEBD in human cells [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], C. elegans [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and in mouse oocytes maturation [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However this is the first demonstration that NPC and Lamin A/C are behaving in an independent manner. At mitotic exit the NPC re-assembly is spatially controlled by the presence of active PLK1 whereas Lamin A is regulated via a &#x201C;clock&#x201D; mechanism based on inactivation of CDK1 without any topological control; in fact it is not important where the chromatin is within the anaphase cell to be competent for Lamin A binding. Although the PLK1-non-phosphorylable mutants of Nup98 did not show an effect in inhibiting NEBD in vitro [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], it is possible that several phosphorylation events on different nucleoporins have additive effects and altogether contribute to the full NPC disassembly. Therefore, mutations in single components might not be sufficient to produce major defects.</p>
<p>This study therefore provides mechanistic insights into the pathway on NE reorganisation in vertebrates and the identification of the specific counteracting phosphatases will be an important aspect to pursue in order to understand the full picture. It is possible that PLK1 negatively regulates the activity of phosphatases as well. Hints towards this direction are that some NPC components have been shown to be substrates for PP2A-B55 [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] but the sites identified are not the ones sensitive to PLK1 inhibition [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Repo-Man/PP1, which activity is regulated by Aurora B [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], can bind to Nup153 [<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and is important for Importin &#x03B2;recruitment on the lagging chromatin [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; this complex could also represent a potential phosphatase candidate. Importantly, our findings have also major implications in genome stability. As we have shown, the MN that originate from merotelic attached chromosomes are inevitably going to have a compromised nuclear barrier from the start as their import/export machinery is impaired. These MN will then be a major source of genomic instability as elegantly demonstrated recently by the Pellman Lab [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These findings could therefore add extra value to the use of PLK1 inhibitors for the treatment of specific cancer types arising from MN formation.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<p><bold>Cell Culture</bold></p>
<p>HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x0025; FBS and DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10&#x0025; FBS and 1&#x0025; chicken serum at 37&#x00B0;C and 39&#x00B0;C respectively in 5&#x0025;CO<sub>2</sub>. DT40 cells DT40CDK1<sup>AS</sup> cells were provided by Dr Helfrid Hochegger (Sussex, UK). HeLa GFP:POM121 cell line was kindly provided by Kathrine Ullamn (Utha, USA).</p>
<p>Transient transfections for DT40 were conducted as previously described [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For synchronization, DT40 cells DT40CDK1<sup>AS</sup> cells were treated with 100 mM of 3MB-PP1 (Millipore) for 4h or with 100ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma).</p>
<p>BI2536 (Stratech), ZM447439 and Y-27632 (Calbiochem), MLN0905 (Sellckechem) were used at 100nM, 2&#x03BC;M, 40&#x03BC;M, and 35&#x03BC;M respectively for the time indicated in each experiment.</p>

<p>The primary antibodies were used as follows:</p>
<p>Anti Nup153 (mouse QE5, Abcam, ab24700) 1:300; mAb414 (mouse Covance 1:500, MMS-120R); Anti-Importin &#x03B2; (monoclonal 3E9, Abcam, ab2811) 1:1000; anti-Lamin A/C (rabbit monoclonal, Abcam ab108595); anti-Ser10ph (rabbit, Upstate Biotechnoloy,#06-570) 1:200; anti-&#x03B1;tubulin (monoclonal B512, Sigma, T5168) 1:1000; anti-PLK1 (Abcam, ab175808) 1:1000; anti-PLK1ph (Abcam, ab39068) 1:300; anti-INCENP (gift from WC Earnshaw, Edinburgh) 1:500; Mel28 (Gift from M. Platani, Edinburgh) 1:500; Nup93 (Santa Cruz, GC-292099) 1:100.</p>
<p>3D data sets were acquired on a wide-field microscope (NIKON Ti-E super research Live Cell imaging system) with a NA 1.45 Plan Apochromat lens. The data sets were deconvolved with NIS-Element AR software. 3D data sets were converted to Quick Projections or presented as single plane, exported as TIFF files, and imported into Adobe Photoshop for final presentation.</p>
<p>For quantification of the staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 C-D</xref>), an area containing the midbody was select and the total staining in the red and blue channel was measured. Another set of measurements was obtained from the same areas in a region outside the cell (background) and subtracted by the intensities in the midbody.</p>
<p>The graphs were generated in Excel or R-studio, exported as png and imported in Inkscape for figure presentation.</p>
