<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Acquired resistance to endocrine therapy remains a significant clinical burden for breast cancer patients. Somatic mutations in the <italic>ESR1</italic> (estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#x03B1;) gene ligand-binding domain (LBD) represent a recognized mechanism of acquired resistance. Antiestrogens with improved efficacy versus tamoxifen might overcome the resistant phenotype in ER&#x002B; breast cancers. Bazedoxifene (BZA) is a potent antiestrogen that is clinically approved for use in hormone replacement therapies. We find BZA possesses improved inhibitory potency against the Y537S and D538G ER&#x03B1; mutants compared to tamoxifen and has additional inhibitory activity in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. In addition, comprehensive biophysical and structural biology studies show that BZA&#x2019;s selective estrogen receptor degrading (SERD) properties that override the stabilizing effects of the Y537S and D538G ER&#x03B1; mutations.</p>

<title>Significance</title>
<p>Bazedoxifene (BZA) is a potent orally available antiestrogen that is clinically approved for use in hormone replacement therapy (DUAVEE). We explore the efficacy of BZA to inhibit activating somatic mutants of ER&#x03B1; that can arise in metastatic breast cancers after prolonged exposure to aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen therapy. Breast cancer cell line, biophysical, and structural data show that BZA disrupts helix 12 of the ER&#x03B1; ligand binding domain to achieve improved potency against Y537S and D538G somatic mutants compared to 4-hydroxytamoxifen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#x03B1;) plays critical roles in the etiology, treatment and prevention of the majority of breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Due to the high degree of efficacy and wide therapeutic indices of endocrine therapies, patients may receive such treatments for progressive disease over the course of several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Unfortunately, the majority of ER&#x002B; metastatic breast cancers that initially respond to endocrine treatment will become refractory despite continued ER&#x03B1; expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen are antagonistic in the breast and agonistic in the bone and endometrium. SERM agonist activity stems from tissue-specific co-regulator binding in the presence of tamoxifen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In addition, somatic mutations to <italic>ESR1</italic> (gene for ER&#x03B1;) ligand binding domain (LBD) were identified in 25&#x2013;30&#x0025; of patients who previously received endocrine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Y537S and D538G are the two most prevalent mutations, and pre-clinical studies show that these mutations confer hormone-free transcriptional activity and relative resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Both mutants enable constitutive ER&#x03B1; activity by favoring the agonist-like conformation of the receptor activating function-2 (AF-2) surface and significantly reduce hormone and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (the active metabolite of tamoxifen) binding affinities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Endocrine treatments with improved efficacy could potentially overcome resistance engendered by the activating somatic mutants and other mechanisms. In pre-clinical studies, fulvestrant (FULV, a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) and complete antiestrogen) at high concentrations was the only molecule that reduced the Y537S and D538G ER&#x03B1; mutant transcriptional activity to basal levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. However, its clinical efficacy is limited by poor solubility and oral bioavailability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Consequently, new complete antiestrogens with improved oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, including AZD9496, GDC-0927, and RAD1901, are currently in development, although their suitability as long-term endocrine therapies remains to be determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we explore whether bazedoxifene (BZA), a potent antiestrogen that retains some SERM properties, shows activity against breast cancer cells that express ESR1 somatic mutants. We chose BZA because it has been extensively studied in clinical trials and is approved for the use in combination with conjugated equine estrogens for hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women (DUAVEE, Pfizer) in the US and for the prevention of osteoporosis as a single agent in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Importantly, it displayed strong antagonist and SERD profiles in the breast while retaining beneficial agonist properties in the bone and did not stimulate endometrial tissue in pre-clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Further, BZA showed good oral bioavailability and improved pharmacokinetics compared with fulvestrant (FULV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, breast cancer reporter gene assays reveal the inhibitory capacity of BZA against the ER&#x03B1; mutants compared to the SERM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) and SERD FULV in several ER&#x002B; breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, ZR75, T47D). We further assessed the ability of BZA to induce the degradation of WT, Y537S, and D538G somatic mutant ER&#x03B1; in MCF7 cells. Additionally, because inhibitors of CDK4/6 combined with antiestrogens are approved for first line therapy and beyond in metastatic ER&#x002B; breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], we examined whether the CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, can be used in combination with BZA to enhance the inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation. Importantly, comprehensive structural and biophysical studies provide additional molecular insights into the chemical differences between BZA, 4-OHT, and raloxifene (RAL, another SERM) that appear to underlie the SERD properties of BZA and its improved inhibitory efficacy against the Y537S and D538G mutants in breast cancer cells. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> shows the chemical structures of the molecules examined in this study and summarizes their clinical indications.</p>

<title>Bazedoxifene Displays SERD Activity in MCF-7 Cells that Express WT ER&#x03B1;</title>
<p>To assess the ability of BZA to inhibit WT ER&#x03B1; in breast cancer cells, we examined its impact on ER&#x03B1; transcriptional activity, degradation and cell growth in MCF-7 cells. 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) was used as a representative SERM and FULV was used as a representative SERD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In MCF7 cells that expressed an ERE-luciferase reporter gene, BZA was a more potent inhibitor of WT ER&#x03B1; transcription than either 4-OHT or FULV (inhibition of luciferase IC<sub>50</sub> for BZA = 0.12 nM, 4-OHT = 0.39 nM and FULV = 0.76 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To test the effect of BZA on endogenous WT ER&#x03B1; transcriptional activity, qPCR was used to quantify the relative mRNA levels of known ER target genes, including cyclin D1, c-myc, CA12, and GREB1, in MCF-7 cells treated with estradiol (E2) or with E2 in combination with BZA, 4-OHT or FULV at 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup> and 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> M (antagonistic mode). For cyclin D1, 4-OHT increased the mRNA level at 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup> M and showed little effect at 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>M, while both FULV and BZA decreased mRNA levels at 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The agonist activity of tamoxifen at low concentrations has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. BZA increased c-myc mRNA levels at 10<sup>&#x2212;</sup> M while it significantly decreased c-myc mRNA at 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Presumably this effect is similar to the behavior of low-level tamoxifen stimulation and merits further examination. Interestingly, 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> M BZA showed the greatest reduction in mRNA levels of both CA12 and GREB compared to 4-OHT and FULV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, D and E</xref>).</p>

<p>As BZA was shown to behave as a SERM/SERD in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], we next tested the activity of BZA as an inducer of ER&#x03B1; degradation and observed dose-dependent ER degradation in MCF7 cells. Overall, BZA mediated similar levels of ER&#x03B1; degradation compared to FULV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In terms of cell growth inhibition, BZA showed an improved IC<sub>50</sub> compared to 4-OHT and in the same range as fulvestrant (BZA IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.4x10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup> M, FULV IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.1x10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup> M and 4-OHT IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.19x10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Together, these data indicate that BZA degrades WT ER&#x03B1; in breast cancer cells and is more effective at inhibiting ER transcription and cell growth than 4-OHT and FULV.</p>

<title>BZA is a Potent Inhibitor of Activating Somatic Mutants of ER&#x03B1; in Breast Cancer Cells</title>
<p>We next tested the activity of BZA in MCF7 cells that ectopically expressed theY537S mutant ER&#x03B1; to determine the inhibition of Y537S mutant cell growth. BZA demonstrated an increased potency compared to FULV and 4-OHT, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1x10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup> M vs 2x10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup> M and 7x10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup> M, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, qPCR data showed that BZA inhibited the transcription of ER&#x03B1; target genes cyclin D1, c-Myc, and PR, in cells expressing the Y537S mutant, in a dose-dependent manner, confirming the on-target effects of BZA in the presence of the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To evaluate the ability of BZA to induce WT and mutant ER&#x03B1; degradation in breast cancer cells, we treated MCF-7 cells that ectopically expressed HA-tagged WT, Y537S and D538G ER&#x03B1; with BZA and other ligands for comparison. Levels of WT and mutant ER&#x03B1; were quantified using immunoblots with an anti-HA antibody. Cells were treated with 10 nM E2, or 100 nM 4-OHT, 100 nM BZA, 100 nM RAL, 1 &#x03BC;M FULV or vehicle for 24 hours before immunostaining; 1 &#x03BC;M FULV was chosen because it was the minimal concentration necessary to achieve maximal ER&#x03B1; degradation. All data were normalized to vehicle-treated cells. In cells expressing HA-WT ER&#x03B1;, BZA and FULV induced degradation of the receptor to similar levels while the amount of the receptor increased upon 4-OHT treatment and was slightly reduced with E2 and RAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Interestingly, for the Y537S mutant, ER&#x03B1; expression remained unchanged for E2 and FULV, while it increased for 4-OHT and RAL. Y537S ER&#x03B1; also increased with BZA but less so than RAL or 4-OHT. Surprisingly, BZA degraded the D538G ER&#x03B1; mutant to a greater extent than FULV while 4-OHT and RAL both increased its expression after 24 hours. It should be noted that BZA and FULV elicited consistent WT and mutant ER&#x03B1; degradation across all replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). However, 4-OHT and RAL elicited slight variations in the actin-normalized quantity of ER&#x03B1; after 24-hours. Overall, these data suggest that BZA degrades WT and D538G ER&#x03B1; in MCF7 cells, but that the Y537S mutant is resistant to degradation. However, the levels of Y537S ER&#x03B1; in the BZA treated cells were still reduced compared to 4-OHT and RAL treatment, consistent with the reduced activities demonstrated by these compounds in MCF-7 reporter gene assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>].</p>

<title>Dual Treatment with BZA and Palbociclib</title>
<p>CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as potent agents in the treatment of metastatic ER&#x002B; breast cancer in combination with endocrine treatment. Combined endocrine treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor is now the standard of care in either first or second line treatment of metastatic ER&#x002B; breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Because BZA showed increased activity over FULV and 4-OHT, we explored whether the activity of BZA combined with the CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib (PB), in multiple ER positive cell lines (MCF-7, ZR75, T47D) and long-term, estrogen-deprived (LTED) ER&#x002B; MCF7 cells that mimic resistance to aromatase inhibitors. For the first three cell lines, the combination of BZA and PB demonstrated the greatest arrest in cellular proliferation, whereas for the LTED cells it was comparable to PB&#x002B;FULV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref>). Additionally, reduced proliferation of MCF-7 cells expressing the Y537S mutant was observed for the BZA&#x002B;PB treatment compared to all other treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Transcriptional reporter gene assays in MCF7 cells showed that: 1. BZA had superior activity in the inhibition of ER transcriptional activity compared to fulvestrant. In addition, palbociclib does not affect ER transcriptional activity either as a single agent or in combination with BZA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3H</xref>). Similarly, immunoblotting for ER showed that treatment with PB does not affect BZA or FULV induced degradation of ER&#x03B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). In sum, these data show that dual inhibition of CDK4/6 with PB and ER&#x03B1; with BZA is an effective combination with significant activity against breast cancer cells expressing WT or constitutively active mutant ER&#x03B1;.</p>

<title>Coregulator Binding Specificity and Affinities of WT and Mutant ER&#x03B1; with BZA, 4-OHT, and FULV</title>
<p>Because hormone regulated coactivator recruitment is crucial for ER&#x03B1; genomic action and inhibition of coactivator recruitment is a key aspect of SERM-mediated ER&#x03B1; antagonism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], we tested the effects of 4-OHT, BZA and FULV on co-regulator binding. We applied the Microarray Assay for Real-time Coregulator-Nuclear receptor Interaction (MARCoNI), which allows the quantification of binding affinity of a nuclear receptor with co-regulator peptides. To determine the effect of 4-OHT, BZA and FULV on co-regulator binding to WT, Y537S and D538G ER&#x03B1;, MCF7 cells that ectopically express HA-tagged WT, Y537S, or D538G ER&#x03B1; were used in conjunction with an HA antibody to detect ER binding to the co-regulator array. Experiments were performed under E2 stimulated conditions for WT ER and under apo conditions for mutant ER&#x03B1;. Overall, dose-dependent inhibition of co-regulator binding was observed for the majority of co-regulator peptides with the three drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). A comparison of EC<sub>50</sub> levels for inhibition of co-regulator binding of the three ER antagonists showed that EC<sub>50</sub> levels for FULV in both the WT and mutant cells was higher, as expected given the mechanism of action of FULV, compared to SERMs. The 4-OHT and BZA EC<sub>50</sub>s were higher in the presence of the Y537S and D538G mutations. Collectively, these results show that differences in antagonistic activity manifested by the three endocrine treatments are reflected by changes in co-regulator binding. There are significant differences among these drugs in their antagonistic activity on WT-ER and mutant ER.</p>

<title>SERMs and SERDs Abolish Hormone-Independent ER&#x03B1;-Coactivator Binding <italic>In Vitro</italic> and Reverse Hormone Recruitment of Coactivators</title>
<p>To further dissect the molecular basis for the reduced BZA, 4-OHT, and RAL potency/efficacy observed with mutant ERs, biochemical coactivator recruitment and competitive ligand-binding experiments were performed. As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], F&#x00F6;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays were used to evaluate the interaction of wild type and Y537S and D538G mutant ER&#x03B1; with steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3), a key coregulator in breast cancer cells. The nuclear receptor recognition domain (NRD) of SRC3 and LBD of the ERs, were used in these experiments.</p>
<p>Previously, we showed that in the absence of hormone, SRC3 did not bind to WT ER&#x03B1; LBD, whereas Y537S ER&#x03B1; bound SRC3 markedly in the absence of E2 with a 10-fold reduced affinity, and D538G ER&#x03B1; bound SRC3 with a 100-fold reduced affinity compared to hormone bound WT receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. To better ascertain the potency of ligands to inhibit coactivator recruitment, we titrated the ligands into fixed concentrations of LBD and SRC3 and monitored LBD-SRC3 interaction by a FRET assay; the three samples were primed with E2 to get a measurable signal from WT and D538G ER. 4-OHT, BZA and RAL reversed the binding of SRC3 NRD to the two mutant ERs and WT-ER&#x03B1; with similar potencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref>). Together, these data show that BZA, 4-OHT, and RAL inhibit both the basal and E2-stimulated recruitment of SRC3 coregulator by the WT and mutant ER&#x03B1; <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>BZA, RAL and FULV Elicit Similar Reduced Binding Affinities for Y537S and D538G Compared to WT ER&#x03B1; LBD</title>
<p>To examine what role alterations in binding affinity may play in this reduced potency, competitive [<sup>3</sup>H]-E2 ligand binding assays ligand-binding experiments were used to examine the effect of Y537S and D538G mutations on BZA, RAL, and FULV ER binding affinities <italic>in vitro</italic>. We previously showed that the E2 and 4-OHT binding was significantly reduced for both the Y537S and D538G mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Affinities were reported using K<sub>i</sub> values calculated from IC<sub>50</sub> values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Supplemental Table 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The affinities of RAL, BZA and FULV for the ER&#x03B1; mutants were reduced 9 to 27-fold relative to WT-ER&#x03B1;. It should be noted that the binding affinity of 4-OHT remained the highest compared to RAL, BZA and FULV against the mutant LBDs. The binding affinities of all tested antiestrogens were somewhat more reduced in D538G than in Y537S. However, FULV and BZA demonstrated the highest potencies in the transcriptional reporter gene assays, even though they exhibited reduced affinities compared to 4-OHT. Therefore, our data indicate that other factors beyond the reduced binding affinity of mutant LBDs for SERM or SERD must play a role in their decreased potency.</p>

<title>The SERD Properties of BZA Arise from its Disruption of Helix 12</title>
<p>X-ray crystallography was used to reveal the structural details of BZA&#x2019;s antiestrogen properties. An x-ray crystal structure for the WT ER&#x03B1; LBD, in complex with BZA was solved to 2.4 &#x00C5; with two dimers in the asymmetric unit (ASU) (PDB: 4XI3). The BZA ligand and H12 are well resolved in each monomer in the ASU; poorly resolved residues were not included in the model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplemental Figure 3</xref> shows the observed difference map density for the BZA ligand for chain A. We were unable to obtain diffraction quality crystals with BZA or RAL in complex with either the Y537S or D538G mutant LBDs.</p>
<p>Clear structural differences are apparent compared to the previously published molecular modeling and docking simulations of the ER&#x03B1; LBD-BZA complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Specifically, the C3 methyl on the indole ring of BZA appears to shift the core of the molecule away from M386, L391 and L428 and towards H12. BZA is most structurally similar to RAL; however, BZA displays more SERD-like behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows a superposition of the ER&#x03B1; LBD-BZA or RAL x-ray crystal structures. Interestingly, the distal phenol on BZA appears to form a hydrogen bond with improved binding geometry to H524 compared to the distal phenol of RAL. This suggests that the ketone on the RAL linker constrains the phenyl group, sterically precluding the adoption of an ideal hydrogen bonding geometry with H524. The core differences for BZA broadcast down the linker arm to alter its vector towards H12 where the azepan ring now pushes against V534 and P535 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The alterations to V534 and P535 propagate to H12 which appears displaced out of the AF-2 cleft into a less stable orientation.</p>

<title>BZA Binding Conformation is Energetically Favored Compared to RAL</title>
<p>Quantum mechanical calculations were employed to determine whether inherent differences in the BZA and RAL ligands accounted for differences in antagonist potency. A significant energetic shift was observed over the time-course of the scans, revealing that the BZA arm can adopt a set of torsion angles with significantly reduced energetic penalties compared to RAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Importantly, the energetic minima well is significantly broader for BZA compared to RAL, indicating that the angles adopted by BZA in the ER&#x03B1; ligand-binding site are more favorable than RAL. Furthermore, an energetic penalty of approximately 1 kcal/mol would be incurred by RAL to adopt the same conformation observed for BZA in the x-ray crystal structure.

<title>BZA and FULV Reduce the Impact of Y537S and D538G Mutations on Helix 12 Dynamics</title>
<p>SERDs competitively bind to the ER&#x03B1; LBD and destabilize helix 12 (H12), leading to proteosomal degradation, while SERMs push the helix into the AF2 cleft to block coregulator binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, AZD9496, a newer orally available SERD pushes H12 into the AF2 cleft but destabilizes the helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Previous work showed that the Y537S and D538G mutants, in complex with 4-OHT, adopts an altered antagonist conformation with respect to the WT-4-OHT complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Here, we explored how Y537S and D538G ER&#x03B1; LBD mutations impact H12 mobility in the BZA complex using differential hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). For comparisons we chose E2 as a representative hormone, FULV as a representative SERD, and 4-OHT as a representative SERM. Average time-dependent amide-deuterium uptake kinetics is indicative of conformational flexibility in proteins with highly dynamic regions being more susceptible to solvent deuterium exchange compared to conformationally rigid regions. As expected, addition of E2 resulted in an increased protection against exchange in H12 (inferred as increased stability or less dynamic), and this protection was enhanced for the Y537S and D538G mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). Also, FULV treatment led to increased D<sub>2</sub>O uptake in H12 (interpreted as destabilization) of regions near H12 in both the WT and D538G mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>), consistent with its SERD-like properties. Unfortunately, we were unable to collect HDX data for the Y537S mutant with FULV because it precipitated out of solution. Similar to previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], binding of 4-OHT resulted in decreased stability of H12 with the Y537S compared to D538G and WT receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that these mutants resist the ability of the SERM to alter their structure. Interestingly, addition of BZA did not increase the stability (lesser protection) of the region near H12 to as great of an extent as 4-OHT in WT and mutant ER&#x03B1; LBDs, suggesting that BZA-bound ER&#x03B1; adopts a less stable antagonist conformation than 4-OHT-bound ER&#x03B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>), consistent with the crystal structure. These data suggest that, while their antagonist conformations are altered by Y537S or D538G mutations, the ER&#x03B1;-BZA and FULV complexes maintain potency because they resist the stabilizing impact of the mutations better than 4-OHT.</p>

<title>How Y537S and D538G ER&#x03B1; LBD Mutants Alter the BZA Antagonist Structure</title>
<p>To understand the structural basis for the reduced BZA degradation of Y537S compared to WT ER&#x03B1;, atom-level explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the LBD of ER&#x03B1; Y537S-BZA and D538G-BZA were performed using the WT-BZA crystal structure as template. When compared to the WT-4-OHT structure (PDB: 3ERT), the D538G-4-OHT structure displayed a significantly altered H11-12 loop, which leads to a perturbed H12 antagonist state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>MD simulations show that H12 of both BZA-bound mutants remain close to an antagonist conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, D</xref>). Furthermore, H12 conformational fluctuations observed in MD simulations are less pronounced in Y537S-BZA than they are in D538G-BZA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which echoes the aforementioned reduced H12 dynamics observed in HDX-MS data and agrees with our result that Y537S reduces BZA activity more than D538G does. Over the course of the simulations, the Y537S-BZA structure shows a hydrogen bond formation between E380 and S537 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which could contribute to fewer H12 conformational fluctuations in Y537S ER&#x03B1;. It should be noted that this hydrogen bond is not sterically allowed in the WT-BZA crystal structure. This predicted hydrogen bond may stabilize H12 in the AF-2 cleft relative to WT. The simulated H11-12 loop conformations for both Y537S-BZA and D538G-BZA resemble WT-BZA or D538G-4-OHT, being closer to the ligand binding site, than they do to WT-4-OHT. The D538G mutation further increases the conformational variance of the H11-12 loop compared to Y537S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which can be explained by the lack of a hydrogen bond in Y537S and the greater backbone conformational freedom allowed by the mutant glycine residue. Additionally, the H11-12 loop of both Y537S and D538G appears further away from the protein core and BZA compared to that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, D</xref>). We hypothesize that the varied conformations and increased dynamics of the H11-12 loop in both ER&#x03B1; mutants makes it more difficult for BZA to maintain sufficient interactions with the loop to disrupt the ER antagonist conformation. Together, these data show that both mutations produce a stable antagonist conformation, especially at H12, and reduce the SERD-like properties of BZA by lessening its ability to disrupt the H11-12 loop and stabilize H12 in the AF-2 cleft.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Somatic mutation to <italic>ESR1</italic> following prolonged estrogen-deprivation therapy represents a newly appreciated mechanism of acquired hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer. The two most prevalent mutations,Y537S and D538G, give rise to a dysfunctional receptor that escapes hormone regulation and has decreased sensitivity to inhibition by 4-OHT and fulvestrant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Newly characterized orally available pure antiestrogens (<italic>e.g</italic>., GDC-0927, AZ9496, and RAD1901) are emerging as potentially potent inhibitors of these mutants, but their long-term clinical utility is unknown and their side effect profiles have not been studied in large patient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Because BZA is already clinically approved for use in hormone replacement therapy and is a potent ER&#x03B1; antagonist in the breast, an agonist in bone, and neutral in the endometrium with long-term safety data in thousands of patients, we explored its ability to inhibit the Y537S and D538G ER&#x03B1; somatic mutants in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>We first quantified the ability of BZA to disrupt WT and mutant ER&#x03B1; transcription, induce degradation, and inhibit cell growth in MCF-7 cells. These data show that BZA has increased activity, compared to the SERD FULV and SERM 4-OHT, toward inhibition of cell growth and ER&#x03B1; transcriptional activity. Further, BZA elicited degradation of WT receptor, although not as much as FULV. Importantly, BZA reduced the levels of Y537S ER&#x03B1; relative to RAL and 4-OHT. Together these data suggest that the ability of BZA to degrade ER&#x03B1; confers an inhibitory advantage over 4-OHT in the context of the somatic mutants. Additionally, combined treatment with BZA and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib resulted in additional inhibitory potency of cellular proliferation in breast cancer cells expressing both WT and Y537S ER&#x03B1; without impacting BZA&#x2019;s action. As such, combination BZA-CDK4/6 treatment shows significant potential in cell line experiments and merits further evaluation.</p>
<p>Comprehensive structural-biochemical investigations were undertaken to understand the basis for the SERD-like properties of BZA and its improved potency against the Y537S and D538G ER&#x03B1; LBD mutants compared to 4-OHT. Biochemical coactivator studies using recombinant ER&#x03B1; LBD demonstrated that BZA could inhibit the both basal and E2-induced recruitment of coregulators <italic>in vitro</italic>, while ligand-binding assays showed that the Y537S and D538G mutants had significantly reduced affinities for BZA, 4-OHT, RAL, and FULV. Interestingly, an HDX MS comparison of BZA, 4-OHT, and FULV suggested that FULV and BZA can both resist the impact of somatic mutation on their antagonist binding conformations compared to 4-OHT. An x-ray crystal structure of the WT-BZA complex revealed that differences in the core of the molecule translated to an altered vector of the linker arm, resulting in contacts with the H11-12 loop and a perturbed H12 antagonist binding mode. This less stable H12 antagonist conformation likely explains the SERM/SERD properties of BZA, wherein it allows H12 to adopt an antagonist conformation (like a SERM) that is somewhat destabilized, although not as destabilized as when FULV is bound.</p>
<p>Atomistic MD simulations were used to examine the molecular basis for the observed decrease in degradation of ER&#x03B1; within breast cancer cells expressing the Y537S and D538G mutants. Both mutants stabilized the antagonist conformation of H12 in the AF-2 cleft, while the Y537S appeared to be the more stable of the two by forming a hydrogen bond between S537 and E380. Interestingly, E380Q has also been found to be a recurrent ESR1 mutation able to confer endocrine resistance. MD simulations also suggest that these mutants have varied conformations and increased dynamics of loop H11-12, which potentially reduces BZA&#x2019;s ability to disrupt ER antagonist conformations. Together these results suggest that BZA retains its SERM antagonist properties within breast cancer cells expressing Y537S and D538G mutant ER&#x03B1; to a greater extent than 4-OHT but its SERD-like properties are diminished. The reduced potency on the mutants likely derives from the stabilization of the apo receptor in the agonist conformation, which reduces the on rate of ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], reflecting that the agonist conformer blocks ligand exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Overall, our findings show the molecular basis for the SERD-like activity of BZA and its potential advantage with and without CDK4/6 inhibitor, versus 4-OHT, to inhibit the Y537S and D538G ER&#x03B1; mutants. Importantly, interrogating the structural details of BZA-ER&#x03B1; LBD binding suggests that molecules with improved pharmacological profiles that specifically disrupt the H11-12 loop at H12 will have clear advantages against breast cancer cells expressing WT, Y537S, and D538G ER&#x03B1;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> summarizes how BZA achieves SERM/SERD activity compared to SERM or agonist compounds. In fact, the newer SERM/SERDs and SERDs with improved pharmacologic profiles (<italic>e.g.</italic>, AZ9496) appear to do so using a similar mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Therefore, further preclinical evaluation of BZA with and without a CDK4/6 inhibitor should be conducted in context of breast cancer cells expressing the Y537S and D538G somatic mutant ER&#x03B1;. In addition, the ability of other new SERDs to withstand the impact of Y537S and D538G mutations on their antagonist binding modes should be investigated.</p>

<p>This method has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Cell lysates of MCF7 cells expressing HA-tagged WT-ER, Y537S mutant ER and D538G mutant ER were quantified by ELISA (Active Motif, USA) to enable equimolar input. An array with a set of immobilized peptides representing coregulator-derived NR-binding motifs was incubated with a reaction mixture of crude lysate, vehicle (2&#x0025; DMSO) with or without 1 &#x03BC;M 17&#x03B2;-estradiol (E2), increasing concentrations of BZA, 4-OHT or FULV (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 nM) and anti-HIS-Alexa488 (Qiagen, USA).

<title>Peptide Identification</title>
<p>Peptides were identified using tandem MS (MS<sup>2</sup> or MS/MS) experiments performed with a LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap XL with ETD, ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA) over a 70 min gradient. Product ion spectra were acquired in a data-dependent mode and the five most abundant ions were selected for the product ion analysis per scan event. The MS/MS &#x002A;.raw data files were converted to &#x002A;.mgf files and then submitted to MASCOT ver2.3 (Matrix Science, London, UK) for peptide identification. The maximum number of missed cleavage was set at 4 with the mass tolerance for precursor ions &#x002B;/- 0.6 Da and for fragment ions &#x002B;/- 8ppm. Oxidation to Methionine was selected for variable modification. Pepsin was used for digestion and no specific enzyme was selected in the MASCOT during the search. Peptides included in the peptide set used for HDX detection had a MASCOT score of 20 or greater. The MS/MS MASCOT search was also performed against a decoy (reverse) sequence and false positives were ruled out. The MS/MS spectra of all the peptide ions from the MASCOT search were further manually inspected and only the unique charged ions with the highest MASCOT score were used in estimating the sequence coverage and included in HDX peptide set.</p>

<title>HDX-MS analysis</title>
<p>For differential HDX experiments, 5 &#x03BC;L of a 10 &#x03BC;M ER&#x03B1; LBD (Apo or in complex with 10-fold excess compound) was diluted to 25 &#x03BC;L with D<sub>2</sub>O-containing HDX buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5&#x0025; glycerol, 1 mM DTT) and incubated at 4 &#x00B0;C for 10 s, 30 s, 60 s, 900 s, and 3600 s. Following on-exchange, unwanted forward or backward exchange is minimized, and the protein is denatured by dilution to 50 &#x03BC;L with 0.1&#x0025; TFA in 5 M urea with 50mM TCEP (held at 4 &#x00B0;C, pH 2.5). Samples are then passed across an immobilized pepsin column (prepared in house) at 50 &#x03BC;L min-1 (0.1&#x0025; TFA,15 &#x00B0;C), and the resulting peptides are trapped onto a C<sub>8</sub> trap cartridge (Thermo Fisher, Hypersil Gold).

Percent deuterium exchange values for peptide isotopic envelopes at each time point were calculated and processed using HDX Workbench [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Each HDX experiment was carried out in triplicate with a single preparation of each protein-ligand complex. The intensity weighted mean m/z centroid value of each peptide envelope was calculated and subsequently converted into a percentage of deuterium incorporation. This is accomplished by determining the observed averages of the undeuterated and using the conventional formula described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Statistical significance for the differential HDX data is determined by an unpaired t-test for each time point, a procedure that is integrated into the HDX Workbench software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Corrections for back-exchange were made on the basis of an estimated 70&#x0025; deuterium recovery and accounting for 80&#x0025; final deuterium concentration in the sample (1:5 dilution in D<sub>2</sub>O HDX buffer).</p>
