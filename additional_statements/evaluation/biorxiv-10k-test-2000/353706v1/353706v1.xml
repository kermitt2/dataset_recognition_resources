<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Recent sequencing efforts unveil genomic landscapes of the tumor microenvironment. Yet, little is known about the extent to which matrisome pattern is conserved in progressive tumors across diverse cancer types, and thus its clinical impact remains largely unexplored.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Using a newly generated, unified data resource, we conducted cross-platform assessment of a measure of altered extra-cellular matrix (ECM) composition and remodeling associated with tumor progression, termed as the matrisome index (TMI). Parallel analyses with TCGA in over 30,000 patient-derived biopsies revealed that TMI is closely associated with mutational load, tumor histopathology, and predictive of patient outcomes. We found an enrichment of specific tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations, signatures predictive of immunotherapy resistance, and several immune checkpoints in tumors with high TMI, suggesting potential role of ECM interaction with immunophenotyes and tumor immune escape mechanisms. Both epithelial cancer cells and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts are potential cellular contributors of such deregulated matrisome.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite wide spectrum of genetic heterogeneity and dynamic nature, matrisome abnormalities are integral to disease progression. Our resource of a curated compendium of 8,386 genome-wide profiles, molecular and clinical associations, and matrisome-tumor genotype-immunophenotype relationships identify potentially actionable immune targets that may guide personalized immunotherapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex multi-spatial meshwork of macromolecules with structural, biochemical and biomechanical cues, influencing virtually all fundamental aspects of cell biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Although rigidly controlled during normal development, ECM is frequently altered in many diseases, including cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Despite clear evidence of abnormal tumor matrix in cancer - owing to complex nature of ECM proteins and their associated factors, or matrisome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] - characterization and understanding their functional role in tumors have been challenging. Little is known about the extent to which matrisome pattern is shared across various carcinomas or unique in tumors of differing metastatic potential. It remains unclear whether there exist subclasses of tumor matrisome that modulates tumor initiation and response to therapy, particularly in the context of immune response.</p>
<p>Previously, we had demonstrated a robust association between a pattern of 29 matrisome genes and its predictive value in prognosis and adjuvant therapy response in early-stage nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. This specific pattern of matrisome gene expression is termed the tumor matrisome index (TMI). Given that abnormal ECM dynamics are a hallmark of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], we hypothesized that this pattern of genomic aberrations in tumor matrix is associated with intrinsic resistance to the therapy, patient outcomes and other clinically relevant parameters, across various tumor types. The present study thus extended evaluation of the TMI to 11 major cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>To facilitate cross-platform meta-analysis of TMI with TCGA, we generated a single, cancer type-specific, merged microarray-acquired dataset (MMD), comprising thousands of transcriptome profiles of both tumor and tumor-free tissues (Tables S1 and S2). Given the derivation from a uniform computational pipeline, MMD accounts for technical bias from preprocessing.</p>
<p>We further define the pan-cancer matrisome landscape by exploring previously unknown features of matrix remodeling and their impact on tumor genotypes and immunophenotypes. Using this newly curated MMD together with 12 TCGA cohorts, we found robust associations of tumor-promoting matrix composition with genomic instability, molecular and clinical features, and immune infiltrate composition. At the center of our results is the promising clinical applicability of TMI to predict immunotherapeutic responsiveness and the identification of specific immune targets that may be selectively efficacious in subset of matrisome-deregulated carcinomas.</p>

<title>Patterns of deregulated matrisome genes are conserved in various malignancies</title>
<p>Given that the initial TMI was derived from lung cancer, we first questioned the extent to which genome-wide DE patterns of lung cancer would be shared across various carcinomas. Conducting cross-platform analysis with TCGA, we found that DE patterns of lung cancers were comparable to that of breast, ovarian, bladder, colorectal, and prostate cancers, regardless of assayed platforms (Tables S3 and S4). Recent pan-cancer studies have revealed some cancers of these tumor types were classified into common molecular subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Assessing the initial 29-matrisome-gene signature at the individual gene level, we found that many genes were consistently positioned in the top of the ranked DE gene list across multiple epithelial cancers, despite their initial derivation from lung cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref> and Table S5). We further identified a subset of these genes, or &#x201C;generic&#x201D; signature, that was significantly enriched in most cancers (Table S6; see Methods). This initial screening provided support for a valid hypothesis that altered matrisome dynamics is a common tumor response across various cancer types. We thus investigated whether previously developed scoring metrics (TMI; see Methods) could further serve as a clinical tool for predictive medicine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>TMI classifies cancer</title>
<p>Analyzing a total of 14,095 biopsies (Tables S7 and S8; see Methods), all eleven cancers examined demonstrated significant difference in the TMI between tumors and tumor-free tissues, except for TCGA PAAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Non-significance in PAAD is likely due to insufficient normal samples for comparison (normal n &#x003D; 4 vs. tumor n &#x003D; 178). Lung cancer-derived TMI expectedly achieved almost perfect accuracy in lung cancer diagnosis (MMD AUC &#x003D; 0.946 and TCGA AUC &#x003D; 0.999; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref> and Table S9; see Methods). Robust diagnostic potential was also demonstrated across all tumor types at any given time and tumor purity, to different extents. The observed difference in some cancer types between two assayed platforms is due to different number of genes filtered in TCGA for final index computation (Table S2).</p>
<p>A further independent data source where tumors were procured under standard conditions and examined 1,492 tumor samples across 10 cancer types was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref> and Table S10; see Methods). Although over a narrower range than for lung cancer, the rest of carcinomas displayed a broad range of the index, revealing a degree of heterogeneity and spectrum of matrix remodeling at different stages of cancer progression. Given minimal technical variation introduced between samples from this single resource, the consistent observed difference in the range of index and wide biological variability suggest a characteristic and causal mechanism and role of ECM molecules independent of site of tumor origin.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>TMI is predictive of patient outcomes</title>
<p>Using 72 independent datasets, we found that the predictive power of TMI for patient survival was dependent on cancer type (Table S11; and for lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]). The TMI was an unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) across prostate, melanoma, liver, pancreatic, renal, and breast cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>, Figures S1 and S2). Although not consistently significant, predicted low-risk patients with colorectal and bladder cancer had better survival for a number of patient cohorts. In contrast, there was no negative correlation between the index and survival in patients with ovarian and gastric cancer; rather TMI was a positive prognostic factor for recurrence and survival in gastric cancers.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="353706_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Clinical associations with not only OS but also progression-free survival (PFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) provides better insights into the matrisomal changes during tumor progression and metastatic dissemination. For example, the index was highly correlated with metastasis development in lung (HR &#x003D; 8.63, P &#x003D; 0.012), but not in bone (HR &#x003D; 0.44, P &#x003D; 0.13), among breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>); this is consistent with the proposed role of extracellular protein encoding genes, such as proteases and chemokines, in promoting metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Liver cancer, among others, demonstrated marked predictive capacity of the index for multiple surrogate endpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Its potential use as a predictor of multicentric occurrence for early-stage hepatocellular carcinomas may guide clinical course and treatment strategies, which depend on classification of subtype of multifocal HCC tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Multivariate analyses taking into account age, race, gender, and clinical and pathological TNM status revealed that TMI is an independent predictor of survival in colorectal, liver, breast, renal, ovarian, and gastric carcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref> and Table S12). Comparing with traditional clinical features between two stratified patient groups in TCGA, we found that the high-risk group had a higher proportion of patients staged pathologically as T3 or T4, diagnosed as lymph node and distant metastasis positive, and classified as late stage.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>There exists a tumor genotype-matrisome phenotype relationship</title>
<p>Given the above association with disease progression and stage of cancer, we asked if there was progressive dysregulation of the TMI in the step-wise progression to advanced cancer. Expression of progression markers should gradually increase or decrease during multistep carcinogenesis to be clinically applicable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Across breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer, we found a progressive increase in the index during tumor development from normal to adenoma to carcinoma in-situ, and further to invasive carcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and Table S13).</p>

</fig>
<p>Molecular subtyping in breast cancer is often associated with its predictive value for prognosis and response to various treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. We found that basal-like and HER2&#x002B; tumors consistently had higher TMI than luminal tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref> and Table S14); paralleling trends were reported in prior works for breast cancer specific survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Collectively, breast cancers exhibit the strongest association of TMI with both molecular and clinical features among all types of cancer investigated.</p>
<p>Using TCGA datasets, we found a strong correlation of the TMI with tumor mutational burden (TMB), defined as the total number of simple somatic mutations, in pancreas, stomach, prostate, colon, lung, and breast cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>, Tables S15 and S16; see Methods). This suggests a potential role of matrisome molecules in providing unique selective pressures in the tumor microenvironment and increasing genomic instability. Given that non-synonymous somatic mutations are major determinants of tumor immunogenicity in many solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], we next asked if there exists any direct association of this abnormal matrisome with the immune landscapes and conducted cross-platform evaluation of TMI in the context of immune response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Matrisome associates with tumor immunophenotypes and escape mechanisms</title>
<p>By applying CIBERSORT to MMDs and TCGA, we found that for many cancers, TMI was closely correlated with composition of specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Enrichment of these TILs related to both innate and adaptive immunity was diverse and cancer-specific. Relative abundance of M0 and M1 macrophages, neutrophils, activated mast cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, activated CD4&#x002B; memory T cells generally increased, whereas that of resting CD4&#x002B; memory T cells, mast cells, na&#x00EF;ve B cells, and resting dendritic cells decreased along with tumor-promoting matrix remodeling. Impact on immune infiltrates was particularly pronounced in gastric, lung, colorectal and breast cancers, having significant positive and negative correlations with TMI. This highlights the evolving nature of the immune response during matrisome remodeling in these selected cancers. It is noteworthy that despite having no correlation with mutational load, TMI of some cancer types, such as liver, renal, and ovarian cancers, remains associated with specific TIL composition. This indicates that not only tumor genotypes but also matrisome phenotypes may be critical determinants of tumor immunogenicity and thus inter-tumor heterogeneity of immune infiltration, considering highly heterogeneous expression of ECM molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>

<graphic xlink:href="353706_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We further estimated functional activation of distinct immune cells, as recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], for their potential role in specific killing of tumor cells upon immunotherapy. Across all cancers except for bladder cancers, the activation state of CD4&#x002B; T cells was significantly higher in tumors with high TMI, suggesting their central role in response to abnormalities in the local matrix niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Activations of other innate immune infiltrates such as NK cells, DC cells, and mast cells, were also either positively or negatively correlated in specific cancer types, whereas in others these cell types had no correlation with matrisomal changes. Due to high enrichment of M0 macrophages, functional activities of M1 and M2 macrophages were repressed in tumors with high TMI (and thus classified as high-risk based on cut-off index), shifting the tumor microenvironment toward an immunosuppressive phenotype.</p>
<p>We next correlated the index directly with the expression of 20 potentially targetable immune checkpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] &#x2013; that are currently in preclinical or clinical trials, and are FDA-approved. Many of these genes were enriched in tumors with high TMI, potentially responding to expanded CD4&#x002B; T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref> and Table S17). The highest number of immune targets with correlation was found in lung cancer; those genes whose expression levels are positively correlated with TMI in both MMD and TCGA are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. Particularly, B7-H3 is a promising pan-cancer immune marker, which may be selectively efficacious in these high-risk tumors. Altogether, these findings unveil specific immune targets that may be selectively efficacious in a subset of matrisome-deregulated carcinomas. We expect that these tumors will be more sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade given that they harbor sufficient immune infiltrates and upregulated immune checkpoints.</p>
<p>Given promising applicability of our metrics in prediction of immunotherapy responsiveness, we tested how this specific matrisome would be expressed relative to a previously defined signature of cancers that fail to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. By applying innate PD-1 resistance signature (IPRES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] to lung MMD and TCGA LUAD, we found that patients who are predicted to be resistant, or &#x2018;IPRES-enriched&#x2019;, attained higher TMI than the rest of the patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>; see Methods). Extending the analysis to the rest of cancer types, we found that prostate, ovarian, lung, and bladder cancers further demonstrated significant difference in TMI between these two predicted groups (p &#x003C; 0.01 in both platforms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). As IPRES is predictive of resistance, not response, we further identified 161-gene &#x2018;responder signature&#x2019; by applying strict criteria to the DE gene list obtained from the original work (see Methods). Except for melanomas, TMI of all cancers had direct negative correlation with GSVA z-scores of responder signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>), to different extents, with the most pronounced association seen for lung cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>Epithelial cancer cells and CAFs are potential cellular contributors of tumor matrisome</title>
<p>We sought to determine the potential cellular source of this common matrisome response observed in bulk tumors. By comparing with previously identified stroma-derived signatures, six ECM genes were reported to be prognostic and differentially expressed in activated stroma, or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), compared to normal stroma (Table S18) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Many ECM-associated enzymes and other paracrine factors are known to be of fibroblastic origin, leading to altered ECM metabolism and protein expression in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Tumor samples annotated with estimates of both epithelia and stroma components by both pathological and <italic>in silico</italic> means were then analyzed. Tumors with almost no epithelial component expectedly exhibited a wide range of the index, due to stromal cell-derived variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). We found an unexpected weak positive correlation between the index and tumor content, indicating tumor cells may also play a role in producing these specific tumor-supporting matrix components (Table S19).</p>

<p>The initial screening of micro-dissected ovarian tissues revealed significantly higher index in both tumor epithelial cells and stromal CAFs compared to normal ovarian surface epithelial cells and fibroblasts, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Heatmaps of these samples demonstrated shared matrisome patterns in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). This pattern was also observed in various malignances including breast, ovarian, liver, colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, showing their ubiquitous alteration at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D-E</xref> and Table S20). Using human/mouse xenograft models coupled with proteomics, characteristic contribution from both tumor and stromal cells to the production of ECM proteins in tumors of differing metastatic potential was recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The mode by which these cells in tumor matrix produce, degrade, remodel and eventually deregulate tumor matrisome and whether these cell types mutually crosstalk or instruct one another to shape tumor-promoting matrisome remain to be uncovered.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This work is based on cross-platform evaluation of TMI in over 30,000 primary tumors across 11 major cancer types. Prior integrative genome-wide profiling studies are limited to single platforms, interrogating either RNA-seq-based TCGA or microarray-based GEO data. Curating a total of 8,836 patient-derived tumor and tumor-free samples, we generated 11 cancer type-specific MMDs annotated with clinical features and deposited the data at ArrayExpress (see Data Availability). This approach further minimizes biased selection of validation cohorts and allows parallel analyses with other high-throughput data sources - without having to conduct laborious data mining in search for multiple small-scale patient cohorts.</p>
<p>Considering that the index was computed under the assumptions of each gene having concordant regulation as observed in lung cancer, it is noteworthy that tumors with highly dynamic and constantly remodeling ECM could have ubiquitously altered expression of matrisome genes across genetically and phenotypically diverse epithelial tumors. The data may indicate the presence of shared signal transduction pathways activated across these selective tumors, such as recently reported TGF&#x03B2; or HIF1&#x03B1;/VEGF pathways, in controlling ECM balance or cell-intrinsic mechanism regulating the expression of set of ECM genes contributing to tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we provide a comprehensive overview of common matrisome variation in the context of tumor genotypes, molecular and clinical parameters, and immunophenotypes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest potential role of ECM molecules in determining immunosuppressive microenvironment and immune escape mechanisms with cross-platform evaluation of a spectrum of major human malignancies. We found a significant enrichment of tumor-promoting immune infiltrates, IPRES, and multiple immune checkpoints in tumors with high TMI. Heterogeneous infiltration within the same immune cell population was also observed across tumors of varying matrisome indices. For example, high-risk lung tumors according to TMI were significantly enriched for M0 and M1 macrophages, whereas low-risk tumors were negatively enriched for M2 macrophages, suggesting different mechanisms adopted by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to promote tumor progression.</p>
<p>Many of potentially targetable immune checkpoints were enriched in tumors with high TMI, possibly in dulling CD4&#x002B; T cell activation, as seen by our CIBERSORT deconvolution analysis. Particularly, we found that B7-H3 emerged as a promising pan-cancer immune target. We expect that such tumors will be more sensitive to immunotherapy due to sufficient immune infiltrates and upregulated expression of immune checkpoints. Tumors with hypermutant phenotypes are regarded as better candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitors across a wide spectrum of cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Given positive correlation of TMI with mutational burden, it could thus be postulated that tumors with higher TMI would be more susceptible to immunotherapy. Retrospective analyses using IPRES, however, revealed that high-risk tumors associated more closely with signature predictive of resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, and vice versa for low-risk tumors. This suggests that high mutational load may not necessarily imply tumor response, as reported in the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. In particular, lung cancer was found to have the most pronounced correlation effects with IPRES signatures. Given the predictive role of PD-L1 expression for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], enrichment of IPRES in tumors with high TMI may be attributed to insufficient PD-L1 expression in these tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The findings altogether reinforce the need to adopt a more &#x201C;holistic&#x201D; approach to find biomarkers for immunotherapy response that take into consideration tumor, tumor microenvironment and host immunity.</p>
<p>Matrisomal changes during the colorectal and breast cancer multistep carcinogenesis were also implicated. This holds particular promise as no more than a dozen or so &#x201C;driver&#x201D; mutations, mostly occurring in tumor suppressors and oncogene, are thought to be potential progression markers of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Likewise, despite much efforts to characterize ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), there is currently no standard test accurately identifying tumors likely to progress from preinvasive to invasive carcinomas in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Unlike limited information that could be inferred from the binary mutational status, the interpretation of progressively changing TMI on a continuous scale as a progression marker will be clinically pertinent and straightforward.</p>
<p>Since both tumor and CAF are sources of ECM proteins, targeting both cancer cells and CAFs may represent a better strategy to improve antitumor efficacy by remodeling the tumor. Even if actionable targets are found in cancer cells, excessive ECM deposition followed by CAF accumulation presumably build physical barrier and thus prevent efficient drug delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Owing to low likelihood of developing clonal selection and therapy resistance, genetic stability of CAFs further makes them promising therapeutic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. CAF-targeting approach, however, has been challenged for many reasons, such as lack of specific markers and resulting toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The genes that make up this TMI may provide specific targets that are of relevance for this purpose.</p>
<p>Two matrisome-gene-based classifiers and their relevance in clinical outcomes have recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. However, technical feasibility and clinical applicability of these gene panels have not been clearly demonstrated. Their predictive values are further limited to OS, without implication of intrinsic resistance to adjuvant therapy. We showed that the index does not vary greatly with tumor purity without considering other confounding factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>), suggesting feasibility to the testing. We further demonstrated that the index remains robust in clinical outcomes for multiple surrogate endpoints (OS, DFS, RFS, MFS, PFS, and MO), even in situations where a few genes were missing (table S2), and is an independent predictor of survival. This facilitates easy application and practical development into an affordable multi-gene panel that can be assayed with conventional qPCR in clinical practice. These metrics, nevertheless, will require functional validation in prospective clinical studies and necessitate a standard tissue procession protocols for precise measurement.</p>

<title>Preprocessing of Datasets</title>
<p>All 147 independent public datasets used in this study are summarized in Table S1. Preprocessing methods, number of patient sample, platform assayed, and genes included in the computation of TMI are recorded in Table S2. Raw data of independent studies were RMA-normalized using the <italic>affy</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] or preprocessed&#x002D; or author-defined normalized-data were used as stated in Table S2. Most were assayed with the full 29-gene platform (Affymetrix-GPL570), although some microarray platforms had few missing genes, which are stated in Table S2. As genes without having at least 1 count in at least 20&#x0025; patients were excluded from preprocessing (described below), different number of ECM genes were included in the computation for the final index for TCGA data. Probes having maximum expression values were collapsed to the genes for subsequent index scoring.</p>

<title>12 TCGA Cohorts</title>
<p>Using <italic>TCGA-Assembler</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data of 11 epithelial cancer types were collected, processed, and annotated with clinical parameters (Tables S1 and S2). Due to lack of normal tissue samples, OV and SKCM cohorts, representing ovarian and melanoma cancers respectively, were excluded in DE analyses. <italic>TCGA-Assembler</italic> R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] was used to extract normalized RPKM count values. In each dataset, we excluded genes without minimum 1 counts per million (cpm) or RPMK value in less than 20&#x0025; of total number of samples were excluded using <italic>edgeR</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].

<title>Generic ECM Signature</title>
<p>We extracted the ranking of 29 ECM genes and visualized their positions in each DE gene list from each cancer-specific TCGA cohort with circular plots generated via the <italic>circlize</italic> package (Table S5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. To further investigate the extent to which ECM genes exhibit greater degree of DE variation among 29 lung-specific ECM genes across all tumors, we derived a &#x201C;generic&#x201D; ECM signature based on a weight computed for each ECM gene using the following formula, which was slightly modified from equation that was used to derive generic EMT signature in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]:

As not all 29 ECM genes were present in the final cancer-specific DE gene list due to preprocessing, each gene was computed with different number of total <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for the weight. &#x201C;Generic&#x201D; ECM signature was then derived from 17 ECM genes having a weighted sum &#x003E; 3.90 and further visualized for their position in the ranked DE gene list in a circular plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). SFTPC gene was not present in the final DE gene list of all TCGA cohorts, except for lung cancer cohort which was not included in the weight computation.</p>

<title>Tumor Matrisome Index (TMI)</title>
<p>Our 29 ECM gene signature includes collagens (COL11A1, COL10A1, COL6A6), glycoproteins (SPP1, CTHRC1, TNNC1, ABI3BP, PCOLCE2), ECM regulators (MMP12, MMP1, ADAMTS5), ECM-affiliated proteins (GREM1, SFTPC, SFTPA2, SFTPD, FCN3), secreted factors (S140A2, CXCL13, WIF1, CHRDL1, CXCL2, IL6, HHIP, S140A12), proteoglycan (OGN) and other ECM-related components (LPL, CPB2, MAMDC2, CD36) coding genes. Expression profiles of these 29 genes were then extracted from collapsed normalized data and computed for the index, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>

<title>Diagnostic Performance</title>
<p>Complete lists of the patient ID and respective personalized TMI from both tumor and tumor-free samples across microarray and RNA-seq platforms are recorded in tables S7 and S8, respectively. TMI of tumor and normal groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. To further statistically evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the TMI in deciding the presence of the disease, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, and specificity with the best threshold determined by the <italic>pROC</italic> package[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] (Table S9). All ROC curves generated were subjected to binormal smoothing for illustration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantification of TMI Spectrum</title>
<p>We analyzed the Expression Project for Oncology (expO) data provided by the International Genomics Consortium (IGC, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.intgen.com">www.intgen.com</ext-link>) for ECM spectrum quantification, owing to their procurement of tumor samples under standard conditions. This minimized potential non-biological variations across multiple cancer types, and thus allowed us to perform comparative analysis; data from MMDs and RNA-seq cohorts were excluded for possible batch-effects and different number of genes included in ECM risk scoring, respectively. All patients annotated with prostate, lung, renal, liver, gastric, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal, and bladder cancer from the expO dataset were included in the spectrum quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref> and Table S10).</p>

<title>Patient Stratification</title>
<p>For each preprocessed independent datasets (Table S2), cut-off index was determined using the Cutoff Finder algorithm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] to stratify each patient cohort into low-and high-risk groups. Statistical summary of 72 datasets used in survival analysis is recorded in Table S11. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves were derived for OS and DSS endpoints (Fig. S1) and other multiple endpoints (Fig. S2) using the <italic>survival</italic> package in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival">http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival</ext-link>). Multivariate Cox regression analyses were done to adjust confounding factors including age, race, gender, pT, pN, and pM status (Table S12). For all cancer types, patients with available survival data and TMI were all included in the KM analyses.</p>

<title>Molecular Subtypes of Breast Cancer</title>
<p>Of the 147 independent datasets, five datasets (BRCA, GSE20711, GSE21653, GSE19615, and GSE50567) were annotated with either ER, PR, and HER2 status or defined molecular subtypes of breast cancers (normal breast-like, luminal A, luminal B, HER2 positive, and basal-like); tumors harboring positive status of ER and/or negative status of HER2 were classified as luminal cancers while the basal-like tumors were defined as ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative cancers (table S14).</p>

<title>Total Mutational Burden</title>
<p>We obtained the mutational load of TCGA tumor samples across nine epithelial cancer types from the NCI GDC Data Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/</ext-link>) using the same TCGA samples used to generate TMI in our previous analyses. The portal defines the mutational load as the total number of simple somatic mutations. Only tumors harboring at least one mutation were included and log 10 transformed to compute Spearman correlations between TMI and mutational load. To further relate the cut-off of TMI (identified in prior survival analyses) to clinical application, we stratified each TCGA cancer cohort into low-and high-risk groups and compared the mutational load between two groups using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test (Tables S15 and S16).</p>

<title>IPRES and GSVA Z-Scores</title>
<p>IPRES was obtained from Broad MSigDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb">http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb</ext-link>) and Supplementary Data from the original publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Using the gene set variation analysis (GSVA), we computed both GSVA score and TMI for any given sample and converted to z-scores. We then obtained the mean z-score for each sample and applied a cutoff of &#x003E; 0.35, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] to define a patient as &#x201C;IPRES-enriched&#x201D;.

For any given sample, we calculated Spearman correlation between TMI and relative abundance of each immune cell type using our 11 generated MMDs and 11 TCGA cohorts (LUAD, OV, SKCM, BLCA, LIHC, BRCA, COAD, STAD, KIRC, PRAD, and PAAD). As our MMDs of breast, colorectal, and lung cancer exceeded maximum load capacity (500 MB), 1,000 tumors were randomly selected for input data files. We selected LM22 (22 immune cell types) for signature gene file, 100 for permutations, and disabled quantile normalization for all runs.</p>
