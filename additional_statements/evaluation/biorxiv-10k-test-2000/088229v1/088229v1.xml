<title>Abstract</title>
<p>MicroRNA dysregulation is a common feature of cancer and due to the promiscuity of microRNA binding this can result in a wide array of genes whose expression is altered. miR-106b is an oncomiR overexpressed in cholangiocarcinoma and its upregulation in this and other cancers often leads to repression of anti-tumorigenic targets. The goal of this study was to identify the miR-106b-regulated gene landscape in cholangiocarcinoma cells using a genome-wide, unbiased mRNA analysis. Through RNA-Seq we found 112 mRNAs significantly repressed by miR-106b. The majority of these genes contain the specific miR-106b seed-binding site. We have validated 11 genes from this set at the mRNA level and demonstrated regulation by miR-106b of five proteins. Combined analysis of our miR-106b-regulated mRNA data set plus published reports indicate that miR-106b binding is anchored by G:C pairing in and near the seed. Novel targets Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and KLF6 were verified both at the mRNA and at the protein level. Further investigation showed regulation of four other KLF family members by miR-106b. We have discovered coordinated repression of several members of the KLF family by miR-106b that may play a role in cholangiocarcinoma tumor biology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>miR-106b has been established as an oncogenic microRNA with increased expression in many cancers including cholangiocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], gastric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Some functions of miR-106b include increased proliferation by miR-106b-mediated reduction of the transcription factor E2F1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and the tumor suppressor RB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Additionally, miR-106b increased migration through targeting of the phosphatase PTEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], and reduced apoptosis by regulating the BH3-containing protein Bim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>MicroRNAs function to dampen the expression of their targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. This is accomplished both through reduction in mRNA transcript level as well as by repression of translation. While both mechanisms contribute to reduced target protein expression, the effect of mRNA reduction may dominate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], in part because each message is used as a transcript for synthesis of many protein molecules; still, the magnitude of change in mRNA expression is low. A focused description of the binding characteristics and targets of individual microRNAs is feasible and desirable.</p>
<p>The seed region of a microRNA is a 7-8 nucleotide sequence at the 5&#x2019; end of the microRNA which is vital for complementary binding to its mRNA target. The complementary seed-binding site is more or less conserved among targets, allowing for broad transcript-expression dampening effects from a single microRNA. Seed-binding sites are highly enriched in the 3&#x2019; untranslated region (UTR) of transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. There is also evidence that supports non-canonical, non-seed mRNA target interactions between microRNAs and their targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The traditional seed for miR-106b is located at nucleotides 1-8 on its 5&#x2019; end, corresponding to the microRNA sequence 5&#x2019;UAAAGUGC.</p>
<p>In this study, we sought to define the genome-wide target set of miR-106b and found that miR-106b binding relied on sequences between bases 2-10, tolerating a G:U wobble in the seed region. We found 112 transcripts that were regulated at the mRNA level in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Finally, we demonstrated that members of the KLF family of transcription factors are coordinately repressed by miR-106b. Comparison of our data in cholangiocarcinoma cells with data in Flp-In T-REx 293 human embryonic kidney-derived cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] revealed that the microRNA-responsive gene set is largely cell-type specific.</p>

<title>Cell lines</title>
<p>Human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were previously derived from a female patient with metastatic gallbladder cancer, Mz-ChA-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], or a male patient with combined histologic features of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, KMCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. BDEneu rat cholangiocarcinoma cells were derived from primary Fisher 344 rat cholangiocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. H69 cells are a non-malignant immortalized cholangiocyte cell line. Cholangiocarcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modified Eagle&#x2019;s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10&#x0025; fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin (0.5 &#x03BC;g/mL) and G418 (50 &#x03BC;g/mL). H69 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x0025; FBS, insulin (5 &#x03BC;g/mL), adenine (24.3 &#x03BC;g/mL), epinephrine (1 ug/mL), tri-iodothyronine (T3)-transferrin (T), [T3-2.23 ng/ml, T-8.19 &#x03BC;g/mL], epidermal growth factor (9.9 ng/mL) and hydrocortisone (5.34 &#x03BC;g/mL).</p>
<p>Cells were transfected either with mature miR-106b mimic (Life Technologies), locked-nucleic acid (LNA) antagonist to miR-106b, LNA-106b (Exiqon), or LNA Negative Control A (Exiqon) for 24-48 hours using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX at a final oligonucleotide concentration of 20 nM. miR-106b levels were quantified by TaqMan Small RNA assay (Life Technologies).</p>

<title>RNA-Seq</title>
<p>High quality total RNA was extracted from Mz-ChA-1 cells transfected with either miR-106b (n=3) or LNA-106b (n=3) for RNA-Seq using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The quality of the RNA was confirmed by RNA Integrity Analysis using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared by the UNMC Next Generation Sequencing Core Facility beginning with 1 &#x03BC;g of total RNA and a TruSeq RNA Prep V2 (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA). Samples were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system with 100 bp paired-end reads. An average of 76.99 million reads per sample were collected (range 58.99-87.00 million).</p>
<p>Sequences were analyzed by the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Core at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) using the Tuxedo protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Reads were mapped to the human genome using Top Hat. Transcripts were assigned by Cuff links and the transcriptome defined using Cuffmerge. Finally, differential expression between miR-106b and LNA-106b was calculated with Cuffdiff.</p>
<p>Using a false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p value, genome-wide transcripts were ranked from most significant to least. This ranked list of genes was submitted to the SylArray online server to detect enrichment of microRNA seed-binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>

<title>miR-106b binding site analysis</title>
<p>RefSeq sequences for the 129 significant genes (112 decreased and 17 increased) were collected in Fasta format and analyzed by direct search for the known miR-106b binding site as well as subjected to k-mer analysis to generate a k table of all possible 7-mer and 8-mer sequences and their frequency in this gene set. Several genes had more than one RefSeq sequence, so the final size of this Fasta file was 191 transcripts. For comparison, 1,000 random sets of 191 transcripts each from the RefSeq database were generated.</p>
<p>RNAHybrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] was used to identify the single best miR-106b predicted binding site for each decreased transcript based on minimum free energy hybridization.

<title>MicroRNA biotinylation</title>
<p>Biotinylation of Cel-miR-67 and miR-106b was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Mature microRNA for <italic>C. elegans</italic> miR-67 (control) and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> miR-106b (both leading and passenger strand) were from Integrated DNA Tech, Coralville, IA. Leading strand of both Cel-miR-67 and miR-106b was biotinylated at the 3&#x2019; end using T4 RNA ligase (pierce RNA 3&#x2019; End Biotinylation kit, Thermo Scientific, #20160). Biotinylated RNA was quantified by dot blot on hybond N&#x002B;. An equal amount of biotinylated mature microRNA (leading strand) was mixed with its respective passenger strand RNA.</p>

<title>Pull down of biotinylated RNA</title>
<p>Mz-ChA-1 cells were transfected with 50 nM of biotinylated microRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX in triplicate. After 24 hours, cells were lysed (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3&#x0025; NP40, 50 U of RNase OUT and complete protease inhibitor) and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. 90&#x0025; of cell lysate was incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) for 6 hours at 4&#x00B0;C and 10&#x0025; of cell lysate was used for input RNA. Streptavidin-bead bound RNAs were washed five times with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. After pull down, RNA was isolated using <italic>mir</italic>Vana kit. Relative expression of IL8, KLF2 and a Tubulin1A was analyzed by qRT-PCR. 18S was used as a control RNA.</p>

<title>RNA-Seq to determine miR-106b targets</title>
<p>To determine miR-106b targets, we experimentally manipulated miR-106b levels in human Mz-ChA-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Total RNA from each condition, miR-106b and LNA-106b, was sequenced. Messages with decreased counts in miR-106b-transfected samples compared to LNA-106b-transfected samples were defined as repressed by miR-106b, while mRNAs that had increased counts were defined to be increased by miR-106b. More genes were repressed by miR-106b than increased, with 112 mRNAs repressed and 17 increased (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Based on the RefSeq sequences, we searched the two data sets&#x2014;genes with decreased expression and those with increased expression&#x2014;for the miR-106b seed-binding site. Specifically, we sought perfect 8-mer binding sites and either 7-mer with a match at position 8 (m8) or 7-mer with an A opposite position 1 (A1). The seed sequence of miR-106b is 5&#x2019;UAAAGUGC and the corresponding 8-mer binding site is 5&#x2019;GCACUUUA. Of the 112 mRNAs with decreased expression, 81 had either an 8-mer or a 7-mer binding site (72.3&#x0025;), and 31 had at least one perfect 8-mer binding site (27.7&#x0025;; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Conversely, of the 17 mRNAs with increased expression in cells transfected with miR-106b, only one mRNA contained a 7-mer binding sequence (5.9&#x0025;) and none had a perfect 8-mer site (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). The enrichment of seed-binding sites suggested that our technique was effective in detecting miR-106b targets.</p>

<p>(A) miR-106b RNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR after transfection of Mz-ChA-1 cells with control LNA (Control), antagonist to miR-106b (LNA-106b), or miR-106b. Expression was normalized to Z30 and plotted as relative level. The dashed horizontal line indicates the mean of miR-106b in Control cells.

(B) Following RNA-Seq of the LNA-106b and miR-106b samples from panel A, significantly altered transcripts were categorized as increased (13.2&#x0025;) or decreased (86.8&#x0025;) by miR-106b. (C) A majority of decreased transcripts contained one or more miR-106b seed-binding sites (7-mer or 8-mer) while only one increased transcript contained a 7-mer binding site. None of the increased transcripts contained an 8-mer binding site (#). (D) All transcripts identified by RNA-Seq were sorted by statistical significance of expression difference between miR-106b and LNA-106b. This sorted list (plotted on the horizontal axis) was then analyzed by SylArray to identify microRNA binding sites that are over-represented, shown by colored traces. Over-representation of seed-binding sites is indicated on the vertical axis above zero, plotted on a log scale. Under-represented sequences are plotted below zero.</p></caption>

<p>The entire gene set was analyzed by SylArray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] to detect enrichment of microRNA binding sites. We confirmed the enrichment of the miR-106b 7-mer m8 seed-binding site, 5&#x2019;GCACTTT (red line) in the sequences that were significantly altered by miR-106b (to the left on the plot; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref></bold>).

<title>Sequence determinants of miR-106b targeting</title>
<p>Using previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], we determined that 76.2&#x0025; of miR-106b target interactions employed 7 or more consecutive miR-106b bases in the microRNA-mRNA binding hybrid. Because a high proportion of interactions contained at least 7 consecutive bases, we determined which of the miR-106b 7-or 8-mer binding sites were favored in our target gene set. We searched the 112 significant mRNA sequences for all 65,536 possible 8-mer sequences and plotted the frequency of occurrence of each 8-mer (count) versus the number of 8-mers in each bin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Approximately 50&#x0025; of all possible 8-mers were observed with a frequency of between 1 and 10 occurrences, while 5,020 8-mers were not observed at all (count = 0). Notably, the perfect 8-mer binding site 5&#x2019;GCACTTTA was present 63 times and the overlapping 8-mer (2-9) was present 81 times. The two most over-represented 8-mers were 5&#x2019;AAAAAAAA (1,987 times) and 5&#x2019;TTTTTTTT (830 times). The analogous k-mer data set was developed for all possible 7-mer sequences (16,384 possible 7-mers) within the significant gene set (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Again the most common sequences were 5&#x2019;AAAAAAA and 5&#x2019;TTTTTTT. Forty-nine 7-mers were absent in the data set. The sequence complementary to bases 1-7 of miR-106b was observed 121 times, the 2-8 sequence was observed 170 times, and the 3-9 sequence was observed 147 times.</p>

<p>(A) Histogram of the distibution of 8-mers found in miR-106b-regulated sequences. The horizontal axis depicts the frequency each 8-mer was observed and the vertical axis represents the number of 8-mers at each count. The bins containing the miR-106b 1-8 and 2-9 perfect binding sequences are indicated. (B) Data are as in panel A except that 7-mers were analyzed. Bins containing the miR-106b 1-7, 2-8, and 3-9 perfect binding sequences are indicated. (C) The count of each possible 8-mer binding site in the miR-106b-regulated sequences is indicated. Sequences are ordered as they occur along miR-106b. The horizontal dashed line represents the count corresponding to the 90th percentile of all 8-mers (i. e., only the top 10 percent occur more frequently). (D) The same plot as in panel C except using 8-mers derived from let-7a. (E) Counts in the miR-106b-regulated sequences of each possible 7-mer along miR-106b are indicated. The horizontal dashed line represents the count corresponding to the 90th percentile of all 7-mers. (F) The same plot as in panel E except using 7-mers derived from let-7a. (G) Single-base substitutions within the 8-base miR-106b binding site were queried for their frequency, compared to the perfect 8-mer (observed 63 times) and plotted as the nucleotide frequency (count) at each position when the other 7 positions were a perfect miR-106b match. For example, the single substitution of a &#x2018;U&#x2019; opposite position 5 (forming a G:U wobble) was observed 40 times while the favored &#x2018;C&#x2019; (forming a G:C pair) was found 63 times. (H) k-mer analysis of the count of miR-106b binding sites in the miR-106b-regulated gene set compared to 1,000 randomly chosen similarly-sized gene sets. (I) The binding motif for miR-106b is shown over the sequence of the microRNA (antiparallel). Taller letters indicate greater representation of that nucleotide in determining the motif. The upper motif was generated using RNA-Seq data from the current study. The analysis was performed separately on data from Helwak et al., 2010, shown in the lower motif.</p></caption>

The 8-mer opposite bases 2-9 was somewhat more frequent that the 1-8 complement (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). A similar plot of the frequency of all complementary 7-mers tiled from 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; showed that over-represented sequences again favored the 5&#x2019; end of miR-106b, especially the classical seed (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). We used an unrelated, control microRNA let-7a; the same plot of tiled 8-and 7-mer sequences showed that none of these sequences were found in the top 10 percentile (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C&#x0026;D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To determine the tolerance for single base differences within the seed sequence, we started from a perfect 1-8 sequence and systematically searched for one-off variants. For example, the 1-8 binding site 5&#x2019;GCACTTTA was observed 63 times while the sequence 5&#x2019;<underline>A</underline>CACTTTA occurred 26 times. The sequence 5&#x2019;GCA<underline>T</underline>TTTA contains a single base difference opposite position 5 of miR-106b and was observed 40 times (96th percentile). Compare this result to the sequence 5&#x2019;GCA<underline>G</underline>TTTA which was observed only 13 times (66th percentile). We plotted the counts for each of these one-off sequences as a function of the position in the miR-106b binding site (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). The most tolerance was observed opposite position 1 of miR-106b. The next most tolerated substitution was a T at position 5, which would result in a G:U wobble base instead of a G:C pair.</p>
<p>The raw count for each sequence may not indicate over-representation but rather may indicate frequently encountered 8-mers (e.g., 5&#x2019;AAAAAAAA within the poly-A tail). Thus, we sought to determine the statistical significance of a number of sequences commonly observed in our set of 129 significant genes. This set contained 191 sequences due to some genes having multiple forms. To correct for natural frequency variation, we generated 1,000 additional sets of mRNAs each containing 191 random transcript sequences and compared the frequency of the miR-106b binding sequence and related sequences. The 8-mer sequence 5&#x2019;GCACTTTA was over-represented in our gene set and this finding was highly statistically significant (p = 0). Similarly, each of the 7-mer sequences was statistically different in our set (p = 0). The two C&#x2019;s within the miR-106b binding sequence were reassigned as T&#x2019;s to search for seed-binding sites including a G:U wobble, C5 and C7. The wobble at the 5th position, 5&#x2019;GCA<underline>T</underline>TTTA, was highly significant, as was the double wobble, 5&#x2019;G<underline>T</underline>A<underline>T</underline>TTTA. Tolerance for a G:U wobble at position 7 only, 5&#x2019;G<underline>T</underline>ACTTTA, was not as highly significant (p = 0.022, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>RNA hybrid analysis</title>
<p>Although the perfect complement is likely preferred, our data indicated that related sequences were also commonly overrepresented. We sought to identify the characteristics of the most thermodynamically stable miR-106b binding site in our significantly-repressed genes. We used RNAhybrid to determine the microRNA:mRNA pairing with the lowest free energy for each repressed target. Next, the predicted miR-106b binding sites were analyzed using MEME Suite to identify the most common motif. The resulting sequence motif includes 6 nucleotides that align with the predicted miR-106b binding site from bases 5-10 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; upper</bold>). This sequence does not include the triplet U at positions 2-4, possibly because A:T pairs have less favorable free energy than G:C pairs and the query set was limited by the lowest free energy binding site from RNAhybrid.</p>

<title>Comparison to CLASH data</title>
<p>Supplemental data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] included 143 target mRNAs bound by miR-106b, including the sequence at the region of interaction. To validate the miR-106b binding characteristics we have described, we searched for sequence motifs in the CLASH data set using MEME Suite. Within the 143 sequences, 138 contained a sequence highly related to 5&#x2019;CTGTCAGCACTTTC. This is the complement of the 5&#x2019; end of miR-106b from bases 2-14 (with &#x2018;C&#x2019; opposite the first position of miR-106b slightly favored over the expected &#x2018;A&#x2019;). The most conserved region of this meme is 5&#x2019;CAGCA, complementary to miR-106b bases 6-10 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; lower</bold>). Comparing the two motifs, the sequence from bases 6-10 is most important with some contribution from flanking bases and tolerance for substitution opposite position 5 (allowing a G:U wobble). The two data sets are mostly in agreement and indicate that binding of miR-106b is anchored by G:C pairing in and near the seed.</p>

<p>We sought to verify that miR-106b levels altered expression of target genes identified by RNA-Seq. We transfected Mz-ChA-1 cells with negative control LNA, miR-106b, or LNA-106b and isolated total RNA. Transcript levels of selected targets were determined by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to 18S rRNA. Targets confirmed by RT-PCR include EREG, RRM2, ITGA2, RB1, GLO1, M6PR, and PSD3. We also evaluated non-target negative controls ITGA3 and HRAS and found no change by LNA-106b compared to negative control LNA. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). NCEH1 was a target identified by RNA-Seq which had a trend towards increased mRNA expression upon miR-106b antagonism, but was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). We did not observe a change in mRNA level in RNA-Seq target FOS by RT-PCR. Not all miR-106b targets will be identified by the current method, specifically those that do not have a decrease in mRNA levels. We have not exhaustively tried to determine the identity of such targets, but did recognize the TRAIL death receptor DR5 as a predicted miR-106b target by TargetScan. Because miR-106b is clustered with miR-25 and miR-25 regulates cell death by targeting (DR4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], we tested whether miR-106b decreased the functionally-related DR5 protein. Transfection with miR-106b decreased DR5 protein levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref></bold>), potentially acting to complement miR-25-mediated DR4 repression and promote TRAIL resistance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data presented in this manuscript relate to mRNAs regulated by miR-106b in cholangiocarcinoma cells. A number of cancer types over express miR106b, making a target gene set of potential value to tumors beyond cholangiocarcinoma. The principle findings reported here show: (i) miR-106b repressed 112 mRNA targets; (ii) most target genes contained a 7&#x2010; or 8-mer seed-binding site; (iii) multiple KLF family proteins are targeted by miR-106b; and (iv) miR-106b promoted tumor cell survival in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Each of these findings will be discussed below.</p>
<p>Our study has revealed 112 mRNAs that were negatively regulated by miR-106b. Some known miR-106b-regulated genes (e.g., RB1, IL-8, F3, YES1, FAM91A1, and ERO1L) were identified and several novel targets were uncovered as well. Our experiments did not further investigate a functional role for these known targets. Not all previously-identified miR-106b-regulated genes were significantly altered in our study. Specifically, we did not observe any change in the mRNA levels of PTEN, E2F1, or BCL2L11 (Bim). A lack of change in expression of these mRNAs may reflect cell-line specific differences in microRNA targeting, changes in mRNA levels below the threshold of detection, or post-transcriptional effects that do not change mRNA levels. Previously unknown genes that were regulated at the mRNA level include KLF family members, which are discussed below.</p>
<p>MicroRNA binding depends on sequence complementarity. The degree of complementarity and length of consecutive bases can vary, resulting in refinement of rules of binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] and definition of new types or classes of microRNA:mRNA interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Classes I-III of interactions involve complementarity within the seed region. Class IV interactions show complementarity in a more central region, described as centered pairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Finally, Class V interactions exhibited distributed pairing, where discrete continuous regions of complementarity were not observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. These data are consistent with a role for microRNAs in regulating expression of mRNAs based on sequence complementarity but not strictly limited to seed pairing. Perhaps not surprisingly, the GC content of microRNA binding motifs, representing the average or commonly identified binding site over many mRNAs, was higher than the GC content of microRNA seed regions in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Thus, binding energy may be more important than binding position, a concept incorporated into the microRNA target prediction algorithm RNAhybrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Over 70&#x0025; of mRNAs that were decreased contained either a 7-mer or 8-mer miR-106b binding site. Analysis of all 8-mers or 7-mers in miR-106b-regulated sequences demonstrated that the sequences at or near the seed, including up to nucleotide 10, were over-represented. This over-representation of the 7-mer and 8-mer sequences was highly statistically significant when compared to the expected distribution of the same sequences in a thousand random gene sets of the same size. The seed sequence tolerated a &#x2018;U&#x2019; in the place of &#x2018;C&#x2019; (resulting in G:U wobble pairing) opposite positions 5, 7, or both. Two hydrogen bonds connect the G:U pair while three hydrogen bonds stabilize the G:C pair, suggesting there may be a thermodynamic cost to miR-106b binding sites with G:U wobbles. Alternatively, the exocyclic amino group of &#x2018;G&#x2019; is available for additional interactions when &#x2018;G&#x2019; is paired with &#x2018;U&#x2019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] allowing for the possibility of compensatory stabilizing hydrogen bonds to functional groups within the RISC polypeptides.</p>
<p>Based on both the CLASH dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] and our own, we found that the sequence 5&#x2019;U<underline>CAGCAC</underline>U represents an &#x2018;average&#x2019; sequence motif serving as a binding site for miR-106b, with the best evidence for the central 6-mer (underlined, complementary to miR-106b based 5-10). While this is the average binding sequence, the most prevalent 7-mer was 5&#x2019;GCACUUU and the most common 8-mer was 5&#x2019;AGCACUUU. The difference between the average and the most prevalent sequences is that the average (in our data set) was determined using the single-most-stable predicted binding site, as identified by RNAhybrid. Such a filter will bias against the triplet UUU. Still, the agreement between our average binding motif and the motif generated from CLASH data where this potential bias is not relevant suggest that this filter is not unreasonable. Overall, we find good evidence that binding favors complementarity near the 5&#x2019; end of the microRNA, consistent with the seed model, as well as evidence that the sequence tolerates a slight shift toward the center of miR-106b.</p>
<p>Comparison of our data set of modulated genes and that obtained by CLASH showed a striking near-absence of overlap in the mRNAs identified. Indeed, of the 143 mRNAs in the CLASH set and 112 genes down regulated in our experiment, only three mRNAs were on both lists: ERO1L, YES1, and FAM91A1. None of these contain an 8-mer binding site. YES1 and FAM91A1 each have a single copy of the 7-mer-m8 binding site and YES1 has an additional 7-mer-A1 binding site. The cell lines used in the two studies are very different, Flp-In T-REx 293 embryonic kidney-derived cells versus Mz-ChA-1 biliary tract cancer-derived cells. The techniques used are also different. Finally, data from the CLASH study reflect steady-state interactions of all detected microRNAs and their targets, while the current study assessed acute changes to mRNA targets after manipulation of only miR-106b. It is likely that different cell types will have a different microRNA target landscape, and that identification of these targets by several methods will allow a detailed understanding of mRNA regulation and binding by microRNAs.</p>
<p>An important finding in the current study was the coordinated regulation of multiple KLF family members. The seventeen members of the KLF family of transcription factors are involved in a diverse range of biological functions and aberrations can lead to disorders such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease, obesity, inflammatory diseases and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Many KLF family members have been implicated in some aspect of cancer cell biology including growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. We have revealed regulation of six KLF members by miR-106b in our study. Two members, KLF2 and KLF6, were significantly repressed genes in our RNA-Seq experiment. Additionally, KLF4, KLF10, and KLF11 were somewhat near the cutoff for significance (p = 0.024, 0.038, and 0.032 respectively), while KLF13 mRNA in the RNA-Seq data did not suggest regulation (p = 0.81). These six KLFs were demonstrated to be miR-106b-responsive genes by qRT-PCR. In particular, the result for KLF13 was surprising as this gene was included as a control under the expectation it would not be responsive to miR-106b. The coordinated modulation of these six family members may indicate a functional aspect of miR-106b biology that was not previously appreciated. Each of the KLFs regulated by miR-106b in our study has tumor suppressive function in one or several cancers. KLF2 has been shown to induce apoptosis and to be a tumor suppressor in prostate and breast cancer cell lines as well as in xenografted mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In pancreatic cancer cells, KLF2 expression is decreased and its enforced expression leads to inhibition of growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. KLF4 regulates proliferation and differentiation of lung cancer cells and its deletion in a mouse is enough to generate tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. KLF6 reduced tumorigenic features in osteosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] and its expression is reduced in human and mouse prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Loss of KLF6 expression results in increased liver mass, decreased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, and correlated with low p21 in liver cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Mice deficient in KLF10 exhibit increased skin tumorigenesis when exposed to carcinogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Knockdown of KLF11 in leiomyoma cells leads to increased proliferation and its expression is lower in tumor tissue compared to normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. KLF13 is shown to repress anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. These varied and overlapping anti-tumorigenic features of KLFs in cancer make them attractive potential targets for future study in cholangiocarcinoma.</p>
<p>Resistance to apoptosis is a characteristic of cholangiocarcinoma cells. Many KLFs are implicated in regulation of apoptosis in tumor cells but their role in cholangiocarcinoma cell death is unknown. We have shown regulation of six KLFs by miR-106b. Overexpression of KLF2 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines led to increased cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. KLF6 has dual roles in apoptosis as its wildtype form is pro-apoptotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] while the splice variant SV1 which is overexpressed in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] is anti-apoptotic. KLF10 promotes cell death in human leukemia cells through upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Bax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In our study, antagonism of miR-106b with LNA led to increased apoptosis sensitivity in cholangiocarcinoma cells. In part, this effect could be through derepression of pro-apoptotic KLFs. Targeting of miR-106b to increase cholangiocarcinoma cell sensitivity to apoptosis is a potential future strategy.</p>
<p>In summation, we report a landscape of miR-106b responsive genes in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Several tumor suppressive members of the KLF family of transcription factors were revealed to be modulated by miR-106b. And finally, miR-106b is protective against apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells.</p>
