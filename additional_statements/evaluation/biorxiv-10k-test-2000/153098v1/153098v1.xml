<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The spatial organization of RNA within cells is a crucial factor in a wide range of biological functions, spanning all kingdoms of life. However, a general understanding of RNA localization has been hindered by a lack of simple, high-throughput methods for mapping the transcriptomes of subcellular compartments. Here, we develop such a method, termed APEX-RIP, which combines peroxidase-catalyzed, spatially restricted in situ protein biotinylation with RNA-protein chemical crosslinking. We demonstrate that, using a single protocol, APEX-RIP can isolate RNAs from a variety of subcellular compartments, including the mitochondrial matrix, nucleus, bulk cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with higher specificity and coverage than do conventional approaches. We furthermore identify candidate RNAs localized to mitochondria-ER junctions and nuclear lamina, two compartments that are recalcitrant to classical biochemical purification. Since APEX-RIP is simple, versatile, and does not require special instrumentation, we envision its broad application in a variety of biological contexts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spatial compartmentalization of RNA is central to many biological processes across all kingdoms of life, and enables diverse regulatory schemes that exploit both coding and noncoding functions of the transcriptome. For example, the localization and spatially restricted translation of mRNA plays a fundamental role in asymmetric cell division in bacteria and yeast, body-pattern formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, signaling at mammalian neuronal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jung et al. 2014</xref>), and a wide variety of other biological contexts. In another example, the localization of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) can play an architectural role in the assembly of subcellular structures, including short-range chromatin loops, higher-order chromatin domains, and large sub-nuclear structures like nucleoli and Barr bodies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rinn and Guttman 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engreitz, Ollikainen, and Guttman 2016</xref>). However, despite these examples, our general understanding of the breadth and biological significance of RNA subcellular localization remains inchoate.</p>
<p>Techniques that elucidate the subcellular localization of RNAs are therefore critical for advancing our understanding of RNA biology. Classically, such techniques rely either on imaging or biochemical approaches. Imaging methods&#x2013;such as Fluorescence <italic>In Situ</italic> Hybridization (FISH) and artificial RNA reporter schemes&#x2013;are powerful tools for elucidating the positions of a small number of target RNAs at low-to-moderate throughput(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wilk et al. 2016</xref>; K. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Paige, Wu, and Jaffrey 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hocine et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nelles et al. 2016</xref>). Alternatively, unbiased approaches for RNA discovery couple biochemical manipulations to deep sequencing. For example, the RNA partners of proteins with characteristic subcellular localization can be identified through a variety of techniques that couple protein immunoprecipitation to RNA-seq(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ule et al. 2003</xref>; Christopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gilbert et al. 2004</xref>). Such methods have revealed many localized mRNAs, in addition to novel non-coding RNAs involved in RNA splicing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chi et al. 2009</xref>) and RNAi(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Motamedi et al. 2004</xref>). On a broader scale, a deep sampling of RNAs residing within a cellular compartment&#x2014;for example, an intact organelle of interest, or partitions along a sucrose gradient, can be identified by coupling subcellular fractionation to RNA-Seq (&#x201C;Fractionation-Seq&#x201D;)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sterne-Weiler et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mercer et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>However, a technological gap exists among these current methods for studying RNA localization. Imaging approaches are of limited throughput, and may require specialized reagents, constructs, or microscopes that are only accessible to a handful of laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wilk et al. 2016</xref>; K. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Paige, Wu, and Jaffrey 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hocine et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nelles et al. 2016</xref>). The efficacy of immunoprecipitation-based approaches is highly sensitive to the antibodies and enrichment protocols used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hendrickson et al. 2016</xref>) and captures only RNAs that are directly complexed with each target protein. Fractionation-Seq is applicable only to organelles and subcellular fractions that can be purified, and is frequently complicated by contaminants (false positives) and loss of material (false negatives) Therefore, a new technology is needed for unbiased and large-scale discovery and characterization of RNA <italic>neighborhoods,</italic> with high spatial specificity, and within cellular structures that cannot be enriched by biochemical fractionation.</p>
<p>Here we introduce such a technology&#x2013;termed APEX-RIP&#x2013; that enables unbiased discovery of endogenous RNAs in specific cellular locales. APEX-RIP merges two existing technologies: APEX (engineered ascorbate peroxidase)- catalyzed proximity biotinylation of endogenous proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rhee et al. 2013</xref>), and RNA ImmunoPrecipitation (RIP)(Christopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gilbert et al. 2004</xref>). We demonstrate that APEX-RIP is able to enrich endogenous RNAs in membrane-enclosed cellular organelles, such as the mitochondrion and nucleus, and in membrane-abutting cellular regions such as the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum. The specificity and coverage of this approach are much higher than those obtained by traditional Fractionation-Seq. Moreover, by applying APEX-RIP to multiple mammalian organelles, we have generated high quality datasets of compartmentalized RNAs that should serve as valuable resources for testing and generating novel hypotheses pertinent to RNA biology.</p>

<title>Development of APEX-RIP method and application to mitochondria</title>
<p>APEX is an engineered peroxidase that can be targeted by genetic fusion to various subcellular regions of interest(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rhee et al. 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon addition of its substrates, biotin-phenol (BP) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), to live cells, APEX catalyzes the formation of biotin-phenoxyl radicals that then diffuse outward and covalently biotinylate nearby endogenous proteins. More distal proteins are not significantly labeled because the biotin-phenoxyl radical has a half-life of less than 1 millisecond(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wishart and Madhava Rao 2010</xref>). Previous work has shown that APEX-catalyzed proximity biotinylation, coupled to streptavidin enrichment and mass spectrometry, can generate proteomic maps of the mitochondrial matrix, intermembrane space, outer membrane, and nucleoid, each with &#x003C;5 nm spatial specificity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rhee et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hung et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hung et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al. 2017</xref>).</p>

Cells expressing APEX2 (grey &#x2018;pacmen&#x2019;) targeted to the compartment of interest (here, the mitochondrial matrix.) are incubated with the APEX substrate biotin-phenol (BP; red B: biotin). A one-minute pulse of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> initiates biotinylation of proximal endogenous proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rhee et al. 2013</xref>), which are then covalently crosslinked to nearby RNAs by 0.1&#x0025; formaldehyde. Following cell lysis, biotinylated species are enriched by streptavidin pulldown, and coeluting RNAs are analyzed by RT-qPCR or RNA-Seq. IMM: inner mitochondrial membrane.

<p>Because most cellular RNAs exist in close proximity to proteins, we reasoned that APEX-tagged subcellular proteomes could also provide access to the nearby RNA content, if proteins and RNA could be crosslinked together <italic>in situ</italic>, immediately before or after APEX labeling. As our first target organelle, we selected the mitochondrion because its RNA content--derived from both the mitochondrial genome and from imported, nuclear-encoded RNAs--has been extensively characterized by a wide array of complementary methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mercer et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al&#x00E1;n et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Piechota et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ro et al. 2013</xref>), hence providing a &#x201C;gold-standard&#x201D; to which we can compare our results. The mitochondrial matrix was also the first mammalian compartment mapped by APEX proteomics methodology(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rhee et al. 2013</xref>). As a RNA-protein chemical crosslinker, we opted for mild formaldehyde treatment, which covalently captures most protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, and can be achieved with minimal disruption of native interactions in live cells. It is for these reasons that formaldehyde is used for several RIP(Chris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert and Svejstrup 2006</xref>) technologies for identifying the RNA partners of specific proteins of interest, including our own &#x201C;fRIP-Seq&#x201D; protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hendrickson et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Since it was unclear <italic>a priori</italic> whether APEX-catalyzed biotinylation should precede or follow the formaldehyde crosslinking step, we explored both schemes in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A</xref>; <italic>see methods</italic>). Each protocol, applied to HEK 293T cells expressing mitochondrially-localized APEX2 (&#x201C;mito-APEX2&#x201D;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B-C</xref>), resulted in clear enrichment of fifteen mitochondrial-encoded RNAs&#x2014;relative to the cytosolic marker <italic>GAPDH</italic>&#x2014;as gauged by RT&#x2013;qPCR (average of 49.3&#x00B1;3.5 and 60.9&#x00B1;4.1-fold enrichment, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A</xref>). Assuming that fixing cells prior to biotinylation would better capture transient or weak RNA&#x2013;protein interactions, we selected the crosslinking-then-BP protocol for RNA-Seq analysis. While this confirmed that mitochondrial mRNAs were enriched, a sizeable &#x201C;shoulder&#x201D; of conspicuous off-target RNAs were also unexpectedly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1B</xref>). Thus, we re-examined our labeling and crosslinking protocols, using a sampling of these off-target RNA markers (e.g., the abundant nuclear RNA <italic>XIST</italic>, and cytosol-localized RNAs <italic>HOOK2</italic> and <italic>MAN2C1</italic>). This more comprehensive analysis revealed that APEX labeling followed by crosslinking provides superior specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1C</xref>). We hypothesize that the mild formaldehyde treatment compromises membrane integrity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fox et al. 1985</xref>), allowing BP radicals to escape to adjoining compartments when APEX labeling is performed after formaldehyde treatment.</p>
<p>We used the optimized APEX followed by crosslinking protocol to map mitochondrial RNAs in mito-APEX2-expressing HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, Table 1, tab 2). Gene-level analysis, comparing RNA counts before and after streptavidin enrichment, revealed that all 13 mRNAs encoded by the mitochondrial genome were highly enriched (greater than 3.5 fold) in three independent replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and S1E, Table 1 tab 1). Enrichment was absent in negative controls with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1F</xref>). Read density plots mapped to the mitochondrial genome demonstrated that most of our captured RNAs correspond to fully-processed transcripts, including mRNAs, interstitial tRNAs, and the D-loop leader sequence from which mitochondrial transcription initiates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Intriguingly, mitomRNA read densities appeared to correlate with previous measures of mRNA halflife(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nagao, Hino-Shigi, and Suzuki 2008</xref>). For example, mRNAs encoding MTCO1-3 have longer half-lives, and more reads from APEX-RIP, than mRNAs encoding MTND1-2.</p>

<title>APEX-RIP mapping of the nuclear-cytoplasmic RNA distribution</title>
<p>Having established that APEX-RIP is both specific and sensitive in the mitochondrion, we next turned our attention to a more challenging compartment: the mammalian nucleus. The nucleus is more complex and has a less defined transcriptome than the mitochondrial matrix, but previous Fractionation-Seq datasets, including by ENCODE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dunham et al. 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figures S2A&#x2013;D</xref>), again provide a reference list to which we can compare our results.</p>
<p>We generated HEK 293T cells that stably express APEX2 in the nucleus (APEX-NLS) or in the cytosol (APEX-NES; NES is a nuclear export signal). The specificity of <italic>in situ</italic> biotinylation by these constructs within each compartment was confirmed by imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Whole cell lysates prepared from each cell line also produced distinct &#x201C;fingerprints&#x201D; of biotinylated proteins, as assayed by streptavidin blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1D</xref>).</p>

<p>We performed APEX-RIP on both APEX-NLS and APEX-NES cells, using the biotinylation-first/crosslinking-second protocol established above, with an additional one-minute radical-quenching step in between the APEX and crosslinking steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>; see <italic>methods</italic>). Encouragingly, &#x201C;gold standard&#x201D; nuclear and cytosolic RNAs (defined from the ENCODE data as the top 1000 RNAs in each compartment; see Table 2 tab 4) were enriched from the corresponding cell lines as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> <italic>histograms</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figures S2E&#x2013;F</xref>). Moreover, when directly comparing the fold-enrichments from each compartment to one another, it was apparent that APEX-NLS had effectively enriched known nuclear-localized RNAs, while APEX-NES had enriched known cytosol-localized RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> scatter plot, Table 2 tab 3). We calculated for each RNA a &#x201C;nuclear preference score,&#x201D; defined as the minimum geometric distance of each point to the line y=x (corresponding to the set of genes which are not preferentially enriched from either compartment).</p>
<p>Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis of these nuclear preference scores was used to filter the data and obtain final transcript lists of 5,467 nuclear RNAs and 10,130 cytosolic RNAs from living HEK 293T cells (Table 2 tabs 1 and 2). The false discovery rates of these two lists are &#x003C;0.6&#x0025; and &#x003C;0.4&#x0025;, respectively.</p>
<p>When plotted by nuclear preference score, the human transcriptome displayed an overall bimodal distribution, wherein the majority of species were cytoplasmic, appended by a smaller right-shifted populace of predominantly nuclear RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). As might be predicted(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Derrien et al. 2012</xref>), many of this latter group were lncRNAs, which clearly showed preferential nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>). Most mRNAs appeared to be cytosolic in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Notably, we also observed sizeable populaces of RNAs exhibiting noncanonical nuclear&#x2013;cytoplasmic partitioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). 3323 mRNAs&#x2013;including <italic>C1orf63</italic>, for example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>)&#x2013;appeared preferentially nuclear. Many of these species have been proposed to play a role in dampening gene expression noise(Bahar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Halpern et al. 2015</xref>). Conversely, 234 lncRNAs appeared preferentially cytoplasmic; these include the known cytoplasmic lncRNA <italic>SNHG5</italic>, a modulator of staufen-mediated decay that influences colorectal tumor growth(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Derrien et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Damas et al. 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Our APEX-RIP nuclear and cytosolic RNA lists provide an opportunity for a head-to-head comparison with the traditional Fractionation-Seq method for mapping subcellular RNA localization. ROC analysis of the ENCODE Fractionation-Seq data yielded a list of 3,056 RNAs enriched by nuclear fractionation (Table 2 tab 5). Of these RNAs, 81&#x0025; (2469) were also enriched in our APEX-RIP nuclear dataset, implying general agreement between the two technologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, APEX-RIP also enriched nearly 3000 additional transcripts. These may be nuclear-localized RNAs that were opaque to the ENCODE protocol, or contaminants enriched by APEX-RIP. To address this possibility, we examined each dataset for conspicuous non-nuclear contaminants: RNAs that are known to be localized at the Endoplasmic Reticulum(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jan, Williams, and Weissman 2014</xref>). Satisfyingly, the APEX-RIP nuclear dataset, though larger, contained fewer ER contaminants than did the analogous fractionation-based dataset, implying that APEX-RIP produces higher specificity than Fractionation-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <italic>left</italic>).</p>
<p>To compare the coverage/sensitivity of each method (sometimes termed recall), we examined the enrichment in each dataset of lncRNAs, which are thought to be predominantly nuclear(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Derrien et al. 2012</xref>). We assembled a list of 827 annotated lncRNAs (GENCODE hg19) with average FPKM pre-enrichment greater than 1.0 (Table 2 tab 7). Of these lncRNAs, 71.7 &#x0025; are enriched in our APEX-RIP-derived nuclear dataset, while nuclear Fractionation-Seq from the same cell line enriched only 43.4 &#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). We conclude that APEX-RIP can be superior to Fractionation-Seq in terms of <italic>both</italic> specificity and coverage, for analysis of endogenous RNA subcellular localization.</p>

<title>Enrichment of RNAs proximal to the ER membrane</title>
<p>The above efforts establish that APEX-RIP can enrich RNAs in membrane-enclosed cellular compartments. We next sought to address whether the technique could successfully capture the transcriptomes of &#x201C;open&#x201D; subcellular regions. Previous proteomic work has shown that APEX tagging exhibits sufficient spatial specificity for such open compartments, since this technology has produced highly specific proteomic maps of, for example, the mammalian neuronal synaptic cleft(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Loh et al. 2016</xref>), outer mitochondrial membrane(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hung et al. 2017</xref>), mitochondrial nucleoid(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al. 2017</xref>), and G-protein coupled receptor interaction network(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lobingier et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Paek et al. 2017</xref>). We were unsure, however, if the additional formaldehyde crosslinking step would preserve or blur the estimated &#x003C;10 nanometer spatial resolution of APEX labeling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rhee et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>As a test case for the generality of APEX-RIP at such open compartments, we selected the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The ER is an appealing target for several reasons. First, it is host to a known set of characteristic RNAs that we can use as positive controls&#x2014;the so-called &#x201C;secretome&#x201D;&#x2014;which comprises mRNAs encoding secreted, glycosylated, and/or transmembrane proteins, that are translated by ribosomes on the rough ER. Second, the ER provides the opportunity to compare the efficacy of APEX-RIP to alternative approaches, since RNAs in this subcellular locale have been previously characterized both by Fractionation-Seq, and by a newer methodology termed proximity-dependent ribosome profiling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jan, Williams, and Weissman 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Williams, Jan, and Weissman 2014</xref>). This latter technique maps active protein translation at the ER membrane by combining ribosome profiling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ingolia et al. 2009</xref>) with proximity-restricted sequence-specific biotinylation, using an ER-targeted biotin ligase and ribosomes that are tagged with the peptide substrate (AviTag) of that ligase.</p>
<p>Since it was initially unclear which face of the ER membrane (cytosolic or luminal) would be most amenable to the APEX-RIP method, we generated fusion constructs that localized the peroxidase catalytic center to each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A&#x2013;B</xref>). ERM-APEX2 targets APEX2 to the ER cytosolic surface via a 27-amino acid fragment derived from the native ER membrane (ERM) protein cytochrome P450 C1. HRP-KDEL targets horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to the ER lumen via an N-terminal ER-targeting signal and a C-terminal KDEL ER-retention motif(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martell et al. 2012</xref>). We have shown that HRP catalyzes the same proximity-dependent biotinylation chemistry as APEX2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Loh et al. 2016</xref>), but has higher specific activity than APEX2 in the ER lumen(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lam et al. 2014</xref>). We generated HEK 293T cells stably expressing ERM-APEX2 and HRP-KDEL, and confirmed by microscopy and streptavidin blotting that each produced the expected labeling patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C and D</xref>). Next, we compared the efficacy of each construct for target RNA isolation, using the biotinylation-first/crosslinking-second APEX-RIP protocol, and analyzing our results via RT-qPCR analysis of established secretome and non-secretome mRNAs<sup>24</sup>. Parallel experiments with APEX2-NES cells served as negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>Intriguingly, while APEX-RIP from HRP-KDEL cells efficiently enriched target secretome mRNAs relative to non-target controls (average fold enrichment = 19.5, paired t-test p-value = 0.00009), parallel experiments in ERM-APEX2 cells exhibited only modest, qualitative enrichment of target species (average fold enrichment = 1.49, paired t-test p-value = 0.0515). Indeed, results from ERM-APEX2 cells were nearly indistinguishable from those acquired from APEX2-NES control cells (paired t-test p-value =0.830, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). This is surprising, since proteomic experiments in HEK 293T cells expressing the identical ERM-APEX2 construct yielded highly specific enrichment of ER-localized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hung et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data strongly imply that APEX-RIP does <italic>not</italic> have the same spatial specificity as peroxidase-catalyzed proteomic labeling, and may be limited by perturbations induced by formaldehyde crosslinking. However, we were highly encouraged by the data obtained with the HRP-KDEL construct. We hypothesize that APEX-RIP with this construct is effective because formaldehyde crosslinking physically couples RNAs on the cytosolic face of the ER to protein complexes that are biotinylated within the ER lumen, thereby allowing target RNAs to be enriched by streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that the target specificity of this approach could be greatly improved by addition of a one-minute radical-quenching step in between the biotinylation and crosslinking steps in our protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>). We surmise that this additional step prevents residual peroxidase-generated radicals from leaking into adjoining compartments when the integrity of the ER membrane is compromised during formaldehyde treatment.</p>
<p>Using this improved protocol, we performed APEX-RIP on HRP-KDEL cells (Table 3 tab 2). Gene-level analysis, comparing RNA counts before and after streptavidin pulldown, revealed a distinct population of substantially enriched RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and S3B). Encouragingly, the majority (63.4&#x0025;) of secretome mRNAs (defined by ER proximal RNAs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jan, Williams, and Weissman 2014</xref>) and Phobius predicted mRNAs with exclusion of nuclear encoded mitochondrial mRNAs, see <italic>methods</italic>) resided in this set, while most (97.1&#x0025;) mRNAs in a test set of known non-secreted genes were not enriched, thus demonstrating the ability of APEX-RIP to isolate ER-associated transcripts from the larger population of cellular RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Using histogram and ROC analysis, we determined the optimal log2 FKPM significance threshold cutoff for each experimental replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3C</xref>; <italic>see methods</italic>), obtaining a final list of 2970 ERM-associated RNAs that were independently enriched in multiple experiments (Table 3 tab 1). This dataset exhibited 94&#x0025; specificity, based on previous secretory annotation as defined by GOCC, SignalP, TMHMM, or Phobius(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ashburner et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petersen et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Krogh et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">K&#x00E4;ll, Krogh, and Sonnhammer 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> shows that we also de-enriched mRNAs lacking such signals. Coverage was likewise exceptional (97&#x0025;), as gauged by the recall of 71 literature-curated well-established ER resident proteins&#x2019; mRNAs (Table 3 tab 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <italic>see methods</italic>).</p>
<p>We next compared the ERM APEX-RIP dataset to analogous results obtained by subcellular biochemical fractionation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Reid and Nicchitta 2012</xref>), and by proximity-dependent ribosome profiling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jan, Williams, and Weissman 2014</xref>) (Table 3, tabs 3 and 4, respectively). Encouragingly, APEX-RIP captures the majority of RNAs enriched by each of these alternative techniques (70&#x0025; and 93&#x0025;, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), implying broad agreement between the different methodologies. To examine this further, we quantified the specificity and coverage of each approach, as above (<italic>see methods</italic>). Specificity analysis demonstrated that APEX-RIP and ribosome profiling exhibited similarly high specificity (94&#x0025; and 98&#x0025;, respectively). However, Fractionation-Seq was substantially noisier, such that only 90&#x0025; of enriched mRNAs bore a secretory annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>); the remaining 10&#x0025; comprised sizeable populations of conspicuous contaminants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3E</xref>). The coverage of ER-localized mRNAs retrieved by APEX-RIP (97&#x0025;) was also considerably higher than those retrieved by both Fractionation-Seq and ribosome profiling (73&#x0025; and 77&#x0025;, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). We attribute the enhanced coverage of APEX-RIP to its higher sensitivity, since this method appears better suited for capturing RNAs with lower abundances than do the alternative approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3 F-G</xref>). Such higher sensitivity may also explain why the set of RNAs enriched by APEX-RIP is so much larger than those obtained by fractionation and ribosome-profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Excitingly, this further underscores the ability of APEX-RIP to recover RNAs that are opaque to other methods. While the vast majority (88.7&#x0025;) of our enriched RNAs are mRNAs, we also enrich hundreds of noncoding RNA species&#x2013;including antisense RNAs and lincRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These RNAs are not translated, and thus cannot be detected by ribosome profiling, and tend to be lowly expressed, making them difficult targets for either ribosome profiling or Fractionation-Seq.</p>
<p>In summary, APEX-RIP is superior to existing methods for mapping endogenous RNAs proximal to the ER membrane, and may be extensible to other membrane-abutting subcellular regions as well.</p>

<title>Hypotheses from ER and nuclear APEX-RIP datasets</title>
<p>We wondered if the highly specific and comprehensive RNA subcellular localization datasets produced by APEX-RIP could be mined for new biological hypotheses. We first observed that, of the 2635 mRNAs in our ERM dataset, 141 code for mitochondrial proteins. It is thought that that the bulk of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteome is translated within the bulk cytosol, or in proximity to mitochondria themselves(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lesnik, Golani-Armon, and Arava 2015</xref>), raising the possibility that the translation or subsequent processing of these 141 protein products require machinery localized to the ER. Additionally, these mRNAs may be translated at mitochondria-ER contact sites, some of which have been observed to contain ribosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Csord&#x00E1;s et al. 2006</xref>). To gain initial insight into these unusual RNAs, we analyzed these 141 genes to see whether, relative to total pool of mRNAs encoding mitochondrially-localized proteins, they were enriched in particular properties (Table 4 tab 1). Intriguingly, 57.1&#x0025; of these mRNAs code for transmembrane proteins (as predicted by TMHMM), compared to only 20.4&#x0025; for all mitochondrial protein mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Mitochondrial subcompartment analysis showed that the ER-proximal population is enriched for proteins destined for the inner mitochondrial membrane, and is depleted for resident matrix proteins, compared to the total mitochondrial proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, proximity-dependent ribosome profiling by Williams et al. in yeast using biotin ligase targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Williams, Jan, and Weissman 2014</xref>) also showed enrichment of mRNAs encoding proteins destined for the inner mitochondrial membrane. Perhaps a subset of inner mitochondrial membrane-destined proteins are locally translated at mitochondria-ER contact sites.</p>

<p>Next, we tested whether new insights could be gained by examining RNAs that APEX-RIP had enriched from more than one subcellular compartment. Because the ER lumen is contiguous with that of the nuclear envelope, we hypothesized that the HRP-KDEL APEX-RIP experiment, in addition to enriching RNAs proximal to the ER, might also enrich RNAs proximal to the nuclear membrane. This region within the nucleus, termed the nuclear lamina, is widely thought to play a critical role in gene repression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kind and van Steensel 2010</xref>), and in shaping the global three-dimensional architecture of chromatin(C.-K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al. 2016</xref>). However, no exclusively laminar-resident RNAs have yet been identified. We hypothesized that we might identify such long-sought lamina RNAs by intersecting our APEX-RIP nuclear and ERM RNA lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Encouragingly, we observed 673 such RNAs in the intersection list, 34 of which are long noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; Table 4 tab 2). This small list is a compelling starting point for exploration of regulatory RNAs that may reside in the nuclear lamina.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Methods for mapping RNA subcellular localization are constrained by the limits of their spatiotemporal precision, the diversity of RNA species that they can simultaneously analyze, their generality across cell types and compartments, and their ease of use. We believe that APEX-RIP is superior to existing imaging- and sequencing-based techniques with regard to many of these factors.</p>
<p>Compared to imaging-based technologies, APEX-RIP offers superior target throughput, ease of use, and temporal control. For example, although modern variants of FISH can achieve extremely high spatial precision&#x2013;even enabling the visualization of individual RNA molecules(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Batish, Raj, and Tyagi 2011</xref>)&#x2013;this technique requires the synthesis and testing of customized fluorescent probes for each transcript under enquiry, a cumbersome process that limits throughput(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cabili et al. 2015</xref>). A highly multiplexed FISH variant, merFISH, substantially boosts throughput&#x2014;enabling thousands of transcripts to be simultaneously visualized&#x2014; but requires complex protocols for probe set design and imaging(K. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al. 2015</xref>). An alternate approach, FISSEQ, achieves similar target depth without the need for gene-specific probes, but instead relies on customized instrumentation and a rococo process of <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing and imaging(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee et al. 2014</xref>). Notably, without incorporating additional stains or markers, these imaging-based approaches provide little information regarding the local environment (<italic>i.e.</italic>, proximal cellular compartments or features) near each RNA target. Furthermore, these techniques fundamentally lack temporal precision: each requires extensively fixing and permeabilizing cells prior to data collection, during which time diffusion or the loss of cellular integrity can perturb endogenous RNA localization. This latter issue can be circumvented through a variety of live-cell imaging technologies, but these require the implementation of customized reagents that limit throughput, and may even distort the localization of the RNA targets under enquiry(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Paige, Wu, and Jaffrey 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hocine et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nelles et al. 2016</xref>). By contrast, APEX-RIP is not encumbered by any of these constraints. It does not require the development of target-specific expression constructs or probes; nor does it rely on specialized instrumentation. The ensemble of RNA targets analyzed (and, for that matter, the array of RNA classes analyzed) is theoretically limited only by the library synthesis and sequencing protocols employed. Moreover, since APEX-RIP captures only RNAs proximal to a specific subcellular compartment, and does so during a one-minute reaction, the technique offers both greater information content and higher temporal resolution than do its imaging-based alternatives.</p>
<p>Compared to fractionation-based technologies, APEX-RIP offers superior accuracy, ease of use, and general versatility. As illustrated in the nucleus and ER, our technique outperforms conventional Fractionation-Seq with regard to both target specificity and recall, apparently circumventing the dual issues of target loss and off-target contamination that can plague such approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E-F</xref>). We ascribe this performance boost to two principal factors. First, the high spatiotemporal precision afforded by <italic>in situ</italic> biotinylation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rhee et al. 2013</xref>) allows us to efficiently isolate target material from contaminants that might be difficult to remove by classical fractionation, thereby improving specificity. Second, covalently coupling target RNAs to affinity-tagged proteins allows us to recover low-abundance or weakly affiliated transcripts that might otherwise be lost during biochemical enrichment, thereby improving target recall. Perhaps more importantly, however, we have achieved these results in a variety of subcellular compartments using a common protocol, thus obviating the need to develop customized purification schemes for each compartment. This generality should enable APEX-RIP to access &#x201C;unpurifiable&#x201D; subcellular compartments for which such purification schemes would be impossible. While a related technology, proximity-dependent ribosome profiling, exhibits similar versatility within diverse subcellular milieus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jan, Williams, and Weissman 2014</xref>), this approach is limited to mRNAs actively undergoing translation. It also requires biotin starvation prior to tagging, which is toxic to mammalian cells. As we have demonstrated, APEX-RIP can map diverse classes of noncoding RNA and quiescent mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), and toxic protocols starving cells of essential nutrients for hours are not required.</p>
<p>The APEX-RIP methodology does have notable limitations. Cells to be analyzed must be transfected with a recombinant construct, in contrast to FISH and Fractionation-Seq, which can be performed on native tissues. APEX-RIP also gives poor spatial specificity in membrane-free subcellular regions.</p>
<p>The APEX peroxidase used here has also previously been used to generate contrast for electron microscopy in fixed cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Martell et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lam et al. 2014</xref>), and for spatially-resolved proteomic mapping in living cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rhee et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hung et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Loh et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hung et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mick et al. 2015</xref>). This study extends APEX to a new class of applications and to a new biopolymer. In principle, it should be possible to utilize a single APEX-expressing cell line to characterize a target subcellular compartment by electron microscopic, proteomic, and transcriptomic means. Related methods for proteomic mapping, such as BioID(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Roux et al. 2012</xref>), lack this versatility, because the underlying chemistry is not as flexible as the one-electron oxidation reaction catalyzed by APEX.</p>
<p>We anticipate that the initial subcellular transcriptomic map presented in this work&#x2014;probing the mitochondrial matrix, cytosol, nucleus, and ER membrane of HEK293T cells&#x2014;will serve as valuable resources for cell biologists. Analysis of these data has already yielded potential insight into nuclear-retained mRNAs, cytosolic lncRNAs, putative lamina-localized RNAs, and genes that may be translated locally at mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum junctions. Applying APEX-RIP at other subcellular compartments will further expand the depth and breadth of this map. Furthermore, given the high temporal resolution of APEX-RIP, we imagine that our technology might enable profiling of subcellular RNA pools in response to acute stimuli or drugs, or throughout stages of the cell cycle and development. Collectively, such studies would yield an understanding into the biology of RNA subcellular localization at unprecedented scale.</p>

<title>Significance</title>
<p>RNA subcellular localization is a critical factor that influences a wide array of biological processes, ranging from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis to mammalian neuronal signaling. However, while this spatial layer of transcriptome regulation has been characterized in a handful of contexts, a broader understanding of its overall extent, the factors governing its establishment, and its impact on biological function, remain inchoate. The limitations hindering this understanding have been largely technical, since conventional methods&#x2014;such as fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) and Fractionation-Sequencing (&#x201C;Frac-Seq&#x201D;)&#x2014;depend upon specialized reagents and protocols that can limit throughput and general applicability. To address this fundamental need, we have developed a new strategy&#x2014;APEX-RIP&#x2014; which uses a simple toolkit and workflow to map the transcriptomes of discrete subcellular compartments at high depth and spatiotemporal resolution. APEX-RIP utilizes the engineered ascorbate peroxidase APEX to biotinylate proteins within a target subcellular compartment in live cells; these affinity-tagged proteins are then chemically crosslinked <italic>in situ</italic> to nearby RNAs. When applied to a variety of membrane-enclosed and membrane-adjacent compartments, the APEX-RIP strategy exhibited higher target specificity and coverage than do conventional fractionation-sequencing-based approaches, at a depth far exceeding those attainable by imaging-based methods. Furthermore, APEX-RIP can be applied to compartments that are recalcitrant to conventional biochemical purification. Given the superior precision, flexibility, and ease of this approach, we anticipate that APEX-RIP will provide a powerful tool for dissecting RNA subcellular localization in a broad range of biological contexts.</p>

<title>Plasmids and cloning</title>
<p>The pCDNA3 mito-APEX plasmid was published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rhee et al. 2013</xref>). The Mito-APEX2 construct was cloned from this plasmid using a two-step protocol. First, the A134P mutation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lam et al. 2014</xref>) was introduced into the APEX gene itself, using QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent), and thereafter the APEX2 gene was moved to the lentiviral vector pLX304 via Gateway cloning (Thermofisher), to generate plasmid pLX304 mito-APEX2.Other APEX-fusion constructs (pLX304 APEX2-NLS, pLX304 APEX2-NES, and plx304 ERM-APEX2) were cloned by Gibson assembly (NEB), using PCR to add targeting sequences and Gibson Assembly homology arms to the APEX2 gene, and joining the resulting insert into the pLX304 vector digested by BstBI and NheI. For HRP-KDEL, HRP C previously published(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Martell et al. 2016</xref>) was used as a template to make HRP-KDEL-IRES-Puromycin PCR fragment. Then the insert was cloned into PCDNA3 vector digested by NotI and XbaI.

<title>Mammalian cell culture</title>
<p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were obtained from ATCC, and cultured in growth media consisting of 1:1 DMEM:MEM (Cellgro), supplemented with 10&#x0025; Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 &#x03BC;g/mL streptomycin, at 37&#x00B0;C and under 5&#x0025;CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were discarded at 25 passages, and were periodically tested for Mycoplasma contamination using Universal Mycoplasma Detection kit (ATCC). For fluorescence microscopy imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>), cells were grown on 7&#x00D7;7-mm glass coverslips in 48-well plates. To improve cell adherence, coverslips were pretreated with 50 &#x03BC;g/mL fibronectin (Millipore) for 20 min at 37 &#x00B0;C and washed once with Dulbecco&#x2019;s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), pH 7.4.

<p>To prepare lentivirus, one &#x007E;70&#x0025; confluent T25 plate of HEK 293T cells, grown as above, was co-transfected with 2.5 &#x03BC;g of APEX2 fusion plasmid, along with 0.25 &#x03BC;g and 2.25 &#x03BC;g, respectively, of the lentivirus packaging plasmids VSV-G, and dR8.91(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pagliarini et al. 2008</xref>). Transfection mixes used 10 &#x03BC;L Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and were brought to a final volume of 2 mL with unsupplemented MEM. The cells were transfected for 3 hours, after which media was replaced with 2 ml of fresh growth media with FBS. After 48 hours, the lentiviral supernatant was collected by aspiration and filtered through a 0.45 &#x03BC;m syringe-mounted filter. This filtered supernatant was immediately used to infect cells. HEK293T cells, grown in 6-well plates as described above, were infected at &#x007E;50&#x0025; confluency, grown for 2 days, followed by selection in growth medium supplemented with 8 &#x03BC;g/mL blasticidin for 7 days, before further analysis.</p>
<p>For the cells stably expressing HRP-KDEL, HEK293T cells at &#x007E;60&#x0025; confluency, grown in 6-well plates as described above, were transfected with the mixture of 150 &#x03BC;g of plasmid and 10 &#x03BC;L Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in unsupplemented MEM for 3 hours, after which media was prelaced with 2 ml of fresh growth media with FBS.

<title><italic>In situ</italic> biotinylation and crosslinking</title>
<p>Stable-expression HEK 293T cells were grown to 90&#x0025; confluency in 6-well plates, as described above. For the crosslinking&#x2013;then&#x2013;BP biotinylation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A</xref>, <italic>top</italic>), cells were washed once with 5 mL PBS, and crosslinked in 5 mL 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, with gentle agitation. The crosslinking reaction was quenched by addition of glycine (1.2 M, in PBS) to final concentration 125 mM, and gentle agitation for 5 minutes at room temperature. Crosslinked cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with 500 &#x03BC;M biotin-phenol (BP)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rhee et al. 2013</xref>) in PBS at room temperature, for 30 min. Thereafter, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added to a final concentration 1 mM, for 1 min. The liquid phase was then removed by aspiration, and cells were washed twice with 2 mL quenching solution (5 mM Trolox, 10 mM Ascorbate, 10 mM sodium azide, in PBS). Crosslinked, labeled cells were collected by scraping, and pelleted by centrifugation, and either processed immediately or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x2013; 80 &#x00B0;C before further analysis.</p>
<p>For the BP&#x2013;then&#x2013;crosslinking protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>) used for mito-APEX2 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), cell growth media was replaced with fresh media supplemented with 500 &#x03BC;M BP. Cells were incubated in BP-supplemented media for 30 minutes at 37 &#x00B0;C, after which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After 1 min, the media was replaced with 5 mL crosslink-quench solution (0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formaldehyde, 10 mM ascorbate, and 5 mM Trolox, in PBS) for one minute, to simultaneously quench the APEX2 BP labeling reaction and initiate formaldehyde crosslinking. Thereafter, cells were washed and incubated in 5 mL of fresh crosslinkquench for two additional 1-minute incubation steps, followed by a third, 8-minute wash. Thereafter, crosslinking was terminated by the addition of Glycine, and cells were harvested as described above.</p>
<p>The BP&#x2013;quench&#x2013;then&#x2013;crosslinking protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>) used for all other subcellular compartments was identical to the BP&#x2013;then&#x2013;crosslinking protocol, except that, following BP-labling, and prior to the addition of crosslink-quench solution, cells were incubated in 2 mL azide-free quenching solution (10 mM ascorbate and 5 mM Trolox, in PBS) for one minute. Subsequently, cells were subjected to only two (1 and 9 minute) treatments in crosslink-quench solution.

After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies and neutravidin-AlexaFluor647 (1:1000 dilution) in BSA-supplemented PBS for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy, or in PBS at 4 &#x00B0;C in light-tight containers prior to imaging. Primary and secondary antibodies used were listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>.</p>
<p>Fluorescence confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss AxioObserver microscope with 63&#x00D7; oil-immersion objectives, outfitted with a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal head, a Cascade II:512 camera, a Quad-band notch dichroic mirror (405/488/568/647), 405 (diode), 491 (DPSS), 561 (DPSS) and 640 nm (diode) lasers (all 50 mW). Alexa Fluor488 (491 laser excitation, 528/38 emission), Alexa Fluor 568 (561 laser excitation, 617/73 emission), and AlexaFluor647 (640 laser excitation, 700/75 emission) and differential interference contrast (DIC) images were acquired through a 63x oil-immersion lens.

The blots were then blocked with blocking buffer (3&#x0025; (w/v) BSA, 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h more. The dilutions of the antibodies are as followed: Mouse anti-V5 antibody (Life Technologies) 1:1000 dilution and Mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Life Technologies) 1:800 dilution. Blots were rinsed four times for 5 min with wash buffer (0.1&#x0025; Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline), and then immersed in blocking buffer supplemented with Goat anti-Mouse IgG H &#x002B; L-HRP Conjugate (1:3,000 dilution, Bio-Rad), for 1 h at room temperature.

<p>To call significantly enriched genes from our data, ENCODE data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dunham et al. 2012</xref>), and ER-fractionation data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Reid and Nicchitta 2012</xref>), threshold cutoffs were determined using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fawcett 2006</xref>), employing sets of true-positive and false-positive genes identified as described below. At each fold enrichment value of the data, true positive rate (TPR &#x2013; fraction of detected true positive genes above the fold enrichment value) and false positive rate (FPR &#x2013; fraction of detected false positive genes above the fold enrichment value) are calculated. The fold enrichment value that maximizes TPR-FPR is chosen as the fold enrichment cutoff. In mitochondrial and ER-associated APEX-RIP experiments, ROC analysis was based on fold enrichment values; in the nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning experiment, it was based on calculated nuclear preference scores.</p>
<p>Nuclear preference scores were calculated as follows. To each gene, <italic>i,</italic> we assigned coordinates, (x,y) = (log<sub>2</sub><italic>N<sub>i</sub></italic>,log<sub>2</sub><italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic>), where <italic>N<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic> denote to the fold-enrichments from nuclear- (NLS) and cytosolic- (NES) APEX-RIP, respectively. In this space, the line y=x (or rather,log<sub>2</sub><italic>N</italic> =log<sub>2</sub><italic>C</italic>) corresponds to all genes that were equally enriched in both nuclear and cytosolic APEX-RIP, and hence do not preferentially reside in either compartment. The nuclear preference score for gene <italic>i</italic> (NPS<italic>i</italic>), is therefore defined as the minimum distance between its coordinates and the line log<sub>2</sub><italic>N</italic> =log<sub>2</sub><italic>C</italic>. This is equivalent to calculating the distance between points (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) = (log<sub>2</sub><italic>N<sub>i</sub></italic>, log<sub>2</sub><italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic>) and (x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>) = (0.5(log<sub>2</sub><italic>N<sub>i</sub></italic>&#x002B;log<sub>2</sub><italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic>), 0.5(log<sub>2</sub><italic>N<sub>i</sub></italic>&#x002B;log<sub>2</sub><italic>C<sub>i</sub></italic>)).

<title>Coverage and Specificity analysis of nuclear, cytosolic, and ER-proximal RNAs</title>
<p>To estimate the coverage (recall) and specificity of APEX-RIP at each subcellular compartment, we assembled lists of established target and off-target genes tailored for that compartment.</p>
<p>For analysis of the nuclear&#x2013;cytosolic datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), our reference nuclear gene list comprised 827 lncRNAs with average RNA pre-enrichment abundances of 1.0 or greater. Our reference off-target list comprised the set of 1260 ER-proximal RNAs defined using proximity-restricted ribosome profiling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jan, Williams, and Weissman 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>For analysis of the ER-proximal dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>&#x2013;J), our reference gene list comprised 71 mRNAs encoding ER-resident proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">Table S3</xref> tab 5). Our reference off-target list comprised (7589) RNAs lacking secretory annotation, as assessed using Phobius(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">K&#x00E4;ll, Krogh, and Sonnhammer 2004</xref>), TMHMM(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Krogh et al. 2001</xref>), SignalP(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petersen et al. 2011</xref>), and which lacked the GOCC terms &#x201C;Endoplasmic reticulum,&#x201D; &#x201C;Golgi,&#x201D; &#x201C;membrane,&#x201D; and &#x201C;extracellular&#x201D;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ashburner et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>For analysis of contaminants in ER datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3E</xref>), the RNAs that encode proteins with no predicted secretory annotation by Phobius, TMHMM, and SignalP and lacked GOCC terms &#x201C;Endoplasmic reticulum,&#x201D; &#x201C;Golgi,&#x201D; &#x201C;membrane,&#x201D; and &#x201C;extracellular&#x201D; were submitted to DAVID Bioinformatics analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang, Sherman, and Lempicki 2009</xref>) to find Gene ontology term enrichment against human background.
