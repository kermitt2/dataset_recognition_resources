<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Vaccinia virus (VACV) is an established tool for vaccination and is beginning to prove effective as an oncolytic agent. Industrial production of VACV stands to benefit in future from advances made by synthetic biology in genome engineering and standardisation. As a step toward realising these benefits we analysed the Lister Vaccinia virus genome with respect to refactoring options and propose a VACV genome engineering BioBrick&#x2122;. We then used the CV-1 cell line to produce a conventional recombinant Lister strain VACV, VACVL-15 RFP in a serum-free process. CV-1 cells grown in 5&#x0025; foetal bovine serum (FBS) Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) were adapted to growth in OptiPRO and VP-SFM brands of serum-free media. Specific growth rates of 0.047 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and 0.044 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> were observed for cells adapted to OptiPRO and VP-SFM respectively, compared to 0.035 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> in 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM. Cells adapted to OptiPRO and to 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM achieved recovery ratios of over 96&#x0025;, an indication of their robustness to cryopreservation. Cells adapted to VP-SFM showed a recovery ratio of 82&#x0025;. VACV production in static culture, measured as plaque forming units (PFU) per propagator cell, was 75 PFU/cell for cells in 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM. VP-SFM and OptiPRO adaptation increased VACV production to 150 PFU/cell and 350 PFU/cell respectively. Boosted PFU/cell from OptiPRO-adapted cells persisted when 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM or OptiPRO medium was present during the infection step and when titre was measured using cells adapted to 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM or OptiPRO medium. Finally, OptiPRO-adapted CV-1 cells were successfully cultivated using Cytodex-1 microcarriers to inform future scale up studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vaccinia virus (VACV) is an enveloped, brick-shaped particle typically 300&#x00D7;240&#x00D7;120 nm containing a double stranded DNA genome which, for the Lister strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Garcel et al. 2007</xref>), is 189.4 kilobase-pairs (kb) in size, encoding up to 201 open reading frames (ORFs). VACV is arguably one of the most effective biotechnological tools in history by dint of the fact human antibodies raised against VACV tend also to recognise smallpox epitopes. VACV was used to eradicate smallpox via a global vaccination programme carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) between 1966 and 1980 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fenner et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>VACV has also been used as a molecular biology tool to effect high-level transgene expression in mammalian cells, due in part to its &#x2248;25kb capacity for accommodating recombinant DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Mackett and Smith, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hruby, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guse et al., 2011</xref>). Molecular biology techniques developed in this area have also enabled construction of a wide range of recombinant VACV vaccines in which selected epitopes or payloads are defined by recombinant DNA.</p>
<p>Recombinant VACV has been developed as an effective live vaccine against viral, bacterial and oncological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hruby, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lee et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Timiryasova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>), due to its ability to elicit vigorous antibody and T-cell mediated responses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiley et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tysome et al. (2011)</xref> have also demonstrated the effectiveness of recombinant Lister strain VACV in targeting hypoxic tumours in human head and neck cancer.</p>
<p>Mass production of VACV for smallpox eradication was achieved by harvesting virus from lesions brought about by infection of live animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fenner et al., 1988</xref>). However, this method brought significant risk of contamination with microbiological agents and was superseded by viral propagation in embryonated hen eggs (EMEA 2012). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Monath et al. (2004)</xref> investigated the use of MRC-5 cells to produce the New York City Board of Health (NYCBH) VACV strain for a Phase I clinical trial as a smallpox vaccine. As a human diploid cell line, MRC-5 has a finite in vitro life span that limits capacity for long-term cultivation and large-scale VACV production using diploid cell lines can be difficult as such cells typically do not grow well on microcarriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barrett et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Vero cells cultivated in serum-free media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mayrhoffer et al. 2009</xref>) have been used previously to produce VACV and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Monath et al. (2004)</xref> used Vero cells grown on microcarriers for VACV production at 1200L scale in bioreactors. In effect Vero cells are the workhorse of VACV production so in this study we sought to diversify the range of mammalian cell lines used for VACV production. CV-1 cells are an obvious first choice as they have already been used widely for VACV titration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Schweneker et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>At laboratory-scale, scale-out strategies, such as roller bottles, T-flasks and the Nunc&#x2122; Cell Factory&#x2122;, are commonly used to cultivate adherent cells for propagation of VACV. However, methods that can be scaled up, as opposed to scaled out, are the ideal solution for increasing the level of production, predictability and affordability for widespread application of VACV-based therapies. Toward this aim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bleckwenn et al. (2005)</xref> used HeLa S3 cells grown on microcarriers, at 1.5L scale, in a hollow fibre perfusion bioreactor setup to propagate VACV. Viral vaccine production in media supplemented with bovine serum has been discouraged by regulatory authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), brings high variability between serum batches and can lead to variations in product yield and quality. Undefined components in serum may also provide a route for adventitious agent contamination. Bioprocesses that are serum-free and animal derived component free (ADCF) are now sought in order to reduce the contamination risk, ease the downstream processing artefacts and promote robustness and reliability for the production of VACV. Previous attempts to grow CV-1 cells in serum-free media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Steimer et al. 1981</xref>) replaced serum with other animal-derived products so did not remove routes for adventitious agent contamination.</p>
<p>Synthetic biology aims to render biological phenomena easier to engineer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ye and Fussenegger 2014</xref>). An inevitable consequence of this aim is that biology becomes easier to manufacture. When applied to VACV production, and its exploitation in areas such as gene therapy and oncotherapeutics, synthetic biology offers the prospect of rapid design and assembly of viral payloads using interoperable tools, such as BioBrick&#x2122;-formatted plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Shetty et al., 2008</xref>), compatible with repositories containing thousands of components.</p>
<p>Synthetic DNA is now being used to construct large segments of eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dymond et al. 2011</xref>) and construction of human artificial chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kononenko et al. 2015</xref>) is now an established approach in gene therapy research. We feel it is then reasonable to expect that cells, or &#x2018;chassis&#x2019;, could in the near future be controlled by bespoke genomes designed for maximal VACV production yields and integration with scalable bioprocesses. Here we take steps toward such a synthetic biology platform for VACV production, firstly by proposing a BioBrick&#x2122;-formatted plasmid for VACV genome engineering and appraising considerations for refactoring the VACV genome. Secondly, using a conventionally engineered VACV strain but a novel choice of propagator cell line, we retrofit VACV production from serum-containing media to serum-free media and test the resultant cells in terms of growth performance, viral productivity in T flasks and growth performance in a microcarrier-based cultivation platform.</p>

<title>Cell Cultivation</title>
<p>CV-1 cells, product CCL-70&#x2122; from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), were grown in High Glucose Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modification of Eagle&#x2019;s Medium (DMEM) from PAA Laboratories (Pasching, Austria), supplemented with 5&#x0025; v/v foetal bovine serum (FBS) from batches A10409-1728 and A15112-2026 for three passages prior to this study. Cells were passaged twice weekly in T flasks and seeded at 1&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> cells / cm<sup>2</sup> for growth in 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM and serum-free OptiPRO and 2&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> for growth in serum-free VP-SFM medium. Serum-free media was supplemented with GlutaMAX to 4mM and detached by treatment with TrypLE Select. All materials were sourced from Life Technologies, New York, USA, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cell Banking and Revival</title>
<p>Cells adapted to growth in 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM were cryopreserved in 90&#x0025; FBS plus 10&#x0025; v/v dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) from Sigma-Aldrich (Ayrshire, UK). Cells adapted to growth in serum-free media were frozen in a v/v mixture of; 45&#x0025; fresh growth medium, 15&#x0025; 2 day, 15&#x0025; 3 day and 15&#x0025; 4 day conditioned medium plus 10&#x0025; DMSO and 0.1&#x0025; v/v methylcellulose (Sigma). Cells were suspended in the cryopreservation medium at 3-5&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and transferred to 2mL screw cap cryopreservation tubes (Eppendorf Ltd, Stevenage, UK) for storage in the liquid phase of a liquid nitrogen Dewar (Part No. 9902130, Statebourne Cryogenics, Tyne &#x0026; Wear, UK). For revival, cryopreservation tubes were removed from liquid nitrogen and thawed in a SUB14 water bath at 37&#x00B0;C (Grant Instruments, Cambridge, UK). Upon thawing, cells in cryopreservation solution was diluted to 8mL and centrifuged at 1300rpm for 3minutes. The supernatant was withdrawn and cell pellet was resuspended in 8mL pre-warmed OptiPRO and transferred to a T 25 flask and incubated at 37&#x00B0;C, 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> in an MCO-19AIC incubator (Sanyo, Gunma, Japan).</p>

<title>Counting cells cultivated using T flasks</title>
<p>Cells were detached from flask surfaces using standard trypsin treatment. Total cells in suspension were then counted using a TC10&#x2122; Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions (document PN10016620 Rev B). Total viable cell counts in suspension were performed using standard trypan blue dye exclusion. Cells were stained with 0.4&#x0025; trypan blue (#T8154, Sigma-Aldrich, Aryshire, UK) and counted using an Improved Neubauer haemocytometer (Hawksley, Lancing, UK) within three minutes of staining.</p>

<title>Adaptation to Serum Free Media</title>
<p>Cells were grown in 10&#x0025; FBS DMEM to a density of 1.3&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in a T-25 flask (3.25&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> cells total). Cells were then harvested into a total volume of 8mL growth media mix, containing, for each round of adaptation; 6mL, 4mL, 2mL, 0.8mL and finally zero mL 10&#x0025; FBS DMEM made up to 8mL with serum-free media before further passaging. OptiPRO or VP-SFM brands of serum-free medium were used, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Virus Propagation</title>
<p>A single virus stock was used throughout this work. A titre of 6.68&#x00D7;10<sup>8</sup> PFU/mL was determined for this stock using the procedures described below and with CV-1 cells used for titration. Aliquots for infection were diluted with the required volume of growth media. Virus solutions were added drop wise to cells at a density of 3-5&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 6-well plate at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. After the indicated time period, infected &#x2018;propagator&#x2019; cells were harvested using a cell scraper for virus release by cell disruption.</p>

<title>Growth on microcarriers of CV-1 cells adapted to OptiPRO medium</title>
<sec id="s2i1">
<title>Pre-treatment of vessels and microcarriers</title>
<p>Cultivation of OptiPRO-adapted CV-1 cells adhered to Cytodex-1 microcarriers (GE Healthcare, Westborough, USA) was performed using a Techne MCS-104L 250mL spinner flask setup (Bibby Scientific Ltd, Staffordshire, UK). All procedures were performed in a Level 1 laminar flow biological safety cabinet (BSC) unless otherwise stated. Spinner flasks were first prepared for use by siliconisation of the flask interior surface and impellers using Sigmacote (SL2, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in accordance with manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. When the siliconisation procedure was complete the impeller system was assembled within the 250mL spinner flask and autoclaved using a cycle of 20 minutes at 121&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>A 0.5L pyrex Duran bottle was also coated with silicon using the Sigmacote and following manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Briefly, 100mL of Sigmacote were poured into to the 0.5L pyrex Duran bottle which was swirled until all the interior surface received a covering of Sigmacote. Remaining Sigmacote was decanted and the bottle was autoclaved, dried in a fume hood overnight then rinsed with Milli-Q water to remove any siliconisation by-products before use.</p>
<p>The required mass of Cytodex-1 microcarriers (17-0448-01, GE Healthcare, Sweden) was added to the siliconised Pyrex Duran bottle. For every gram of dry microcarriers 100mL of pH 7.4 PBS, free of calcium and magnesium ions (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), was added. The bottle was left to stand over night to achieve complete swelling and hydration of the microcarriers. The next day the PBS used to hydrate the microcarriers was gently decanted and replaced with 50mL fresh PBS for every gram of wet microcarriers. The microcarrier slurry was then sterilized by autoclaving (121 &#x00B0;C, 20 min). Prior to use, the sterilized microcarriers were allowed to cool and settle. Upon cooling the supernatant was gently decanted and replaced with 50 mL fresh OptiPRO medium for every gram of wet microcarriers. This OptiPRO/microcarrier slurry was allowed to settle and the OptiPRO supernatant was gently decanted then replaced with 100 mL fresh OptiPRO for every gram of wet microcarriers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i2">
<title>Mixing cells and microcarriers</title>
<p>30mL of the microcarrier / media slurry was transferred to the spinner flask. 70mL of a suspension of OptiPRO-adapted CV-1 cells in OptiPRO was then added to the spinner flask to achieve a microcarrier concentration of 3g/L and a cell concentration of 3.4x10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL, corresponding to 26 cells / microcarrier. The spinner flask was then placed on the MCS-104L stirrer device inside an MCO-19AIC incubator (Sanyo, Gunma, Japan) at 37&#x00B0;C and 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>. The mixture of cells and microcarriers was subjected to intermittent agitation at 30 RPM for 30 seconds every 30 minutes for the first two days of cultivation after which continuous 30 RPM agitation was used for the third day and then 35 RPM for the remainder of the cultivation experiment. Approximately 70&#x0025; of the volume of culture medium was replaced with fresh OptiPRO every 24 hours by terminating agitation; allowing microcarriers to settle decanting supernatant and adding fresh OptiPRO.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i3">
<title>Removing CV-1 cell samples during microcarrier-based cultivation</title>
<p>The MCS-104L stirrer device was switched off and transferred, with the spinner flask, from the incubator to the BSC. The stirrer was set to agitate the spinner flask at 60 RPM and the cap from one side-arm port of the spinner flask was removed to allow withdrawal of a 0.2mL sample from the culture. The MCS-104L stirrer device was then switched off and the entire setup returned to the incubator where incubation and agitation were resumed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i4">
<title>Counting CV-1 cells during cultivation using microcarriers</title>
<p>Samples taken as above were typically transferred to a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube and washed with 1mL PBS. Microcarriers were allowed to settle and 1ml supernatant was gently decanted; then a further 1mL PBS wash performed. After the final decanting of supernatant 0.2 mL aqueous crystal violet solution (0.1&#x0025; w/v Crystal Violet, 0.1M citric acid, 0.1&#x0025; v/v Triton X-100) was added to the microcarriers slurry and the mixed by pipetting up and down 25 times before the Eppendorf tube was transferred to an incubator set at 37&#x00B0;C / 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> for 1.5 hours. This treatment causes cells to lyse and release stained nuclei. Typically the solution was diluted by addition of PBS. Released nuclei were counted using an Improved Neubauer haemocytometer (1080346, Heinz Herenz Medizinalbedarf GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) as an indicator of cell numbers.</p>

<title>Considerations for VACV genome refactoring and BioBrick&#x2122;-based VACV plasmid tools</title>
<p>Industrial synthetic biology seeks to go beyond conventional bioprocessing and design host organisms (&#x2018;chassis&#x2019;) with predictable process behaviour. In the case of VACV biomanufacturing, a first step toward such a synthetic biology platform would involve refactoring the VACV genome for improved safety and manipulability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chan et al. (2005)</xref> proposed a refactored version of the T7 bacteriophage genome with a major design goal being to enable the precise and independent manipulation of discrete elements, such as open reading frames (ORFs). This goal was met by repositioning unique restriction sites naturally present in the T7 genome and introducing new unique sites, previously absent from the genome. We analysed the VACV Lister strain genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and located 6 unique restriction sites, cut by enzymes SanDI, SbfI, NotI, SgrAI, SmaI and ApaI in that order. AscI, DpnI, FseI, RsrII, SfiI, SgfI and SrfI sites are absent from the VACV Lister strain genome so may be candidates for addition by refactoring.</p>

<p>We also indicated the location of the EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI sites in the Lister strain VACV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) as these sites define the BioBrick&#x2122; DNA fragment assembly standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Shetty et al. 2008</xref>) widely used in the synthetic biology community and beyond. The six-fold variation in prevalence of these sites in the VACV genome serves to indicate the scale of refactoring that can be required to render natural DNA more compatible with standardised synthetic biology formats even for relatively small viral genomes.</p>
<p>The VACV genome is conventionally edited by parallel viral infection and plasmid transfection of mammalian cells. The plasmids contain regions of homology with a VACV genomic locus and this directs targeted recombination that results in progeny virions with edited genomes. Typically the locus encoding the ORF for thymidine kinase (TK) is used to target insertion of transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Byrd and Hruby, 2004</xref>) as its disruption does not compromise virus replication in cells commonly used for tissue culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The TK ORF contains a lone EcoRI restriction site at its approximate mid-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The location of this EcoRI site suggests a convenient point for splitting the TK and positioning it either side of the EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI BioBrick&#x2122; cloning site in a BioBrick&#x2122;-compatible VACV genome editing tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). BioBrick&#x2122;-based tools for virus design have been developed previously, such as BBa_K404129 that encodes a transgene expression cassette designed to be encapsidated by adeno-associated virus. Our proposed design, BBa_J140000, opens up the VACV genome to exploration using all components of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (International Genetically Engineered Machines, Boston, USA).</p>

<title>Adaptation of CV-1 cells to serum free growth media</title>
<p>CV-1 is a continuous cell line derived from <italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic> African green monkey kidneys by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jensen (1964)</xref>. It is susceptible to several viruses including VACV and has been widely used for virus titration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cho et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiley et al., 2010</xref>) but is previously unused for VACV propagation. Given its proven track record of both safe cultivation and efficient viral infection we chose CV-1 for this preliminary investigation. We sourced CV-1 cells from ATCC (product CCL-70&#x2122;) and considered them as already adapted to growth in 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM.</p>
<p>Cells were grown in a rich medium, 10&#x0025; FBS DMEM, before stepwise adaptation to growth in the VP-SFM and OptiPRO brands of serum-free medium. The serum content (v/v) of the growth medium mix used during each round of adaptation was lowered to 7.5&#x0025;, 2.5&#x0025;, 1&#x0025; and finally 0&#x0025;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the average growth rates observed when cells were first challenged with the decreased serum content media mix. Average CV-1 cell growth rate in 10&#x0025; FBS DMEM was 2.93&#x00B1;0.54 x10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>/day. Average growth rates in 7.5&#x0025; and 5&#x0025; FBS media mixes, for both VP-SFM and OptiPRO, were increased compared to 10&#x0025; FBS DMEM. Only 0&#x0025; serum, pure VP-SFM or OptiPRO, resulted in initial growth rates lower than that for 10&#x0025; FBS DMEM, with 1.97x10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>/day and 1.29x10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>/day respectively. Cells were then grown in VP-SFM or OptiPRO for another four passages before being considered as fully adapted to serum-free media.</p>

For cells adapted to 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), total cell numbers decreased over the first 24 hours post-seeding. Growth increased after this with a specific growth rate of 0.035 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> observed, corresponding to a doubling time of 20.1 hours. This is comparable to the doubling time of 22 hours reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hagedorn et al.

<p>Cells adapted to VP-SFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), decreased rapidly in number over the first 95 hours post-seeding, with viability as low as 4.9&#x0025;.

<p>Growth of cells adapted to OptiPRO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) lagged over the first 67 hours post-seeding then grew exponentially, with a specific growth rate of 0.047 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (14.8 hours doubling time). These cells reached stationary phase at 192 hours post-seeding, at a saturation density of 3.84x10<sup>6</sup> cells/25cm<sup>2</sup>. Notably, a significant decrease in viability was observed 24 hour post-seeding. This increased to &#x003E;90&#x0025; at 67 hours, remained above 90&#x0025; until 200 (160) hours then declined to &#x003C;60&#x0025; at 354 hours post-seeding.</p>
<p>Compared to cells adapted to grow in 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM, cells adapted to VP-SFM and OptiPRO had lower saturation densities and significant drops either in cell number or viability in the first 96 hours post-seeding. The absence of specific growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Todarro et al. 1965</xref>, Dulbecco et al. 1973, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Vogel et al. 1980</xref>) or nutrients from certain serum-free media formulations may result in reduced shear resistance in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">El-Ensahsy et al., 2009</xref>). This could explain the extended lag phase growth of cells adapted to VP-SFM and OptiPRO compared to those adapted to 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). VP-SFM and OptiPRO-adapted cells may have required a longer time period to recover from shear experienced over multiple rounds of detachment, resuspension and re-seeding during adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>CV-1 cell robustness to cryopreservation</title>
<p>Stable and reliable recovery from cryopreservation is a critical attribute of mammalian cells used for industrial production of biotherapeutics. Recovery ratio provides an indication of the effectiveness of a given formulation of cryopreservant media for storing cells under liquid nitrogen. Cells adapted to growth in 5&#x0025; FBS DMEM, VP-SFM and OptiPRO were resuspended in cryopreservant media, as detailed in the Methods section above, containing methylcellulose as a protective agent only for CV-1 cells previously adapted to VP-SFM and OptiPRO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Waymouth et al. 1976</xref>).

<p>In the case of T-flask cultivation, VACV propagation involves two significant factors: virus number and cell numbers, which are summarised by the MOI. By contrast microcarrier-based VACV propagation presents three major factors; viruses, cells and microcarriers, and as such represents a complex investigation to identify productivity optima, such as those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Monath et al. (2004)</xref> for production of VACV from Vero cells grown using microcarriers and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bleckwernn et al at (2005)</xref> for VACV production from HeLa cells. Such an investigation falls outside the scope of this study, which is to indicate the broad feasibility of the steps likely to define a future synthetic biology platform for VACV production.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We appraised the VACV genome in light of refactoring considerations and proposed a BioBrick&#x2122; plasmid for standardised VACV genome insertion. CV-1 cells adapted for growth in OptiPRO serum free medium exhibited elevated titre performance when grown using static culture and showed promising growth characteristics on Cytodex-1 microcarriers. Mechanisms underlying the elevated titre are unclear but may result from selective pressure exerted by the adaptation process acting also to select for an unintended phenotype.</p>
<p>Overall these results are consistent with the assertion that a standardised, serum-free, microcarrier-based synthetic biology platform for production of VACV is feasible. Cultivation in suspensions is inherently more scalable than cultivation on planar surfaces so further scale up of the platform proposed here should be investigated. Future work should include an investigation of the optimal conditions for VACV production from CV-1 cells grown on microcarriers, including the ratio of infecting virus to cells and microcarriers. Characterisation of virus quality should also be performed to assess factors such as the percentage of total virus particles that are plaque-forming as opposed to inactive.</p>
