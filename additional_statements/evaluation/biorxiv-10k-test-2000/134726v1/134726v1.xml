<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Insufficient folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore homeostasis. Yet, how the UPR achieves and evaluates ER homeostatic readjustment is poorly understood. In a HeLa cell model we show that, upon a severe proteostatic insult that eclipses the ER chaperone BiP, the UPR transitions from acute full-gear activation to chronic submaximal activation, when BiP is in excess again. As such, the UPR-driven ER expansion is pro-survival, primarily via the UPR transducer ATF6&#x03B1;. Simultaneous abrogation of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) leads to chronic full-gear UPR activation and further ER expansion, but the UPR transducers IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK turn pro-apoptotic. Pro-survival <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA processing by IRE1&#x03B1; is then trumped since unspliced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA is depleted and IRE1&#x03B1;&#x2019;s endonuclease activity is unleashed against other RNAs. Thus, the IRE1&#x03B1;/<italic>XBP1</italic> relay serves as a capacitor of ER expansion that heralds cell death if the expansion is deemed excessive.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Key to survival is that organisms adapt their behavior&#x2014;or on the cellular level their molecular machineries&#x2014;according to need. An example is how the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) accommodates fluctuations in the load of client proteins that fold and assemble there before being dispatched to travel further along the secretory pathway (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref></italic></bold>). An impressive array of ER resident chaperones and other folding factors assist the maturation of client proteins (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">van Anken and Braakman, 2005</xref></italic></bold>). BiP is an ER resident HSP70 family chaperone, whose function is regulated by at least five different HSP40 co-chaperones, two nucleotide exchange factors, and through reversible AMPylation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Preissler et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>). The ER also hosts an HSP90 family member, GRP94, for which CNPY family proteins may be co-chaperones (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Anelli and van Anken, 2013</xref></italic></bold>), and several PPIases, such as cyclophilin B and a few FKBP family members. Special to the ER are the chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) that bind N-glycans on client proteins, and numerous protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) that assist disulfide bond formation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">van Anken and Braakman, 2005</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>The chaperones and folding factors retain folding and assembly intermediates in the ER so as to minimize the secretion or deployment throughout the endomembrane system of immature client proteins (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ellgaard and Helenius. 2003</xref></italic></bold>). Such client retention in the ER implies that when the protein folding machinery is inadequate in letting clients mature, they accumulate, which causes ER stress and activates an adaptive response: the UPR (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref></italic></bold>). The circuitry of the UPR has been mapped to impressive detail: the three well-studied branches of the UPR are initiated by the UPR transducers IRE1&#x03B1;, PERK and ATF6&#x03B1;, each having an ER stress sensing domain in the ER lumen and a UPR signaling effector domain in the cytosol. Activated IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK are kinases that trans-autophosphorylate. This step triggers IRE1&#x03B1; to assume endonuclease activity such that it removes an intron from <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA. Upon its religation the spliced mRNA encodes the XBP1 transcription factor (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Calfon et al., 2002</xref></italic></bold>). The IRE1&#x03B1; endonuclease activity may also stray to other RNAs in a process named regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hollien et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). Activated PERK transiently attenuates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2&#x03B1; (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Harding et al., 1999</xref></italic></bold>). At the same time eIF2&#x03B1; phosphorylation favors expression of a few transcripts, in particular ATF4 and ATF5, which are transcription factors that activate further downstream effectors, such as CHOP (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref></italic></bold>). The third UPR branch is activated by ATF6&#x03B1; that undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis in the Golgi, which liberates a transcriptionally active N-terminal portion of 50 kDa that acts as a transcription factor (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Ye et al., 2000</xref></italic></bold>). The UPR-driven mobilization of these transcription factors ensures that through their concerted efforts a comprehensive genetic program is initiated that drives expression of all components that are necessary to expand the ER, including chaperones and enzymes for membrane synthesis (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref></italic></bold>). In fact, overexpression of for instance XBP1 alone leads to ER expansion even in absence of any perturbation of the ER client protein folding and assembly process (<bold><italic>Sriburi et al., 2000</italic></bold>). Moreover, UPR activation reinforces the ERAD machinery that dispatches ER clients that fail to fold or assemble across the ER membrane to the cytosol for proteasomal destruction (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Altogether, the UPR aims for homeostatic readjustment of the ER folding machinery through expansion of the organelle when needed, as well as for making life/death decisions depending on the severity of ER stress (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref></italic></bold>). Indeed, the UPR displays pro-apoptotic activity, which contributes to disease when dysregulated. For instance, UPR-driven apoptosis in &#x03B2;-cells of the pancreas seems to be a major cause of Type II diabetes (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scheuner and Kaufman, 2008</xref></italic></bold>) and various other pathologies (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wang and Kaufman, 2012</xref></italic></bold>). However, the question why the UPR would invoke pro-apoptotic pathways has been poorly addressed. Certainly, unbridled ER expansion occurs in so-called ER storage diseases (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rutishauser and Spiess, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anelli and Sitia, 2010</xref></italic></bold>) when ER clients accumulate but apparently no UPR-driven cell death is invoked. In epithelial cells that line the thick ascending limb of Henle&#x2019;s loop in the nephron, ER accumulation of mutant uromodulin causes a UPR and such unrestrained expansion of the organelle (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nasr et al., 2008</xref></italic></bold>) that it leads to loss of cellular and tubule architecture (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kemter et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>), and, ultimately, loss of kidney function (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bernascone et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>). Along these lines, one could speculate that unrestrained ER expansion may cause gain-of-function disease irrespective of the ER client that drives the expansion. Pro-apoptotic output of the UPR could serve to afford cells self-censorship when they expand their ER to a size that is out of order.</p>
<p>Thus far, most studies on the UPR circuitry have focused on the signaling pathways themselves, while little is known about how the UPR evaluates the severity of ER stress and what defines the success of homeostatic readjustment of the ER. We here show that the widely used strategy of employing ER stress-eliciting drugs obscures how ER homeostatic readjustment may be achieved, and we present a HeLa cell model that instead allows to evaluate just that. By inducible overexpression of orphan immunoglobulin M (IgM) heavy chain (&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>), we provoke a full-blown UPR, which is essential for the cells to cope with the proteostatic insult. As &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> accumulates in the ER, it temporarily reaches levels that are at least on a par with BiP, which provokes the UPR that lets BiP increase to levels that exceed &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> levels again, while the ER expands in the process. The activation of the UPR is maximal only when there is a relative shortage of BiP, while it subsides to chronic submaximal output levels when ER homeostatic readjustment is achieved. Co-expression of Ig light chain (&#x03BB;) instead leads to productive IgM secretion, such that BiP is not sequestered by &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>, the UPR is not activated and the ER does not expand. Conversely, abrogation of ERAD leads to further ER expansion since &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> accumulates even more as it cannot be disposed of. Under these conditions IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK are chronically activated to maximal levels, which is when they relinquish their pro-survival role. While IRE1&#x03B1; still sustains maximal levels of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing it also commits to RIDD. Apparently, IRE1&#x03B1;&#x2019;s endonuclease activity is then unleashed against other RNAs, simply because levels of unspliced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA become limiting. As such, the IRE1&#x03B1;/<italic>XBP1</italic> relay serves as a capacitor that affords capping of ER expansion if it is judged to be excessive.</p>

<title>Cytotoxicity of UPR eliciting drugs</title>
<p>Drugs that typically are used to study the unfolded protein response (UPR) include tunicamycin (Tm), which prevents addition of N-glycans to nascent ER clients, dithiothreitol (DTT), which impedes disulfide bond formation, and thapsigargin (Tg), which depletes Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> from the ER lumen. Their immediate effect is a general collapse of productive protein folding in the ER, and these drugs activate as such the UPR (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref></italic></bold>). In the longer run, however, these drugs likely have pleiotropic effects. Evidently, non-productive folding in the ER causes that ER clients are retained in the ER (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</xref></italic></bold>), and thus no longer reach their destination, be it anywhere throughout the endomembrane system of the cell or extracellularly. As a result&#x2014;depending on their half-life (<italic>t</italic>&#x00BD;)&#x2014;these proteins will be depleted at the site where they have to exert their functions, which ultimately may cause a plethora of perturbations to the homeostasis of the cell.</p>
<p>In order to unmask pleiotropic effects of UPR eliciting drugs, taking Tm as an example, we serially diluted it starting from a concentration (5 &#x03BC;g/ml) that is widely used to study the effects of ER stress and UPR activation, and monitored cell survival after 7 days by a cell growth / colony formation assay. At this high concentration a full-blown UPR was triggered, which is evident from the maximal extent of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing in HeLa cells, i.e. the appearance of a band of higher mobility, corresponding to the RT-PCR product of the <italic>XBP1<sup>S</sup></italic> transcript from which the intron has been removed (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>). Yet, there was no cell survival after 7 days (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref></italic></bold>); not even when the cells were treated with Tm only the first day for 4 hrs. At a 100-fold dilution of the &#x201C;standard&#x201D; concentration, Tm marginally induced splicing of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>), but still provoked a substantial cell growth defect (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref></italic></bold>). Even at a further two-fold dilution of Tm to 25 ng/ml that failed to engender <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing altogether (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>) there was some loss of cell growth (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref></italic></bold>). These findings thus reveal that an overall impairment of ER client protein folding has cytotoxic consequences aside from the activation of the UPR <italic>per se</italic>. Indeed, Tm readily causes morphological aberrations of the ER also at these low concentrations (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rutkowski et al., 2006</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Proteostatic induction of the UPR as a model to assess ER homeostatic readjustment</title>
<p>We reasoned that pleiotropic effects of UPR eliciting drugs likely obscure important aspects of how cells cope with ER stress. If cell growth is compromised or, worse, if cell death is provoked already through these pleiotropic effects, how can we appreciate the contribution of the UPR to life/death decisions? Moreover, will UPR-driven ER expansion reach its full extent, if other cellular functions are compromised? We therefore sought to circumvent the shortcomings of using ER stress-eliciting drugs, and we hypothesized that over-expression of an ER client protein would be a better tool to appreciate these two aspects of UPR-driven adaptations to ER stress.</p>
<p>The impressive ER expansion during B cell differentiation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wiest et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">van Anken et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>) inspired us to choose the bulk product of plasma cells, secretory antibody, as an ideal candidate to engender a proteostatically driven UPR. More specifically, we decided to employ the secretory heavy chain (HC) of immunoglobulin M (&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>), since &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> is expressed in bulk exclusively once B lymphocytes are activated and develop an expanded ER to become plasma cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sitia et al., 1987</xref></italic></bold>), and since plasma cell differentiation requires a functional UPR (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Reimold et al., 2001</xref></italic></bold>). Yet, the precise role of the UPR in ER expansion and life/death decision in plasma cell development is difficult to assess. On the one hand, B cells anticipate that they will secrete IgM in bulk once they have differentiated into plasma cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">van Anken et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>), such that ER expansion is also driven by developmental cues (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Iwakoshi et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>). Accordingly, ER expansion occurs in differentiating B cells even when &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> is ablated (<bold><italic>Hu et al., 2009</italic></bold>). On the other hand, plasma cell life span is inherently limited out of immunological necessity, such that the UPR may contribute to life/death decisions in plasma cells, but unlikely exclusively so.</p>
<p>To assess the effect solely of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression on cellular homeostasis we thus decided to create a HeLa cell model that allowed inducible expression of murine &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> for which we exploited the GeneSwitch system (Invitrogen). By subsequent lentiviral delivery and cloning of integrant cells we introduced the hybrid nuclear receptor that is activated by the synthetic steroid, mifepristone (Mif), yielding HeLa-MifON cells. The &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> transgene under control of the promoter element responsive to that hybrid nuclear receptor was then integrated into the HeLa-MifON cells, yielding HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> cells.</p>
<p>Expression of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> in HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> cells in the absence of Mif was undetectable by immunoblotting (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></italic></bold>) or immunofluorescence (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref></italic></bold>). The GeneSwitch system is amplified through an autoregulatory feedback loop whereby the Mif-bound hybrid nuclear receptor upregulates expression of its own gene. This feature likely causes that titration of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression levels by varying Mif concentration was not easily reproducible, and that the Mif-driven inducibility was rather an off/on effect (data not shown). A proxy for tunable expression of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> instead was offered by comparing different HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> clones, which&#x2014;due to differences in genomic locus or copy number of integrations&#x2014;each expressed &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> at a different level upon induction with Mif as shown for three individual clones (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></italic></bold>). As illustrated by immunofluorescence of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref></italic></bold>), expression was remarkably uniform between cells since they were clonal. Moreover, &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> is retained in the ER lumen, as shown by its strict co-localization with the ER marker CRT (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>The autoregulatory feedback loop of the GeneSwitch system has the advantage that it allows highly abundant expression of the transgene. Indeed, in the most highly expressing HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> clone &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> reached levels that are at least on a par with those in model plasma cells: I.29&#x03BC;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> lymphomas that were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 3 days (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref></italic></bold>). Synthesis of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> reached a plateau after 1-2 days of consistently high levels as judged by radiolabeling (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref></italic></bold>,<bold><italic>F</italic></bold>). Thus, the proteostatic UPR stimulus is permanent, which implies that the cells must undergo homeostatic readjustment to meet the increased demand on the ER folding machinery.</p>
<p>By a series of standard assays, we then demonstrated that &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> triggered a full-blown UPR. Upon 16 hrs of induction of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression, splicing of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA, phosphorylation of PERK (appearance of a band of slightly lower mobility), expression of PERK&#x2019;s downstream effector CHOP, cleavage of the precursor ATF6&#x03B1;-p90 and the concomitant release of its cytosolic portion p50, were all at levels comparable to those triggered by a conventional Tm or Tg elicited UPR in these cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></italic></bold>). Treatment of the parental HeLa-MifON cells with a high dose of Mif (10 nM) did not provoke <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref></italic></bold>). Thus, the UPR induction in Mif treated HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> was the result of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression. Moreover, UPR activation upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> induction was dose dependent, since the extent of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing or CHOP expression was commensurate with the levels of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> that were expressed by the different HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> clones (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></italic></bold>). Another hallmark of a full-blown UPR activation is the clustering of IRE1&#x03B1; (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>). We deleted IRE1&#x03B1; by CRISPR/Cas9 and reconstituted it with GFP-tagged murine IRE1&#x03B1; (IRE1&#x03B1;-GFP) under control of a tight Tet responsive element (Clontech) by lentiviral transduction. The GFP-tag was introduced such that it did not interfere with function (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref></italic></bold>) as has been shown before for human IRE1&#x03B1; (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>) or yeast Ire1p (<bold><italic><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Arag&#x00F3;n et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). With doxycycline (Dox) we tuned IRE1&#x03B1;-GFP expression to near-endogenous levels that allowed visualization by fluorescent microscopy and found that IRE1&#x03B1;-GFP not only clustered upon Tm treatment, but also upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref></italic></bold>). Altogether, we concluded that &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression drove activation of all branches of the UPR we tested in a similar manner and to a similar extent as triggered by ER-stress eliciting drugs.</p>
<p>Strikingly, in spite of the expression of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> in bulk, cell growth of the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> cells almost paralleled that of the Mif treated parental MifON cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref></italic></bold>,<bold><italic>J</italic></bold>). Thus, the full-blown UPR that was elicited by &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression was well tolerated by the cells, unlike prolonged treatment with Tm at concentrations that triggered a full-blown UPR (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></italic></bold>). In all, we concluded that the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> cells offer a suitable model to assess ER homeostatic readjustment and the role of the UPR in the process since the cells apparently cope well with the proteostatic insult that is unabated once &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression is induced.</p>

<title>UPR activation correlates with accumulation of ER load rather than with the secretory burden</title>
<p>By expressing &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> we burden the cells with a Sisyphean task, because in absence of &#x03BB;, no IgM can be produced, a situation that mimics storage of mutant ER client proteins in disease. Inspired by B to plasma cell differentiation, we argued that &#x03BB; in contrast to &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> would likely provide a poor if any proteostatic insult to the cells, as it is expressed in B lymphocytes when they still are quiescent, and&#x2014; by definition&#x2014;minimally stressed. Moreover, ER retention of &#x03BB; is far less stringent than that of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> such that &#x03BB; can be secreted (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hendershot and Sitia, 2005</xref></italic></bold>). To assess whether the flux of client proteins passing through the ER or rather their accumulation determines the amplitude of UPR signaling, we created clones that co-express the two IgM subunits and selected clones based on stoichiometric differences in &#x03BB; and &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression. As expected, when &#x03BB; and &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> were co-expressed, antibody assembly took place, which we monitored by immunoblotting of lysates and of culture media separated by reducing (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>) or non-reducing (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref></italic></bold>) gel electrophoresis. The clone in which &#x03BB; was in excess allowed successful assembly into polymeric antibodies that were efficiently secreted. In clones where &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> was in excess, assembly and secretion were less efficient, leading to intracellular accumulation of disulfide-linked species that are characteristic intermediates of the IgM assembly pathway (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hendershot and Sitia, 2005</xref></italic></bold>). As anticipated, HeLa cells inducibly expressing &#x03BB;, at similarly high levels as we had reached for &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>, did not activate the UPR (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref></italic></bold>). Strikingly, the &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> driven UPR was almost fully mitigated as well when &#x03BB; was co-expressed in excess, while the other clones showed intermediate UPR activation commensurate with the excess of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> (or lack of &#x03BB;).</p>

<p>Since the levels of ER client proteins (the sum of intracellular &#x03BB; and &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>) were comparable in the different clones, we concluded that the flux of proteins entering the ER is no key determinant for UPR activation, but rather that the nature of the proteostatic insult determines the extent of UPR activation, with &#x03BB; being a very poor UPR activator, and &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> being a particularly powerful one, provided it does not team up with &#x03BB;. Of note is that levels of the ER chaperone BiP increased markedly when &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> was expressed alone but far less so or not at all if &#x03BB; was present (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref></italic></bold>).

<title>ER homeostatic readjustment entails a transition from acute to chronic UPR signaling</title>
<p>Since the cells that inducibly overexpress &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> showed maximal UPR activation with no major negative impact on cell growth&#x2014;unlike cells treated with UPR eliciting drugs&#x2014;we surmised that the &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expressing cells underwent successful homeostatic readjustment of the ER. To appreciate the timing of the response to the proteostatic insult and the process of ER homeostatic readjustment with a more detailed temporal resolution, we further analyzed by immunoblotting the upregulation of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>, BiP and of another ER chaperone, PDI, with time (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref></italic></bold>). As such, we witnessed that levels of BiP only noticeably increased from 12 hrs onwards (and PDI even later), while &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> built up steadily in the first 12 hrs upon induction. Indeed, using recombinant BiP and commercially obtained pure IgM (of which &#x223C;70&#x0025; of the protein mass is &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>) as standards, we assessed the absolute quantities in cell lysates of BiP and &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> upon induction of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression. BiP levels increased &#x223C;12.5-fold. Based on cell counting, protein weight determination of samples and that the molecular weight of BiP is &#x223C;70 kDa, we estimated BiP levels to rise from &#x223C;2 x 10<sup>7</sup> to &#x223C;2 x 10<sup>8</sup> copies per cell. Importantly, from the absolute quantitation we deduced that BiP levels were in excess of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> once the cells had adapted to the proteostatic insult (with &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> reaching an estimated &#x223C;1.5-1.8 x 10<sup>8</sup> copies per cell). Early upon the onset of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression and before BiP induction was fully underway, however, &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> levels transiently were at a 1:1 stoichiometry with those of BiP, or possibly, &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> levels even slightly exceeded BiP levels (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>Following the activation of the UPR over time upon onset of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression, we found that all three UPR branches transiently reached an output that was maximal, i.e. at least on a par with the output that was induced by a conventional drug-elicited UPR (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref></italic></bold>). Levels of cleaved ATF6&#x03B1; (p50) reached a maximum at &#x223C;6 hrs upon the onset of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression before it subsided to submaximal levels. Levels of spliced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA likewise reached a maximum at the same time but remained maximal for about 24 hrs (with perhaps some oscillations) before they subsided to submaximal levels. Levels of CHOP, which provides a readout for PERK activity, reached a maximum slightly later, at 12-16 hr upon the onset of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression before reaching submaximal levels, as further illustrated in a &#x201C;heatmap&#x201D; of UPR activation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref></italic></bold>). Treatment with ER-stress eliciting drugs during the chronic phase when the UPR had submaximal output, readily triggered close to maximal output of all three UPR branches again (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 4&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref></italic></bold>), indicating that prolonged &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression had not exhausted the signaling capacity of the UPR, and, thus, that homeostatic readjustment of the ER accounted for lowered UPR output levels upon chronic &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression. Strikingly, the highest output of the three UPR branches did not coincide when &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> reached maximal expression levels. Instead, UPR signaling reached maxima when the ratio &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>/BiP was highest (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref></italic></bold>). These findings support a scenario in which the UPR signals are commensurate with the extent of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> sequestering the folding machinery, in particular BiP, rather than its accumulation <italic>per se</italic>.</p>

<title>The ER expands in response to a proteostatic insult</title>
<p>The increase of BiP levels upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression indicated that the homeostatic readjustment to accumulating &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> levels entailed expansion of the ER. To directly visualize ER expansion, we targeted a modified version of pea peroxidase (APEX) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lam et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>) to the ER by use of an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal KDEL. APEX-KDEL was expressed under control of the TetT promoter at such low levels that it did not interfere with the &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>-driven UPR (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5&#x2014; figure supplement 1</xref></italic></bold>). We then exploited APEX to catalyze polymerization of 3,3&#x2019;-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) upon treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to obtain contrast in electron microscopy (EM), and stained as such the ER of cells before or after 1, 3, or 7 days of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression. We determined that the ER lumen before induction of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression occupies 10-12&#x0025; of the area within the cytoplasm (i.e. excluding the nucleus) in the electron micrographs (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref></italic></bold>), which by a rough estimate would correspond to (0.10-0.12)<sup>3/2</sup> &#x2248; 3-4&#x0025; of the cytoplasmic volume. Considering that the volume of the cytosol in HeLa cells is estimated to be &#x223C;2x10<sup>3</sup> &#x03BC;m<sup>3</sup>, i.e. &#x223C;2x10<sup>3</sup> fl (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Milo, 2013</xref></italic></bold>), we estimated the ER to have a volume of &#x223C;60-80 fl. The ER expanded in the course of 1-3 days upon the onset of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression to cover &#x223C;18&#x0025; of the cytoplasmic area in the electron micrographs, corresponding to roughly (0.18)<sup>3/2</sup> &#x2248; 7-8&#x0025; of the cytoplasmic volume, but we observed no further ER expansion after three days. Based on these estimates the volume of the ER increased 2-3-fold as a result of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression to &#x223C;120-240 fl per cell.</p>

We then used a label-free quantitation approach to obtain an approximation of the mass levels of proteins (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cox et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>) (<bold><italic>Supplementary File 1</italic></bold>), such that we could estimate what share of the total protein content of the cell the ER would account for. Proteins that we identified at each time point to rank among the 500 most abundant at any of the time points, altogether representing &#x223C;600 proteins, we categorized according to subcellular localization and/or function. We limited detailed analysis to this subset, since the label-free quantitation method is more reliable for abundant proteins (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cox et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>), and because this subset already covered &#x003E;90&#x0025; of the total protein content in the cell. Changes in protein expression levels were assessed and in parallel by SILAC (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ong et al., 2002</xref></italic></bold>), which revealed mostly similar trends in differential expression (<bold><italic>Supplementary File 1</italic></bold>), confirming the usefulness of the label-free quantitation approach.</p>
<p>We then calculated for each category the percentage of the total protein content and deduced that the ER accounts for &#x223C;3&#x0025; before &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression in line with the findings by EM. Upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression the ER content, including &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>, expanded to &#x223C;10&#x0025; within 3 days, but did not expand much further after that (&#x223C;12&#x0025; at day 7) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, upper panels</italic></bold>; <bold><italic>Supplementary File 1</italic></bold>). The slightly higher estimate of the percentage of the total protein the ER accounts for by proteomics compared to the EM-based estimate of the percentage of the total volume that the ER occupies could indicate that the continuous &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression led to increased molecular crowding within the ER.

Put together with the absolute quantitation of BiP levels, we estimate the cells on average to harbor 5 x 10<sup>9</sup> proteins, which fits with earlier assumptions (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Milo, 2013</xref></italic></bold>). Moreover, from these quantitations we estimated BiP levels to be at &#x223C;0.5 mM (or 30-40 mg/ml) before induction and to reach &#x223C;1.5 mM (or 90-120 mg/ml) at day 7, corresponding an overall protein concentration of &#x223C;200-300 mg/ml in the ER. Other ER resident chaperones increased as well, such as GRP94, CRT and some members of the PDI family (most notably ERp72 and P5) albeit to a lesser extent. As a consequence, levels of BiP within the ER increased from &#x223C;15&#x0025; before onset of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression to 30-40&#x0025; of the expanded ER proteome. Also levels of GRP170, which acts as a nucleotide exchange factor of BiP (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Behnke et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>), markedly increased.</p>
<p>Before induction &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> was barely detectable (&#x223C;1 ppm) but levels rapidly increased to become &#x223C;10 x 10<sup>3</sup> ppm, i.e. &#x223C;1&#x0025; (after 1 day) and &#x223C;2&#x0025; (from day 3 onward) of the total protein content in the cell (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, upper panels</italic></bold>; <bold><italic>Supplementary File 1</italic></bold>). Strikingly, already after 1 day upon induction of its expression, &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> levels exceeded that of any chaperone in the ER except BiP, which still outmatched &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> 3:2 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lower panels</italic></bold>; <bold><italic>Supplementary File 1</italic></bold>). Yet, BiP levels had increased 3-4 fold after 1 day of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression to keep pace with the burden imposed on the ER folding machinery by &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>. At later times, the margin of BiP being in excess of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> increased again, with BiP and &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> together constituting about half of the ER when it had fully expanded. Thus, upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression in bulk, the ER not only changed quantitatively (i.e. undergoing a &#x223C;3-4-fold expansion), but also qualitatively (i.e. becoming dominated by &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> that is held in check by excess levels of its most devoted chaperone BiP).</p>

<title>UPR signaling, in particular through ATF6&#x03B1;, is key for ER homeostatic readjustment</title>
<p>Since cell growth and survival were hardly perturbed upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression, we reasoned that ER homeostasis was successfully readjusted.

<p>Surprisingly, ablation of IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK either alone or in combination could be afforded upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression, with growth being only marginally affected. In contrast, silencing of ATF6&#x03B1; alone negatively affected growth when &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> was expressed, and additional ablation of IRE1&#x03B1; or PERK almost completely abolished growth. Thus, ATF6&#x03B1; is the key branch of the UPR that sustains ER homeostatic readjustment in the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> model, but the pro-survival role of IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK in letting the cells adjust to &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression was unmasked when ATF6&#x03B1; was silenced (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref></italic></bold>).

<title>ER homeostatic readjustment requires expansion of the ER</title>
<p>For conditions that led to a severe loss of cell growth, we obviously could not assess BiP or &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> levels upon induction. Conversely, ablation of either IRE1&#x03B1; or PERK alone or in combination did not diminish BiP induction (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref></italic></bold>), but the induction of BiP levels was compromised when ATF6&#x03B1; was ablated even though the induction of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression levels was similar (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>-E</italic></bold>).

<title>ER homeostatic readjustment requires that ER expansion is capped</title>
<p>While ER expansion proved to be essential for the cells to cope with &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression, there was no further expansion once a &#x223C;3-4-fold increase of ER content was reached, which implies that at that stage the influx of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> molecules was matched by countermeasures.</p>
<p>One obvious way through which the stress can be diluted is through cell division, but we reasoned that the cells also employed dedicated mechanisms to achieve a relief of the folding load. Translational attenuation through PERK activation is a means to alleviate the burden on the ER folding machinery by diminishing the input of nascent clients entering the ER lumen (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Harding et al., 1999</xref></italic></bold>). Yet, we ruled out that PERK-driven translational attenuation was a key determinant for ER homeostatic readjustment in the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> model, considering that PERK ablation hardly impeded cell growth upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression, and considering that there was a transient and only marginal reduction (at the lowest &#x223C;80&#x0025; of that before induction) in overall protein synthesis only during the first 16 hrs of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure 9&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref></italic></bold>). RIDD, as afforded by IRE1&#x03B1;, likewise has been proposed to limit ER input by destroying mRNAs that encode ER client proteins (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hollien et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). Following the same reasoning, we excluded that RIDD is important for ER homeostatic readjustment upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression as well, since ablation of IRE1&#x03B1; had little impact on cell growth.</p>
<p>However, &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> is a target of ERAD in plasma cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fagioli and Sitia, 2001</xref></italic></bold>), and we confirmed by radio-labeling-based pulse-chase that &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> was degraded also in the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> cell model in a manner that was almost fully prevented when the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 was present (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref></italic></bold>). Thus, we ruled out that other degradative pathways (in particular autophagy) play a role in the disposal of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>. Since &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> is glycosylated, it is subject to mannose trimming (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aebi et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>), which is a key step in delivering &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> to the dislocation machinery that shuttles &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fagioli and Sitia, 2001</xref></italic></bold>). Accordingly, the ER mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine (Kif) stabilized &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> in a similar manner as MG132. Interestingly, while &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> levels built up steadily in the ER with time, ERAD kinetics hardly changed (i.e. the <italic>t</italic>&#x00BD; of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> was remarkably constant), which implies that ERAD kept pace with the accumulating load of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref></italic></bold>). Indeed levels of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> no longer increased (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref></italic></bold>) soon after the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> reached a plateau (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref></italic></bold>), reflecting that synthesis and degradation were then at equilibrium. The net accumulation of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> is therefore commensurate with the <italic>t</italic>&#x00BD; of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>: if the <italic>t</italic>&#x00BD; would have been shorter, as it is in plasma cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fagioli and Sitia, 2001</xref></italic></bold>), less &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> would accumulate at an equal &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> synthesis rate.</p>

<p>Kif treatment did not affect cell viability in HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> cells in absence of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression, but caused apoptosis when &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression was induced, indicating that ERAD is key for homeostatic readjustment of the ER when under duress of accumulating &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref></italic></bold>). Accordingly, ablation of either HRD1 or SEL1L, two ERAD-related proteins shown previously to target &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> for proteasomal degradation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cattaneo et al., 2008</xref></italic></bold>), was tolerated in the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> cells, but not upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression (<bold><italic>Lari et al, manuscript in preparation</italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, a block of ERAD by Kif entailed further expansion of the ER to an extent that&#x2014;as judged by electron microscopy&#x2014;is reminiscent of that in professional secretory cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref></italic></bold>). The area of ER staining within the cytoplasm reached 30-35&#x0025;, which on a rough estimate would account for (0.3-0.35)<sup>3/2</sup> &#x2248; 17-20&#x0025; of the cytoplasmic volume, implying that the ER had expanded &#x223C;6-7-fold. In contrast, the extent of the ER was hardly affected by Kif in absence of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression, which further indicates that the default burden on the ER folding machinery in HeLa cells is low. We concluded that curtailing the &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> load by ERAD is essential for the cells to cope with &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression. We moreover surmised that the UPR might play a role in capping ER expansion by invoking pro-apoptotic pathways in response to unrestrained ER expansion.</p>

<title>Unbridled ER expansion causes IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK to relinquish their pro-survival role</title>
<p>Since we found that ATF6&#x03B1; was key for sustaining ER expansion to accommodate the accumulating &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> load, and, since ERAD turned out to be a crucial countermeasure, it was not surprising that ablating ATF6&#x03B1; and ERAD at the same time resulted in further loss of cell growth than when either ATF6&#x03B1; was silenced or ERAD inhibited alone (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref></italic></bold>,<bold><italic>B</italic></bold>). Unexpectedly, ablation of either IRE1&#x03B1; or PERK, and, in particular, of both IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK led to a partial &#x201C;rescue&#x201D;; i.e. inhibition of ERAD caused less reduction in growth upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression when the cells lacked IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK. We therefore surmised that under conditions when ERAD is dysfunctional, IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK are no longer predominantly pro-survival, but instead contribute to a loss in cell growth. Thus, when &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> cannot be disposed of and ER expansion is unrestrained, IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK apparently commit to a pro-apoptotic role. Successful homeostatic readjustment of the ER entailed that signaling through IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK subsided to a submaximal level after an acute but transient phase of maximal signaling (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref></italic></bold>,<bold><italic>C</italic></bold>). In contrast, ablation of ERAD caused IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK to chronically signal at maximal levels when &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> was expressed (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref></italic></bold>). In line with the vast ER expansion we witnessed under those conditions (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref></italic></bold>), BiP levels augmented a further &#x223C;2-fold when ERAD was inhibited but to no avail, since &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> levels underwent an even greater, &#x223C;3-fold, rise, likely resulting in a relative shortage of BiP (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref></italic></bold>), which suggests once more that maximal activation of the UPR transducers coincides with BiP running short.</p>

Indeed, when &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> was expressed in bulk, it transiently provoked decay of <italic>BLOS1</italic> mRNA, which is indicative of IRE1&#x03B1; having committed to RIDD activity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hollien et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>). Yet, RIDD activity was unabated upon chronic &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression only when also ERAD was ablated, and, therefore, ER homeostatic readjustment failed (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>To confirm in a direct manner that RIDD activity accounts for IRE1&#x03B1;-provoked loss of cell growth, we exploited that the IRE1&#x03B1; KO cells that had been reconstituted with IRE1&#x03B1;-GFP allow to titrate levels of IRE1&#x03B1;-GFP by Dox.

<p>Loss of cell growth instead correlated well with the extent of RIDD activity (as measured by decay of <italic>BLOS1</italic> mRNA) that was caused by the overexpression of IRE1&#x03B1;-GFP (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref></italic></bold>), and RIDD activity and loss of growth were further enhanced when XBP1 was silenced (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A,B,E</xref></italic></bold>). These findings confirm that RIDD activity is triggered by unconstrained activation of IRE1&#x03B1; and support that RIDD activity of IRE1&#x03B1; is sufficient for provoking apoptosis, as reported (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Oslowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lerner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). Importantly, <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing activity and RIDD activity are not mutually exclusive. Instead, IRE1&#x03B1; seems to switch from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic activity, simply when it is in short supply of its preferred substrate unspliced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA whether due to silencing or because most <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA is already spliced.</p>
<p>Earlier reports have shown that when IRE1&#x03B1; is activated and phosphorylated it can engage various pro-apoptotic pathways (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref></italic></bold>), for instance by recruiting the adaptor molecule TRAF2 that then can couple IRE1&#x03B1; to ASK1. ASK1 in turn can activate JNK, a transcription factor that heralds cell death (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Urano et al., 2000</xref></italic></bold>). Alternatively or in parallel, TRAF2 reportedly couples IRE1&#x03B1; phosphorylation with caspase-7 and caspase-12 activation, which likewise promote apoptosis (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yoneda et al., 2001</xref></italic></bold>). We then reconstituted the IRE1&#x03B1; KO cells with an endonuclease activity deficient (N906A; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Han et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>) mutant of IRE1&#x03B1;-GFP, which upon Tm treatment was phosphorylated despite its lack of splicing activity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref></italic></bold>) and which clustered into foci (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref></italic></bold>) to a similar extent as wild-type IRE1&#x03B1; &#x0391; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref></italic></bold>), but did not provoke loss of cell growth even upon substantial overexpression (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11H</xref>,I</italic></bold>). These findings further support that IRE1&#x03B1; commits to a pro-apoptotic role exclusively by means of RIDD.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>By avoiding the use of ER stress-eliciting drugs that have cytotoxic side effects, we have created a cell model that allowed us to reevaluate several aspects of how cells respond to an accumulating load of client protein in the ER. First, our results highlight that the UPR predominantly acts as a pro-survival pathway. Namely, by confronting cells with a proteostatic stimulus (i.e. bulk &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression) that these cells could well cope with, we confirmed that the UPR is key for their capacity to do so. Yet, the finding that &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression readily causes cells to undergo apoptosis in the absence of these UPR transducers, implies that other, as yet unknown ER stress-induced mechanisms can be invoked to mediate cell death, which may well play such a role also when the UPR is functional. For instance, hyperoxidizing conditions in the lumen of the ER activate NADPH oxidases, leading to efflux of radical oxygen species to the cytosol that may cause activation of pro-apoptotic pathways (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Second, our data confirm that the UPR drives ER expansion, which&#x2014;in agreement with earlier reports on non-secretory cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>)&#x2014;mainly relied on the ATF6&#x03B1; branch in the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> model. Interestingly, ER expansion is not necessarily provoked by bulk synthesis of client proteins <italic>per se</italic>, but rather by their accumulation, as co-expression of sufficient quantities of IgL led to bulk secretion of IgM, but failed to trigger a strong UPR, and, thus, did not result in augmented BiP production (which served as a proxy for ER expansion). Our findings indicate moreover that the ER folding machinery seems to be underused in HeLa cells. Apparently, mobilization of the default ER folding machinery is sufficient for a task that can be productively executed, such as the folding and assembly of IgM from subunits that are expressed in bulk but in the correct stoichiometry. In most cells the basal size of the ER and its folding capacity indeed may exceed the need for folding assistance from the default secretory burden. In line with such a notion, a substantial fraction of BiP is kept in reserve in an inactive, AMPylated form under non-ER stress conditions (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Preissler et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>ERAD genes are UPR targets, and, accordingly, ERAD activity increased in the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> model such that it kept pace with the increasing &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> influx in the sense that ERAD sustained a remarkably constant <italic>t</italic>&#x00BD; of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> regardless of its expression levels. It has been argued that kinetics of ERAD are tuned such that a delay in their disposal offers incompletely folded or assembled ER clients a grace period to mature after all (<bold><italic>Ellgaard and Helenius, 2001</italic></bold>). The inadvertent consequence of ERAD&#x2019;s leniency is that ER clients accumulate if they never will reach maturity, such as orphan &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>, causing ER expansion. It recently has become clear that autophagy can serve to curtail ER expansion (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pengo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fumagalli et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>), but in our model disposal of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> appeared to be exclusively afforded through ERAD, and, even when ERAD was inhibited, we found no indications that autophagy contributed as a backup to hold excess &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression in check. This finding implies that specific signals are required for activation of ER-phagy, which are not engendered when &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> accumulates in the ER of HeLa cells.</p>
<p>Third, our results highlight that a shortage of BiP in matching the accumulating load of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> correlated with maximal UPR activation, rather than accumulation of client protein in the ER <italic>per se</italic>. Indeed, the transitioning of UPR signaling to chronic submaximal levels coincided with the ER becoming dominated by BiP. Our findings are in line with the idea&#x2014;which was first coined by David Ron and colleagues (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref></italic></bold>)&#x2014;that sequestering of BiP by ER clients (such as &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>) is key for activating the UPR, since activation of the main three UPR sensors, IRE1&#x03B1;, PERK (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref></italic></bold>) and ATF6&#x03B1; (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shen et al., 2002</xref></italic></bold>) goes hand in hand with BiP dissociation from their luminal ER stress sensing domains, while overexpression of BiP dampens UPR activation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref></italic></bold>). Accordingly, the PiZ mutant of &#x03B1;1-antitrypsin despite its accumulation in the ER does not sequester BiP and fails to trigger the UPR (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Graham et al., 1990</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Based on the crystal structure of yeast Ire1&#x2019;s lumenal domain (<bold><italic>Credle et al., 2006</italic></bold>) Peter Walter and colleagues proposed that Ire1 activates through direct binding of unfolded proteins, for which evidence has been obtained in the meantime (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref></italic></bold>). While we cannot exclude that ATF6&#x03B1;, IRE1&#x03B1; and/or PERK directly interact with &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>, it unlikely would be the main, let alone exclusive, mechanism of UPR activation, as it is difficult to envision how the interaction between &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> and the UPR transducers would diminish during chronic &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>-driven ER stress when &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> is more abundant in the ER than any other protein except for BiP. A recent study, moreover, supports that sequestering of BiP by &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> indeed is sufficient to activate IRE1&#x03B1; and PERK (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Carrara et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Our choice to employ &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> as a proteostatic insult to challenge the ER was in fact motivated also by the reasoning that if there ever would be an ER client protein to be excellent in sequestering BiP, it would be &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Haas and Wabl, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bole et al., 1986</xref></italic></bold>). Furthermore, it is well-conceivable that even the slightest leakiness of unpaired &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> from the ER has been evolutionarily selected against. Since antigen recognition likely is compromised if &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> is released from the cell when unaccompanied by &#x03BB;, it potentially would lead to ill-fated off-target effects. Thus, BiP binding to &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> must be highly stringent out of immunological necessity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Anelli and van Anken, 2013</xref></italic></bold>), which correlates with the fact that mutations in &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> that lead to lowered affinity for BiP are associated with disorders of the immune system, such as lymphoproliferative heavy chain disease or myeloma (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hendershot et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anelli and Sitia, 2010</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Apparently to ascertain stringent ER retention of the accumulating load of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>, the pool of BiP and the ER at large indeed expanded to an impressive extent, in particular when ERAD was inhibited. In fact, the excessive ER expansion in the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> model upon preventing ERAD of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> is reminiscent of that in plasma cells. In the course of B to plasma cell differentiation all cellular machineries change to anticipate bulk IgM production (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">van Anken et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>). Conversely, the purely &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>-driven stimulus we investigated in this study resulted almost exclusively in ER expansion. We found only meager indications even for expansion of the remainder of the secretory machinery (<bold><italic>Supplementary File 1</italic></bold>). The stringent retention of &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> in the ER indeed obviates the need for reinforcing the secretory pathway downstream of the ER. Accordingly, homeostatic regulation of the Golgi and beyond appears to be governed foremost by dedicated signaling mechanisms other than the UPR (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Luini and Parashuraman, 2016</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Our findings furthermore provide insight into two important aspects of ER stress signaling that are relevant for disease. First, various genetic disorders stem from mutations in ER client proteins that lead to their misfolding and accumulation in the ER. Based on our results, cells that suffer from such conditions will likely display submaximal UPR signaling levels similar to what we found for chronic &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> expression, as prolonged maximal UPR signaling correlates with invoking pro-apoptotic pathways. Thus, in cells or tissues that express a mutant or orphan protein that accumulates in the ER, submaximal UPR signaling is not a sign of &#x201C;mild&#x201D; ER stress, but rather reflects that the stress these cells suffer from has been sub-lethal, such that they have adapted to the stress that is chronic, although the stress likely still predisposes cells to succumb.</p>
<p>Second, our data emphasize that in the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> model IRE1&#x03B1; commits to a pro-apoptotic role through RIDD activity rather than through processing of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA or through IRE1&#x03B1; being in a phosphorylated state, which may play role in other cells instead (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tabas and Ron 2011</xref></italic></bold>). Importantly, little if any RIDD activity accompanied successful homeostatic readjustment of the ER. IRE1&#x03B1; activity <italic>per se</italic> contributed marginally to successful ER homeostatic readjustment. Thus, in the HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> model RIDD activity unlikely serves any protective role, neither by decreasing the burden on the ER folding machinery by depleting mRNA pools encoding for ER client proteins (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hollien et al., 2009</xref></italic></bold>) nor by degrading specific target mRNAs, such as has been shown for death receptor 5 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). Unrestrained RNase activity of IRE1&#x03B1; against RNA targets other than <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA may in itself cause a plethora of problems to the cell that ultimately lead to activation of pro-apoptotic pathways. Yet, RIDD activity reportedly also invokes cell death in a selective manner through cleavage of various microRNAs (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Upton et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>). Particularly intriguing is RIDD-controled decay of miR17, as it leads to the stabilization of the mRNA encoding TXNIP (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lerner et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>). Since TXNIP is upregulated at the same time through PERK and its downstream effector ATF5 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Oslowski et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>), PERK and IRE1&#x03B1; pathways converge in promoting apoptosis via TXNIP-driven triggering of the NLRP3 inflammosome and ensuing caspase activation. Ablation of this signaling relay in fact prevents ER stress-induced apoptosis in pancreatic &#x03B2; cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Oslowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lerner et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Altogether, a dichotomy emerges between IRE1&#x03B1;&#x2019;s splicing activity being pro-survival and its RIDD activity being pro-apoptotic. Strategies that would selectively inhibit or promote either of IRE1&#x03B1;&#x2019;s activities therefore would hold therapeutic promise. Indeed, it has been proposed that IRE1&#x03B1; transitions from pro-survival <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing activity to pro-apoptotic RIDD activity by virtue of a switch in its enzymatic activity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Maurel et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). Our data indicate however that once IRE1&#x03B1; commits to RIDD activity, <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing activity is still unabated, which argues against any such switch. Instead, we argue that IRE1&#x03B1;&#x2019;s endonuclease activity is unleashed against other RNA substrates simply because IRE1&#x03B1;&#x2019;s preferred substrate, unspliced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA, is running low. Such a scenario would be attractive also to explain how the extent of ER expansion is capped depending on the maximal levels of UPR specific transcription factors, in particular ATF6&#x03B1;-p50 and XBP1 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>), that can be mobilized to drive ER expansion. If <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing levels are already maximal but the UPR driven ER expansion still cannot keep pace with the increasing demand on the ER folding machinery, IRE1&#x03B1; activity is directed to other RNA substrates and thus automatically commits to RIDD to invoke pro-apoptotic pathways.</p>
<p>Along these lines, levels of ATF6&#x03B1;, IRE1&#x03B1; and <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA could serve as key determinants in defining the maximal extent of ER expansion and sensitivity to ER stress of a given cell. Indeed, transcript levels of ATF6&#x03B1; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/atf6">http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/atf6</ext-link>) and of IRE1&#x03B1; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/ern1">http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/ern1</ext-link>) differ between cell types by approximately one order, while XBP1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/xbp1">http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/xbp1</ext-link>) differs by more than two orders of magnitude. The ratio of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA to IRE1&#x03B1; levels is much higher in secretory tissues than in non-secretory cells. As such, quasi-inexhaustible supplies of spliceable <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA increase the threshold for IRE1&#x03B1; to commit to RIDD, thereby protecting secretory cells better against ER expansion-induced apoptosis, while affording through the XBP1 protein further reinforcement of the ER folding capacity. Pro-apoptotic RIDD activity may be even further avoided by fueling IRE1&#x03B1;&#x2019;s endonuclease with a decoy RNA in case no unspliced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA is left. For instance, &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> mRNA in plasma cells becomes a RIDD target once XBP1 is ablated (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Benhamron et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). Following the same reasoning, non-secretory cells would be highly susceptible to RIDD-driven cell death, since the stocks of unspliced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA will more readily run short. If these cells&#x2014;uncharacteristically&#x2014;expand their ER too much, RIDD provides a means for self-censorship. An attractive therapeutic avenue against RIDD-driven cell death therefore would be to employ a competitive inhibitor or decoy substrate for which IRE1&#x03B1; has an affinity that is outmatched only by its affinity for unspliced <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA.</p>

Similarly, a reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator (rtTA) cassette (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhou et al., 2006</xref></italic></bold>) under control of a bidirectional promoter with &#x0394;LNGFR in the reverse orientation for selection purposes (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amendola et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>) on a lentiviral vector was employed to render cells Tet (and thus Dox) responsive. A pGene5b (GeneSwitch system; Invitrogen) encoding lentiviral construct (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sirin and Park, 2003</xref></italic></bold>)&#x2014;another kind gift from Dr. Frank Parker&#x2014;was used as backbone to place either Ig&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> or Ig&#x03BB; under control of the GAL4 promoter. The coding sequences for NP-specific murine &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> and &#x03BB; were derived from plasmids described elsewhere (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sitia et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fagioli and Sitia, 2001</xref></italic></bold>). pENTR223.1 #100061599 bearing murine IRE1&#x03B1; cDNA was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. GFP was placed in frame at the same position in the juxtamembrane cytosolic linker portion of IRE1&#x03B1; as described (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2010</xref></italic></bold>). The IRE1&#x03B1;-GFP cassette was placed under control of a TetTight (TetT) responsive element (Clontech) into a lentiviral vector. This construct was mutagenized to harbor the N906A substitution in the endonuclease domain of IRE1&#x03B1; to obtain an RNase dead version of IRE1&#x03B1;-GFP (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Upton et al., 2012</xref></italic></bold>). The APEX2 coding sequence (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lam et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>), derived from the #49385 plasmid (Addgene), and modified to contain in frame extensions encoding the vitronectin signal peptide at the N-terminus and the tetrapeptide KDEL at the C-terminus, was placed under control of a TetT promoter into the same lentiviral vector as employed for IRE1&#x03B1;-GFP. Standard techniques were used for construction, transformation and purification of plasmids. Transgene cassettes were genomically integrated in a subsequent manner into HeLa S3 cells by lentiviral delivery, essentially as described (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amendola et al., 2005</xref></italic></bold>).

<p>To assess growth, cells were counted with a Burker chamber, and seeded in 24-multiwell plates in 1:5 serial dilutions (5000, 1000, and 200 cells per well) to grow for 7 days. Culture media and pharmacological agents were refreshed every 2-3 days. Cells were fixed in methanol-acetone (1:1) for 10 min, stained with 0.5&#x0025; crystal violet in 20&#x0025; methanol for 10 min and washed with distilled water. Dried plates were densitometrically scanned at a resolution of 50-100 &#x00B5;m with a Typhoon FLA-9000 reader (GE Healthcare), employing the 647 nm laser and the photomultiplier 1000. Intensity of crystal violet staining was analyzed with ImageJ for quantitation of growth. Typically, wells originally seeded with 1000 cells were used for comparison of signal intensity between conditions. An empty well on the same plate served for background subtraction. As a measure for apoptosis the percentage of Annexin V positive cells was recorded by use of a standard detection assay (APC-Annexin V, BD Biosciences) on a Canto cytometer (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturers&#x2019; instructions.</p>

<p>Detection of fluorescent antibody signals on blots was performed by scanning with the Typhoon FLA-9000 reader, except for IRE1&#x03B1; and ATF6&#x03B1;, which were detected on films using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham). Signal intensities were analyzed with Image J. For absolute quantitation of BiP and &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> protein levels standard &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> and BiP curves were obtained. To that end we used purified mouse myeloma derived IgM (#02-6800, Invitrogen), of which we estimated 70&#x0025; of the protein mass to be &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>, and purified recombinant hamster BiP, which safe for two conservative changes, Y313F and A649S, is identical in sequence to human BiP and therefore, in all likelihood, is recognized equally well by the goat anti-BiP antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz). Recombinant BiP was expressed and purified as described (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Marcinowski et al., 2011</xref></italic></bold>) from a pPROEX expression construct that was a kind gift from Dr. Johannes Buchner.

<p>Cells harboring APEX2-KDEL were fixed in 1&#x0025; glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 30 min, and incubated for 20 min with 0.3 mg/ml DAB, and for 20 min with 0.03&#x0025; H2O2 (to activate APEX) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), all at room temperature. Samples were rinsed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), and post-fixed with 1.5&#x0025; potassium ferrocyanide, 1&#x0025; OsO4, sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 1 hr on ice. After en bloc staining with 0.5&#x0025; uranyl acetate overnight at 4&#x00B0;C in the dark, samples were dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol, embedded in EPON and cured in an oven at 60&#x00B0;C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (70 &#x2013; 90 nm) were obtained using an ultramicrotome (UC7, Leica microsystem, Vienna, Austria), collected, stained once more with uranyl acetate and Sato&#x2019;s lead solutions, and visualized in a transmission electron microscope (Leo 912AB, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Digital micrographs were taken with a 2Kx2K bottom mounted slow-scan camera (ProScan, Lagerlechfeld, Germany) controlled by the EsivisionPro 3.2 software (Soft Imaging System, M&#x00FC;nster, Germany). Images of randomly selected cells (10 for each condition) were acquired at a nominal magnification of 1840x. Using ImageJ software, cytoplasmic regions were selected manually and ER profiles, thanks to the electron-dense DAB precipitate, were segmented by means of an automatic macro based on threshold intensity, yielding the percentage of the area within the cytoplasm that was ER. For simplicity we used the formula: volume (&#x0025;) = (area (&#x0025;))<sup>3/2</sup>&#x2014;which would be fully accurate only if the ER were cuboidal, but which we considered a good approximation nonetheless&#x2014;to obtain a rough estimate of the ER volume.</p>

<p>SILAC heavy and light collected serum-free cell media were mixed proportionally to a 1:1 cell number ratio, lysed with 8 M Urea 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, and proteins were quantified by Bradford. About 5 &#x03BC;g of mixed proteins for each sample were reduced by TCEP, alkylated by chloroacetamide, digested by Lys-C and trypsin (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kulak et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>), and peptides were desalted on StageTip C18 (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rappsilber et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>). Samples were analyzed in duplo on a LC&#x2013;ESI&#x2013;MS-MS quadrupole Orbitrap QExactive-HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides separation was achieved on a linear gradient from 93&#x0025; solvent A (2&#x0025; ACN, 0.1&#x0025; formic acid) to 60&#x0025; solvent B (80&#x0025; acetonitrile, 0.1&#x0025; formic acid) over 110 min and from 60 to 100&#x0025; solvent B in 8 min at a constant flow rate of 0.25</p>

Woburn, MA, USA), packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 &#x03BC;m beads (Dr Maisch Gmbh, Ammerbuch, Germany) using a high-pressure bomb loader (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark). MS data were acquired using a data-dependent top 20 method for HCD fragmentation. Survey full scan MS spectra (300&#x2013;1650 Th) were acquired in the Orbitrap with 60000 resolution, AGC target 3<sup>e6</sup>, IT 20 ms. For HCD spectra, resolution was set to 15000 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 200, AGC target 1<sup>e5</sup>, IT 80 ms; NCE 28&#x0025; and isolation width 2.0 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>.

Cysteine carbamidomethyl was used as fixed modification, methionine oxidation and protein <italic>N</italic>-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. Mass deviation for MS-MS peaks was set at 20 ppm. The peptides and protein false discovery rates (FDR) were set to 0.01; the minimal length required for a peptide was six amino acids; a minimum of two peptides and at least one unique peptide were required for high-confidence protein identification.</p>
<p>The lists of identified proteins were filtered to eliminate known contaminants and reverse hits. Normalized H/L ratios were analyzed via Perseus (version 1.5.0.6). Statistical analysis was performed using the Significance B outlier test where statistical significance based on magnitude fold-change was established at p &#x003C; 0.05. To look for proteins that changed over time we considered Intensity L and Intensity H normalized by the correspondent Summed Intensity and the statistical ANOVA test analysis was done using Perseus (ver. 1.5.0.6) with p &#x003C; 0.01. All proteomic data as raw files, total proteins, and peptides identified with relative intensities and search parameters have been loaded into Peptide Atlas repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://PASS01009:PJ3566i@ftp.peptideatlas.org/">ftp://PASS01009:PJ3566i@ftp.peptideatlas.org/</ext-link>). To obtain approximations for absolute protein quantities we followed a MaxLFQ label-free quantification strategy, as described (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cox et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). We then assessed the relative abundance of total protein per subcellular compartment, i.e. cytosol, nucleus, mitochondrion, ER, and other organelles, as well as &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>, as well as the relative abundance of protein species, including or excluding &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub>, within the ER as detailed in the legend of <bold><italic>Supplementary File 1</italic></bold>.</p>

<p>Translation is transiently attenuated upon &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> overexpression to a marginal extent. HeLa-&#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> cells were induced with 0.5 nM Mif to express &#x03BC;<sub>s</sub> for the indicated times, or treated with 4 &#x03BC;M Tg for 45 min before they were pulse labeled for 10 min with <sup>35</sup>S labeled methionine and cysteine for 10 min at the indicated times after induction, as in <bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref></italic></bold>. Lysates were separated by gel electrophoresis and total proteins were visualized by Coomassie, while radio-labeled proteins were detected and quantified by phosphor imaging. Labeling efficiency was compared to that in cells before induction, which was set at 100&#x0025;.</p></caption>
