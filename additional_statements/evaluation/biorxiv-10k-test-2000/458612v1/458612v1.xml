<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The neurotrophin &#x03B2;-Nerve Growth Factor (&#x03B2;-NGF) is flourishing as a protein with important roles in the ovulation induction process in induced-ovulation species but data in rabbits are still inconclusive, probably due to the species-specificity effect of the neurotrophin to trigger the ovulation. Moreover, &#x03B2;-NGF seems to have a role in sperm function. To clarify these functionalities we aimed, in the present research: 1) to newly synthesize a functional recombinant &#x03B2;-NGF from rabbit (rr&#x03B2;-NGF), 2) to reveal differences in the amino acid sequence of rabbit &#x03B2;-NGF compared to other sequences of induced and spontaneous ovulator species, and 3) to assess the effects of rr&#x03B2;-NGF on sperm viability and motility. The nucleotide sequence of <italic>NGF</italic> from rabbit prostate was sequenced by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) and annotated in GenBank (KX528686). Then, rr&#x03B2;-NGF was produced in CHO cells and purified by affinity chromatography. Western blot and MALDI-TOF analyses confirmed the correct identity of the recombinant protein. rr&#x03B2;-NGF functionality was validated in PC12 cells through a successful dose-response effect along 8 days. The comparison of the amino acid sequences of NGF between rabbit and other species suggested some relevant substitutions at its binding site to both the high-(TrkA) and the low-(p75) affinity receptors. The addition of rr&#x03B2;-NGF in rabbit sperm, in a time- and dose-response study, did not affect its viability but slightly changed some of its motility parameters at the highest concentration used (100 ng/ml). Thus, it can be considered that this new recombinant protein may be used for biotechnological and reproduction assisted techniques in ovulation-induced species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Beta Nerve Growth Factor (&#x03B2;-NGF) is a neurotrophin first described for its function in survival and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Similar to many other growth factors, &#x03B2;-NGF is synthesized as a precursor (pro-NGF), which is a 241-residue protein composed by a signal peptide of 18 residues, a pro-peptide of 103 residues and the mature form of 120 residues in the C-terminal end (data extrapolated and generalized from human &#x03B2;-NGF: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01138">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01138</ext-link>). N-glycosylation of pro-NGF is essential for the processing, secretion and construction of the tertiary fold of the homodimer of &#x03B2;-NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Then, the protein should form a dimer whose correct folding is crucial for the performance of the biological activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the post-translational modifications of the molecule, i.e. three disulfide bonds and the cysteine knot within the two &#x03B2;-NGF chains, are essential for the correct structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Since only intracellular engineering of mammalian cells is able to efficiently generate all these modifications, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells have been used elsewhere for the recombinant production of human and mouse &#x03B2;-NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], resulting in biologically active proteins.</p>
<p>&#x03B2;-NGF achieves its function when it binds to its high-affinity receptor, TrkA, present in a wide range of cells, such as neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] or cells of sexual organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], developing different actions depending on where is located. This receptor is also present in the cell surface of PC12 cells, a cell line derived from pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla, extensively used for testing the biological activity of &#x03B2;-NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. These cells respond to &#x03B2;-NGF and they turned from proliferating chromaffin-like cells to non-dividing sympathetic-neuron-like cells that extend axons or neurites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. This effect is produced when &#x03B2;-NGF binds to TrkA and mediates signaling cascades, such as ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, &#x03B2;-NGF has been identified as the ovulation-inducing factor (OIF) in the seminal plasma of some species of reflexive ovulation, as camelids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In rabbits, another induced ovulatory species, the protein and its receptors (TrkA and p75) have been identified in all reproductive male and female tissues (testes, epididymis and accessory glands of male rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and uterus, oviduct and ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]) as well as in seminal plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. However, there are no studies which demonstrate that &#x03B2;-NGF is the OIF in this species, although some kind of ovarian response in terms of the increase of hemorrhagic follicles (non-ruptured anovulatory follicles full of blood) have been evidenced using &#x03B2;-NGF of murine species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], or rabbit SP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] intramuscularly injected. Although &#x03B2;-NGF is a highly conserved protein among species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], a detailed comparison analysis of the amino acid sequences between induced- and spontaneous-ovulation species, could help to identify different ovulation patterns among species.</p>
<p>In addition, &#x03B2;-NGF has been detected in semen in some other species but its role in sperm physiology is barely studied. This neurotrophin has been localized in round spermatids and spermatocytes in the reproductive tract in mouse and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and it is suggested to intervene in sperm maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. In ejaculated sperm, &#x03B2;-NGF promotes sperm motility and viability in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], bulls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and golden hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], and facilitates the acrosome reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. In rabbits, there are no studies about the effects of &#x03B2;-NGF in the seminal characteristics of ejaculated semen.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that specific substitutions within the amino acid sequence of &#x03B2;-NGF from rabbit may be relevant for its different physiological action and, consequently, the production and use of a homologous recombinant rabbit &#x03B2;-NGF can help to enlighten the specific role of this multi-functional protein as an OIF in this species. Moreover, the potential use of exogenous &#x03B2;-NGF in the seminal dose could be an assisted reproductive procedure to reduce the handling and costs at the insemination time in reflex ovulator species but effect in semen must be contrasted. In this context, the aims of the present study were: 1) to produce and purify recombinant &#x03B2;-NGF from the rabbit prostate amino acid sequence, verifying its biological activity in PC12 cells, 2) to compare and analyze &#x03B2;-NGF amino acid sequences from several representative species of induced and spontaneous ovulation, and 3) to assess recombinant &#x03B2;-NGF effects in sperm viability and motility in a dose-response study. All these aims were achieved; the protein was produced and purified and their effect in semen was successfully tested. Some relevant differences were found in the comparison of the &#x03B2;-NGF amino acid sequence among rabbit and the other species studied.</p>

<title>Animals, tissue extraction and processing</title>
<p>New Zealand White x California adult male rabbits were housed individually in flat-deck cages with a light program consisted of 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness, at 20 to 25 &#x00B0;C of temperature and a relative humidity of 60 to 75&#x0025; maintained by a forced ventilation system. Each animal had free access to food and water. All the experimental procedures with animals were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM, Spain), and were in compliance with the Spanish guidelines for care and use of animals in research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Animals (n=3) were euthanized and ventral media laparotomy was performed. Prostate complex was dissected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]; the proprostate was discarded and the prostate part was recovered. Portions of 5 mm were collected in 1.5 mL tubes containing RNA later&#x00AE; Stabilization Solution (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA) to avoid RNA degradation. RNA later&#x00AE; was removed from tubes after being at 4&#x00B0; C overnight and samples were stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0; C.</p>

<title>Complementary DNA sequencing of rabbit prostate &#x03B2;-NGF</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, the cDNA sequence from rabbit prostate was not published, thus we proceeded to sequence it. Therefore, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA), and then mRNA was obtained with FastTrack&#x00AE; MAG mRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Afterwards, cDNA was synthesized using a mix of random hexamers (0.5 &#x03BC;g/&#x03BC;L) and oligo (dT) primers (0.1 &#x03BC;g/&#x03BC;L) (SuperScript&#x2122; First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR, Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA).</p>
<p>Firstly, to sequence the entire <italic>NGF</italic> gene, specific primers were designed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) for a highly conserved region of the gene among species. The design was performed taking into account that <italic>NGF</italic> presents alternative splicing; hence, amino acid and nucleotide sequences of different species were aligned (Clustal Omega Software and Serial Cloner 2.6 Software) to look for the conserved region. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using 1 &#x03BC;l of cDNA as a template for <italic>&#x03B2;-NGF</italic> specific primers, using the Platinum&#x00AE; Taq DNA Polymerase kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA). Cycling conditions consisted of one first phase of 3 min for denaturation at 95 &#x00B0;C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 seconds at 95 &#x00B0;C, 30 s at 55 &#x00B0;C and 15 s at 72 &#x00B0;C, and a final phase of 5 min at 72 &#x00B0;C to allow elongation. Negative control without reverse transcriptase was performed in PCR, in order to discard genomic DNA contamination. A 2 &#x0025; agarose gel was used to visualize the size of bands of the PCR products (10 &#x03BC;l per lane) by a scanner (Bio-Rad Laboratories, California, USA). The amplified products of 305 pb were purified from the agarose gel with SpeedTools PCR Clean-up kit (Biotools, B&#x0026;M Labs, S.A., Madrid, Spain) and sequenced by Sanger method using the BigDyeTM Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA) in a 3730XL DNA Analyzer sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA).</p>

<p>Once sequenced the conserved region of <italic>NGF</italic>, the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) procedure was used to obtain the 5&#x2019; and 3&#x2019; sequences, based on Frohman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] using SMARTer&#x00AE; RACE 5&#x2019;/3&#x2019; kit (Clontech Laboratories, California, USA). Inner and outer primers were designed following the kit protocol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), as well as the cycling conditions of PCRs, using a melting temperature of 68&#x00B0; C.</p>

<title>Plasmid production and transfection</title>
<p>Our rabbit prostate <italic>NGF</italic> sequence (KX528686) with a 7 &#x00D7; histidine tag in the C-terminal end was inserted in a pD2539-CEF plasmid with kanamycin and puromycin resistance (DNA 2.0, California, USA). Plasmid was produced in large quantities in bacterial cells (Stellar&#x2122; Competent Cells, ClonTech Laboratories, California, USA) using LB medium containing 25 &#x03BC;g/ml of kanamycin. They were incubated at 37&#x00B0; C by shaking during 24 h. Plasmid was extracted by Megaprep (PureLink&#x00AE; HiPure Plasmid Megaprep Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA) and then precipitated with isopropanol/ethanol. The resulting DNA was cut with the restriction enzyme Sal I to linearize the plasmid and then transfected with Lipofectamine&#x00AE; 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA) into Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells (ATCC, Virginia, USA).</p>

<sec id="s2a4">
<title>CHO cells culture and protein purification</title>
<p>Transfected CHO cells were firstly cultivated in F12 medium supplemented with HEPES 25 mM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA), 10&#x0025; fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco&#x00AE; One Shot FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA), 125 &#x03BC;g/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA) and 5 &#x03BC;g/ml puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA). Afterwards, 500,000 viable cells/ml were subcultured in a T-160 cc flask (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA) in Serum Free Medium (CHO-S-SFM II, with hypoxanthine and thymidine, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA) supplemented with 50 &#x03BC;g/ml gentamicin and 5 &#x03BC;g/ml puromycin for 4 days and shaken on a shaker platform. All cell cultures were incubated in a humidified incubator (NuAire, Minnesota, USA) at 37&#x00B0;C and 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Recombinant rabbit &#x03B2;-NGF (rr&#x03B2;-NGF) purification from the culture medium was made by affinity chromatography, using columns containing Nickel (HisXL-Column High Density NICKEL, Agarose Bead Technology, Florida, USA) in order to select only those proteins with the histidine tag. Columns were equilibrated with 5 column bed volume of binding buffer (20 mM disodium phosphate, 500 mMNaCl, 10 mM imidazole at pH 7.5) and culture media was added, keeping in contact with the resin for 15 min. Then, after several washes of the column with binding buffer, the protein was eluted in 10 mL of elution buffer (20 mM Disodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM Imidazole) and then dialyzed in HEPES 10 &#x03BC;M for PC12 bioassay, or in phosphate buffer saline 0.01M (PBS tablet, Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) for rabbit sperm bioassay in order to maintain semen viability. Dialysis was performed by shaking at 4&#x00B0; C, changing the medium 3 times with a minimum of 3 h dialyzing per time. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s2a5">
<title>Western Blot analysis</title>
<p>To verify the presence of rr&#x03B2;-NGF, aliquots of dialyzed protein were subjected to TCA-acetone precipitation and then denatured in loading buffer (0.312 M Tris-HCl, 10&#x0025; SDS, 25&#x0025; 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01&#x0025; bromophenol blue, 50&#x0025; glycerol) at 95&#x00B0;C. Afterwards, they were loaded on 12&#x0025; SDS-PAGE gels and were run at 90 V for 2 h. One gel was stained using Coomassie (Sigma Aldrich, Missouri, USA) and the other one was used to transfer the protein to a nitrocellulose membrane (Ammersham<sup>TM</sup> Hybond ECL Nitrocellulose Membrane, GE Healthcare Life Science, Barcelona, Spain) (80 mA per membrane for 80 min). Membrane was blocked during 1 h using Odyssey&#x00AE; Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Nebraska, USA), and then incubated at 4&#x00B0;C overnight with goat anti-NGF antibody (0.1 &#x03BC;g/mL) (N8773, Sigma-Aldrich) in blocking buffer with 0. 1&#x0025; Tween 20. After several washes, membranes were incubated at room temperature (RT) for 1 h with secondary antibody (IRDye&#x00AE; 800CW Donkey anti-Goat IgG (H &#x002B; L), LI-COR Biosciences, Nebraska, USA). After several washes, membranes were scanned with an Odyssey fluorescence scanner (LI-COR Bioscience, Nebraska, USA).</p>

<title>MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis</title>
<p>For mass spectrometry analysis, SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining were performed with the synthesized protein as described above, and gel bands of 13-15 kDa were manually excised from gels.

<title>PC12 cell culture</title>
<p>For PC12 cells culture, cells were thawed at 37&#x00B0;C, centrifuged at 1800 x <italic>g</italic> 5 min to remove DMSO from freezing and then plated in a T-75 cc flask. They were cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, high glucose, HEPES) supplemented with 0.2 mM pyruvate, 10&#x0025; horse serum (heat inactivated, New Zealand origin), 5&#x0025; FBS and 50 &#x03BC;g/ml of gentamicin. All reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Washington, USA). Medium was changed every 48 h, and cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37&#x00B0;C and 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>. PC12 cells were seed at a density of 15,000 cells/500 &#x03BC;l in 24-well plates and grown for 24 h in a 37&#x00B0;C incubator. Culture media was added every 48 h with different concentrations of rr&#x03B2;-NGF eluted in HEPES 10 &#x03BC;M: 0, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 ng/ml, respectively. Different concentrations were run in triplicates and each experiment was repeated 3 times.</p>

<title>MTT assay</title>
<p>To determine the possible cytotoxicity of rr&#x03B2;-NGF treatment in PC12 cells, we assessed cellular viability at 48 h using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, M6494, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Washington, USA) assay. After discarding the media of wells, 200 &#x03BC;l of 500 &#x03BC;g/ml MTT in Locke medium (140 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 5.5 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES) were added in each well and incubated for 2 h at 37&#x00B0;C. Then, 200 &#x03BC;l of solubilization buffer (0.1 M HCl, 1&#x0025; Triton X-100 in isopropanol) were added and incubated for 1 h at RT to solubilize the formazan crystals. Sterile cell scrapers (Lab Clinics, Barcelona, Spain) were used to scratch the wells and the volume of each well was collected in tubes containing 0.9 mL of distilled water. The optical density (OD) of each sample was then measured at 560 nm using UltroSpec III spectrophotometer (Pharmacia LKB, GE Healthcare Life Science, Barcelona, Spain). The data were analyzed in terms of the percentage of cell viability, calculated by the equation: (OD treated cells / OD not treated cells) &#x00D7; 100.</p>

Twenty five ng/ml rr&#x03B2;-NGF (the best concentration found in the previous analyses) were added 24 h after the beginning of the cell culture and changed every 48 h. At Day 8 of treatment, the medium was removed and cells were washed with 0.1M PBS (16 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O, 84 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>), fixed in 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT and treated with 0.1&#x0025; Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT to permeabilize the cell membrane. After several washes, cells were blocked with 10&#x0025; FBS in PBS for 45 min at RT to avoid non-specific binding and then, incubated with mAb against &#x03B2;-III tubulin (ab52623, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 1:50 dilution and 4&#x00B0;C overnight. Next, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG H&#x0026;L (Alexa Fluor&#x00AE; 488) secondary antibody (ab150081, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:500 for 1h at RT.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present work, we have sequenced <italic>NGF-mRNA</italic> from rabbit prostate and produced and purified its corresponding recombinant rabbit &#x03B2;-NGF, which was able to differentiate PC12 cells into neuron-like cells. The comparison of the amino acid sequence of rabbit NGF with other induced and spontaneous-ovulator species has revealed species-specific differences, mainly in the receptor binding sites. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of the addition of this neurotrophin to rabbit sperm with the aim of verify the possibility of its addition in the seminal dose to improve the breeding systems in reflex ovulator species.</p>
<p>One of the challenges in the production of the recombinant proteins is the post-translational modifications, which can be achieved using the intracellular engineering of mammalian cells, such as CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Thus, the transfection of the plasmid containing rabbit &#x03B2;-NGF in these cells resulted in the successful production of the native protein with an appropriate molecular weight (confirmed by western blot) and amino acid sequence (verified by MALDI-TOF), and the proper biological activity (cellular differentiation by neurite proliferation in PC12 cells). rr&#x03B2;-NGF maintained PC12 viability regardless the concentration tested. However, 25 and 50 ng/ml treated cells presented the highest percentages of cell differentiation and neurite/cell during all the study, showing also a higher neurite growth as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. In contrast, Gunning et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] noticed that higher concentrations of mouse &#x03B2;-NGF than those used in the current study (150 ng/ml) can progressively increase the percentage of cells with neurites. Probably, the origin of &#x03B2;-NGF can affect PC12 cells differentiation due to the affinity to TrkA receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Protein sequence of the rabbit &#x03B2;-NGF revealed some changes compared to other species in the binding sites to its receptors. Two consecutive residues Ala-Pro were found in the N-terminal region of rabbit &#x03B2;-NGF important for binding to TrkA, as in all species of induced ovulation. This association may indicate a different strength degree in the union to TrkA, since Pro has a special structure that may facilitate an angle of a greater torsion. Conversely, after this tandem of amino acids, a Ser residue is found in all of the species studied, except in rabbits. This missing residue may be relevant to create a more stable configuration through the torsion facilitated by the previous Pro. Furthermore, two amino acid residues which participate in the recognition of the low-affinity receptor p75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] presented also mutations in the rabbit sequence. Thus, Asn<sup>155</sup> substitutes the conserved Lys, and Lys<sup>158</sup> replaces also a conserved Met. The Lys residue has a positive charge and repels the protonated histidine within the binding site of p75. Its change to Asn residue, which has a neutral charge, may promote a closeness of &#x03B2;-NGF to its low-affinity receptor. We have recently reported the expression and localization of TrkA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] and of p75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] in rabbit male genital tract evidencing that it probably has a role in rabbit reproduction. Despite the presence of these meaningful differences in amino acid sequence located at the binding domains to the receptors, some biological functions of the rabbit &#x03B2;-NGF appeared in parallel to other species. In llama females, rabbit seminal plasma produced ovulation at the same level as llama seminal plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], thus the interaction with the receptor does not seem to be modified in other species. However, llama seminal plasma is not able to elicit the ovulation in rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], so it could indicate that these specific residues found in the rabbit amino acid sequence may explain in part some of the particular physiological characteristics in the rabbit ovulation process. In any case, it has to be taken into consideration the different sexual stimulation to trigger ovulation that occurs in both species and the high number of components of the seminal plasma. Further studies about mechanisms of rabbit &#x03B2;-NGF in the female reproductive tract are needed to elucidate its role.</p>
<p>&#x03B2;-NGF is present in the seminal plasma of several species and its high- and low-affinity receptors have been found in the head and tail of bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] sperm cells. Hence, the addition of &#x03B2;-NGF in semen presumably induces an effect in sperm. In the present study, the viability and the percentage of static sperm were unaffected by rr&#x03B2;-NGF addition. In contrast, the motion pattern of the sperm was influenced in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The highest dose (100 ng/ml) and the longest time (2 h) in rr&#x03B2;-NGF addition study in semen provoked a reduction of sperm progressivity. The data found in other species are hardly comparable to this study since the &#x03B2;-NGF concentrations and times of image captures were not equivalent. Nevertheless, in golden hamster, motility parameters at the time of the supplementation with 100 ng/ml of &#x03B2;-NGF did not seem to be affected compared with sperm without &#x03B2;-NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. In humans, the motility pattern and velocity appear to be improved with &#x03B2;-NGF doses of 1 and 10 &#x03BC;M and with 1 h of incubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. However, it is remarkable that rr&#x03B2;-NGF had not negative effects in the moment of the addition and maintains the sperm viability over time. These findings could be interesting for the use of this neurotrophin in the seminal doses for experimental studies of ovulation or female fertility.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the differentiation of PC12 cells together with the appearance of &#x03B2;-III tubulin and the absence of neurite growth in the presence of TrkA inhibitor confirm that this novel recombinant rabbit &#x03B2;-NGF produced in CHO cells is a functional protein. This protein has some unique amino acid residues in the binding sites of the receptors, which may help to understand some of the particularities in the reproductive physiology of rabbit. In addition, the exogenous addition of rr&#x03B2;-NGF to ejaculated rabbit sperm maintained viability and progressive motility of spermatozoa. Therefore, this new recombinant protein could be potentially used by the intravaginal via to elicit ovulation in rabbits and maybe in other reflex ovulator females.</p>
