<title>Abstract</title>
<p>A current working model is that Alzheimer&#x0027;s disease actively spreads from diseased to healthy neurons, mediated by transfer of extracellular, abnormal, disease-specific forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. It is currently unclear whether transfer of tau between neurons is a toxic gain-of-function process in dementia, or reflects a constitutive biological process. We report two mechanisms of entry of monomeric tau to neurons: a rapid early dynamin-dependent phase, and a second, slower actin-dependent phase, suggesting that monomeric tau enters neurons via rapid saturable clathrin-mediated endocytosis and also by bulk endocytosis. Aggregated tau entry is independent of actin polymerisation and largely dynamin dependent, consistent with clathrin-mediated endocytosis and distinct from macropinocytosis, the major route for aggregated tau entry reported for non-neuronal cells. Anti-tau antibodies abrogate tau entry into neurons, with tau carrying antibody with it into neurons, indicating that antibody binding is insufficient to prevent neuronal tau entry.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) is involved in the pathogenesis of several forms of dementia, including Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in the MAPT gene are causal for some familial forms of FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ghetti et al., 2015</xref>), and the formation of intracellular, hyperphoshorylated aggregates of tau (neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs) is a common pathological feature in AD, FTD and other dementias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kosik et al., 1986</xref>). Disease progression, and clinical severity of symptoms, is associated with a predictable spatial and temporal order of appearance of NFTs in different forebrain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Braak and Braak, 1991</xref>). This has led to the proposal that these diseases actively spread from diseased to healthy neurons in a spatial and temporal progression, mediated by extracellular, abnormal, disease-associated forms of tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Iba et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>It is not currently known if neuronal release and internalisation of extracellular tau are disease-specific phenomena that spread disease through the CNS, or are fundamental physiological processes. <italic>In vivo</italic>, tau protein is present in interstitial fluid of the central nervous system (CNS) and passes into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where is it is found in concentrations of the order of 15pM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Blennow et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Olsson et al., 2005</xref>). Mice transgenic for human tau have 10-fold higher concentrations of tau in brain interstitial fluid than in CSF, which would suggest that the extracellular concentrations of tau in the human brain are in the high picomolar-low nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Yamada et al., 2011</xref>). There is strong evidence for regulated release of non-pathogenic forms tau from healthy neurons, and of tau entry into neurons and non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bright et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kanmert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). There have been conflicting reports about the ability of extracellular monomeric tau to enter cells, whereas aggregated or fibrillar tau has been clearly shown to efficiently enter neurons and other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Frost et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kfoury et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wu et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We used human stem cell-derived neurons to address open questions about the efficiency with which tau enters human neurons, which forms (monomeric and aggregated) of tau enter neurons, and the routes by which they do so. We find that both forms of tau are efficiently taken up by human neurons, by overlapping but distinct mechanisms, consistent with regulated endocytosis. Monomeric tau enters neurons by two different routes and is actively trafficked within the neuron. Tau entry into neurons can be slowed by antibody binding, however, extracellular tau-antibody complexes are internalised into intracellular compartments.</p></sec>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Rapid and efficient entry of extracellular monomeric and aggregated tau into human neurons</title>
<p>We first analysed the ability of monomeric or aggregated tau (P301S) protein to enter human cortical neurons from the extracellular milieu. We used the tau P301S variant, an autosomal dominant mutation that causes early onset FTD with high penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bugiani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Guo et al., 2017</xref>), enabling us to study the transmission of a disease-relevant variant that differs from normal tau by a single amino acid. To do so, purified recombinant monomeric (native) or heparin-aggregated tau protein conjugated to an amide reactive fluorophore (tau-Dylight 488 NHS ester) were incubated with iPSC-cell derived neurons for 2 hours. After extensive washing, monomeric and aggregated tau-Dylight were both detected in cells expressing the neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein MAP2, confirming that both forms of tau enter neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Tau-Dylight was found predominantly within the somatic compartment of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After four hours incubation with extracellular tau, flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) revealed that 83&#x0025; and 73&#x0025; of dissociated cells contained monomeric or aggregated tau-Dylight, respectively, demonstrating that extracellular tau efficiently enters human neurons in culture.</p>

<title>Concentration-dependent entry of tau into neurons via low pH transport vesicles</title>
<p>Live imaging of human cortical neurons was used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of neuronal entry of monomeric and aggregated tau. To do so, we prepared purified recombinant tau P301S protein conjugated to a maleimide reactive pH-sensitive dye (tau-pHrodo Red maleimide), a reporter detectable in low pH environments, including late endosomes and lysosomes. Incubation of tau-pHrodo with human neurons at a range of concentrations from 2.5 to 25 nM (0.12 to 1.2<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>g.ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, diluted in culture medium) showed that tau entry to neurons is rapid and concentration dependent, as visualised by live imaging. Intraneuronal fluorescent punctae were observed within the first ten minutes of exposure to monomeric tau-pHrodo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Supplementary movie 1). Tau-pHrodo positive structures increased in size and intensity over the four-hour course of the assay. These structures were present within neurites and accumulated in the somatic compartment of neurons. In the presence of 15 and 25 nM monomeric tau-pHrodo, the number of tau-pHrodo positive objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) rapidly increases with the signal approaching a plateau (&#x003E;90&#x0025; of final measurement) after approximately one hour.</p>

<p>Internalisation of aggregated tau-pHrodo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) was also found to be concentration dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, unlike monomeric tau-pHrodo, the number of detectable tau-pHrodo positive objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) did not increase immediately, but displayed a lag for the first hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These kinetics of aggregated tau-pHrodo entry are similar to that of both lower concentrations of monomeric tau (2.5nM) and of low molecular weight (10kDa) dextran-pHrodo (same molarity as monomeric tau samples; Supplementary Figure 1). Direct quantitative comparison of the amount of monomeric and aggregated tau-pHrodo entering at different concentrations is not possible under these experimental conditions, as the mixed nature of aggregated tau fibrils prevents us establishing molarity accurately.</p></sec>

<title>Monomeric and aggregated tau appear in early endosomes and in lysosomes</title>
<p>To establish the route of vesicular internalisation of monomeric and aggregated tau, we analysed the appearance of tau-Dylight in endosomal or lysosomal compartments in iPSC-derived human neurons. Monomeric or aggregated tau-Dylight (total protein concentration 10&#x03BC;g.ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>; &#x007E;250nM) was incubated with neurons for up to 6 hours, then extensively washed to remove extracellular protein and fixed.

</fig>
<p>In agreement with the monomeric tau-pHrodo experiments, monomeric tau-Dylight is rapidly taken up into neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, IgG-Dylight shows little detectable entry into neurons throughout the time course (data not shown). As early as 1 hour after addition of extracellular tau, monomeric and aggregated tau-Dylight were co-localised in EEA1 early endosomes. Monomeric and aggregated tau-Dylight were also detected in LAMP1 late endosomes and lysosomes, consistent with endocytosed proteins first reaching the early endosomes, before endosomes mature to become late endosomes.</p>
<p>Live imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, Supplementary Movie 2) of neurons incubated with aggregated tau-pHrodo (four hours; 0.7<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>g.ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) enabled the longer-term tracking of tau-pHrodo-containing vesicles within neurons. Tau-containing vesicles were dynamically and rapidly (&#x003E;10<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>m/second) transported in both antero- and retrograde directions along neurites, and could rapidly reverse direction of transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Thus, monomeric and aggregated tau both efficiently enter neurons via the endosome-lysosome system, and are actively trafficked within vesicles over long distances within neurons over several hours.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Differential effects of dynamin inhibition on endocytosis of monomeric and aggregated tau</title>
<p>As extracellular monomeric and aggregated tau utilise endosomal pathways to enter neurons, but display different kinetics of uptake, we examined whether the underlying internalisation mechanisms of tau protein species differ. First, we tested the sensitively of monomeric and aggregated tau internalisation to the small molecule inhibitor Dynasore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), an inhibitor of the GTPase Dynamin, which is required for numerous membrane fission events, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Preta et al., 2015</xref>). Following 30 minute pre-incubation with 100<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>M Dynasore or vehicle control, entry of extracellular monomeric (25nM) or aggregated tau-pHrodo (1.2<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>g.ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) was assessed by live imaging over four hours.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="168294v1_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The amount of monomeric tau entering neurons, as measured by total fluorescent intensity of intracellular monomeric tau-pHrodo vesicles, is significantly reduced by dynamin inhibition, as shown at 1 and 3 hours after addition of extracellular tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is also reflected in the significant reduction in the number of tau-pHrodo positive objects at 1 hour (compared with vehicle control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The kinetics of appearance of intracellular monomeric tau-pHrodo objects changes in the presence of dynamin inhibitor, displaying an initial lag in entry. However, the number of tau-pHrodo objects then reaches the same level as vehicle-treated controls by 3 hours, although not the same total intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which may reflect a reduction in endosome/lysosome acidification in the presence of Dynasore. This suggests that there are two distinct mechanisms of entry of monomeric tau into human neurons, one of which is rapid and dynamin-dependent, and the other slower and independent of dynamin.</p>
<p>The effect of dynamin inhibition on entry of aggregated tau is more pronounced than on monomeric tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>). The total fluorescent intensity of intracellular aggregated tau-pHrodo is consistently reduced by more than 70&#x0025; at 1 and 3 hours after tau addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and the number of tau-pHrodo positive objects is reduced by 95&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These data indicate that, at the concentrations studied, that aggregated tau enters neurons almost entirely via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Perturbation of actin dynamics confirms that monomeric and aggregated tau have overlapping but different routes to enter neurons</title>
<p>To explore further whether monomeric and aggregated tau enter neurons via different mechanisms, we studied the role of actin polymerisation in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Inhibition of actin polymerisation with Cytochalasin D disrupts several clathrin-independent endocytic processes, including bulk endocytosis/macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mooren et al., 2012</xref>). Disruption of actin polymerisation has previously been shown to inhibit entry of fibrils formed of the tau repeat domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, neuronal entry of tau-pHrodo was measured over three hours in the presence of extracellular monomeric (25nM) or aggregated (1.2<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>g.ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) tau-pHrodo, following 30 minute pre-incubation with 0.1 or 1<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>M Cytochalasin D or vehicle control.</p>

<p>Entry of monomeric tau was reduced in the presence of 1<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>M Cytochalasin D, as reflected in the 95&#x0025; reduction in the number of monomeric tau-pHrodo positive objects after three hours incubation in the presence of 1<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>M Cytochalasin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

<p>Live imaging of tau entry with pHrodo-tau may not detect intracellular pools of tau that enter via a different mechanism, avoiding low-pH environments. Additionally the pharmacological treatments may also effect the acidification of intracellular vesicles, which could affect the pHrodo signal.

Compared with the live imaging studies, relatively high concentrations of aggregated tau were used to investigate whether the dynamin-dependence and actin-independence of neuronal entry seen by live imaging were related to the lower molarity of aggregated versus monomeric tau used for those experiments. These independent assays confirmed the same differential effects of the two inhibitors observed by live imaging of pHrodo-tau: at the three hour assay point, dynamin inhibition had no effect on the number of monomeric tau-Dylight positive punctae within neurons, whereas inhibition of actin polymerisation reduced the amount of intracellular tau by over half (Supplementary Figure 2). Conversely, dynamin inhibition significantly reduced the entry of aggregated tau, with no significant effects of Cytochalasin D (Supplementary Figure 2) at this relatively high molar concentration of aggregated tau.</p></sec>

<title>Anti-tau antibodies slow neuronal internalisation of extracellular tau</title>
<p>It is not currently known if tau entry into neurons requires specific domains of tau, specific cell surface binding proteins or receptors. Antibodies that recognise extracellular tau are a potential therapeutic strategy for slowing disease progression through the CNS by inhibiting tau entry into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Congdon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gu and Sigurdsson, 2011</xref>). Complex formation between specific antibodies and tau results in an increase in molecular size and may alter or mask uptake recognition sites on tau, thus preventing neuronal entry of tau.</p>
<p>We analysed the ability of a polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal half of tau to reduce tau protein entry into human cortical neurons. The anti-tau antibody or control IgGs (250nM) were incubated with either monomeric (25nM) or aggregated (1.2<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>g.ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) tau-pHrodo at approximately 10-fold excess of antibody for 30 minutes. Tau-antibody mixtures were then added to iPSC-derived human neurons and tau entry assessed by live imaging of fluorescent intracellular tau-pHrodo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Pre-incubation with the polyclonal (anti-tau<sup>pAb</sup>) tau antibody reduced the amount of monomeric tau that enters neurons, as assessed by the number of monomeric tau-pHrodo containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; Supplementary Figure 3). The kinetics of monomeric tau entry are affected by the presence of tau-specific antibodies, such that an initial lag in the appearance of defined tau-pHrodo-positive objects was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Tau antibodies also reduce entry of aggregated tau uptake into human neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the presence of anti-tau<sup>pAb</sup> the number of aggregated tau-pHrodo vesicles was reduced by more than half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; Supplementary Figure 3). IgG antibodies that do not recognise tau appear to have some minor effects on monomeric and aggregated tau entry, which may be due to competition between tau and IgG for bulk endocytosis.</p>
<p>The effect of tau antibodies on the entry of monomeric tau-Dylight into neurons was also tested (Supplementary Figure 3), using the same concentrations and pre-incubation time as the tau-pHrodo assays. After three hours of incubation with antibodies and extracellular monomeric or aggregated tau, neurons were washed, fixed and number of intracellular tau-Dylight punctae were quantified. These independent assays confirm that tau-specific antibodies significantly reduce the amount of tau-Dylight entering neurons (Supplementary Figure 3).</p></sec>

<title>Entry of aggregated tau-antibody complexes into neurons</title>
<p>Although tau was pre-incubated with a large molar excess of antibodies (10x) before addition to neurons, a notable amount of both monomeric and aggregated tau still entered neurons. This raised the question whether the tau that entered neurons under these conditions did so in a complex with antibodies, or that a fraction of antibody-free tau was available for neuronal entry. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed additional assays using pre-formed aggregated tau-Dylight-antibody complexes. After three hours of incubation, antibodies were detected in the fixed neurons with a secondary antibody specific to the host species (anti-rabbit polyclonal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and also imaged for tau-Dylight. Intraneuronal punctae positive for both tau-Dylight and tau specific antibodies were detected after binding of extracellular tau with anti-tau<sup>pAb</sup>, demonstrating that tau-antibody complexes do enter human neurons. No intraneuronal tau-antibody complexes were detected when aggregated tau was incubated with IgG control.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We find here that both monomeric and aggregated tau (P301S) efficiently enter human neurons, arguing that tau entry to neurons is a constitutive biological process, and not a disease-specific phenomenon. Both species of tau enter neurons via a dynamin-dependent process, with monomeric tau also entering neurons through a second, slower pathway dependent on actin polymerisation. Monomeric and aggregated tau access neurons via the lysosome/endosome system, and a fraction of tau is dynamically transported long distances in neurons within low pH vesicles for lengthy periods. The amount of monomeric and aggregated tau entering neurons is reduced by polyclonal anti-tau antibodies. However, a notable amount of tau enters neurons complexed with antibodies, even in the presence of a ten-fold molar excess of antibodies. While antibody binding may affect intracellular trafficking of tau and the final destination of tau within the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">McEwan et al., 2017</xref>), these data demonstrate that simple binding of tau by antibodies is not sufficient to prevent neuronal entry when tau is presented in solution to the neuron.</p>
<p>In contrast to earlier reports from HEK cells and primary rodent neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Frost et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), full-length monomeric tau efficiently and rapidly enters healthy human neurons, and does so as efficiently as aggregated tau. We find that there are two mechanisms of entry of monomeric tau to neurons: a rapid early phase that can be blocked by dynamin inhibition, and a second, slower phase that it does so in an actindependent manner. These two mechanisms suggest that monomeric tau enters neurons via a rapid saturable clathrin-mediated endocytic mechanism and also by bulk endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Loebrich, 2014</xref>). In contrast to monomeric tau, aggregated tau entry is independent of actin polymerisation and largely dynamin dependent, consistent with clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The lack of actin dependence of aggregated tau entry into neurons suggests that it does not enter human neurons via macropinocytosis, as has been reported in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Rapid clathrin-mediated endocytosis of both monomeric and aggregated tau would typically require one or more specific receptors or cell surface binding molecules, the identities of which are currently unknown. Specific surface receptors have been identified for fibrils of alpha-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mao et al., 2016</xref>), and that receptor shows specificity for aggregated synuclein over the monomeric form, arguing that although both species of tau enter neurons via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, they may do so through distinct surface receptors. As a largely disordered protein, the most obvious candidate region for recognition for cellular entry of monomeric tau is the highly ordered microtubule-binding region of tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Butner and Kirschner, 1991</xref>). Detailed understanding of the different paths of entry for monomeric and aggregated tau will be useful for investigating the potential for specifically preventing inter-neuronal transfer of aggregated tau without interfering with transfer of non-pathogenic forms.</p>
<p>In addition to the importance of these questions for understanding mechanisms of dementia pathogenesis, they also have implications for immunotherapy strategies that target extracellular tau as disease-modifying treatments for dementia. Tau immunotherapy strategies have been shown to alter tau transmission in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Congdon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gu and Sigurdsson, 2011</xref>). Proposed mechanisms for tau immunotherapies are epitope, affinity and aggregate size-dependent. Studies of specific tau immunotherapies have demonstrated that either extracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Yanamandra et al., 2013</xref>) or intracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nicholls et al., 2017</xref>) tau can be targeted. Antibodies are thought to halt the progression of disease by binding to tau aggregates, triggering their uptake and clearance via either endosomal or proteasome pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mallery et al., 2010</xref>). Fluid phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Funk et al., 2015</xref>) and Fc-receptor-mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Congdon et al., 2016</xref>) endocytosis have both been implicated in the uptake of antibody-tau complexes into neurons and microglia. The consequences for the neuron of uptake of antibody-antigen complexes are not clear, and would depend in part on whether those complexes are degraded or accumulate in the endosome/lysosome or transit to the cytoplasm, where they could be detected by the cytosolic Fc receptor TRIM21 and targeted for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">McEwan et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The data presented here from in vitro experiments suggest that entry of tau into human neurons is an efficient physiological process, rather than a disease-specific gain-of-function. Most current immunotherapy approaches targeting extracellular tau do not distinguish between pathogenic forms of tau that are thought to propagate disease, and the forms of extracellular tau that are found in the healthy brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bright et al., 2015</xref>). Disruption of interneuronal transfer of non-pathogenic tau may have deleterious effects, if that transfer has a biological function. Current clinical trials of anti-tau antibodies have not so far reported deleterious effects relating to disruption of interneuronal non-pathogenic tau, and the field awaits the outcomes of longer term trials. Furthermore, therapeutics that are not selective for extracellular pathogenic forms of tau may not achieve appropriate levels of target engagement in the presence of concentrations of non-pathogenic tau that are higher than those of pathogenic tau. Therefore, it will be important to ascertain the biological functions of neuronal release and internalisation of tau, and to identify which, if any, extracellular tau forms are truly pathogenic, to facilitate the rational design of therapies that target interneuronal transfer of tau to prevent disease progression.</p>
