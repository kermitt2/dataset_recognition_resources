<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>Meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes is tightly regulated to ensure proper chromosome segregation. Each chromosome pair typically undergoes at least one crossover event (crossover assurance) but these exchanges are also strictly limited in number and widely spaced along chromosomes (crossover interference). This has implied the existence of chromosome-wide signals that regulate crossovers, but their molecular basis remains mysterious. Here we characterize a family of four related RING finger proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. These proteins are recruited to the synaptonemal complex between paired homologs, where they act as two heterodimeric complexes, likely as E3 ubiquitin ligases. Genetic and cytological analysis reveals that they act with additional components to create a self-extinguishing circuit that controls crossover designation and maturation. These proteins also act at the top of a hierarchical chromosome remodeling process that enables crossovers to direct stepwise segregation. Work in diverse phyla indicates that related mechanisms mediate crossover control across eukaryotes.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Meiosis gives rise to haploid gametes through two sequential rounds of nuclear division. To ensure faithful meiotic chromosome segregation in most organisms, every pair of homologous chromosomes must attain at least one crossover (CO) recombination product, which creates a stable interhomolog connection known as a chiasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Page and Hawley, 2003</xref>). However, the total number of COs per cell is typically far too low to assure CO formation on each chromosome by a Poisson process; indeed, in many species each homolog pair undergoes only a single CO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mercier et al., 2015</xref>). In cases where multiple COs occur per chromosome pair, they are nonrandomly far apart, a phenomenon known as &#x201C;crossover interference&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Muller, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sturtevant, 1915</xref>). Despite our longstanding awareness of crossover patterning, the mechanisms that ensure this highly nonrandom process remain poorly understood and controversial.</p>
<p>Meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the conserved topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11 (SPO-11 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Keeney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>). A subset of DSBs are processed to become COs, while the rest are repaired through alternate pathways. In several model organisms, two CO pathways have been elucidated: The &#x201C;class I&#x201D; pathway, which is subject to CO assurance and interference, requires meiosis-specific homologs of the bacterial mismatch repair protein MutS (Msh4 and Msh5). Components of the synaptonemal complex (SC), an ordered, periodic proteinaceous structure that assembles between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase, are also required for class I COs. An alternate enzymatic pathway can give rise to both noncrossovers and &#x201C;class II&#x201D; COs, which do not show interference.</p>
<p>In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, only class I COs normally occur, and only a single CO occurs per chromosome pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Martinez-Perez and Colaiacovo, 2009</xref>). No COs occur in the absence of SC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>). Additional factors required for meiotic COs, but not for homolog pairing, synapsis, or other homologous recombination, include MSH-4 and MSH-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kelly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zalevsky et al., 1999</xref>), the cyclin-related protein COSA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>), and ZHP-3, a RING finger protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>COs act together with sister chromatid cohesion to orchestrate two successive rounds of chromosome segregation. In mammals and most other model organisms, cohesion between sister chromatids is maintained near centromeres during the first division (MI), but arm cohesion must be released to allow homologs to separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Duro and Marston, 2015</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which lacks defined centromeres, cohesion is spatially regulated downstream of CO designation. Following CO designation at mid-pachynema, the chromosome region on one side of the designated CO site becomes enriched for several proteins, including HTP-&#x00BD;, LAB-1, and REC-8, which act together to maintain cohesion through the first division. Conversely, the reciprocal chromosome region becomes depleted of these proteins but retains a stretch of SC. This &#x201C;short arm&#x201D; eventually recruits the Aurora kinase AIR-2, which is required to release cohesion and allow MI segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">de Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kaitna et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). It has been unclear whether the SC that remains along this arm contributes to regulating cohesion. The hierarchy of regulatory steps leading to this remodeling, and particularly the initial trigger for this asymmetry, are also poorly understood.</p>
<p>Growing evidence has implicated the SC in CO regulation, particularly in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Libuda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rog et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sym and Roeder, 1994</xref>). We recently reported that SCs assemble through regulated phase separation and behave as liquid crystalline bodies, in that structural proteins within assembled SCs are mobile on short time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rog et al., 2017</xref>). This suggested that biochemical signals might diffuse through the SC to regulate CO formation. We further showed that two pro-crossover factors, ZHP-3 and COSA-1, dynamically associate with ordered, chromosome-free assemblies of SC proteins known as polycomplexes, revealing that they have an intrinsic affinity for this material.</p>
<p>This led us to search for novel crossover control factors that might act within the SC. Three paralogs of ZHP-3 are expressed in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, but their functions have not been described. Here we define key meiotic roles for these proteins. We report that this family of four paralogs, which we designate as ZHP-1&#x2013;4, act as two heterodimeric complexes to regulate CO formation. Together with other known and unknown factors, they form a signaling network that acts within the SC to ensure CO formation while limiting the number of CO-designated sites, and thereby mediate CO assurance and CO interference. In addition, the ZHP proteins act upstream of other regulators to direct chromosome remodeling in response to crossover formation, which enables stepwise chromosome segregation. Homology between the ZHP proteins and meiotic regulators from other phyla indicate that similar mechanisms likely underlie meiotic CO control in most eukaryotes, and may also play previously-unrecognized roles in regulating meiotic cohesion.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2"><title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a"><title>A family of meiotic RING finger proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>The RING finger protein ZHP-3 was initially identified as a candidate meiotic factor in <italic>C. elegans</italic> based on its homology to Zip3, a component of the &#x201C;synapsis initiation complex&#x201D; in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwal and Roeder, 2000</xref>). Targeted disruption of <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>3</italic> revealed that it is required for CO formation, but dispensable for homolog pairing and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>). ZHP-3 has an N-terminal RING finger domain, a central predicted coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal tail that is predicted to be largely unstructured. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome includes three additional predicted genes with the same domain structure and significant homology to ZHP-3. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Several independent analyses indicate that all four genes are expressed in the germline, consistent with a role in meiosis (WormBase, S.K. and A.F.D. unpublished).</p>
<p>All four predicted proteins have similar N-terminal C3HC4-type RING-finger domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1A-B</xref>), which are usually associated with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>). The C-terminal regions of these proteins are divergent and lack obvious structural domains, but contain a number of potential post-translational modification sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on their similarity to each other, and on evidence presented here that they function together to form a regulatory circuit, we have named these genes <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> (F55A12.10), <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>2</italic> (D1081.9) and <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>4</italic> (Y39B6A.16) (<italic><underline>z</underline>ip3</italic> <underline>h</underline>omologous <underline>p</underline>rotein). The numbering reflects their physical order in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome: <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic>, -<italic>2</italic>, and -<italic>3</italic> are clustered on Chromosome I, while <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>4</italic> is on Chromosome V.</p>
<p>To gain insight into the evolution of these proteins, we searched for homologs in other sequenced nematode genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1C</xref>). Orthologs of each protein can be identified in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. remanei</italic>, as well as in other nematode genera, indicating that these proteins diversified at least tens to hundreds of millions of years ago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1C-D</xref> and data not shown). Their N-terminal regions show homology to the mammalian CO regulator RNF212, and ZHP-1 and ZHP-2 are also recognized as homologs of HEI10, which is involved in CO regulation in mammals, plants, and fungi (data not shown).</p></sec>
<sec id="s2b"><title>ZHP proteins exhibit two distinct patterns of dynamic localization during meiosis</title>
<p>To investigate the localization of the ZHP proteins, we inserted epitope tags at the C-terminus of each coding sequence; these tagged alleles supported normal meiosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). All four of the proteins localized to the synaptonemal complex (SC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Prior to synapsis, they also localized to nuclear puncta containing all known SC central region proteins. Prior work has shown that these are nuclear bodies are polycomplexes, defined as ordered, chromosome-free assemblies of SC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Goldstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rog et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Roth, 1966</xref>).</p>

ZHP-1 and ZHP-2 show identical dynamics: they localize to assembling SCs, and upon CO designation they become restricted to the short arm of each bivalent. ZHP-3 and ZHP-4 also mirror each other, localizing initially throughout the SC, and then concentrate at CO-designated sites upon the appearance of COSA-1 foci. 3F indicates 3xFLAG.

</fig>
<p>ZHP-1 and -2 exhibited identical localization patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>): From early prophase to mid-pachynema, they became brighter and more contiguous along the length of SCs, but did not appear completely uniform throughout this structure. Upon the appearance of GFP-COSA-1 foci, which mark designated CO sites from mid-pachynema through diplonema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>), ZHP-&#x00BD; became confined to the SC on one side of each CO. Intriguingly, this restriction was observed in pachytene nuclei that retained SC and the HORMA domain proteins HTP-&#x00BD; on both sides of the CO, and represents the earliest known molecular differentiation of the two chromosome domains that will become the long and short arms of the bivalent. ZHP-1 and -2 remained associated with SC proteins along the short arm of each bivalent as the SC disappeared from the long arm, and persisted as long as SC proteins were present along the short arms, through late diakinesis.</p>
<p>ZHP-3 and -4 exhibited a similar but distinct distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). These proteins also localized to polycomplexes prior to synapsis, then became discontinuously distributed along the length of SCs in early to mid-pachynema. Upon the appearance of GFP-COSA-1 foci, ZHP-3 and -4 both concentrated at these designated CO sites and gradually disappeared from the SC along both arms of the chromosomes. These observations are largely consistent with previous characterization of ZHP-3 and a partially functional GFP-ZHP-3 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="s2c"><title>Association of ZHPs with meiotic chromosomes depends on synaptonemal complexes</title>
<p>The SC in <italic>C. elegans</italic> comprises at least 4 proteins, known as SYP-1-4, which are mutually dependent for its self-assembly. We found that none of the four ZHP proteins associated with chromosomes in <italic>syp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> mutants, which lack synapsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Intriguingly, in the region of the germline that normally corresponds to late pachynema, the 4 ZHP proteins colocalized within nuclear puncta devoid of SC proteins, indicating that the ZHPs can interact with each other in the absence of SC or polycomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2C</xref>, lower panel). The ZHP proteins were also less abundant in <italic>syp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2D-J</xref>), suggesting that their stability is enhanced by association with SCs, particularly that of ZHP-1 and -2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2E</xref> and I).</p>
<p>Because the ZHP proteins relocalized upon CO designation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we examined their distribution under conditions where COs fail to occur. In mutants lacking SPO-11, MSH-5, or COSA-1, ZHPs were detected along the length of SCs through diplonema (data not shown). Thus, relocalization of the ZHPs in late prophase depends on CO designation.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2d"><title>ZHPs act as two heterodimeric complexes</title>
<p>To investigate the meiotic functions of the ZHP proteins, we first exploited the auxin-inducible degradation system. Each of the ZHP genes was tagged with a 3xFLAG epitope and a 44-aa degron sequence (hereafter &#x201C;AID&#x201D;) in a strain that expresses the F-box protein AtTIR1 throughout the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). When adult animals were transferred to plates containing 1 mM auxin, all AID-tagged proteins were robustly depleted within 1-2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). To assess the efficacy of the knockdown, we compared meiotic chromosome segregation in hermaphrodites carrying the previously characterized <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>3(jf61)</italic> null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>) to AID-mediated ZHP-3-depleted worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1C</xref>). AID-mediated depletion of ZHP-3 quantitatively phenocopied the null allele, based on both embryonic viability <italic>(&#x0394;zhp</italic>-<italic>3</italic>: 2.06 &#x00B1; 0.62&#x0025;; <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>3::AID</italic>: 1.83 &#x00B1; 0.82&#x0025;) and male self-progeny (<italic>&#x0394;zhp</italic>-<italic>3</italic>: 43.75 &#x00B1; 27.59 &#x0025;; <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>3::AID:</italic> 37.02 &#x00B1; 38.12&#x0025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that auxin-induced degradation effectively eliminates the function of ZHP-3.</p>
<p>To determine the dependence of the ZHP proteins on each other for their localization and stability, we exposed worms to auxin for 24 hours, so that a pool of nuclei had entered and progressed through meiotic prophase in the absence of AID-tagged protein. Other proteins of interest were epitope-tagged. We found that ZHP-1 and -2 depend on each other for both their chromosome association and stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-D</xref>). ZHP-3 and -4 were also interdependent for their localization to chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1D</xref>). ZHP-4 was unstable in the absence of ZHP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1E</xref>) and ZHP-3 levels were somewhat lower when ZHP-4 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="168948_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Other RING finger proteins such as BRCA1/BARD1 are known to act as obligate heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brzovic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Metzger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wu et al., 1996</xref>). The similarity and interdependence of localization of ZHP-1 and -2, and of ZHP-3 and -4, suggested that these four proteins might function as two pairs. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis, we found that ZHP-1 and -2 indeed interact with each other, and that ZHP-3 and ZHP-4 also physically interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1F</xref>). This evidence for specific pairwise physical interactions, together with their physical distributions (above) and functional analysis (below), indicate that ZHP-&#x00BD; form a heteromeric complex, and ZHP-&#x0394; similarly form an obligate pair.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2e"><title>ZHPs play essential roles in chiasma formation and chromosome segregation</title>
<p>Using a number of established assays, we investigated the meiotic functions of these RING finger proteins in further detail. At late diakinesis, pairwise interactions between homologs are normally maintained by chiasmata, and six condensed bivalents can be detected in each oocyte nucleus. We exposed <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>AID</italic> strains to auxin for 24 hours and then analyzed chiasma formation. Depletion of ZHP-1 or -2 yielded 8-12 DAPI-staining bodies at diakinesis, representing 4-12 univalents and 0-4 bivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). In contrast, depletion of ZHP-3 or -4 resulted in a complete failure of chiasma formation, indicated by the appearance of 12 achiasmate chromosomes in each nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>), consistent with previous characterization of ZHP-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

ZHPs tagged with AID in a <italic>P<sub>sun-1</sub>::TIR1</italic> background were treated with or without auxin for 24 h. In the absence of auxin, each nucleus contains six bivalents (homolog pairs held together by chiasmata). Depletion of ZHP-1 or -2 leads to a marked decrease in bivalents per nucleus (8-12 DAPI-staining bodies, or 0-4 bivalents), while depletion of ZHP-3 or -4 results in a complete loss of bivalents (12 DAPI-staining bodies). <italic>n</italic> = the number of nuclei scored for each condition or genotype.

<p>Because a few chiasmata were observed when ZHP-1-AID or ZHP-2-AID were depleted, we were concerned that these proteins might not be efficiently degraded. We therefore engineered null mutations in <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> and <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>2</italic> (see Materials and Methods). Homozygous mutants produced few viable progeny and a high incidence of male self-progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), as expected for important meiotic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hodgkin et al., 1979</xref>). They also showed identical distributions of DAPI-staining bodies at diakinesis to that observed in AID-depleted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1A-C</xref> and data not shown). Additionally, both <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> and -<italic>2</italic> null mutants produced more viable progeny than <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>3</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), consistent with a less absolute dependence of chiasma formation on ZHP-&#x00BD; than on ZHP-&#x00BE;.</p>
<p>We wondered whether the few chiasmata in hermaphrodites lacking ZHP-&#x00BD; might preferentially occur on the X chromosome, which shows some differences from autosomes in its genetic requirements for DSB induction and CO formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate this, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to mark Chromosome V and the X chromosome in <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> mutants. By examining nuclei at diakinesis, we found that chiasma formation was compromised to a similar degree on both chromosomes. Our observations are quantitatively consistent with a low number of chiasmata distributed evenly among all 6 chromosome pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-G</xref>).</p>
<p>ZHP-3 was previously found to be dispensable for homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, and DSB induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>). Pairing and synapsis also occurred normally in the absence of ZHP-1, -2, or -4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). RAD-51 foci, which mark recombination intermediates and require DSB induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Colaiacovo et al., 2003</xref>), were also abundant in all <italic>zhp</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1F-J</xref>). Thus, the high frequency of achiasmate chromosomes in the absence of ZHPs reflects defects in CO recombination downstream of pairing, synapsis, and DSBs.</p>
<p>Prior work has established the existence of a &#x201C;crossover assurance checkpoint&#x201D; that delays meiotic progression when the preconditions for CO designation fail on one or more chromosomes. Activation of this checkpoint prolongs the activity of the CHK-2 kinase, resulting in an extended region and elevated number of RAD-51 foci, and a shift in the pattern of meiotic recombination, but does not perturb CO interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carlton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). We observed that phosphorylation of HIM-8 and its paralogs, a marker for CHK-2 activity, was extended when any of the ZHPs was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1K-M</xref>), and RAD-51 foci were more abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1F-J</xref>). Thus, the crossover assurance checkpoint is triggered, presumably by CO defects, indicating that the ZHPs are dispensable for this feedback mechanism.</p>
<p>We noted differences in RAD-51 dynamics when ZHP-&#x00BD; were depleted as compared to ZHP-&#x00BE; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1G-J</xref>). In the absence of ZHP-&#x00BE;, RAD-51 foci reached higher peak numbers than in wild-type animals or in the absence of ZHP-&#x00BD;, but depletion of ZHP-&#x00BD; caused a greater delay in the appearance and disappearance of RAD-51 foci than depletion of ZHP-&#x00BE;. Thus, the two ZHP complexes likely play distinct roles in the processing of recombination intermediates.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2f"><title>ZHP-&#x00BE; are essential for CO designation, while ZHP-&#x00BD; limit ZHP-&#x00BE; activity and promote CO maturation</title>
<p>To probe the role of ZHPs in recombination, we examined the distribution of MSH-5 and COSA-1, which are normally associated with recombination intermediates and designated COs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). While six bright GFP-COSA-1 foci &#x2013; one per pair of chromosomes &#x2013; were consistently detected in nuclei from control worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), no COSA-1 foci were detected in ZHP-3 or ZHP-4-depleted worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and data not shown). Similarly, &#x223C;10-20 MSH-5 foci were detected in wild-type mid-pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4&#x2014;figure supplement 1A</xref>), but were undetectable in ZHP-&#x00BE;-depleted worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4&#x2014;figure supplement 1B</xref>). By contrast, depletion of ZHP-&#x00BD; led to appearance of up to &#x223C;20-30 dim GFP-COSA-1 foci and &#x223C;40-50 MSH-5 foci in late pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4&#x2014;figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Notably, these foci increased in number as nuclei advanced from mid- to late pachynema, and then rapidly declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4&#x2014;figure supplement 1D</xref>). Depletion of ZHP-&#x00BD; also resulted in persistence of ZHP-3 and -4 throughout SCs in late pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4&#x2014;figure supplement 1E</xref> and data not shown), as in other CO-defective mutants (see above; data not shown). These observations suggested that in the absence of ZHP-1 or -2, pro-CO proteins associate promiscuously with recombination intermediates rather than being restricted to a single designated CO between each homolog pair.</p>

<p>To test whether dim GFP-COSA-1 foci in ZHP-&#x00BD;-depleted worms mark recombination intermediates, we inhibited DSB formation. We AID-tagged SPO-11 and either ZHP-1 or ZHP-2 in the same strain, and found that both proteins could be effectively co-depleted by auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4&#x2014;figure supplement 1F</xref> and data not shown). This abolished all GFP-COSA-1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and data not shown), indicating that the dim foci observed in the absence of ZHP-&#x00BD; are indeed recombination intermediates. Co-depletion of ZHP-1 and ZHP-4 also eliminated GFP-COSA-1 foci; thus, dim foci seen in the absence of ZHP-1 require ZHP-&#x00BE; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4&#x2014;figure supplement 1G</xref>). Consistent with this result, no bivalents were detected when ZHP-1 and -4 were co-depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>We next sought to understand why oocytes lacking ZHP-&#x00BD; have abundant, dim COSA-1 foci but few bivalent chromosomes. This discrepancy could indicate that the dim foci do not mature as COs, or that they do become COs but fail to give rise to stable chiasmata. To address this, we mapped COs in <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> null mutants by whole genome sequencing (see Materials and Methods). This analysis indicated that COs are strongly reduced in the absence of ZHP-1. We detected an average of 2.8 &#x00B1; 1.8 (SD) per oocyte in <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> mutants, compared to 7.3 &#x00B1; 3.0 (SD) per oocyte (slightly more than the expected number of 6) in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This is consistent with the number of bivalents seen in <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>&#x00BD;</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in the absence of ZHP-&#x00BD;, many recombination intermediates recruit COSA-1, but only a small subset mature as COs and chiasmata.</p>
<p>The large number of dim GFP-COSA-1 foci in the absence of ZHP-&#x00BD; suggested that one or more limiting components might be distributed to an excess of recombination intermediates. We therefore wondered whether robust CO designation could be rescued by restricting the number of potential intermediates. Mutations in <italic>dsb</italic>-<italic>2</italic> cause an age-dependent reduction in meiotic DSBs: very few RAD-51 foci and chiasmata are seen in older (48 h post-L4) <italic>dsb</italic>-<italic>2</italic> hermaphrodites, while somewhat more RAD-51 foci and chiasmata are seen in younger adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We co-depleted DSB-2 and ZHP-2 using the AID system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5&#x2014;figure supplement 1A</xref>), fixed worms at 24 and 48 hours post-L4, and stained for RAD-51 and GFP-COSA-1. Fewer COSA-1 foci and bivalents were observed in animals depleted for both DSB-2 and ZHP-2 than DSB-2 alone, although the number of RAD-51 foci was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5&#x2014;figure supplement 1B</xref> and data not shown). Intriguingly, while younger <italic>dsb</italic>-<italic>2</italic> mutant animals have more meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rosu et al., 2013</xref> and data not shown), we observed fewer bright GFP-COSA-1 foci in young animals &#x2013; only 11&#x0025; of nuclei contained a bright GFP-COSA-1 focus, compared to 49&#x0025; in older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-C</xref>). The number of bivalents in these animals corresponded well with bright GFP-COSA-1 foci, and only chromosomes with bright COSA-1 foci displayed the normal hallmarks of chromosome remodeling (see below), indicating that only bright COSA-1 foci are effectively designated as COs. Thus, CO designation in the absence of ZHP-2 becomes more robust as the number of intermediates becomes more limiting.</p>

<p>(A) Projection images of representative late pachytene nuclei stained for GFP-COSA-1 (green) and SYP-1 (red). In the absence of DSB-2, at 24 h post-L4, an average of 3 bright GFP-COSA-1 foci were detected in each nucleus. However, very few bright GFP-COSA-1 foci were detected when ZHP-2 was co-depleted. By 48 h post-L4, bright GFP-COSA-1 foci dropped to &#x223C;2 per nucleus in the absence of DSB-2 alone, but &#x223C;50&#x0025; of nuclei displayed 1 bright GFP-COSA-1 focus when ZHP-2 was also depleted. (B) Quantification of bright GFP-COSA-1 foci at late pachynema, 24 h post-L4.

Data were derived from 4-8 gonads for each genotype or condition. <italic>n</italic> = 165, 348, 172 and 377 nuclei, respectively. The number of GFP-COSA-1 foci differed significantly between <italic>dsb</italic>-<italic>2::AID</italic> and <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>2::AID; dsb</italic>-<italic>2::AID</italic> following auxin treatment (<sup>&#x2217;&#x2217;&#x2217;</sup>p&#x003C;0.0001 by Chi-square test).

Data were derived from 4-8 gonads for each genotype or condition. <italic>n</italic> = 252, 558, 263 and 416 nuclei, respectively.

The number of bright GFP-COSA-1 foci in the absence of ZHP-&#x00BD; was quantified following exposure of SPO-11-depleted worms to varying doses of ionizing radiation. L4 worms were maintained in the presence or in the absence of 1 mM auxin for 24 h, followed by irradiation at the indicated dosage, and then incubated for additional 8 h to allow irradiated nuclei to progress to late pachynema.

<p>As another approach to examine how the number of intermediates impacts CO designation in the absence of ZHP-&#x00BD;, we co-depleted ZHP-2 and SPO-11 to abolish programmed meiotic DSBs, and exposed these animals to ionizing radiation to induce varying numbers of DSBs. When SPO-11 alone was depleted by the AID system, GFP-COSA-1 foci and bivalents were eliminated. Following 10 Gy of radiation, a dose sufficient to ensure CO formation on most chromosomes in the absence of SPO-11, 6 bright GFP-COSA-1 foci were observed in each nucleus, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Libuda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5&#x2014;figure supplement 1C</xref>). When SPO-11 and ZHP-2 were co-depleted, bright GFP-COSA-1 foci were observed following low doses of radiation, but these never exceeded 2 per nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). At 10 Gy, only extremely dim GFP-COSA-1 foci were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these observations indicate that ZHP-&#x00BD; are dispensable for a single break to become a functional interhomolog CO, but act to limit or focus the activity of ZHP-&#x00BE; and/or other CO factors to ensure robust CO designation in the context of excess DSBs. However, ZHP-&#x00BD; also contribute to CO formation even when very few breaks are made. A possible interpretation is that ZHP-&#x00BD; stabilize a factor that becomes limiting for CO formation in their absence, particularly when there are abundant recombination intermediates.</p>
<p>We next tested whether the function of ZHP-&#x00BD; in limiting designated COs could be separated from their role in CO maturation by reducing the amount of either protein. When strains carrying AID-tagged ZHP-1 or -2 were maintained on low concentrations of auxin, these proteins could be partially depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5&#x2014;figure supplement 1D-E</xref> and data not shown). At very low protein levels, we saw a reduction in GFP-COSA-1 foci, but never observed more than 6 bright COSA-1 foci per nucleus. Thus, concentrations of ZHP-&#x00BD; required to promote CO maturation are also sufficient to impose robust interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5&#x2014;figure supplement 1F</xref> and data not shown), further indicating that these functions are tightly coupled.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2g"><title>ZHP-&#x00BD; mediate chromosome remodeling in response to CO designation</title>
<p>As described in the Introduction, several proteins become asymmetrically localized along chromosomes following CO designation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This differentiates the regions on either side of the crossover and leads eventually to the stepwise release of cohesion, first along the &#x201C;short arms&#x201D; during MI, and then from the &#x201C;long arms&#x201D; during MII. The progression of steps in this remodeling process can be inferred cytologically, based on their spatial distribution within the germline, and on their genetic interdependence. During diplotene/diakinesis, HTP-&#x00BD; and LAB-1 become enriched along the long arms, and a stretch of SC remains along the short arms, which later recruit the Aurora kinase AIR-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">de Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kaitna et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>). Here we report that even prior to apparent reorganization of HTP-1 or SC proteins, ZHP-&#x00BD; became restricted to the SC on one side of the CO, the presumptive short arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, depletion of ZHP-1 or -2 resulted in aberrant chromosome remodeling: HTP-&#x00BD; and SYP-1 persisted along all chromosomes, both recombinant and achiasmate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 6&#x2014;figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). These observations suggested that ZHP-&#x00BD; might regulate chromosome remodeling, in addition to their roles in CO control.</p>
<p>To further probe the contribution of ZHP-&#x00BD; to remodeling, we examined <italic>dsb</italic>-<italic>2</italic> mutants, since some COs were robustly designated in this background in the absence of ZHP-&#x00BD;. The low number of COs in <italic>dsb</italic>-<italic>2</italic> mutants also allows direct comparison between recombinant and nonexchange chromosomes in the same nucleus, and thus at the same cell cycle stage. As described above, at 48 h-post L4, most late pachytene nuclei in <italic>dsb</italic>-<italic>2</italic> mutants had 0-1 COSA-1 focus. These foci also accumulated ZHP-3 and ZHP-4, which disappeared from the corresponding SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and data not shown). SC proteins and the Polo kinase PLK-2 also became enriched along these chromosomes relative to nonexchange chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Machovina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pattabiraman et al., 2017</xref>). We also observed that PLK-2, which plays a poorly characterized role in remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Harper et al., 2011</xref>), became co-enriched with ZHP-&#x00BD; on one side of each CO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, upper panel). Similar enrichment of PLK-2 along the short arm was observed in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 6&#x2014;figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). This had not been apparent using PLK-2 antibodies, but was readily detected with epitope-tagged PLK-2, as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Harper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pattabiraman et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<p>When we co-depleted DSB-2 and ZHP-&#x00BD;, ZHP-&#x00BE; still colocalized with COSA-1 at CO-designated sites and were depleted from the corresponding SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This indicates that robust CO designation, rather than ZHP-&#x00BD; activity per se, triggers depletion of ZHP-&#x00BE; from the SC. However, none of the other hallmarks of CO-induced remodeling were observed in DSB-2 and ZHP-&#x00BD; co-depleted animals, including accumulation of SC proteins and PLK-2, and asymmetrical localization of PLK-2, HTP-&#x00BD;, and LAB-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-E</xref> and data not shown). Instead, a small focus of PLK-2 was detected at CO sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, lower panel). During diplonema-diakinesis, SC proteins also became restricted to this focus, while HTP-&#x00BD; persisted along all chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lower panel).</p>
<p>We also depleted PLK-2 with the AID system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Under these conditions, CO designation and the asymmetric localization of ZHP-&#x00BD; were delayed, but still occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, lower panel). Thus, ZHP-&#x00BD; are required for the asymmetric localization of PLK-2, but not vice versa, placing ZHP-&#x00BD; upstream of PLK-2 in the remodeling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p>

<p>SC proteins self-assemble into polycomplexes in meiotic nuclei of <italic>htp</italic>-<italic>3</italic> mutants. During late meiotic prophase, foci containing COSA-1 and ZHP-&#x00BE; appear on these polycomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rog et al., 2017</xref> and data not shown). (A) ZHP-1 (not shown) and ZHP-2 (green) localize throughout polycomplexes (red) both before and after the appearance of GFP-COSA-1 foci (blue).

(B,C) Late prophase nuclei in <italic>htp</italic>-<italic>3 zhp</italic>-<italic>2::AID</italic> mutants showing polycomplexes in the presence and absence of ZHP-2 (minus and plus auxin treatment, respectively). Insets show higher magnification views of the indicated polycomplexes. (B) In the presence of ZHP-2, ZHP-&#x00BE; (green and not shown) colocalize with COSA-1 foci (cyan) in late meiotic prophase and become depleted from the body of polycomplexes (red).

(E) PLK-2 (green) was recruited to polycomplexes (red) prior to the appearance of GFP-COSA-1 foci (blue), but staining became more intense in late prophase. (F) Depletion of ZHP-2 does not affect the localization of PLK-2 to polycomplexes. Scale bars in lower magnification images, 5 &#x03BC;m; in insets, 1 &#x03BC;m. (G) Spatial regulation of CO designation by ZHP proteins. In early prophase, all 4 ZHPs concentrate within SCs at the interface between homologous chromosomes. DSBs are induced and initiate homologous recombination (X-shaped structure). In mid-prophase, one intermediate recruits COSA-1 (green), which requires ZHP-&#x00BE; (blue). Upon this &#x201C;trigger&#x201D; event, ZHP-&#x00BD; (red) promote the depletion of ZHP-&#x00BE; from the SC, preventing additional sites from recruiting COSA-1, and also reinforce the initial selection, perhaps by stabilizing limiting factors for CO maturation. Diffusion of proteins within the SC allows a signal to spread along chromosomes from the CO site in a rapid, concerted fashion. (H) A circuit diagram for CO control and chromosome remodeling, incorporating the findings of this work. ZHP-&#x00BE; promote local recruitment of COSA-1, which activates ZHP-&#x00BD; to promote depletion of ZHP-&#x00BE;, resulting in a self-extinguishing CO designation circuit. Our data suggest that a negative feedback loop leads to depletion of ZHP-&#x00BE; throughout the SC once COSA-1 has been recruited, while a positive feedback loop mutually reinforces COSA-1 recruitment and ZHP-&#x00BD; activity, resulting in switch-like behavior of the circuit. ZHP-&#x00BD; also act at the top of a hierarchy that leads to PLK-2 enrichment on one side of the crossover and retention of the SC within this domain, creating another positive feedback loop. (How ZHP-&#x00BD; become enriched on one side of the crossover is unknown.) Activities within the SC antagonize the retention of HTP-&#x00BD; and associated factors along the axis, and vice versa, resulting in the differentiation of two distinct chromosome domains. This leads to timely cleavage of cohesion on the short arm in MI and stabilization of cohesion on long arm until MII, promoting accurate, stepwise meiotic chromosome separation.</p></caption>

<p>Because ZHP-&#x00BE; are strictly required for CO designation, we could not analyze their roles in chromosome remodeling. However, prior work has found that a GFP-tagged ZHP-3 transgene acts as a separation-of-function allele that is proficient for CO designation but defective for remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This remodeling process ultimately leads to the spatial partitioning of meiotic cohesion complexes containing distinct kleisin subunits to reciprocal chromosome domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Severson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). The most mature oocyte in each gonad arm, referred to as the &#x201C;-1&#x201D; oocyte, normally shows enrichment of REC-8 along the long arms of each bivalent, while COH-&#x00BE; are retained along the short arms. In ZHP-1 or -2 depleted worms, REC-8 persisted along all arms, while COH-&#x00BE; virtually disappeared by the -1 oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 6&#x2014;figure supplement 1E</xref>), consistent with the absence of other &#x201C;short arm&#x201D; hallmarks.</p>
<p>Taken together, our analysis indicates that the ZHP circuit acts at or near the top of the hierarchy that mediates chromosome remodeling in response to CO designation, and directly couples these two key mechanisms to promote proper chromosome segregation. Our observations also imply that the persistence of SC along the short arm following CO designation plays an important role in remodeling by maintaining ZHP-&#x00BD; and PLK-2 activity along this region. Together with previous observations, our findings indicate that a biochemical signaling cascade acts in <italic>cis</italic> within individual SC compartments to mediate and respond to CO designation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Libuda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Machovina et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="s2h"><title>Compartmentalization of CO regulation by the synaptonemal complex</title>
<p>Under various conditions, SC proteins self-assemble to form nuclear or cytoplasmic bodies known as &#x201C;polycomplexes&#x201D; that recapitulate the ordered appearance of SCs, but are not associated with chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Roth, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Westergaard and von Wettstein, 1972</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacking the axis protein HTP-3, large polycomplexes self-assemble in oocyte nuclei and persist throughout meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Goodyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rog et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). We recently reported that these nuclear bodies, like SCs, behave as liquid crystalline compartments that self-assemble through coacervation, or liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rog et al., 2017</xref>). We further reported that ZHP-3 localizes throughout polycomplexes in early meiotic prophase. At mid-prophase, a focus of COSA-1 appears at the surface of each polycomplex. Shortly thereafter, ZHP-3 also becomes concentrated at these foci and gradually disappears from the interior of polycomplexes. Thus, ZHP-3 and COSA-1 recapitulate the dynamic relocalization and interdependence that they show at CO sites on the surface of polycomplexes, even in the absence of DSBs or CO intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rog et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate this circuitry further, we disrupted <italic>htp</italic>-<italic>3</italic> in various tagged strains. All 4 ZHP proteins localized throughout polycomplexes during early prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-B</xref>, and data not shown). In contrast to ZHP-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rog et al., 2017</xref>), ZHP-&#x00BD; did not concentrate at COSA-1 foci, but instead remained diffusely localized throughout polycomplexes during late prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-B</xref> and data not shown). Depletion of ZHP-&#x00BD; did not disrupt the appearance of COSA-1 foci during late prophase, but ZHP-3 remained distributed throughout polycomplexes after they appeared, in addition to concentrating with COSA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), indicating that
ZHP-&#x00BD; promote the removal of ZHP-&#x00BE; from these compartments. We also found that MSH-5 colocalized with ZHP-&#x00BE; and COSA-1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Additionally, PLK-2 localized throughout polycomplexes even prior to the appearance of COSA-1 foci, but became noticeably brighter afterwards, in the presence or absence of ZHP-&#x00BD; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Together with the observations of <italic>dsb</italic>-<italic>2</italic> mutants described above, these findings demonstrate that key aspects of the regulatory circuit that designates and constrains COs act autonomously within each contiguous SC or polycomplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Remarkably, this circuit is triggered within polycomplexes even in the absence of CO intermediates. These findings support the idea that CO regulation is mediated through this liquid crystalline medium, which acts as a conduit for the propagation of biochemical signals along individual pairs of chromosomes.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a"><title>Conservation of crossover control mechanisms</title>
<p>Our findings reveal that CO assurance, CO interference, and CO maturation are coordinately mediated by the ZHP RING finger proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G-H</xref>). ZHP-&#x00BE; are required for CO designation, and are depleted from SCs once a CO has been designated, although they are retained at the CO site. Although our observations indicate that ZHP-&#x00BD; do not directly mediate removal of ZHP-&#x00BE;, they act as crucial components of a circuit that reinforces CO designation in an acute, switch-like fashion, likely through a positive feedback loop, and promote CO maturation.</p>
<p>RING finger proteins homologous to the ZHP family play important roles in CO formation in diverse eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwal and Roeder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahuja et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelysheva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lake et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). The cytological distributions and functions of ZHP-&#x00BE; and ZHP-&#x00BD; are very similar to those reported for the mammalian recombination regulators RNF212 and HEI10, respectively. Like ZHP-&#x00BE;, RNF212 is required in mice for CO designation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>), while HEI10, like ZHP-&#x00BD;, is required for robust CO maturation and to limit the number of RNF212/Msh5-positive foci along chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>). HEI10 in <italic>Sordaria</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> may be bifunctional proteins with roles similar to both ZHP-&#x00BD; and ZHP-&#x00BE;, as suggested by their localization to CO sites and the apparent absence of RNF212 in these clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelysheva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Muyt et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings strongly support the idea that this family of RING finger proteins, together with other components, mediates CO assurance and CO interference.</p>
<p>While robust CO interference in <italic>C. elegans</italic> normally limits COs to one per homolog pair, the evidence presented here also suggests how such a network can give rise to classical interference in which multiple COs occur at widely spaced intervals. If, as we propose, interference acts as a signal that initiates at a designated CO and propagates through the SC by diffusion, the likelihood of another CO between the same pair of chromosomes will correlate positively with the frequency of CO designation and distance from an initiation site, and negatively with the rate of signal propagation. Crossover distributions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Neurospora</italic> are consistent with such a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fujitani et al., 2002</xref>). Evidence presented here indicates that both CO designation and signal propagation depend on ZHP activity. This may explain why both RNF212 and HEI10 act as dosage-sensitive modulators of recombination in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Ziolkowski et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In mammals, RNF212 and HEI10 are thought to mediate opposing pro- and anti-crossover activities through SUMOylation and SUMO-dependent ubiquitylation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>); a similar &#x201C;SUMO-ubiquitin switch&#x201D; has been proposed based on findings in Sordaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Muyt et al., 2014</xref>). However, our findings that ZHP-&#x00BD; function similarly to HEI10, while ZHP-&#x00BE; share homology and apparent function with RNF212, raise questions about these conclusions. SUMOylation is essential for SC assembly, and thus for CO regulation, in budding yeast, Sordaria, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Muyt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hooker and Roeder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Klug et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Leung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Voelkel-Meiman et al., 2013</xref>). Budding yeast Zip3 can stimulate SUMOylation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>) yet SUMOylation of SC proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> occurs in its absence, as in the absence of mammalian RNF212. Moreover, such <italic>in vitro</italic> activity can be misleading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Parker and Ulrich, 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic> we do not detect SUMO cytologically either along the SC or at CO sites, even with highly sensitive tools such as epitope-tagged endogenous SUMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pelisch and Hay, 2016</xref>; data not shown). Further, genetic analysis has indicated that SMO-1 (SUMO) and its E2 ligase UBC-9 are dispensable for synapsis and CO control in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, although they play key roles downstream of COs to mediate meiotic chromosome segregation in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pelisch et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, we think it likely that each pair of ZHP proteins acts as a ubiquitin ligase, like the &#x201C;lion&#x2019;s share&#x201D; of RING finger proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We speculate that ZHP-&#x00BE; ensure CO designation by promoting interactions between other CO proteins, such as MSH-4, MSH-5, and COSA-1, at recombination intermediates, as has been proposed for RNF212 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>), but that this occurs through monoubiquitylation. This hypothesis is consistent with evidence that the accumulation of ZHP-3, MSH-5 and COSA-1 at CO sites are interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, ZHP-&#x00BD; appear to mediate the removal of pro-CO factors, including ZHP-&#x00BE;, from the SC. A full understanding of CO control will clearly require identification of the substrates of the ZHP ligase family and the effects of their modification.</p>
<p>Our analysis also reveals that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ZHP proteins function as heterodimers, or perhaps as higher order oligomers. It will be important to determine whether ZHP homologs in other organisms also have obligate partners, or perhaps homooligomerize, since this knowledge may help to illuminate their <italic>in vivo</italic> activities and substrates. <italic>RNF212B</italic>, which encodes a mammalian paralog of <italic>RNF212</italic>, was recently identified as a candidate modifier of meiotic recombination in cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kadri et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that it may act as a partner for RNF212. Multiple protein isoforms are also predicted from the <italic>RNF212</italic> locus, which could act together as dimers or higher-order oligomers.</p></sec>
<sec id="s3b"><title>Regulation of meiotic cohesion by the ZHP family</title>
<p>In addition to their roles in CO control, the ZHP family also link COs to chromosome remodeling, which enables the stepwise release of cohesion during the MI and MII divisions. Specifically, we find that CO designation results in enrichment of ZHP-&#x00BD; along one chromosome arm, which in turn promotes concentration of PLK-2 within this domain, asymmetric disassembly of the SC, and spatial regulation of meiotic cohesion.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether meiotic cohesion in other organisms is regulated in the same fashion. In budding and fission yeasts, Drosophila, diverse plants, and mammals, cohesion near centromeres is specifically retained during the first division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Duro and Marston, 2015</xref>). Cohesin complexes containing the meiosis-specific kleisin Rec8 are enriched in pericentromeric heterochromatin and sometimes at centromere cores, and Shugoshin/MEI-S332, a Rec8-specific protective factor, is also recruited to these regions. In principle, programmed release of cohesion along arms and its retention near centromeres could suffice to allow homologs to segregate in MI while maintaining a link between sisters until MII. However, experimental evidence from several organisms indicates that CO formation leads to a local disruption of cohesion, which can predispose chromosomes to missegregate when COs occur close to centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brar and Amon, 2008</xref>). In light of other similarities between ZHP-&#x00BD; and HEI10, this raises the possibility that HEI10 may also influence meiotic cohesion, perhaps via spatial control of Polo-like kinases, which promote release of cohesion in mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Archambault and Glover, 2009</xref>). If so, HEI10 activity may directly impact chromosome missegregation in human oocytes, which has been attributed to compromised cohesion, and also &#x2013; very recently &#x2013; to inefficient CO maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), another process that involves HEI10.</p></sec>
<sec id="s3c"><title>Spatial compartmentalization of CO control</title>
<p>Evidence that the SC behaves as a phase-separated, liquid crystalline compartment suggested how this interface might act as a conduit for diffusion of biochemical signals along the interface between paired chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rog et al., 2017</xref>). Here we show that all four ZHP proteins localize to polycomplexes, and fail to localize to chromosomes in the absence of synapsis. All known RNF212 and HEI10 homologs also contain predicted coiled-coil domains and localize to the central region of the SC, with the exception of a recently identified homolog in the ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, which lacks a coiled-coil domain, likely related to the fact that this organism lacks SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Shodhan et al., 2017</xref>). These observations support the idea that these proteins are confined and concentrated within this unique compartment. Spatial confinement between homologs can explain how each pair of chromosomes in the same nucleus is regulated independently, although CO designation is normally coupled to global cell cycle signals.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that SC-mediated CO control is a widely conserved feature of meiosis. HEI10 and RNF212 proteins, like the ZHPs, are confined to SCs. It has been argued that CO interference in budding yeast acts at zygonema in an SC-independent way, since Zip3 foci appear along chromosomes and seem to show &#x201C;interference&#x201D; in the absence of the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). This mechanism seems to be fundamentally different from the situation in mammals, plants, and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where synapsis does not require Zip3 homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelysheva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ward et al., 2007</xref>), and CO control is thus likely implemented following SC assembly. Nevertheless, the physical association of Zip3 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> with both SCs and polycomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwal and Roeder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shinohara et al., 2015</xref>) indicates that biochemical aspects of CO designation are conserved between budding yeast and other eukaryotes. It remains unclear how and why crossover control can be implemented either prior to or following SC assembly.</p>
<p>While the SC is an unusual, liquid crystalline compartment, phase separation has been implicated in subcellular compartmentalization of diverse signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, the ZHP proteins and their homologs are very similar to TRIM E3 ligases (tripartite motif: RING, B-box, coiled-coil domain), a very large family of enzymes with diverse cellular roles. The functions of most TRIM ligases are unknown, but like the ZHP proteins, they often form homo-or heterodimers, and large fraction of these proteins appear to localize to cellular compartments, including globular nuclear and cytoplasmic bodies, or to filamentous structures such as microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rajsbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Reymond et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, we speculate that compartmentalized regulatory mechanisms with similarities to the circuitry illuminated here may control many other cellular decisions.</p>

See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS4">Table S4</xref> for a full list of strains used. Unless otherwise indicated, young adults were used for both immunofluorescence and western blotting assays. Synchronized young adults were obtained by picking L4 larvae and culturing them for 20-24 h at 20&#x00B0;C.</p></sec>
<sec id="s4b"><title>Auxin-mediated protein depletion</title>
<p>To deplete AID-tagged proteins in a strain expressing the <italic>AtTIR1</italic> transgene, animals were treated with auxin (indole acetic acid, IAA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, NGM agar was supplemented with 1mM IAA just before pouring plates. <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 bacteria cultures were concentrated and spread on plates, which were allowed to dry before transferring <italic>C. elegans</italic> onto the plates.</p>
<p>We note that two major advantages of the AID system have facilitated our study of these proteins in meiosis: i) this approach enables temporal control and germline-specific degradation of proteins; ii) complex strains that combine various mutations and epitope-tagged alleles can be constructed far more easily, since balancer chromosomes are not required to maintain conditional alleles of genes essential for reproduction. Additionally, control experiments can be performed using the same strains without auxin treatment.</p></sec>
<sec id="s4c"><title>Viability and fertility</title>
<p>To quantify brood size and male self-progeny, L4 hermaphrodites were picked onto individual plates and transferred to new plates daily over 4 days. Eggs were counted every day. Viable progeny and males were counted when the F1 reached the L4 or adult stages. To analyze viability and fertility in the presence of auxin, L1s were transferred onto auxin plates and grown to the L4 stage. Hermaphrodites were then transferred onto fresh auxin plates, transferred daily over 4 days, and progeny were scored as described above.</p></sec>
<sec id="s4d"><title>Recombination mapping by whole genome sequencing</title>
<p>The <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> gene was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in both the N2 Bristol and CB4856 Hawaiian strain backgrounds, as described above (allele designations: <italic>ie43</italic> and <italic>ie46</italic>, respectively). By crossing animals carrying these mutations, we generated N2/CB4856 hybrids lacking <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic>. To map meiotic COs that occurred during oogenesis in these animals, hybrid hermaphrodites were backcrossed to (<italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup>) CB4856 males. Hermaphrodite progeny from this cross were picked to individual 60mm plates and allowed to produce self-progeny until the plates were starved. Genomic DNA was extracted from these pools of progeny using Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit (Qiagen), and quantified by Qubit (Invitrogen). Sequencing libraries were constructed in the Functional Genomics Lab (FGL), a QB3-Berkeley Core Research Facility at UC Berkeley. DNA was Fragmented with an S220 Focused-Ultrasonciator (Covaris), then cleaned &#x0026; concentrated with the MinElute&#x00AE; PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN). Library preparation was done on an Apollo 324&#x2122; with PrepX&#x2122; ILM 32i DNA Library Kits (WaferGen Biosystems, Fremont, CA). 9 cycles of PCR amplification were used. The average insert size of libraries was 380bp. 150PE sequencing at approximately 9x coverage was carried out on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 by the Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Laboratory at UC Berkeley. Two libraries for each of the parental strains (N2 and CB4856) were prepared in parallel, sequenced at 30x coverage, and aligned to the reference genome sequences available through Wormbase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). To map COs, the data were analyzed using the MSG software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/msg">https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/msg</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andolfatto et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="s4e"><title>Yeast two-hybrid analysis</title>
<p>To test for interactions among the ZHP proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system, coding sequences for ZHP-1-V5, ZHP-2-3xFLAG, ZHP-3-3xFLAG and ZHP-4-HA were synthesized as gBlocks by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Epitope tags were appended to the protein sequences so that expression in yeast could be monitored. The coding sequence for ZHP-4 was codon-optimized by IDT to facilitate gBlock synthesis and expression in yeast. Each of these sequences was fused to both the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the GAL4 activation domain by insertion into pDEST32 and pDEST22, respectively, using the Gateway cloning system, following the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions (Invitrogen).</p>
<p>All possible pairwise combinations of the four ZHP proteins, including potential homodimers, were tested using the Proquest<sup>TM</sup> Two-Hybrid System (Invitrogen). Briefly, each pair of bait and prey plasmids was co-transformed into yeast strain MaV203 using standard LiAc-mediated transformation. To test for specific interactions, 2-4 independent clones of each strain were assayed for <italic>HIS3</italic>, <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>LacZ</italic> induction. Negative and positive controls provided with the Proquest<sup>TM</sup> kit were run in parallel.</p></sec>

Primary antibodies were obtained from commercial sources or have been previously described, and were diluted as follows: Rabbit anti-SYP-1 [1:500, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>)], Rabbit anti-SYP-2 [1:500, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Colaiacovo et al., 2003</xref>)], Rabbit anti-HTP-1 [1:500, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</xref>)], Rabbit anti-RAD-51 (1:5,000, Novus Biologicals, #29480002), Rabbit anti-pHIM-8/ZIMs [1:500, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kim et al., 2015</xref>)], Rabbit MSH-5 [1:5,000, modENCODE/SDIX, #SDQ2376, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>)], Rabbit anti-REC-8 (1:5,000, modENCODE/SDIX, #SDQ0802), Rabbit anti-COH-3 (1:5,000, modENCODE/SDIX, #SDQ3972), Guinea pig anti-PLK-2 [1:100, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Harper et al., 2011</xref>)], Goat anti-SYP-1 [1:300, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Harper et al., 2011</xref>)], Chicken anti-HTP-3 [1:500, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>)], Rabbit anti-ZHP-3 (1:5,000, modENCODE/SDIX, #SDQ3956), Rat anti-HIM-8 [1:500, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>)], Mouse anti-FLAG (1:500, Sigma, #F1804), Mouse anti-HA (1:400, Thermo Fisher, #26183), Mouse anti-V5 (1:500, Thermo Fisher, #R960-25), Rabbit anti-V5 (1:250, Sigma, #V8137), Mouse anti-GFP (1:500, Roche, #11814460001). Secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa 488, Cy3 or Cy5 were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch and used at 1:500.</p>
<p>Chromosomal in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>) with modifications. Briefly, worms were dissected and fixed essentially according to the immunofluorescence protocol described above. Fixed worm gonads were then washed with 2xSSCT and treated with 50&#x0025; formamide overnight at 37&#x00B0;C. Tissue and probes were denatured at 91&#x00B0;C for 2 min, then hybridized overnight at 37&#x00B0;C. Hybridized gonads were then washed and stained with DAPI. Two chromosome-specific probes were used: an oligonucleotide targeting a short repetitive sequence on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lieb et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>) and the 5S rDNA repeat on the right arm of chromosome V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>). FISH probes were labeled with aminoallyl-dUTP (Sigma) by terminal transferase-mediated 3&#x2019; end-labeling, followed by conjugation to Alexa 488-NHS-ester (Molecular Probes) or Cy3-NHS-ester (Amersham), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dernburg, 2011</xref>)</p>
<p>All images were acquired as z-stacks through 8-&#x03BC;m depth at intervals of 0.2 &#x03BC;m using a DeltaVision Elite microscope (GE) with a 100x, 1.4 N.A. oil-immersion objective. Iterative 3D deconvolution, image projection and colorization were carried out using the SoftWoRx package and Adobe Photoshop CC 2014.</p></sec>
<sec id="s4g"><title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Adult worms were picked into SDS sample buffer and lysed by boiling for 30 min, a single freeze/thaw cycle in liquid nitrogen, and occasionally vortexing. Whole worm lysates were separated on 4-12&#x0025; polyacrylamide gradient gels and blotted with indicated antibodies: Mouse anti-GFP (1:1,000, Roche, #11814460001), Mouse anti-FLAG (1:1,000, Sigma, #F1804), Mouse anti-HA (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher, #26183), Mouse anti-V5 (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher, #R960-25), Mouse anti-&#x03B1;-tubulin (1:5,000, EMD MILLIPORE, #05-829), Guinea pig anti-HTP-3 [1:1,500, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>)]. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratory, #115-035-068) and SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher, #34095) were used for detection.</p>
<p>To quantify western blots, TIF images were collected for each blot using a Chemidoc system (Bio-Rad). Integrated intensities for relevant bands were then calculated using ImageJ. To normalize for sample loading, the indicated band intensity was divided by the corresponding &#x03B1;-tubulin or HTP-3 band intensity. Each normalized band intensity was expressed as the percentage of the intensity at t=0 or in a control sample.</p>

<p>(A-C) Null mutations in <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> and <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>3</italic> result in identical effects to AID-mediated depletion. Upper: Representative examples of DAPI-stained oocyte nuclei at diakinesis. Lower: Graphs indicating the distribution of nuclei containing various numbers of DAPI-staining bodies. Note: the observed number of DAPI-staining bodies, on average, is slightly lower than the true mean, since occasionally univalent or bivalent chromosomes in the same nucleus cannot be clearly resolved. (A) Auxin treatment does not impair chiasma formation in wild-type hermaphrodites. (B) A few bivalents are detected in <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> null mutants, as in <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1::AID</italic> animals treated with 1 mM auxin. (C) No bivalents are observed in <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>3</italic> null mutants, as in <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>3::AID</italic> hermaphrodites exposed to auxin. <italic>n</italic> = the number of nuclei scored for each condition or genotype. (D,E) Synapsis and homolog pairing occur normally in the absence of any of the ZHP proteins. (D) Projection images of representative pachytene nuclei stained for SYP-1 (green) and HTP-3 (red), revealing normal synapsis in ZHP-depleted worms. Animals expressing the indicated transgene, along with germline-expressed TIR1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) were incubated on plates with or without 1mM auxin for 24 h before dissection. (E) Images of representative early prophase nuclei stained for HIM-8 (yellow), which specifically marks the pairing center region of the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>), and DNA (blue). Robust pairing of HIM-8 foci in early meiotic prophase is observed. Normal pairing at other chromosomal loci was confirmed by FISH (data not shown). (F-M) DSBs are induced and the crossover assurance checkpoint is triggered in the absence of any of the ZHP proteins. (F) Projection images of mid-pachytene nuclei stained for RAD-51 (yellow) and DNA (blue), showing accumulation of DSB repair intermediates in the absence of ZHP-1 or ZHP-4. (G-J) Quantification of RAD-51 foci. Gonads were divided into six zones of equal length, spanning the premeiotic through late pachytene region. The average number of RAD-51 foci per nucleus is plotted for each zone.

Insets on the right show larger magnification images of the indicated nuclei at mid-or late pachynema. (A, C) MSH-5 foci normally peak at mid-pachytene, when 10-20 can be detected per nucleus (B) No MSH-5 foci were detected when ZHP-4 was depleted for 24h.

<p>(A) Western blot showing efficient auxin-mediated depletion of DSB-2 alone, or co-depletion of ZHP-2 and DSB-2. Tubulin was blotted as a loading control. 3F: 3xFLAG. (B) Low magnification images of gonads from worms 48 h post-L4 stained against RAD-51 (yellow), GFP-COSA-1 (green), SYP-1 (red) and DNA (blue). RAD-51 staining in the upper panel indicates that few DSBs are induced in the absence of DSB-2. The lower panel shows GFP-COSA-1 and SYP-1 staining in the same gonad. A few bright GFP-COSA-1 foci are detected in the absence of ZHP-2 when the number of DSBs is limited by DSB-2 depletion. Insets show enlargements of corresponding regions of the gonad. (C) SPO-11 activity is effectively abrogated by AID-mediated depletion. Projection images of pachytene nuclei stained for RAD-51 (yellow), DNA (blue), GFP-COSA-1 (green) and SYP-1 (red). DSBs were induced by ionizing radiation following depletion of SPO-11. No COSA-1 foci were observed in unirradiated animals, but CO designation was rescued following 10 Gy of irradiation. (D-F) Partial depletion of ZHP-2 does not uncouple its roles in crossover interference and crossover maturation (D) Western blots showing partial depletion of AID-tagged ZHP-2 in animals exposed to low concentrations of auxin. (E) Quantification of ZHP-2 depletion. The intensity of ZHP-2 bands were normalized against the corresponding tubulin band, and expressed as percentage of the intensity in a control sample. The graph shows the mean&#x00B1;SD protein levels from three independent experiments. (F) Low-magnification images of late pachytene nuclei stained for GFP-COSA-1 (green) and SYP-1 (red).

<caption><title>ZHP-&#x00BD; are required for chromosome remodeling.</title>
<p>(A,B) Images of late pachytene nuclei stained for SYP-1 (green) and HTP-1 (red). (A) In <italic>dsb</italic>-<italic>2</italic> null mutants 48 h post-L4, most nuclei have 2-4 COs. Although disassembly of SYP-1 and HTP-1 are delayed due to activation of the CO assurance checkpoint, these proteins eventually show reciprocal localization on CO-designated chromosomes, while univalent chromosomes retain HTP-1 but not SYP-1. (B) In <italic>zhp</italic>-<italic>1</italic> null mutants, SYP-1 and HTP-1 remain colocalized with each other on all chromosomes, despite the formation of &#x223C;2-3 COs per nucleus. Univalent chromosomes also show persistent staining with both HTP-1 and SYP-1. Insets showing enlarged views of the indicated nuclei. (C,D) ZHP-2 are required for asymmetric localization of PLK-2 following crossover designation. (C) In wild-type nuclei (or animals expressing ZHP-AID in the absence of auxin), PLK-2 (red) concentrates along the presumptive short arms following crossover designation. (D) When ZHP-2 is depleted, PLK-2 localizes to a subset of CO-designated sites (likely those that will mature as COs), but does not show asymmetric localization along the SCs. (E) High-magnification images of maturing oocytes stained for the kleisin proteins REC-8 or COH-3 and the HORMA domain protein HTP-3, which persists along all arms of bivalents. Worms were treated with or without auxin for 48 h. In the most mature, or &#x201C;-1&#x201D; oocytes, REC-8 normally becomes enriched on the long arms, while COH-3 is retained on short arms. In the absence of ZHP-2, removal of REC-8 from short arms was defective and retention of COH-3 was rarely observed. Scale bars, 5 &#x03BC;m. Scale bar for insets in (C-E), 1 &#x03BC;m</p></caption>
