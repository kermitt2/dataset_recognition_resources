<title>Abstract</title>
<p>For diseases such as influenza, where the majority of infected persons experience mild (if any) symptoms, surveillance systems are sensitive to changes in healthcare-seeking and clinical decision-making behaviours. This presents a challenge when trying to interpret surveillance data in near-real-time (e.g., in order to provide public health decision-support). Australia experienced a particularly large and severe influenza season in 2017, perhaps in part due to (a) mild cases being more likely to seek healthcare; and (b) clinicians being more likely to collect specimens for RT-PCR influenza tests. In this study we used weekly Flutracking surveillance data to estimate the probability that a person with influenza-like illness (ILI) would seek healthcare and have a specimen collected. We then used this estimated probability to calibrate near-real-time seasonal influenza forecasts at each week of the 2017 season, to see whether predictive skill could be improved. While the number of self-reported influenza tests in the weekly surveys are typically very low, we were able to detect a substantial change in healthcare seeking behaviour and clinician testing behaviour prior to the high epidemic peak. Adjusting for these changes in behaviour in the forecasting framework improved predictive skill. Our analysis demonstrates a unique value of community-level surveillance systems, such as Flutracking, when interpreting traditional surveillance data.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Public health surveillance systems provide valuable insights into disease incidence, which can inform preparedness and response activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The data obtained from these systems must be interpreted appropriately, which requires an understanding of the characteristics of each system. For example, there is a well-established need to &#x201C;understand the processes that determine how persons are identified by surveillance systems in order to appropriately adjust for the biases that may be present&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The importance of understanding how people are identified by a surveillance system is particularly problematic in the context of near-real-time influenza forecasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], because healthcare-seeking behaviours and clinical decision-making are dynamic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] and are subject to acute influences (e.g., media coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]). The challenge that this poses is further compounded by delays in data collection and reporting, which reduce forecast performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. And in the event of a pandemic, changes in patient and clinician behaviours are likely to be even more pronounced, with ramifications not only for interpreting surveillance data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], but also for delivering effective and proportionate public health responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. For influenza and influenza-like illnesses (ILI), the Flutracking online community surveillance system offers unique perspectives on disease incidence and severity in Australia, but also on healthcare-seeking behaviours and clinical decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>The 2017 influenza season was particularly severe in most of Australia, with an unprecedented number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, and high consultation, hospitalisation, and mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. The 2017 season presented a very real challenge to public health staff in Australia for a number of reasons, among which were the unprecedented scale of the surveillance data and the delays in reporting that this entailed. In the subsequent 2017/18 northern hemisphere influenza season, the dominant strain was frequently referred to as the &#x201C;Australian flu&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p>We have previously adapted epidemic forecasting methods to the Australian context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Notable features of this context include: more than half of the population reside in the five largest cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide), which are sparsely distributed across a landmass approximately the same size as continental USA; ILI data are available from sentinel surveillance systems and public health services, but on a much smaller scale than, e.g, the ILINet system in the USA; and laboratory-confirmed influenza infections data are available, but testing denominators are typically only provided by public laboratories (which comprise only a small proportion of all laboratory testing). In previous work we have applied these forecasting methods to individual Australian cities, and have used them to compare multiple surveillance systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], developed model-selection methods to measure the benefit of incorporating climatic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], and have deployed these forecasts in real-time in collaboration with public health staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Most recently, we have used these methods to quantify the impact of delays in reporting and to highlight challenges in accounting for population and clinician behaviour changes in response to a severe season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>In 2017 we produced weekly near-real-time influenza forecasts for the capital cities of three Australian states: Sydney (New South Wales), Brisbane (Queensland), and Melbourne (Victoria). As described previously, we performed a one-off re-calibration of our real-time influenza forecasts (2&#x2013;5 weeks prior to the observed peaks), which improved the forecast performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. This was a manual process and was informed by qualitative expert opinion rather than by quantitative methods. In the 2018 influenza season we also began producing weekly near-real-time influenza forecasts for Perth, the capital city of Western Australia.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate how the use of community-level ILI surveillance data, as captured by the Flutracking surveillance system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], may allow us to re-calibrate our forecasts in real-time based on quantitative measures, and potentially improve forecast performance. We use the 2014&#x2013;16 seasons in these four cities for calibration, and the 2017 season in these four cities as a case study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Retrospective analysis revealed that in the 2017 influenza season there was a marked increase in the probability that Flutracking participants with ILI symptoms (defined in Methods <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4a">section 4.1</xref>) would seek healthcare and have a specimen collected for testing, relative to previous influenza seasons, in all states except Western Australia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In the other influenza seasons (2014&#x2013;2016) there was no such increase; this probability remained very similar to the average of the 2014 season (horizontal dashed lines in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Queensland was the one exception, where this probability did increase in 2015 and 2016, but not by the same scale as observed in 2017.</p>

<title>Relating Flutracking trends to the general population in 2014&#x2013;16</title>
<p>We hypothesised that these trends in influenza testing would also be reflected in the general population, but that there may be a <italic>difference in scale</italic> between the behaviour changes reported in the Flutracking surveys and those of the general population. We introduced a scaling factor <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> to characterise the relationship between the testing probability obtained from the Flutracking surveys and the testing probability of the general population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). When <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> &#x003D; 1 the change in the population testing probability <italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(<italic>w</italic>) &#x2014; relative to its initial value <italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(0) &#x2014; is the same as the change in the Flutracking testing probability <italic>P</italic> (Test<italic>|</italic>ILI, <italic>week</italic> &#x003D; <italic>w</italic>) relative to its initial value <italic>&#x00B5;</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x003D; <italic>P</italic> (Test<italic>|</italic>ILI, <italic>week</italic> &#x003D; 0). When <italic>&#x03BA; &#x003E;</italic> 1, the population testing probability is more sensitive to changes in the Flutracking testing probability. And when <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> &#x003D; 0 we recover the <italic>non-calibrated forecasts</italic>&#x2014; i.e., the forecasts obtained without accounting for any behaviour changes. We used retrospective forecasts to identify an optimal value for this scaling parameter.</p>
<fig id="fig3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<caption><p>The testing probability <italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(<italic>w</italic>) for the general population is a smooth function of the testing probability <italic>P</italic> (Test<italic>|</italic>ILI, <italic>week</italic> &#x003D; <italic>w</italic>) obtained from the Flutracking data (left panel). Note that this relationship is non-linear as the Flutracking testing probability approaches zero, in order to ensure that the population testing probability remains non-negative, and that the Flutracking testing probability is defined in terms of its initial value <italic>&#x00B5;</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x003D; <italic>P</italic> (Test<italic>|</italic>ILI, <italic>week</italic> &#x003D; 0).

<p>We produced retrospective weekly influenza forecasts for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 influenza seasons for the capital cities of four Australian states: Sydney (New South Wales), Brisbane (Queensland), Melbourne (Victoria), and Perth (Western Australia). At each week, the forecasts were calibrated based on the Flutracking survey data, by adjusting the <italic>testing probability p</italic><sub>id</sub>(<italic>w</italic>) at each week <italic>w</italic>. This testing probability was used to relate disease incidence in epidemic simulations to reported surveillance data (see Methods <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4d">section 4.4</xref>). We evaluated how this calibration affected forecast performance, according to four different forecasting targets:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>&#x201C;Now-casts&#x201D;: how well forecasts predicted the observation for the forecasting date itself.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x201C;Next 2 weeks&#x201D;: how well forecasts predicted observations 1&#x2013;2 weeks after the forecasting date.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x201C;Next 4 weeks&#x201D;: how well forecasts predicted observations 1&#x2013;4 weeks after the forecasting date.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x201C;Next 6 weeks&#x201D;: how well forecasts predicted observations 1&#x2013;6 weeks after the forecasting date.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Forecast performance was evaluated using Bayes factors, which are the ratio of the likelihood that the available data support two competing hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In this study we used the ratio of the calibrated forecast likelihood (where <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> &#x003D; <italic>k</italic>) to the non-calibrated forecast likelihood, averaged over all of the forecasting weeks, and reported the logarithm <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="475756_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of this average, which we denote the &#x201C;mean performance&#x201D; (see Methods <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4e">section 4.5</xref> for details). Where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="475756_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> the <italic>calibrated forecasts</italic> are considered to be more strongly supported by the data, and where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="475756_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> the <italic>non-calibrated forecasts</italic>are considered to be more strongly supported. To measure forecast performance over multiple years, we normalised the mean performance <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="475756_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in each year and reported the mean <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="475756_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of these annual values, which we denote the &#x201C;mean normalised performance&#x201D;.</p>
<p>There were consistent trends across these four targets in each city, and substantial differences in performance between the cities, as summarised in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. For values of <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> between 1 and 5, the calibrated forecasts strongly out-performed the non-calibrated forecasts in both Brisbane and Melbourne. Over a similar range, the calibrated forecasts showed no improvement in Sydney, and performed much worse in Perth than the non-calibrated forecasts. Note that in Sydney, for 0 <italic>&#x003C; &#x03BA; &#x2264;</italic> 2 the forecast performance was not meaningfully better <italic>or</italic> worse than the non-calibrated forecasts (<italic>K</italic> &#x003D; 0).</p>

<title>Incorporating Flutracking trends into 2017 forecasts</title>
<p>The next question was whether the optimal value of <italic>&#x03BA;</italic>, as chosen based on the results for 2014&#x2013;16, would have led to improved forecast performance in 2017. In other words, are these findings of value in a real-time context?</p>
<p>In a retrospective analysis, we measured the forecast performance for the 2017 influenza season over the same range of values for <italic>&#x03BA;</italic>, in order to evaluate how well the chosen value of <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> &#x003D; 1.75 would have performed. Note that this represents what would have been possible in real-time in the 2017 season. The calibrated testing probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(<italic>w</italic>) are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, and the resulting performance according to each of the forecasting targets is shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>When we set <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> &#x003D; 1.75 (the optimal value according to the 2014&#x2013;16 forecasts) forecast performance in 2017 was near-optimal according to all forecasting targets in all cities except Perth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This was even true of Sydney, where similar values of <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> in the 2014&#x2013;16 seasons had minimal impact on forecast performance. Note that the relative magnitudes of the performance according to each target is to be expected, since each target considers a different number of observations, and so a ten-fold improvement in predicting a single observation causes a hundred-fold improvement in predicting two observations.</p>
<p>For illustration, a subset of the Brisbane 2017 forecasts are shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, which shows how well the forecast predictions match the reported data over a range of values for <italic>&#x03BA;</italic>, and at different times during the 2017 season.</p>

<p>Incorporating the behavioural trends estimated from the Flutracking self-reported influenza tests into the 2014&#x2013;16 forecasts greatly improved influenza forecast performance in both Brisbane and Melbourne, but had negligible effect on performance in Sydney and substantially reduced performance in Perth (this was not unexpected, see the next section). We explored the relationship between the Flutracking survey data and the testing probability in the general population, identifying an optimal scaling value of <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> &#x003D; 1.75. This should be interpreted as meaning that behaviour changes in the general population were 75&#x0025; larger than the behaviour changes characterised in the Flutracking survey data (where &#x201C;behaviour changes&#x201D; refers to healthcare-seeking behaviours and to clinician testing practices).</p>
<p>Using this same value for the scaling parameter in the 2017 forecasts greatly improved performance in both Brisbane and Melbourne, and also in Sydney. When we explored a wide range of values for the scaling parameter, these performance improvements were found to be near-optimal. Performance in Perth was reduced, but not as substantially as in the 2014&#x2013;16 forecasts.</p>
<p>Similar performance improvements would have been obtained in the 2014&#x2013;16 seasons, and in the 2017 season, if we had instead assumed that there was no difference between Flutracking participants and the general population (i.e., had we set <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> &#x003D; 1). This provides evidence that, with the possible exception of Perth, the behaviour changes characterised by the Flutracking data are not strongly biased.</p>
<p>These findings demonstrate that the insights into healthcare behaviours that are provided by community-level surveillance systems such as Flutracking can greatly improve the performance of influenza forecasting systems. This is particularly true in the event of an unusual epidemic, such as those observed in the 2017 Australian influenza season, where these behaviours may change substantially relative to previous seasons, and also over the course of the epidemic. Improvements in forecast performance are also likely in the event of a pandemic, where the perception of risk is likely to differ markedly from seasonal epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Incorporating these kinds of behavioural insights may also improve the performance of other infectious disease forecasting systems.</p>

<title>Study strengths and weaknesses</title>
<p>It is intrinsically difficult to incorporate the dynamics of human behaviour into an infectious disease modelling framework, as we have attempted here, because it involves many complexities and sources of uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Retrospective analyses of data from multiple surveillance systems have previously been used to estimate disease severity in, e.g., the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], and evidence synthesis in a modelling framework is an active area of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. However, the use of one surveillance system to calibrate the interpretation of another in real-time is, to our knowledge, a novel and significant contribution of this study.</p>
<p>The methods outlined here are also applicable beyond the Australian context. Surveillance systems similar to Flutracking operate around the world, including Influenzanet in many European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] and Flu Near You in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
<p>We have used data from multiple cities that routinely experience seasonal influenza epidemics, but which are geographically and climatically diverse. As the results for Perth show, incorporating behaviour changes into the forecasts is not guaranteed to improve forecast performance. But it does appear that the impact is reasonably consistent within a specific context, such as the same city from one year to the next. This was not an issue of sample size, since there are a similar number of participants from Western Australia as there are for other Australian states (see Appendix A). Instead, it is likely due to differences in the surveillance data (detailed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4c">section 4.3</xref>). The Perth data were obtained from the public pathology laboratory (PathWest) and did not include serologic test results or data from private laboratories. Furthermore, these data contained a much higher proportion of hospitalised cases (40&#x2013;60&#x0025;) than did the data for the other cities in this study. Since people with severe disease will most likely seek healthcare, regardless of behavioural influences, we would expect these data to be less sensitive to behaviour changes in the general community.</p>
<p>It may also reflect, in part, that Western Australia typically experiences an influenza season that is markedly different from the rest of the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. The testing probability for Western Australia was near-constant and differed little across the 2014&#x2013;17 seasons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), and so it is possible that the &#x201C;signal&#x201D; in the Flutracking data for Western Australia was, in fact, noise. In contrast, for Sydney there was no clear signal in the Flutracking data for the 2014&#x2013;16 seasons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and no improvement in forecast performance in these years (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). However, there was a marked change in the testing probability for Sydney in the 2017 season (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and accounting for this yielded a substantial increase in forecast performance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Meaning and implications</title>
<p>Infectious diseases that primarily cause mild (if any) symptoms are difficult to observe, especially in a <italic>consistent manner</italic>. The visibility of such cases to a surveillance system is sensitive to human behaviours that are primarily based on the perception of risk, which is subject to many influencing factors and can change rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Seasonal influenza is an archetypal example, which routinely presents a substantial challenge to healthcare systems in temperate climates, and whose clinical severity profile can differ substantially from one year to the next, and from setting to setting (e.g., city to city). Infectious disease forecasting is now beginning to establish itself as a useful decision-support tool for public health preparedness and response activities, particularly for seasonal influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. One of the many challenges for this field is to account for how behaviour changes affect surveillance data, and how these data should be interpreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Many sources of &#x201C;non-traditional&#x201D; data have been explored for their potential to improve infectious disease forecast performance, such as internet search engine queries and social media trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. While these non-traditional data may indeed provide useful and valid insights, it is unclear how representative they are of disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], especially since those populations that experience the greatest burden of disease are also likely to be the most under-represented in these data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Here, we have used a community-level surveillance system that is explicitly designed to capture influenza-like illness activity outside of healthcare systems, and associated healthcare-seeking behaviour. We argue that the Flutracking survey data provide a much more direct and meaningful quantification of how visible cases are to routine surveillance systems, and have shown here that incorporation of these data yield substantial improvements in forecast performance in what was an unprecedented influenza season.</p>
<p>During the early months of the 2017 Australian influenza season (up to the end of July), at which time we were not using Flutracking data to calibrate our forecasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], our near-real-time influenza forecasts were predicting the epidemic peaks to be similar in size to previous years, and to occur in early August. These would have been relatively early peaks &#x2014; although not unusually so &#x2014; and these predictions were <italic>consistent with expert opinion at that time</italic>. Had we been in a position to incorporate the Flutracking survey data into our forecasts at that time using the methods introduced in this study, we would have had advance warning that, contrary to our original predictions <italic>and</italic> expert opinion, we should have expected later (and, therefore, also larger) epidemic peaks. An early warning of this kind, which indicates that the current situation appears to be unusual and is inconsistent with &#x201C;usual&#x201D; expectations, is in itself a valuable decision-support tool, even in the absence of an accurate prediction of what will eventuate.</p>
<p>Seasonal influenza epidemics, and the threat of pandemic influenza, continue to present substantial challenges for public health preparedness and response in temperate climates, some 100 years after the 1918&#x2013;19 influenza pandemic. Further complicating these activities are human behaviour changes, which confound the interpretation of surveillance data. However, as we have shown here, community-level surveillance is able to provide key insights into behaviour changes that can substantially improve near-real-time epidemic prediction and assessment. These advantages are of very real value to public health preparedness and response activities in the 21st century.</p>

<title>Flutracking survey data</title>
<p>Flutracking weekly surveys were completed online voluntarily by community members in Australia and New Zealand. Participants responded to the weekly survey from April to October each year, and submitted surveys for themselves, and/or on behalf of other household members. The cohort of participants was maintained from year to year, unless participants unsubscribed. Participants were recruited online through workplace campaigns, current participants, the Flutracking website, traditional media and social media promotion.</p>
<p>Weekly counts of completed Flutracking surveys, self-reported ILI, and self-reported influenza tests were obtained from 2014 to 2017 for participants who had a usual postcode of residence in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia (see Appendix A for descriptive statistics of Flutracking data).</p>
<p>A participant with ILI was defined as having both self-reported fever and cough in the past week (ending Sunday). Any responses of &#x201C;don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; to &#x201C;fever&#x201D;, &#x201C;cough&#x201D;, or &#x201C;time off work or normal duties&#x201D; variables were removed from Flutracking data prior to data provision. This removed 0.9&#x0025; of all surveys. Only new ILI symptoms were counted in the analysis. New symptoms were defined as the first week of a participant reporting ILI symptoms (where there were consecutive weeks of reporting ILI symptoms). If a participant reported ILI symptoms in one week, and then reported at least one week of no symptoms, followed by another report of symptoms, then this second symptom report was considered a new incident of ILI.</p>
<p>Participants with ILI who reported seeking health advice for their symptoms were asked whether they had been tested for influenza. Any self-reported influenza tests during an ILI incident were recorded in the same week of the new ILI symptoms (even if the test result was reported during the second, third or fourth week of illness). We acknowledge that Flutracking participant health seeking and testing behaviours may not be representative of the general Australian population. Flutracking has disproportionately high numbers of participants who are female, of working age, health care workers, have higher educational achievement, and have received influenza vaccination. Flutracking has a disproportionately lower number of participants who are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>

<title>Estimating the probability of an influenza test, given ILI symptoms</title>
<p>We used a Beta distribution to estimate the probability that a Flutracking participant with ILI symptoms sought healthcare and had a specimen collected for testing, because it is a suitable model for the distribution of a probability value. If we treat each participant with ILI symptoms as an independent binomial trial, where success is defined as that participant reporting they had a specimen collected for testing, then we obtain a Beta posterior distribution from a Beta prior distribution by conditioning on the results of each weekly Flutracking survey.</p>
<p>We specified separate prior means (<italic>&#x00B5;</italic><sub>0</sub>) for each state, based on the 2014 Flutracking data for that state, and used a common prior variance (<italic>&#x03C3;</italic><sup>2</sup>), in order to determine the initial shape parameters (<italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>0</sub>):</p>

<title>Influenza surveillance data</title>
<p>For three of the cities for which we generated forecasts &#x2014; Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney &#x2014; we obtained influenza case notifications data for the 2014&#x2013;2017 calendar years from the relevant data custodian. These data include only those cases which meet the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], and represent only a small proportion of the actual cases in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].</p>
<p>For Perth, we obtained PCR-confirmed diagnoses from PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA (the Western Australia public pathology laboratory) for the 2014&#x2013;2017 calendar years. In comparison to the notifications data obtained for the other cities in this study, these data do not include serologic diagnoses. They also contain a much higher proportion of hospitalised cases (40&#x2013;60&#x0025;), which is further magnified because the bulk of PathWest community specimens come from regional and remote areas. People whose symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in hospitalisation will most likely seek healthcare, regardless of any other behavioural influences, and so these data are likely to exhibit little sensitivity to behaviour changes characterised in the Flutracking survey data.</p>
<p>Many specimen do not include a symptom onset date, in which case we used the specimen collection date as a proxy. The difference between the time of symptom onset and the collection date is assumed to be less than one week for the majority of cases, and since we aggregate the case counts by week, we assume that this does not substantially impact the resulting time-series data.</p>
<p>Note that in this study we used the weekly case counts as reported after the 2017 influenza season had finished and all tests had been processed.</p>

<title>Forecasting methods</title>
<p>We generated near-real-time forecasts by combining an <italic>SEIR</italic> compartment model of infection with influenza case counts through the use of a bootstrap particle filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>First, we constructed a multivariate normal distribution for the peak timing and size in years prior to 2017, to characterise our prior expectation for the 2017 season. Parameter values for the <italic>SEIR</italic> model were then sampled from uniform distributions, and each sample was accepted in proportion to the simulated epidemic&#x2019;s probability density. See Appendix B for details.</p>
<p>We modelled the relationship between disease incidence in the <italic>SEIR</italic> model and the influenza case counts using a negative binomial distribution with dispersion parameter <italic>k</italic>, since the data are non-negative integer counts and are over-dispersed when compared to a Poisson distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The probability of being <italic>observed</italic> (i.e., of being reported as a notifiable case) was the product of two probabilities: that of becoming infectious (<italic>p</italic><sub>inf</sub>), and that of being identified (<italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(<italic>w</italic>), the probability of being symptomatic, presenting to a doctor, and having a specimen collected). The probability of becoming infectious was defined as the fraction of the <italic>model</italic> population that became infectious (i.e., transitioned from <italic>E</italic> to <italic>I</italic>), and subsumed symptomatic and asymptomatic infections:</p>

</disp-formula>
<p>Values for <italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(0) and <italic>k</italic> were informed by retrospective forecasts using surveillance data from previous seasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], while the background rate <italic>p</italic><sub>bg</sub> was estimated from out-of-season levels (March to May, 2017). The climatic modulation signals <italic>F</italic>(<italic>w</italic>) were characterised by smoothed absolute humidity data for each city in previous years, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>To calibrate the forecasts at each week <italic>w</italic>, we scaled the reference testing probability <italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(0) in proportion to the change in the expected testing probability (relative to the prior expectation), using a scaling coefficient <italic>&#x03BA;</italic>. When the change was negative (i.e., the expected testing probability was less than the prior expectation) we instead raised the change to the power <italic>&#x03BA;</italic>, to ensure that the calibrated value <italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(<italic>w</italic>) was strictly positive:</p>

<p>As required, this is a smooth function of the change in the expected testing probability. We recover the non-calibrated forecasts by setting <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> &#x003D; 0, in which case <italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(<italic>w</italic>) &#x003D; <italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(0), as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Forecasting methods</title>
<p>We applied the forecasting method used in our previous forecasting studies [3,9,10,23,24], which combines an <italic>SEIR</italic> compartment model of infection with influenza case counts through the use of a bootstrap particle filter.</p>
<p>In brief, we randomly selected parameter values (Table A2) for the <italic>SEIR</italic> model (Eqs A1&#x2013;A6) to generate a suite of candidate epidemics, and defined a relationship between disease incidence in the <italic>SEIR</italic> model and the influenza case counts (an &#x201C;observation model&#x201D;, Eqs A7&#x2013;A11). This allowed us to calculate the likelihood of &#x201C;observing&#x201D; the case counts from each of the model simulations. The particle filter (Eqs A12&#x2013;A16) was used to update these likelihoods (&#x201C;weights&#x201D; <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) as data (<bold>y<sub>t</sub></bold>) were reported, and to discard extremely unlikely simulations in favour of more likely ones (&#x201C;resampling&#x201D;).</p>
<p>For each city, we constructed a multivariate normal distribution from the observed peak timing and size in each of the 2012&#x2013;16 influenza seasons (Table A3). For each set of sampled parameter values, we simulated the epidemic that those values described and accepted the sample in proportion to the simulated epidemic&#x2019;s probability density according to this multivariate distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>

<p>As in our previous studies, we assumed the relationship between disease incidence in the <italic>SEIR</italic> model and the weekly case counts was defined by a negative binomial distribution with dispersion parameter <italic>k</italic> (Eqs A7&#x2013;A8), since the data are non-negative integer counts and are over-dispersed when compared to a Poisson distribution. The probability of being <italic>observed</italic> (i.e., of being reported as a notifiable case, Eq A9) was the product of two probabilities: that of becoming infectious (<italic>p</italic><sub>inf</sub>), and that of being identified (<italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>, the likelihood of being symptomatic, presenting to a doctor, and having a specimen collected). The probability of becoming infectious was defined as the fraction of the <italic>model</italic> population that became infectious (i.e., transitioned from <italic>E</italic> to <italic>I</italic>), and subsumed symptomatic and asymptomatic infections (Eq A11).</p>
<p>Values for <italic>p</italic><sub>id</sub>(0) and <italic>k</italic> were informed by retrospective forecasts using surveillance data from previous seasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], while the background rate <italic>p</italic><sub>bg</sub> was estimated from out-of-season levels (March to May) in each year. The climatic modulation signals <italic>F</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) were characterised by smoothed absolute humidity data for each city in previous years, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Forecasts were generated using the pypfilt and epifx packages for Python, which were developed as part of this project and are distributed under permissive free software licenses. Installation instructions and tutorial documentation are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://epifx.readthedocs.io/">https://epifx.readthedocs.io/</ext-link>.</p>
