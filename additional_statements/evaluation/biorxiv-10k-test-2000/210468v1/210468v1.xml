<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p>Influenza virus can completely escape most antibodies with single mutations. However, rare antibodies broadly neutralize many viral strains. It is unclear how easily influenza virus might escape such antibodies if they became widespread due to therapeutic use or vaccination. Here we map all single amino-acid mutations that increase resistance to broad antibodies targeting an H1 hemagglutinin. Crucially, our approach not only identifies antigenic mutations but also quantifies their effect sizes. All antibodies select mutations, but the effect sizes vary widely. The virus can escape a broad antibody targeting hemagglutinin&#x2019;s receptor-binding site the same way it escapes narrow strain-specific antibodies: via single mutations with huge effects. In contrast, broad antibodies targeting hemagglutinin&#x2019;s stalk only select mutations with small effects. Therefore, antibody breadth is not necessarily an indicator of the difficulty of viral escape. Broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting hemagglutinin&#x2019;s stalk are quantifiably harder to escape than the other antibodies tested here.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Nearly all viruses show some antigenic variation. However, the extent of this variation ranges widely. For instance, although both measles virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Birrer et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ter Meulen et al., 1981</xref>) and polio virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Crainic et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Diamond et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Drexler et al., 2014</xref>) exhibit antigenic variation, the magnitude of this variation is small. Therefore, immunity to these viruses is lifelong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Panum, 1847</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Salk, 1984</xref>). In contrast, human influenza virus exhibits much more antigenic variation. So although infection with an influenza virus strain provides long-term immunity to that exact strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">British Medical Journal, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Davies et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yu et al., 2008</xref>), the virus&#x2019;s rapid antigenic evolution erodes the effectiveness of this immunity to that strain&#x2019;s descendants within four to seven years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Couch and Kasel, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>One possible reason that viruses exhibit different amounts of antigenic variation is that they have disparate evolutionary capacities to escape the immunodominant antibodies generated by natural immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lipsitch and O&#x2019;Hagan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cobey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>). According to this explanation, human influenza virus undergoes rapid antigenic drift because most neutralizing antibodies target epitopes on the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that are highly tolerant of mutational change. This explanation is supported by classic experiments showing that it is easy to select viral mutants that escape most antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Webster and Laver, 1980</xref>), as well as by the observation that mutations that alter antigenicity arise frequently during influenza&#x2019;s evolution globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Koel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Petrie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Neher et al., 2016</xref>) and within individual humans with long-term infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Xue et al., 2017</xref>). A corollary of this explanation is that influenza virus&#x2019;s capacity for antigenic drift would be reduced if most antibodies instead targeted epitopes that were less mutationally tolerant.</p>
<p>Verifying this corollary has become of practical importance with the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza virus. These antibodies typically target conserved epitopes in HA&#x2019;s stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ekiert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Corti et al., 2011</xref>) or receptor-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ekiert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>), and neutralize a wide range of viral strains. Broad antibodies are usually less abundant in human serum than antibodies to antigenically variable epitopes on the head of HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ellebedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrews et al., 2015</xref>). However, major efforts are underway to elicit broad antibodies by vaccination or administer them directly as therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Krammer and Palese, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Corti et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>If these efforts succeed, the epitopes of broad antibodies will be under strong antigenic selection in human influenza virus. Might such selection then drive antigenic variation in these epitopes? There is precedent for the idea that the immune status of the host population can shape influenza virus evolution: the virus undergoes faster antigenic drift in long-lived humans that accumulate immune memory than in short-lived swine that are mostly naive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sheerar et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Luoh et al., 1992</xref>), and poultry vaccination may accelerate antigenic drift of avian influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cattoli et al., 2011</xref>). But alternatively, perhaps broad antibodies are broad because the virus has difficulty escaping them regardless of selection from host immunity.</p>
<p>So far, there is limited data to distinguish between these possibilities. Several studies have shown that the head domain of HA is more mutationally tolerant than the stalk domain where many broad antibodies bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Thyagarajan and Bloom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Heaton et al., 2013</xref>). However, these studies did not select for antibody escape, so it is difficult to relate their measurements to the virus&#x2019;s evolutionary capacity under immune selection. Other work has shown that it is possible to select antigenic mutants with broad antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chai et al., 2016</xref>), demonstrating that these epitopes are not entirely refractory to change. But given that antibodies can select some antigenic variation even in measles virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Birrer et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ter Meulen et al., 1981</xref>) and polio virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Crainic et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Diamond et al., 1985</xref>), the existence of selectable mutations does not necessarily imply that influenza virus can escape broad antibodies as easily as it drifts away from narrow strain-specific ones. The fun-damental problem is that existing studies have not quantified the ease of viral escape in a way that can be compared across antibodies in an apples-to-apples fashion.</p>
<p>Here we systematically quantify the results of selecting all single amino-acid mutations to an H1 HA with several broad and narrow antibodies. Critically, our approach quantifies the <italic>magnitude</italic> of the antigenic effect of every mutation in a way that can be directly compared across antibodies. We find that even the broadest antibodies select antigenic mutations. However, the magnitudes of the antigenic effects vary greatly across antibodies. Single mutations make the virus completely resistant to both narrow strain-specific antibodies and a broad antibody against the receptor-binding site. But no single mutation does more than modestly increase the virus&#x2019;s resistance to two broad antibodies against the HA stalk. Therefore, broad anti-stalk antibodies are quantifiably more resistant to viral escape via single amino-acid mutations than the other antibodies tested here.</p>

<title>An approach to quantify the fraction of virions with each mutation that escape antibody neutralization</title>
<p>We can visualize the outcome of antibody selection on viral populations containing antigenic mutations as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. If a mutation strongly escapes neutralization, then all virions with this mutation survive antibody treatment at a concentration where other virions are mostly neutralized (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This escape is manifested by a large shift in the neutralization curve for the mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). If we draw vertical lines through the overlaid neutralization curves, we can calculate the fraction of virions with each mutation that survive neutralization at each antibody concentration. These fractions can be represented using logo plots, where the height of each letter is proportional to the fraction of virions with that amino acid at a site that survive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Large letters correspond to strong escape mutations.</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 1:</label>
<caption><title>Quantifying the fraction of virions with each mutation that escape antibody neutralization</title>
<p>This figure shows hypothetical data for four viral variants. (A) Virions with the V1K mutation (orange) completely survive an antibody concentration where most other virions are neutralized. (B) This resistance is manifested by a large shift in V1K&#x2019;s neutralization curve. (C) For each dotted vertical line drawn through the neutralization curves in (B), we calculate the fraction of virions with that mutation that survive the antibody, and indicate this fraction by the height of the letter corresponding to that amino acid at that site. (D-F) Similar data to the first three panels, but now V1K has only a small antigenic effect, and so only modestly increases the fraction of virions that survive antibody treatment.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="210468_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Now consider the case where a mutation has just a small antigenic effect, and so only slightly increases the fraction of virions that survive neutralization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In this scenario, the neutralization curve shifts only slightly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In the logo plot representation, the antigenic mutation is only slightly larger than other amino acids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), since possessing the mutation only modestly increases the chance that a virion survives antibody treatment. These logo plots therefore provide a way to both identify antigenic mutations and quantify the magnitudes of their effects in a way that is directly comparable across antibodies.</p>
<p>Our goal is to determine the fraction of mutant virions that survive antibody neutralization for <italic>all</italic> mutations to HA. One way to do this would be to measure individual neutralization curves for each of the 19 &#x00D7; 565 &#x003D; 10,735 single amino-acid mutants of the 565-residue HA protein. However, individually creating and assaying that many mutants would be exceedingly time-consuming and expensive. Fortunately, we have shown that antibody selection on all viral mutations can be assayed in a single experiment using mutational antigenic profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Doud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dingens et al., 2017</xref>). This approach involves generating viral libraries containing all mutations to the protein of interest, selecting these viruses with or without antibody, and using an accurate deep-sequencing method to determine the relative frequencies of each mutation.</p>
<p>These frequencies can be analyzed to calculate the fraction of virions with each mutation that survive antibody treatment. Specifically, the deep sequencing determines the frequencies of virions carrying amino-acid <italic>a</italic> at site <italic>r</italic> in the antibody-selected and mock-selected conditions, which we denote as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, respectively. We can also measure the total fraction of the viral library that survives the antibody, which we denote as <italic>&#x03B3;</italic>. The fraction of variants with amino-acid <italic>a</italic> at site <italic>r</italic> that survive antibody selection is then simply
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="210468_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>For instance, in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, the frequency of virions with the orange mutation is <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in the antibody selection and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in the mock selection. The overall fraction of virions that survive the antibody in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> is <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Therefore, we use <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref> to calculate that the fraction of variants with the orange mutation that survive is <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Performing the analogous calculation for <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> correctly determines that fraction of virions with the orange mutation that survive the antibody is only 0.5 for the scenario in that figure panel. In the analyses of real data below, we will plot the excess fraction surviving <italic>above</italic> the overall library average, which is

<title>Broad and narrow antibodies that neutralize influenza virus</title>
<p>We applied this approach to anti-HA antibodies with a range of breadths and epitopes. The crystal structures or sites of escape mutations selected by these antibodies are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. We chose two broad antibodies, FI6v3 and C179, that target the stalk of HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Corti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Okuno et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dreyfus et al., 2013</xref>). FI6v3 is extremely broad, and neutralizes both group 1 and group 2 HAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). C179 is less broad, and neutralizes only some group 1 HAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We also selected a broad antibody, S139/1, that targets HA&#x2019;s receptor-binding site and can neutralize both group 1 and group 2 HAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, we re-analyzed deep sequencing data from prior mutational antigenic profiling of three narrow strain-specific antibodies, H17-L19, H17-L10, and H17-L7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Doud et al., 2017</xref>). These narrow antibodies bind the Ca2, Ca1, and Cb antigenic regions on HA&#x2019;s globular head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Caton et al., 1982</xref>), and only neutralize a narrow slice of H1 viruses.</p>

<p>We performed our experiments using the A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) strain of influenza, which is neutralized by all six antibodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We used antibody concentrations sufficient for nearly complete neutralization of wildtype virus, allowing us to detect antigenic mutations that increase the fraction of mutant virions surviving beyond the baseline of wildtype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We used several concentrations of each broad antibody to increase sensitivity to antigenic mutations of both large and small effect.</p>

<title>Quantifying the antigenic effects of all mutations selected by each antibody</title>
<p>We performed mutational antigenic profiling using the three broad antibodies at the concentrations indicated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, and calculated the fraction of virions carrying each mutation that survived neutralization. All experiments were performed in full biological triplicate using three independently generated virus libraries carrying single amino-acid mutations to HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Doud and Bloom, 2016</xref>). The correlations among replicates are shown in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>. For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to the median antigenic effect of each mutation across replicates.</p>
<p>It is immediately obvious that the narrow strain-specific antibodies and the antibody targeting HA&#x2019;s receptor-binding pocket (S139/1) select mutations with large antigenic effects. For all four of these antibodies, there are multiple sites in HA where mutations enable a substantial fraction of virions to survive high antibody concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Specifically, there are mutations that enable over a third of virions to survive at concentrations where virtually all wildtype virions are neutralized (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, the virus can escape these four antibodies with the sort of large-effect single amino-acid mutations that characterize traditional influenza antigenic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Webster and Laver, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Koel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Petrie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Neher et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>In contrast, the stalk-targeting antibodies C179 and FI6v3 select no strong escape mutants. If we look at the results for these antibodies on the same scale as the other antibodies, we see only a few small bumps in the fraction of virions surviving (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). Only if we zoom in can we see that there are actually a few sites where mutations slightly increase the fraction of virions surviving C179 and FI6v3 (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>, <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>, <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>, and <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">S8</xref>). But the effect sizes of these antigenic mutations are tiny compared to the other antibodies &#x2013; especially for FI6v3. Therefore, the HA of A/WSN/1933 influenza virus is far less capable of escaping these anti-stalk antibodies by single mutations than it is of escaping the other four antibodies.</p>

<title>The selected mutations are near the binding footprints of the antibodies</title>
<p>Antigenic mutations selected by narrow strain-specific antibodies against HA are thought to occur at residues in or near the physical binding footprint of the antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Webster and Laver, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Caton et al., 1982</xref>). We examined whether this was the case for the broad antibodies used in our experiments. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> shows a zoomed-in view of the sites of mutations selected by each antibody, as well as their locations on HA&#x2019;s structure.

<p>For the broad anti-receptor binding pocket antibody S139/1, there are strong escape mutations at sites 156, 158, and 193 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; sites are in H3 numbering). These three sites fall directly in the physical binding footprint of the antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), and are the same three sites where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yoshida et al. (2009)</xref> selected escape mutants in H1, H2, and H3 HAs. Our data show that numerous different amino-acid mutations at each site confer neutralization resistance. The mutation with the largest effect, G158N, introduces an N-linked glycosylation motif.</p>
<p>Although the anti-stalk antibodies C179 and FI6v3 only select mutations with small effects, these mutations almost all fall in or near the physical binding footprints of the antibodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The two antibodies have similar epitopes and angles of approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dreyfus et al., 2013</xref>), and they select identical mutations at several sites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The three largest-effect mutations for FI6v3 (K280S, K280T, and N291S) all introduce glycosylation motifs near the epitope, and all three mutations have similar magnitude antigenic effects in both FI6v3 and C179.</p>
<p>However, C179 selects several mutations that do not have any apparent effect on FI6v3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). The most notable of these C179-specific mutations are at site 38. The additional breadth of FI6v3 over antibodies such as C179 that neutralize only group 1 HAs is because FI6v3 can accommodate a glycan on the asparagine at site 38 that is present in group 2 HAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Corti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ekiert et al., 2009</xref>). However, the H38S mutation that has the largest effect on C179 resistance in our experiments does not introduce a glycosylation motif, showing that there are also other ways to escape anti-stalk antibodies at this site. Interestingly, group 1 HA sub-types that are susceptible to C179 tend to possess a histidine at site 38, but subtypes that are not bound or neutralized by C179 often possess a serine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>The FI6v3 antibody also weakly selects several mutations at residue &#x2212;8, which is part of HA&#x2019;s signal peptide (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This signal peptide is cleaved from the mature HA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Daniels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burke and Smith, 2014</xref>), although mutations at this site can affect HA&#x2019;s expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nordholm et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Neutralization assays validate the mutational antigenic profiling</title>
<p>Do the mutations identified in our mutational antigenic profiling actually have the expected effect on antibody neutralization? We have previously validated many of the large-effect antigenic mutations selected by the narrow antibodies H17-L19, H17-L10, and H17-L7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Doud et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mutations selected by the broad anti-stalk antibodies have much smaller effects &#x2013; especially for the broadest antibody, FI6v3. We therefore tested some of these FI6v3-selected mutations using neutralization assays on individual viral mutants.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> shows that the mutational antigenic profiling is highly predictive of the results of the neutralization assays, even for small-effect mutations. As discussed in the previous section, the three mutations most strongly selected by FI6v3 introduce glycosylation motifs at sites 278-280 or 289-291 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>,B). We created viruses carrying each of these mutations (K280S, K280T, and N291S) and validated that all three modestly increased resistance to FI6v3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). As a control, we also validated that a mutation at one of these sites (K280A) that does <italic>not</italic> have an effect in our mutational antigenic profiling does not shift the neutralization curve (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Neutralization curves of individual viral mutants with FI6v3.

<graphic xlink:href="210468_fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Our mutational antigenic profiling also identified several non-glycosylation-motif mutations that were selected by FI6v3. We validated that one of these mutations, G47R in the HA2 chain, increased neutralization resistance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) &#x2013; although as predicted by the mutational antigenic profiling, the magnitude of the effect was small. The most unexpected mutations identified in our mutational antigenic profiling were at site &#x2212;8 in the signal peptide. We tested one of these mutations, K(-8)T, and found that it did appear to lead to a very slight increase in neutralization resistance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). As controls, we also tested three mutations (P80D and V135T, which are escape mutations for H17-L7 and H17-L19, and M17L in HA2) that did <italic>not</italic> have sub-stantial effects in the mutational antigenic profiling, and confirmed that none of them affected neutralization resistance.</p>
<p>A notable aspect of these validation experiments is the very small effect sizes of the identified mutations on neutralization by FI6v3. Antigenic mutations selected by strain-specific antibodies to HA generally increase the concentration of antibody needed to neutralize the virus by orders of magnitude. Neutralization curves for such large-effect escape mutants are in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B,C</xref>. Although there are no such large-effect single mutations that escape FI6v3 or C179, the results in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> show that we can still use mutational antigenic profiling to identify mutations that have small but measurable effects on resistance to these antibodies.</p>

<title>Limited HA mutational tolerance does not fully explain the lack of strong escape mutations from the anti-stalk antibodies</title>
<p>Why are there no large-effect escape mutations from the anti-stalk antibodies? One possibility is that all HA sites in the antibody-binding footprint are intolerant of mutations, meaning that viruses with mutations at these sites cannot replicate and so are not present in our mutant virus libraries. Another possibility is that mutations are tolerated at some HA sites in the antibody footprint, but that the binding energetics are distributed across sites in such a way that none of these tolerated mutations strongly affect neutralization.</p>
<p>We can examine these possibilities using deep mutational scanning data that measures the tolerance of HA for each possible amino-acid mutation. Specifically, we have previously selected our A/WSN/1933 virus HA mutant libraries for variants that can replicate in cell culture, and then used deep sequencing to estimate the preference of each site in HA for each possible amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Doud and Bloom, 2016</xref>). <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> shows these amino-acid preferences for all sites in HA within 4 angstroms of each broad antibody, with the antigenic effects of the mutations overlaid. Although some HA sites in the antibody footprints strongly prefer a single amino acid, for all antibodies there are also footprint sites that tolerate a fairly wide range of amino acids. In most cases the mutations selected by the antibodies occur at these mutationally tolerant sites. However, there are exceptions &#x2013; for instance, the H38S mutation selected by C179 is rather disfavored with respect to viral growth, but has a large enough antigenic effect to still be detected in our mutational antigenic profiling.</p>
<fig id="fig7" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<p>These plots show all HA sites within 4 angstroms of the antibody in the crystal structure, plus any additional sites (marked with a &#x002A;) where we identified antigenic mutations. The logo plots at bottom show the preference of each HA site for each amino acid under selection for viral replication as measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Doud and Bloom (2016)</xref>. For instance, site 153 only tolerates tryptophan, so W occupies the entire height of the preference logo stack. In contrast, site 156 tolerates many amino acids, all of which contribute to the height of the preference logo stack. Above the preference logo stacks are logo plots showing the excess fraction surviving antibody treatment as measured in the current study. Note that scale for these antigenic effects is 10&#x00D7; smaller for FI6v3 and C179 than for S139/1.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The data in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> show that the lack of large-effect escape mutants from FI6v3 and C179 is not due to complete mutational intolerance of HA sites in the antibody-binding footprints. Some HA sites in each antibody footprint are fairly mutationally tolerant, and contain a range of mutations in the viral libraries used in our antibody selections. However, our mutational antigenic profiling shows that only a fraction of mutations at a fraction of these sites actually affect antibody neutralization. This finding is reminiscent of prior work showing that the binding energetics at protein-protein interfaces can be asymmetrically distributed across sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cunningham and Wells, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dall&#x2019;Acqua et al., 1998</xref>). The broad anti-stalk antibodies appear to distribute their binding energetics in such a way that altering the mutationally tolerant HA sites has relatively little effect on neutralization.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>We have quantified how all single amino-acid mutations to influenza virus HA affect neutralization by a collection of broad and narrow antibodies. Our results show that the virus&#x2019;s inherent evolutionary capacity for escape via point mutations differs across antibodies. Interestingly, antibody breadth is not always an indicator of the difficulty of viral escape. As expected, single amino-acid mutations can make the virus completely resistant to narrow strain-specific antibodies against HA&#x2019;s globular head. However, such mutations can also enable the virus to escape the broad S139/1 antibody targeting HA&#x2019;s receptor-binding pocket, despite the fact that this antibody neutralizes multiple subtypes. But no single mutation has a comparably large effect on neutralization by two broad antibodies targeting HA&#x2019;s stalk, FI6v3 and C179. Therefore, these anti-stalk antibodies are quantifiably more difficult for the virus to escape.</p>
<p>Although there are no large-effect escape mutations from the broad anti-stalk antibodies, there are mutations that more modestly affect neutralization. This finding emphasizes the importance of identifying antigenic mutations in a way that accounts for effect sizes. The classic approach for selecting escape mutations involves treating a virus stock with antibody at a concentration that completely neutralizes wildtype, and looking for viral mutants that survive this treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Webster and Laver, 1980</xref>). There are no such single mutations for the HA and broad anti-stalk antibodies tested here, since no mutations shift the neutralization curve enough to enable survival at antibody concentrations that fully neutralize wildtype. However, our approach shows that there are mutations that have more modest (<italic>&#x003C;</italic>10-fold) effects on neutralization by even the broadest antibody.</p>
<p>It is important to note that our experiments examine <italic>single</italic> amino-acid mutations to the HA from one influenza virus strain. The protein evolution literature is full of examples of epistatic interactions that enable multiple mutations to access phenotypes not accessible by single mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Harms and Thornton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Starr et al., 2017</xref>). Such epistasis is relevant to HA&#x2019;s evolution. For instance, work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Das et al. (2013)</xref> suggests that the sequential accumulation of mutations can shift the spectrum of available antibody-escape mutations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wu et al. (2017)</xref> have used deep mutational scanning to directly demonstrate that rampant epistasis enables HA&#x2019;s receptor-binding pocket to accommodate combinations of individually deleterious mutations, some of which affect sensitivity to antibodies. Therefore, our work does not imply any absolute limits on the possibilities for antibody escape when evolution is given sufficient time to explore combinations of mutations. However, single mutations are the most accessible form of genetic variation, and much of influenza virus&#x2019;s natural antigenic drift involves individual mutations that reduce sensitivity to immunodominant antibody specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Webster and Laver, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Koel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Petrie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Neher et al., 2016</xref>). Quantifying the antigenic effects of all such mutations therefore provides a relevant measure of ease of viral antibody escape.</p>
<p>A major rationale for studying broadly neutralizing antibodies is that they are hoped to be more resistant to viral evolutionary escape than the antibodies that dominate natural immune responses to influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Krammer and Palese, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Corti et al., 2017</xref>). We have used a new approach to quantify the extent to which this is actually true, and shown that the anti-viral activity of broad anti-stalk antibodies is indeed more &#x2013; although certainly not completely &#x2013; resistant to erosion by viral point mutations. Going forward, we suggest that quantifying the ease of viral escape will be a useful complement to more traditional techniques that characterize the structural epitopes and strain breadth of anti-viral antibodies.</p>

<title>Calculating the fraction of virions with each mutation that escapes anti-body neutralization</title>

These <italic>mutation differential selection</italic> values are useful for the analysis of individual experiments. However, there is no natural way to compare these values across experiments with different antibodies at different concentrations, since the strength of differential selection depends on details of how the pressure is imposed.

<p>The general principle of the calculations is illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and discussed in the first section of the RESULTS.

Also denote the total reads at each site <italic>r</italic> in each sample as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline10.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>We first estimate the rate of sequencing errors at site <italic>r</italic> as
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="210468_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>For the wildtype identity at site <italic>r</italic>, which we denote as wt (<italic>r</italic>), the value of <italic>&#x2208;</italic><sub><italic>r,wt</italic>(<italic>r</italic>)</sub> is the fraction of times we correctly observe the wildtype identity wt (<italic>r</italic>) at site <italic>r</italic> versus observing some spurious mutation. For all mutant identities <italic>x</italic> &#x2260; wt (<italic>r</italic>) at site <italic>r</italic>, <italic>&#x2208;</italic><sub><italic>r,x</italic></sub> is the fraction of times we observe the mutation <italic>x</italic> at site <italic>r</italic> when the identity is really wildtype. We ignore second-order terms where we incorrectly read one mutation as another, as such errors will be very rare as mutations themselves are rare (most codons are wildtype in most sequences).</p>
<p>We next adjust all of the deep sequencing codon counts in the antibody-selected and mock-selected conditions by the error control. Specifically, the error-adjusted counts for the antibody-selected sample are
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="210468_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>An equivalent equation is used to calculate <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline11.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. We then sum the error-adjusted codon counts for each amino acid <italic>a</italic>:
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="210468_eqn5.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
so that <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline12.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> are the error-adjusted counts for the antibody-selected condition summed across all codons <italic>x</italic> where the encoded amino acid <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline13.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. An equivalent equation is used to calculate <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline14.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Finally, we use these error-adjusted amino-acid counts to estimate the mutation frequencies <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline15.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline16.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> that are used in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref> to calculate the fraction <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>r,a</italic></sub> of virions with amino acid <italic>a</italic> at site <italic>r</italic> that survive the selection. When estimating these mutation frequencies, we add a pseudocount of <italic>P</italic> &#x003D; 5 to the lower-depth sample, and a depth-adjusted pseudocount to the higher depth sample. The rationale for adding a pseudocount is to regularize the estimates in the case of low counts. Specifically, we estimate the mutation frequencies as
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="210468_eqn6.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="210468_eqn7.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>A</italic> is the number of characters (e.g., 20 for amino acids), <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>r,selected</italic></sub> and <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>r,mock</italic></sub> are the pseudocount adjustment factors defined as:
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="210468_eqn8.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn9">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="210468_eqn9.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The pseudocount adjustment factors ensure that <italic>P</italic> is added to the counts for the lower depth sample, and a proportionally scaled-up pseudocount is added to the higher depth sample. The depth scaling is necessary to avoid systematically biasing towards higher mutation frequencies in the lower depth sample. It is these estimated mutation frequencies that are used in conjunction with <italic>&#x03B3;</italic> (the qPCR estimated overall of virions that survive selection) to compute the fraction surviving (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>r,a</italic></sub>) and excess fraction surviving above the library average <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline17.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> via <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equations 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">2</xref>.</p>
<p>In some cases, we need to summarize the excess fraction of mutations surviving into a single number for each site, such as for plotting as a function of the site number or displaying on the crystal structure. There are 19 different <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="210468_inline18.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> values for non-wildtype amino acids for each site. One summary statistic is the fraction surviving above the library average <italic>averaged</italic> over all 19 amino-acid mutations at site <italic>r</italic>:
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="210468_eqn10.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Another summary statistic is the <italic>maximum</italic> fraction surviving above average among all 19 amino-acid mutations at site <italic>r</italic>:
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="210468_eqn11.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>In this paper, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and S2 show the median of excess fraction surviving taken across all biological and technical replicates at a given antibody concentration. The subsequent logo plots show the medians of these values taken across all concentrations for each antibody. The numerical values plotted in these logo plots are in File S4.</p>
<p>Code that performs these fraction surviving analyses has been added to version 2.1.0 of the dms tools2 software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bloom, 2015</xref>) which is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2">http://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2</ext-link>.</p>

<caption><title>Correlations across experimental replicates</title>
<p>Each point represents one site in HA, and gives the fraction surviving above average across all amino-acid mutations at that site, as calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10">Equation 10</xref>. The replicates are highly correlated for antibodies with strong escape mutations (S139/1, H17-L19, H17-L10, and H17-L7), and reasonably correlated for antibodies with only weak escape mutations (FI6v3 and C179).</p></caption>
