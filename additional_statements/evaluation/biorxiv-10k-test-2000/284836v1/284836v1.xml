<title>Abstract</title><p>The Sxy (TfoX) protein is required for expression of a distinct subset of the genes regulated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) in the model organisms <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. Genetic studies have established that CRP and Sxy co-activate transcription at gene promoters containing DNA binding sites called CRP-S sites. In contrast, CRP acts without Sxy at gene promoters containing canonical CRP-N sites, suggesting that Sxy makes physical contacts with CRP and/or DNA to assist in transcriptional activation at CRP-S promoters. Despite growing interest in Sxy&#x2019;s activity as a transcription factor, Sxy remains poorly characterized due to a lack of reliable phenotypes in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Experiments are further hampered by growth inhibition and formation of inclusion bodies when Sxy is overexpressed. In this study we applied diverse phenotypic and molecular assays to test for postulated Sxy functions and interactions. Mutations in conserved regions of Sxy and truncations in the Sxy C-terminus abolish transcriptional activation of a CRP-S promoter, and a 37 amino acid truncation of the C-terminus relieves the growth inhibition normally caused by Sxy overexpression. Sxy was unable to augment weakened CRP interactions to restore carbon metabolism phenotypes. Bandshift analysis and chromatin pull-down assays of Sxy-CRP-DNA interactions yielded intriguing evidence of CRP-Sxy and Sxy-DNA physical interactions. However, despite the careful application of standard protein purification protocols and quality control steps for nickel affinity column purification, protein mass spectrometry revealed the enrichment of additional DNA-binding proteins in nickel column eluates, presenting a probable source of artefactual protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction results. These findings highlight the importance of extensive controls and phenotypic assays for the study of poorly characterized and recalcitrant proteins like Sxy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural competence is the ability of bacteria to actively take up DNA from their environment. The core mechanisms that regulate natural competence are conserved in the model organisms <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. In these species, competence is induced by two positive regulators, CRP (cAMP receptor protein, also called catabolite activator protein) and Sxy (also known as TfoX). CRP is the master regulator of a carbon-energy starvation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], while Sxy appears restricted to regulation of genes required for natural competence, DNA replication, and nucleotide metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,4&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>CRP is a global regulator that activates expression of hundreds of genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> and other Gamma-proteobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Binding to the allosteric effector, cAMP, causes conformational changes that activate CRP as a DNA binding protein; CRP can then form protein-protein contacts with RNA polymerase and recruit the polymerase to nearby gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. CRP binds preferentially to DNA sequences described by the consensus half-site 5&#x2032;-A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>3</sub>T<sub>4</sub>G<sub>5</sub>T<sub>6</sub>G<sub>7</sub>A<sub>8</sub>T<sub>9</sub>C<sub>10</sub>T<sub>11</sub>. We refer to these canonical CRP binding sites as CRP-N sites to distinguish them from non-canonical &#x201C;CRP-S&#x201D; sites characterized by C<sub>6</sub> instead of T<sub>6</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Unlike gene promoters containing CRP-N sites, gene promoters with CRP-S sites require both CRP and Sxy for transcriptional activation. We previously quantified how both <italic>E. coli</italic> CRP (<italic>Ec</italic>CRP) and <italic>H. influenzae</italic> CRP (<italic>Hi</italic>CRP) demonstrate strong preferences for CRP-N over CRP-S sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], consistent with the finding that <italic>Ec</italic>CRP has a very strong preference for T<sub>6</sub> over C<sub>6</sub> because T<sub>6</sub> allows <italic>Ec</italic>CRP to kink DNA as part of forming a strong and specific protein-DNA interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Even though <italic>Ec</italic>CRP can bind weakly to CRP-S sites <italic>in vitro</italic> without the co-activator Sxy, <italic>Ec</italic>CRP binding alone is insufficient for transcriptional activation of gene promoters with CRP-S sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Altogether, gene expression and protein-DNA interaction experiments led us to hypothesize that Sxy enhances CRP binding at CRP-S sites, perhaps by stabilizing CRP dimer formation. As well, Sxy may assist in recruitment of RNA polymerase to gene promoters where CRP is weakly associated with CRP-S sites.</p>
<p>Sxy&#x2019;s role as the central activator of natural competence was discovered in <italic>H. influenzae</italic> over 25 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Sxy&#x2019;s role as an activator of CRP-S promoters is conserved across three Gamma-proteobacteria families: Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Vibrionaceae, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,24&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], yet Sxy&#x2019;s mode of action remains unknown. Unfortunately, <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of Sxy has been hampered by the toxicity of overexpressed <italic>sxy</italic> and the requirement for strong denaturants to solubilise Sxy inclusion bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. We originally proposed that Sxy&#x2019;s role might be to bind to A&#x002B;T sequences upstream of <italic>H. influenzae</italic> CRP-S sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], but similar sequences were not detected upstream of <italic>E. coli</italic> CRP-S sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Previous studies from our laboratories indicated that CRP and Sxy have conserved functions in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic>. First, we found that <italic>Ec</italic>CRP can activate competence gene expression in a <italic>H. influenzae</italic> &#x0394;<italic>crp</italic> mutant, and that this complementation absolutely requires Sxy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Second, reciprocal experiments demonstrated that CRP-S promoter activity is higher when cognate pairs of <italic>Ec</italic>CRP/<italic>Ec</italic>Sxy and <italic>Hi</italic>CRP/<italic>Hi</italic>Sxy were co-expressed compared to creating pairs between proteins from different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. These findings suggest that CRP and Sxy work best with their co-evolved protein partner, supporting a model in which these proteins physically interact <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Bioinformatic homology searches (HHSearch and SCOOP) at the Pfam proteins family database predict two putative domains in Sxy: TfoX-N (PF04993) and TfoX-C (PF04994) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). An unpublished crystal structure is available for TfoX-N from the <italic>sxy</italic> homolog VP1028 of <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> [Protein Data Bank: 2od0], which is predicted to form a dimer. The CATH database of Protein Data Bank hierarchies clusters the TfoX-N domain with several methyltransferases and an acetyltransferase in Superfamily 3.30.1460.30 - YgaC/TfoX-N like chaperone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. TfoX-C is predicted to belong to a superfamily of DNA-binding helix-hairpin-helix domains that includes phage lambda&#x2019;s DNA polymerase and the C-terminus of bacterial RNA polymerase alpha subunit. These bioinformatic predictions are based on hidden Markov models capable of detecting homology between distantly related proteins, thus provide useful material for hypothesis generation but do not provide direct evidence of protein function. Altogether, bioinformatic predictions suggest that the Sxy N-terminal domain could participate in dimerization while the C-terminus is a DNA binding domain; this domain architecture is similar to CRP, where CRP&#x2019;s effector-binding N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization while the C-terminal domain is responsible for DNA binding. Also similar are the sizes of <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy (209 amino acids) and <italic>Ec</italic>CRP (210 amino acids).</p>

<p>Here we report multiple experimental approaches designed to characterize how Sxy might participate in CRP-Sxy and Sxy-DNA interactions. Phenotypic and gene expression assays were useful for confirming the requirement for specific regions of the Sxy protein. However, assays relying on protein purification yielded promising but ultimately misleading evidence of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Thus, we present a cautionary report and detail the need for extensive confirmatory experiments when testing for putative Sxy-CRP and Sxy-DNA interactions.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Diverse mutations in Sxy prevent CRP-S promoter activity and relieve growth inhibition</title>
<p>To identify amino acids and domains required for Sxy&#x2019;s conserved function as an activator of competence gene expression in the Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Vibrionaceaea, we aligned the Sxy protein sequence from a representative member of each genus. This identified conserved amino acids potentially important for Sxy function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). All three Sxy proteins have similar lengths (209, 215, and 199 amino acids, respectively), but amino acid sequence identity (21-26 &#x0025;) was low and distributed throughout their lengths. Each was also predicted to contain both the TfoX-N and TfoX-C domains (domains are illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To test whether either predicted domain is sufficient for transcriptional activation of a CRP-S regulated gene, we deleted the N-terminal half of <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy to amino acid 102 (<italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>-&#x0394;Nter) and the C-terminal half from position 108 (<italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>-&#x0394;Cter) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We also tested the requirement for the largest block of conserved amino acids in all three genera by deleting the eight amino acids between positions 118 and 125, creating mutant <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>-mut1. Alanine (Ala) at position 174 is conserved in 98&#x0025; of the 1,306 full-length Sxy orthologs annotated at EMBL InterPro; we converted alanine 174 to threonine, creating <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>-mut2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess how each mutation in <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy impacted transcription activation, we measured transcriptional activity at the <italic>pilA</italic> (<italic>ppdD</italic>) CRP-S promoter and the <italic>mglB</italic> CRP-N promoter. Expression of <italic>pilA</italic> was only detected when wildtype <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> was over-expressed, whereas all Sxy mutant variants were incapable of inducing <italic>pilA</italic> (<italic>ppdD</italic>) expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Conversely, expression of <italic>mglB</italic> was unaffected by overexpression of wildtype or Sxy variants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Altogether, the TfoX-N and TfoX-C domains, amino acids 118-125, and Ala174 were all critical for transcriptional activation of <italic>pilA</italic>. These various mutations in Sxy may prevent <italic>pilA</italic> expression either because transcription activation requires Sxy-CRP interactions that are lost in the mutant proteins, and/or because the mutations abolish an independent function for Sxy at the <italic>pilA</italic> promoter.</p>
<p>Another phenotype associated with Sxy arises when <italic>sxy</italic> is overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Overexpression of cloned <italic>sxy</italic> causes growth inhibition and induction of the RpoH stress response, and this growth inhibition phenotype manifests even at low concentrations of the inducer, IPTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. We systematically truncated the C-terminus of histidine-tagged Sxy (<italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>) and tested for the growth inhibition phenotype. Sxy inhibition of growth was alleviated by all three C-terminus truncates, <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>-R1, <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>-R2, and <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>-R3 (truncates length indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, and growth is illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). IPTG-induced expression of the truncated proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry (described below), indicating that the full-length C-terminus is required for growth inhibition. When not induced by IPTG, cells were unaffected by cloned wildtype and mutant <italic>sxy</italic> genes (S1 Fig. B).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Sxy does not enhance CRP activation of CRP-N-regulated carbon metabolism genes</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether Sxy impacts CRP-regulated phenotypes other than natural competence and growth inhibition. Specifically, because <italic>Ec</italic>CRP has a higher affinity for DNA than <italic>Hi</italic>CRP does [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], we used the CRP-regulated phenotypes of carbon metabolism to test whether Sxy enhances CRP-induced gene expression at genes with CRP-N sites. CRP activates the uptake and metabolism of diverse carbon sources by <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, CRP was required for metabolism of maltose, mannitol, xylose and glycerol, but not fructose or galactose (S1 Table, rows 1 and 2), and exogenous expression of <italic>Ec</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub> from plasmid p<italic>Eccrp</italic> fully restored wildtype metabolism to a &#x0394;<italic>crp</italic> mutant (S1 Table 1, row 3). In contrast, complementation by <italic>Hi</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub> was partial, restoring only xylose metabolism (S1 Table 1, row 4). Suggesting that <italic>Hi</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub>&#x2019;s lower affinity for DNA prevents it from activating all <italic>E. coli</italic> CRP-N promoters. We tested this by examining whether <italic>Hi</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> could restore maltose, glycerol, and mannitol fermentation by stabilizing <italic>Hi</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub>-DNA interactions. Although co-expression of <italic>Hi</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub> and <italic>Hi</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> restores CRP-S promoter function in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], the same co-expression did not restore fermentation of maltose, glycerol, and mannitol in our phenotypic assays (S1 Table 1, rows 5 and 6). Further, <italic>Ec</italic>CRP activity at CRP-N promoters was unaffected by expression of either <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> or <italic>Hi</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> (S1 Table 1, rows 7 and 8), suggesting that Sxy cannot significantly enhance the binding of CRP to weak CRP-N sites sufficiently to enhance transcription.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Protein-DNA crosslinking <italic>in vivo</italic> detects non-specific DNA binding</title>
<p>We next sought to test whether Sxy-DNA interactions occur <italic>in vivo</italic> using a chromatin affinity precipitation assay. In principle, formaldehyde can crosslink <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> with DNA and proteins to which it is bound <italic>in vivo</italic>. Isolation of <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> on a nickel affinity column will then co-purify any DNA bound and crosslinked to <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>. To test whether Sxy physically interacts with DNA in vivo, the cloned <italic>Ecsxy</italic><sub>HIS</sub> gene was overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, formaldehyde was added to cell cultures to crosslink interacting DNA and protein molecules, and cells were lysed by sonication and fractionated by centrifugation. The cytoplasmic (soluble) fraction was then incubated with nickel-agarose resin (Ni-NTA) to bind <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> and any crosslinked DNA. After extensive washing, <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> was eluted with imidazole, formaldehyde crosslinking was reversed, and eluted DNA was quantified by PCR.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that Sxy bound specifically to CRP-S sites in living cells, which we could detect as an enrichment of CRP-S containing loci compared to non-CRP-S containing DNA in elution fractions. We quantified the levels of three unlinked chromosomal genes: two CRP-S regulated genes, <italic>pilA</italic> (<italic>ppdD</italic>) and <italic>comM</italic>, and a negative control non-CRP regulated gene <italic>hns</italic>. In each fraction, all three genes were eluted in equal quantities (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, upper panel), indicating that DNA retention was not specific to genes with CRP-S sites. In the absence of formaldehyde crosslinking <italic>in vivo</italic>, most DNA was eluted in fraction &#x0023;1 and DNA concentrations generally declined in subsequent fractions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, lower panel). This elution pattern did not correspond to protein elution, confirming that formaldehyde crosslinking contributed to DNA retention on nickel affinity columns.</p>

<title>Quantifying CRP-DNA and Sxy-DNA interactions <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>We have long hypothesized that Sxy is required for transcriptional activation at CRP-S promoters because it stabilizes CRP-DNA interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Bandshift assay), in which protein-DNA binding retards electrophoretic migration of bait DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], are useful for detecting protein-DNA interactions and for quantifying binding affinity. <italic>Ec</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub> and <italic>Hi</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> were purified in their native forms as in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Expression of <italic>HiSxy</italic><sub>HIS</sub> in <italic>E. coli</italic> for purification of <italic>Hi</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> causes formation of inclusion bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, expression of <italic>HiSxy</italic><sub>HIS</sub> and <italic>EcSxy</italic><sub>HIS</sub> produces sufficient soluble protein to generate the phenotypes observed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and in past publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].

<p>To test for Sxy-DNA and Sxy-CRP-DNA interactions, we designed protein-DNA binding reactions to distinguish between CRP&#x2019;s lower affinity for DNA fragments containing a native CRP-S promoter (<italic>H. influenzae pilA</italic>) and its higher affinity for a derivative CRP-N promoter created from it by site-directed mutagenesis (<italic>pilA</italic>-N) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].

<p>The different affinities of <italic>Ec</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub> and <italic>Hi</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub> for DNA allowed us to test whether <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>H. influenzae</italic> Sxy could enhance binding of their cognate CRP to <italic>pilA</italic> or <italic>pilA</italic>-N DNA. Enhanced binding was predicted to manifest as an increase in the amount of <italic>pilA</italic> DNA shifted by <italic>Ec</italic>CRP, and to create a detectable shift of <italic>pilA</italic> DNA when bound by <italic>Hi</italic>CRP. Additionally, we predicted that simultaneous binding of CRP and Sxy to DNA would create a super-shift; in other words, a CRP-Sxy-DNA complex is expected to migrate slower during electrophoresis than the smaller CRP-DNA complex. However, a range of Sxy concentrations had no detectable effect on either <italic>Ec</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub> or <italic>Hi</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub> binding to <italic>pilA</italic> or <italic>pilA</italic>-N DNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B, C, E, F</xref>, lanes 3-7).</p>
<p>We next tested whether <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> or <italic>Hi</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> alone can bind DNA. Surprisingly, at 4 and 40 nM of <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>, a small amount of <italic>pilA</italic>-N DNA was shifted, producing a new band at the same position as CRP-DNA binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, lanes 11 and 12). The shift was dependent on CRP&#x2019;s allosteric effector cAMP, confirming the presence of CRP in the binding reactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 4). No binding was detected when the experiment was repeated using <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> purified from a &#x0394;<italic>crp</italic> background, confirming that the shift arose from contaminating CRP in the <italic>Ex</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> preparation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>, lane 6). Comparison with lane 11 indicates that CRP contamination at &#x003C;100 pM concentration would be sufficient to account for the observed shift (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, lanes 2 and 12). With <italic>Hi</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> and <italic>pilA</italic>-N bait DNA, increasing protein concentrations correlated with an increase in the amount of DNA retained in the gel wells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>, lanes 8-12). A specific interaction between Sxy and a DNA binding site was expected to yield approximately the same sized bandshift as CRP-DNA binding, but no such band was detected, suggesting <italic>Hi</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> was interacting non-specifically with <italic>pilA</italic>-N DNA to retain it in the gel wells.</p>
<p>To test whether Sxy-DNA binding may in fact occur but is too weak to persist under electrophoretic conditions, we used formaldehyde to cross-link proteins bound to DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, before electrophoresis. A 1:1 mix of <italic>Ec</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub>:<italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> resulted in a shift corresponding in size to a CRP-DNA complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, lanes 13). In contrast, with the <italic>H. influenzae</italic> proteins, most bait DNA was retained in the wells of the gels, indicating the formation of large protein-DNA complexes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>, lanes 13 and 14). This super-shift occurred also in lane 14, which contained only Sxy without CRP, supporting the hypothesis that DNA-Sxy interactions exist, and the super-shift is evidence that Sxy-DNA interactions could be stabilized with formaldehyde.</p>
<p>We also tested the hypothesis that CRP and Sxy may need to form protein-protein contacts prior to binding DNA. However, pre-mixing the proteins from each species before adding bait DNA had no effect on DNA binding (S3 Fig., lanes 4 and 10). Similarly, combining either CRP or Sxy alone with bait DNA before addition of the second protein also had no effect (S3 Fig., lanes 5, 6, 11 and 12). Collectively, these results confirm that Sxy does not bind stably to DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, nor does it enhance CRP binding to DNA in bandshift assays. Nevertheless, the presence of contaminating CRP in <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> preparations was suggestive of protein-protein interactions between Sxy and CRP.</p>
<p>Lastly we tested if very high concentrations of <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> isolated from &#x0394;<italic>crp</italic> cells could shift <italic>pilA</italic> DNA (the highest Sxy concentration used in the above-mentioned experiment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) was 2nM). Purified <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> proteins (10 mM) shifted 17 &#x0025; of DNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lane 3), and higher <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> concentrations resulted in stronger DNA shifts (40&#x0025;, 64&#x0025;, and 74 &#x0025;) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lane 4 - 6). The discrete bandshift supported that this was specific protein-DNA interactions. Further, an excess of non-specific competitor DNA (poly dI-dC) only caused a minor reduction in the observed protein-DNA interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lane 2). Titrating salmon sperm DNA as a non-specific competitor revealed that once competitor DNA surpassed the concentration of bait DNA (around 7 ng/reaction), protein binding to bait DNA was reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). This suggested that although a discrete bandshift was formed by adding <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> extract to bait DNA, protein-DNA binding was low affinity and/or low specificity. Adding high concentrations of <italic>Ec</italic>CRP<sub>HIS</sub> to <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> reactions produced an additive effect resulting in protein-DNA supershifts (S6 Fig., lanes 3, 4, 8, and 9). The retention of bait DNA in wells is consistent with CRP proteins binding non-specifically to bait DNA. Non-specific protein-DNA interactions were confirmed as competitor DNA effectively liberated DNA from wells (S6 Fig., lanes 5 and 6).</p>

<title>Identification of other DNA binding proteins in Sxy extracts</title>
<p>Previous studies of protein purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography identified SlyD and CRP from native <italic>E. coli</italic> extracts to have a high affinity for nickel affinity columns, and that these contaminating proteins elute at high imidazole concentrations along with the desired histidine-tagged protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The SlyD protein chaperone contains a metal binding domain with high affinity for Zn<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and Ni<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions, making it an expected contaminant of metal affinity chromatography. We used mass spectrometry to examine the degree to which <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> was enriched by nickel affinity column purification, also allowed us to identify and quantify cytoplasmic proteins co-purifying with <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>.</p>
<p>We first established that <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub> was not detected in the cytoplasm of <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x0394;<italic>crp</italic> cells before IPTG induction, then became the 4<sup>th</sup> most abundant protein in cytoplasm after induction (S7 Fig.).

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present work used protein alignments, directed mutations, and phenotypic assays to confirm that Sxy&#x2019;s predicted domains and conserved amino acids are essential for transcriptional activation of a CRP-S promoter in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Growth assays confirmed that growth inhibition by Sxy requires a full-length C-terminus, which is predicted to encode a helix-hairpin-helix DNA binding domain. All experiments described in this work (both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>) used histidine-tagged Sxy proteins, and multiple lines of evidence suggest that the histidine tag does not negatively impact Sxy function. For example, overexpression of either wildtype or histidine-tagged Sxy inhibits <italic>E. coli</italic> growth, and both histidine-tagged Sxy and CRP are strong activators of gene expression from CRP-S promoters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]). Having confirmed these phenotypes resulting from overexpressing histidine-tagged <italic>sxy</italic> genes, we tested the hypothesis that Sxy enhances weak CRP-DNA interactions using <italic>Hi</italic>CRP&#x2019;s inability to fully restore sugar metabolism in an <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x0394;<italic>crp</italic> mutant (S1 Table). However, the observed negative results are inconclusive because they may represent an insurmountable inability of <italic>Hi</italic>CRP to act at all <italic>E. coli</italic> CRP-N promoters. Nevertheless, the negative results in the sugar metabolism assys could also reflect that CRP-N promoters lack a specific, but as yet undetected, feature required for Sxy activity.</p>
<p>Nickel affinity pull-down assays and bandshift assays appeared to demonstrate DNA binding by <italic>Ec</italic>Sxy<sub>HIS</sub>, but the DNA binding activities are best explained by the activity of contaminating proteins in nickel affinity column purification. Thus, the complication of bandshift and pull down assays by contaminating DNA-binding activity provides a valuable warning of the need for extensive controls and confirmatory experiments until robust <italic>in vitro</italic> assays for Sxy activity are identified. Throughout this study we applied all standard quality control steps and performed preparative techniques as used successfully for other bacterial proteins. Hence, we present this study partly as a cautionary tale against the use of nickel affinity purification to isolate a low-concentration protein. Even though Ni-NTA resin columns are widely used to purify histidine-tagged proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], we discovered many metal binding and other co-purified proteins eluted in this system despite extensive washing before elution. Therefore, we recommend using mass spectrometry or other precision techniques to assess the purity of proteins eluted from Ni-NTA systems.</p>
<p>Despite the artefactual and ultimately negative results for protein-protein-DNA interactions presented above, the simplest model that remains consistent with all genetic and phenotypic data is that Sxy-CRP interactions facilitate CRP binding to DNA and transcriptional activation at CRP-S promoters. To bind DNA and recruit RNA polymerase, CRP must dimerize and then deform DNA by kinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Although CRP-S sites are targets for CRP binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], their characteristic sequence reduces CRP&#x2019;s ability to bend and kink DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. There may be a role for Sxy in strengthening CRP dimerization, thus stabilizing CRP to spend sufficient time in association with CRP-S sites to achieve the required DNA bending and RNA polymerase recruitment. The CRP-S regulon is unique among characterized bacterial promoter mechanisms because it is defined by a distinct DNA element (the CRP-S site) embedded within the binding site of a global transcription factor, CRP. The molecular interactions that connect Sxy, CRP, and CRP-S sites to stimulate transcription remain enigmatic; additional phenotypes and alternate purification strategies are required to identify Sxy&#x2019;s cellular function(s).</p>

<p>50 ml LB broth was inoculated 1:100 from overnight <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures harboring plasmid p<italic>Ecsxy</italic>. At OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5, expression of <italic>sxy</italic> was induced for 2.5 hours by the addition of IPTG (1 mM final concentration). Cells were harvested (3,000 &#x00D7; g), 4 &#x00B0;C, 20 minutes) and washed in 50 ml of ice-cold PBS. Protein-DNA interactions were chemically cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde (1 &#x0025; vol/vol final concentration) to the washed cell suspensions which were then incubated with agitation (100 rpm) for 30 minutes at 4 &#x00B0;C. Further cross-linking was inhibited by the addition of ice-cold 2 M glycine (0.125 M final concentration), cells were harvested (3,000 &#x00D7; g, 4 &#x00B0;C, 20 minutes) and cell pellets were frozen at &#x2212;20 &#x00B0;C overnight. Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice, re-suspended in 2 ml protein lysis buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) to which lysozyme (1 mg/ml final concentration) and protease inhibitor (1 X) (Pierce) were added and then held on ice-for 1 hour. Cell sonication and protein purification was performed as described above. To reverse formaldehyde cross-linking, 5 M NaCl (0.3 M final conc.) was added to 225 &#x00B5;l of each elution fraction and held at 65 &#x00B0;C for 6 hours. Then, 9 &#x00B5;l Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) was added and fractions were incubated at 45 &#x00B0;C overnight, and 2 &#x00B5;l of salmon sperm DNA (5 mg/ml) was added to each sample just before adding 500 &#x00B5;l Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 &#x00D7; g for 5 minutes at room temperature. The aqueous (top) layer was collected in a fresh 1.5 ml microfuge tubes and 500 &#x00B5;l of chloroform was added to each sample. The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 &#x00D7; g for 5 minutes at room temperature. The aqueous layer was transferred to a fresh 2.0 ml microfuge tubes. 5 &#x00B5;g of GlycoBlue (5 mg/ml), 1 &#x00B5;l of salmon sperm DNA (5 mg/ml, Invitrogen) and 50 &#x00B5;l of 3M NaAc (pH 5.2) was added to each sample and mixed well. The DNA was precipitated with 1375 &#x00B5;l of 100&#x0025; ethanol and incubated at &#x2212;70 &#x00B0;C for 30 minutes (or &#x2212;20 &#x00B0;C overnight). The samples were centrifuged at 13000 &#x00D7; g for 20 minutes at 4 &#x00B0;C. The DNA pellets were washed with 500 &#x00B5;l of ice-cold 70&#x0025; ethanol and air-dried for 10-15 minutes. The DNA pellets were re-suspended in 50 &#x00B5;l of sterile filtered HPLC water. qPCR analysis was performed for each DNA fraction (four elution fractions).</p>

<title>Protein mass spectrometric analysis</title>
<p>Protein samples were desalted using 10kDa MWCO filters (EMD Millipore) before tryptic digest. Subsequently, the resulting peptides were separated on a Waters Nanoaqcuity nano-LC and analyzed with a Waters Synapt G2 HDMS (Waters Corporation). For the LC, an Acquity UPLC T3HSS column (75 mm x 200 mm) was used and a gradient was run from 3&#x0025; acetonitrile/0.1&#x0025; formic acid to 45&#x0025; acetonitrile in 2 hours. Mass spectrometric acquisition was conducted using data-independent acquisition (MSE) in resolution mode and using leucine-enkephaline as lockspray for mass correction. Resulting spectra were analyzed with the ProteinLynx Global Server version 3.02 (Waters) with a false discovery rate set to 4&#x0025;.</p>
