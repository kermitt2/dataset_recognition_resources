<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>C. neoformans</italic> var. <italic>grubii</italic> (<italic>C. neoformans</italic>) is an environmentally acquired pathogen causing 181 000 HIV-associated deaths each year. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterise 699 isolates, primarily <italic>C. neoformans</italic> from HIV-infected patients, from 5 countries in Asia and Africa. We found that 91&#x0025; of our clinical isolates belonged to one of three highly clonal sub-clades of VNIa, which we have termed VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93. Parsimony analysis revealed frequent, long distance transmissions of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>; international transmissions took place on 13&#x0025; of VNIa-4 branches, and intercontinental transmissions on 7&#x0025; of VNIa-93 branches. The median length of within sub-clade internal branches was 3-6 SNPs, while terminal branches were 44.5-77.5 SNPs. The short median internal branches were partly driven by the large number (12-15&#x0025; of internal branches) of polytomies in the within-sub-clade trees. To simultaneously explain our observation of no apparent molecular clock, short internal branches and frequent polytomies we hypothesise that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> VNIa spends much of its time in the environment in a quiescent state, while, when it is sampled, it has almost always undergone an extended period of growth. Infections with VNIa-93 were associated with a significantly reduced risk of death by 10 weeks compared with infections with VNIa-4 (Hazard Ratio = 0.45, p = 0.003). We detected a recombination in the mitochondrial sequence of VNIa-5, suggesting that mitochondria could be involved in the propensity of this sub-clade to infect HIV-uninfected patients. These data highlight the insight into the biology and epidemiology of pathogenic fungi which can be gained from WGS data.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Intro</title>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is an opportunistic fungal pathogen which primarily affects people with cell mediated immune defects, particularly those living with HIV. There are an estimated 223 100 incident cases of cryptococcal meningitis per year in HIV patients with CD4 counts of less than 100 cells per &#x00B5;l, resulting in 181 100 deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rajasingham et al. 2017)</xref>. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> var. <italic>grubii</italic> (hereafter <italic>C. neoformans</italic>), one of two varieties of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, accounts for the vast majority of cryptococcal meningitis cases globally, and particularly in the tropical and sub-tropical regions which bear the heaviest disease burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rajasingham et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Park et al. 2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>The population structure of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> consists of at least three lineages, VNI, VNII and VNB. Two of these, the frequently isolated VNI and the rarely observed VNII, are clonal and globally distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Litvintseva et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Khayhan et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferreira-Paim et al. 2017)</xref> while VNB is very diverse but rarely isolated outside sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Litvintseva et al. 2006)</xref> and South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrade-Silva et al. 2018)</xref>. Sequencing of strains from patients with relapsed disease has indicated that microevolution occurs during infection, with typically 0-6 SNPs occurring over a median relapse period of 146 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al. 2017</xref>). Other studies have described a broad view of the three main molecular types, VNI, VNII and VNB, analysing 150-400 total isolates, and placing clinical isolates into the context of environmental strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Desjardins et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rhodes et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vanhove et al. 2017</xref>). Within VNI, three distinct, but still recombining, sub-lineages have been identified, two of which (VNIa and VNIb) are globally distributed, while VNIc is limited to southern Africa. Genomic data has revealed that VNI and VNII to have more recent migrations than VNB, with nearly clonal isolates found in disparate geographic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rhodes et al. 2017</xref>), although this has not yet been investigated on a fine scale.</p>
<p>So far, our understanding of the population structure of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in the Asia &#x0026; Pacific region, the second highest prevalence region after sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rajasingham et al. 2017)</xref>, has been based upon low resolution methods such as MLST and AFLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Day et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Thanh et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Simwami et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Khayhan et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kaocharoen et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hiremath et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Day et al. 2017)</xref>. These data show that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in Southeast Asia is highly clonal, with considerable gene flow between countries within the region, and less connectivity with other continents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Khayhan et al. 2013)</xref>. Recently, the first study focussing on whole genome data from the region has been reported, which identified 165 Kbp of sequence specific to ST5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Day et al. 2017)</xref>, a sequence type seen more frequently n HIV uninfected patients, the majority of whom have no identified underlying immune-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Day et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">2017</xref>). The predilection of ST5 to infect HIV uninfected patients is not the only reported association between a <italic>C. neoformans</italic> lineage and a clinical phenotype. Infections with VNB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beale et al. 2015)</xref> and VNI ST93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wiesner et al. 2012)</xref> have been reported to have worse outcomes in HIV infected patients in southern Africa and eastern Africa, respectively.</p>
<p>Production of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> spores is thought to be vital to the organism&#x2019;s virulence, as the spores, alongside desiccated yeast cells are the likely infectious propagule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Velagapudi et al. 2009)</xref>. There are two known mechanisms which can result in the generation of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> spores &#x2013;heterothallic mating and homothallic fruiting. Both processes involve meiosis resulting in recombination and other large scale genomic changes such as aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lin and Heitman 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ni et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lin et al. 2005</xref>). While our direct understanding of spore production in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> comes entirely from the laboratory, evidence of the processes occurring naturally have mostly come indirectly from population genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Litvintseva et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hiremath et al. 2008)</xref>. Previously, we have undertaken several prospective, descriptive and randomised controlled intervention trials in Southeast Asia and East/Southeast Africa. Here, we used whole genome sequence analysis of 699 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> isolates to describe the population structure of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> causing disease in these populations, in high resolution, and combine this information with metadata from these trials to relate this to disease phenotype.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2"><title>Results</title>
<p>We sequenced 699 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species complex isolates from Vietnam (n = 441), Laos (n = 73), Thailand (n = 40), Uganda (n = 132) and Malawi (n = 13). Of these, 682 were <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, 12 were <italic>C. gattii</italic> and 5 (all from Uganda) were putative hybrids between <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>C. deneoformans</italic>. There were 696 clinical isolates from 695 patients, and 3 environmental isolates from Vietnam. All environmental isolates were <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. There were 618 isolates from HIV infected patients and 78 from HIV uninfected patients. Of the 682 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> there were 681 isolates with mating type alpha and 1 isolate from Vietnam with mating type a.</p>
<sec id="s2a"><title>Whole genome sequencing of VNI</title>
<p>Six hundred and seventy eight (99.4&#x0025;) of our <italic>C. neoformans</italic> isolates were VNI; four were VNII (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1). To provide context for our isolates, all 185 VNI genomes sequenced by Desjardins <italic>et al</italic>. (160 clinical, 25 environmental, full details available in Supplementary Table 1) were included in subsequent phylogenetic analyses. We ensured technical comparability of our methods of phylogenetic analysis with those of Desjardins <italic>et al.</italic> by comparing our results for the Desjardins data with their reported results (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>
<p>A phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) was derived from the 325812 variant positions in the core genome of the 863 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> VNI. Of the novel <italic>C. neoformans</italic> isolates presented here, 668 were VNIa (98.5&#x0025;), 10 were VNIb (1.5&#x0025;); none were VNIc. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that the population structure of VNIa is dominated by three common and highly clonal sub-clades, while VNIb and VNIc are more heterogenous. VNIa, VNIb and VNIc isolates were isolated from 14, 10 and 2 countries on 5, 6 and 1 continent(s), respectively (Supplementary Tables 2 &#x0026; 3). VNIa was predominant, accounting for 548 of 549 (99.8&#x0025;) isolates in Asia and 163 of 274 (59.5&#x0025;) strains in Africa. When isolates from Botswana, an established outlier in terms of <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> diversity, were excluded, the proportion of VNIa isolates in Africa was 84.3&#x0025; (134 out of 159) of all VNI isolates. The H99 reference genome belonged to VNIb.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="356816_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Nine distinct clusters were identified using PCA and K-means clustering (Supplementary Figure 3). We extended the naming scheme of Desjardins <italic>et al</italic>. to refer to the sub-clades within VNIa as VNIa-4, VNIa-5, VNIa-93 and VNIa-32 after the predominant MLST sequence type in each clade. Two clusters contained only isolates with novel STs, which we refer to as VNIa-X and VNIa-Y. The previously described VNIb and VNIc lineages were also identified as distinct clusters. The remaining polyphyletic VNI isolates which did not fall into any PCA cluster we grouped together into VNI-outlier. The number of each lineage isolated from HIV positive patients from each country are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1:</label>

<graphic xlink:href="356816_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>While each country had a dominant or, in the case of Vietnam, co-dominant sub-clade(s), there were minority sub-clades present in every country analysed (Supplementary Figure 4). For example, VNIa-93, the dominant lineage in Uganda, was also present in Vietnam (12&#x0025;). Similarly, Uganda and Botswana had low prevalence of typically Southeast Asian sub-clades such as VNIa-4 (Uganda = 1.6&#x0025;, Botswana = 2.9&#x0025;) and VNIa-5 (Uganda = 6.5&#x0025;, Botswana = 4.9&#x0025;).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b"><title>Phylogenetic analysis of sub-clades within VNIa</title>
<p>We performed fine-scale genomic epidemiological analyses of VNIa for every sub-clade with at least 50 isolates from this study, i.e. VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93. These sub-clades accounted for 89.3&#x0025; of the total isolates in our study, with VNIa-4 accounting for 41&#x0025;, VNIa-5 for 29&#x0025; and VNIa-93 for 20&#x0025;. To maximise the phylogenetic resolution within these sub-clades, within sub-clade reference genomes were generated using PacBio sequencing (available via FigShare doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.6060686). The median SNP distance of the VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93 strains to the within sub-clade reference genome was 277 (Standard Deviation (SD) = 142), 338 (SD = 236) and 361 (SD = 44) SNPs, compared with 47619 (SD = 196), 46218 (SD = 245) and 48763 (SD = 262) to the H99 reference genome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c"><title>Recombination Within Sub-Clades</title>
<p>Before deriving per sub-clade phylogenies from which genomic-epidemiological characteristics can be inferred, we quantified the extent to which recombination plays a role in generation of diversity within sub-clades. Recombination within sub-clades was investigated by assessing the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD). LD was assessed for all within sub-clade SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 0.1 or greater. There was limited decay of LD as assessed by R2 generated by vcftools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Danecek et al. 2011)</xref>, indicating minimal ongoing recombination (Supplementary Figure 5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d"><title>Isolates from disparate geographical locations are interspersed within the sub-clade phylogenies</title>
<p>One of the most striking patterns observed in the per-sub-clade phylogenies is the interspersion of isolates from different countries and different continents throughout the phylogeny (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2 (A), (B) and (C)</xref>), indicating frequent international and intercontinental transmissions. We used parsimony analysis to quantify the minimum number of international transmission events which explain the current geographic distribution of strains. VNIa-4 had the largest number of international transmission events as a proportion of total internal branches (95&#x0025; CI in parentheses, VNIa-4 = 13&#x0025; (11-16&#x0025;), VNIa-5 = 8&#x0025; (6-11&#x0025;), VNIa-93 = 10&#x0025; (7-14&#x0025;)), while VNIa-93 had the highest proportion of intercontinental branches (VNIa-4 = 1&#x0025; (0-2&#x0025;), VNIa-5 = 5&#x0025; (3-7&#x0025;), VNIa-93 = 7&#x0025; (5-10&#x0025;)).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e"><title>Notable within sub-clade phylogenetic features</title>
<p>A striking feature of the within sub-clade phylogenies is the combination of long terminal branch lengths and short internal branches. The median number of SNPs represented by the internal branch lengths compared with the terminal branch lengths are 4.5 vs 60 for VNIa-4 (P-value from Kolmogorov-Smirnov test = 7&#x00D7;10<sup>-70</sup>), 3 vs 77.5 for VNIa-5 (P-value = 1&#x00D7;10<sup>-53</sup>) and 6 vs 44.5 for VNIa-93 (P-value = 4&#x00D7;10<sup>-19</sup>) (Supplementary Figure 6).</p>

<p>There were a total of 18071, 17593 and 7163 terminal branch SNPs in VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93. HIV infection status had no significant association with the terminal branch length of ST5 isolates. We had only 5 environmental strains in our dataset (one VNIa-4 and four VNIa-5), and they had a similar mean terminal branch length (75 SNPs). There were 263, 294 and 31 variants (1.5&#x0025;, 1.8&#x0025; and 0.4&#x0025; of total) which occurred more than once on different terminal branches in VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93. However, most of these (VNIa-4, 52&#x0025;; VNIa-5, 60&#x0025;; and VNIa-93, 65&#x0025;) were in intergenic regions (i.e. not in coding sequence, 3&#x2019; or 5&#x2019; UTR or introns). We manually investigated any gene containing a variant which occurred as a homoplasy in 3 or more strains for recognised links with virulence or host interactions, but had no informative hits. The average dN/dS of SNPs in the terminal branches were 0.84, 0.82 and 0.84 in VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93, respectively.</p>
<p>Another striking feature of the within sub-clade trees was the number of polytomies. All internal branches that represented 0 SNPs were collapsed, resulting in 78, 65 and 35 collapsed branches in 46, 36 and 21 distinct polytomies (defined as nodes with more than 2 children, after branches of 0 SNPs were collapsed) in VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93, respectively. The collapsed branches as a proportion of the total number of branches in each sub-clade were 13&#x0025;, 15&#x0025; and 12&#x0025; in VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93. The median number of branches resulting from a polytomy event was 3 in all sub-clades, while the maximum was 9, 11 and 6 in VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). For VNIa-4, 14 of 29 (48&#x0025;) polytomies were international (i.e. strains in the polytomy were isolated from more than one country) and 1 (3&#x0025;) of these was intercontinental. For VNIa-5, 10 of 24 (42&#x0025;) polytomies were international and 6 (25&#x0025;) were intercontinental. For VNIa-93, 4 of 21 (19&#x0025;) polytomies were international and 1 (5&#x0025;) of these was intercontinental. The maximum time separating the sampling date of two isolates descending directly from the same polytomy (i.e. not separated via an internal branch representing &#x003E;0 SNPs) was 10 years for VNIa-4, 15 years for VNIa-5 and 8 years for VNIa-93. The median time range spanned by polytomies was 5.5, 5 and 1 year(s) for VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93, respectively. Genome sequences from isolates from both our study and that of Desjardins <italic>et al.</italic> belonged to the same polytomies.</p>

<sec id="s2f"><title>Within Sub-Clade Temporal Patterns</title>
<p>The majority of isolates in our study were collected during two clinical trials which recruited patients between 2004-2010 and 2013-2015 (Supplementary Figure 7A). As the first clinical trial only recruited patients in Vietnam, this is the only country for which we have considerable temporal range. This data shows that two sub-clades, VNIa-4 and VNIa-5 have been predominant in every year in which more than 5 samples were taken since 2004 (Supplementary Figure 7B). The prevalence of VNIa-32 appears to have declined, in 2004 it accounted for 12&#x0025; (4/34) of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> collected, while there were no cases of this sub-clade observed in 2014 (0/40), the last year of collection. We found a lack of clock like evolution within all three sub-clades. The slope of the trend-line between time of isolation and root to tip distance was negative for both VNIa-4 and VNIa-5. There was a poor correlation between time of isolation and distance from the root in the tree for all three sub-clades (correlation co-efficient -0.07, -0.22 and 0.32 for VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93) (Supplementary Figure 8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g"><title>Evidence of genome re-arrangement</title>
<p>The median number of genome re-arrangements between pairs of VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93 isolates were 10, 7 and 3, respectively. There was no significant association between SNP distance between isolates and the number of re-arrangements in VNIa-4, VNIa-5 or VNIa-93 (Supplementary Figure 9). There was also no association between the number of polytomies which occurred since the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the two isolates and the number of genome re-arrangements between the isolates (Supplementary Figure 10)</p>

<sec id="s2h1"><title>Association between sub-clade and outcome</title>
<p>We used data from our recent randomised controlled trials of treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis patients to define the effect of sub-clade on survival until 10 weeks or 6 months after randomisation. We used a Cox proportional hazards regression model with sub-clade as the main covariate, adjusted for country and treatment. Complete data were available from 530 patients. The survival over 6 months is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Infections with VNIa-93 were associated with a significantly reduced risk of death by both 10 weeks and 6 months (hazard ratios (HR) 0.45 95&#x0025;CI 0.26 to 0.76, p = 0.003 and 0.60, 95&#x0025;CI 0.39 to 0.94, p=0.024, respectively) compared with lineage VNIa-4 infections. There were no differences in outcomes between infections with VNIa-4 and any other lineage (See Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).</p>

<sec id="s2h2"><title>Association between VNIa-5 and HIV uninfected patients</title>
<p>Vietnam was the only country with more than 10 isolates of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> from HIV uninfected people. Therefore, only isolates from Vietnam were included in this analysis. Thirty five percent of HIV infected patients were infected with VNIa-5, compared with 75&#x0025; of HIV uninfected patients (Fishers exact test, odds ratio 5.4, 95&#x0025; CI 2.8-10.8, P &#x003C; 10-8). Isolates from HIV uninfected patients are interspersed throughout the entire VNIa-5 phylogeny, implying all strains of this cluster could potentially cause infection in such hosts.</p>

<sec id="s2h3"><title>VNIa-5 defining SNPs</title>
<p>Due to the association between VNIa-5 and disease in HIV uninfected patients, we were interested in SNPs which define VNIa-5. Ancestral sequence reconstruction identified 7465 SNPs between the &#x2018;origin&#x2019; of VNIa-5 and the MRCA of VNIa-5 which were 95&#x0025; sensitive and specific for VNIa-5. There were 1868 non-synonymous SNPs, distributed among 1220 genes. The dN/dS ratio was calculated for all genes with SNPs on the VNIa-5 defining branch, there were no genes known to be associated with virulence or interaction with the host that had extremes of dN/dS ratio. The overall dN/dS ratio of genic SNPs on this branch was 0.33, compared with the SNPs on the VNIa-4 defining branch which had an overall dN/dS of 0.38. There were seven genes with nonsense SNPs, introducing premature stop codons into five hypothetical proteins, one E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (CNAG_04262) and a metacaspase, a cysteine protease involved in cell apoptosis (CNAG_06787).</p>

<sec id="s2i"><title>Mitochondrial sequence</title>
<p>A maximum likelihood phylogeny was derived for the SNPs identified in the mitochondrial DNA (mtSNP) of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> VNI (Supplementary Figure 11 B). When the mtSNP tree was compared with the whole genome SNP (wgSNP) tree (Supplementary Figure 11 B), some sub-clades were phylogenetically congruous, while others were not. VNIa-4, VNIa-5, VNIa-32, and VNIa-Y were all monophyletic within the mtSNP tree, in agreement with the whole genome SNP tree (Supplementary Figure 11 A). For VNIa-93, 144 out of 145 isolates were paraphyletic, with the monophyletic VNIa-32 and VNIa-Y nested within the VNIa-93 genotype, while VNIa-X was identical to the majority mtSNP genotype of VNIa-93. In the mitochondrial phylogeny VNIb is paraphyletic, giving rise to two sub-clades of VNIc, the first contained 19 isolates while the second is a singleton, and two VNI-outlier isolates. The most parsimonious description for VNIc is polyphyletic, with 8 different mono or paraphyletic groups. Otherwise, the paraphyletic grouping of all VNIc includes 648 isolates, only 89 of which are VNIc.</p>
<p>The most striking incongruity between the mtSNP and the whole genome data was in the placement of VNIa-5. In the whole genome tree, VNIa-5 is within the VNIa group with VNIa-4 as its sister taxa. In contrast, in the mtSNP tree, VNIa-5 is an outgroup, even in relation to VNIb and VNIc. There was a 28 bp sequence, intergenic between CNAG_09008 and CNAG_09009 (positions 19441 to 19469 of the mtSNP sequence, NC_018792.1), which contained 8 variants, present in every VNIa-5 in the dataset. This sequence begins 280 bp downstream of the 3&#x2019; end of CNAG_09008 and terminates 200 bp upstream of CNAG_09009. It had a per-site substitution rate of 0.28 compared with 0.004 for the VNIa-5 mitochondrial sequence as a whole. None of the variant positions were shared by any other <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain, or by <italic>C. deneoformans</italic> JEC21 (GCA_000091045) or <italic>C. gattii</italic> R265 (GCA_000149475). When the putative recombinant region was compared against the full nr/nt BLAST database, the closest hit was to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> H99, chromosome 5 (NC_026749.1), positions 80207 to 80234, which had 1 bp difference (E-value = 0.004). This closest sequence on chromosome 5 is within CNAG_06848 which is widely conserved in the fungal kingdom. CNAG_06848 is a 222 bp gene encoding an &#x2018;ATP synthase subunit 9, mitochondrial&#x2019;. There were no strains in our dataset with SNPs in CNAG_06848 which could indicate a reciprocal recombination event. The assembly of the pacbio sequenced VNIa-5 genome also showed the presence of the highly variable region in the mitochondrial genome</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We sequenced 699 isolates of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> covering 19 years and 5 countries on 2 continents, with most isolates derived from two large clinical trials. We integrated our novel data with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Desjardins et al. 2017</xref>) to provide extra context for our original findings. This context allowed us to assign 99.4&#x0025; of the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> isolates sequenced as part of this study to the global clade VNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Litvintseva et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Khayhan et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferreira-Paim et al. 2017)</xref>. According to the nomenclature established by Desjardins <italic>et al.</italic> 98.5&#x0025; of our isolates belonged to VNIa, compared with 30&#x0025; of clinical VNI isolates and 18.5&#x0025; of all isolates sequenced by Desjardins. To some extent, this difference is to be expected due to the focus of Desjardins <italic>et al.</italic> on both VNI and VNB, and their intensive sampling of Botswana, a known outlier in terms of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Litvintseva et al. 2006)</xref>. This dominance of VNIa in our samples is interesting for two reasons. Firstly, it begs the question, are there specific biological properties of VNIa, or of VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93 which underlie their success? Secondly, the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> reference strain, H99, belongs to VNIb, which accounts for fewer than 1.5&#x0025; of the clinical isolates in our study. We suggest that it may be useful to the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> research community to consider including more representative isolates (i.e. from VNIa) in detailed laboratory investigations.</p>
<sec id="s3a"><title>There is very little novel diversity observed in the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in our study</title>
<p>Even though 98.5&#x0025; of our isolates were VNIa, we observed little additional diversity within VNIa that was not also observed in the much smaller number of VNIa isolates sequenced by Desjardins et al. This is due to the presence in our isolate collection of a small number of very common, highly clonal sub-clades. The three most common sub-clades (VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93) accounted for 92&#x0025; of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> sequenced in this study. When there are a lot of internal nodes near the tips of the tree, it means that you either have high extinction rates or recently increased growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pybus et al. 2002)</xref>. High extinction rate could be due to a relatively rapid decline in the ability of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> cells to germinate over time, while a recently increased growth rate could be due to exploitation of a new niche, such as the HIV infected human host.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b"><title><italic>C. neoformans</italic> undergoes frequent transfers between continents</title>
<p>The phylo-geography of VNIa is characterised by each lineage being predominantly but not exclusively found in a single country or continent. While our sampling is exclusively from Asia and Africa, and is therefore not globally representative, VNIa-4 and VNIa-5 were predominantly Asian (97&#x0025; and 89&#x0025;), and VNIa-93 was predominantly African (64&#x0025;). This finding is consistent with previous reports, with particular STs having been reported to be more common in certain countries, regions, or continents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Khayhan et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Litvintseva et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferreira-Paim et al. 2017)</xref>. However, whole genome sequencing provides us with extra resolution in resolving whether, for example, the 7&#x0025; of VNIa-5 strains in Africa are the result of a single introduction or multiple discrete introductions. To address this question, we generated within sub-clade reference genomes using PacBio sequencing and performed within sub-clade phylogenetic analyses. Examination of the within sub-clade phylogenetic trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and parsimony analysis shows that international and intercontinental transmission is a frequent event, with 8-13&#x0025; of internal branches representing an international transmission.</p>
<p>While nearly clonal isolates have been identified in disparate locations by a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rhodes et al. 2017</xref>), the authors focussed more on exploring ancient migrations. Our data dramatically illustrate the extent of this on-going intercontinental migration and we offer two alternative explanations. The first potential explanation is that transmission between countries or continents occurs during latent infection, i.e. a patient is exposed in one country, and then travels to another country where they develop illness and are sampled. Such long distance latent transmission has been hypothesised previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Hermoso et al. 1999)</xref>. Unfortunately, we do not have extensive travel/residence histories for our patients and thus cannot directly address this hypothesis. However, historically there has not been large scale migration between Southeast Asia and South/East Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kuyper 2008)</xref>, suggesting that this hypothesis is insufficient to explain the high frequency of transmissions. A second, broad hypothesis to explain the large number of transmission events is that they are mediated by environmental factors, either &#x2018;natural&#x2019; or human influenced. Potential natural environmental factors would include air currents or migratory birds; pigeons specifically are considered the most probable vector for global dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lin and Heitman 2006)</xref>. Human activities that link the environments of East/Southeast Africa and Southeast Asia include trade in lumber, rice, exotic animals, and illegal animal products such as those used in traditional medicine e.g. ivory (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/exclusive-vietnam-double-standards-ivory-trade-161114152646053.html">http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/exclusive-vietnam-double-standards-ivory-trade-161114152646053.html</ext-link>). While we cannot directly address this hypothesis with our data, airborne spread is well established as a long distance dispersal mechanism for plant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brown 2002)</xref>. Intuitively it might seem unlikely that long distance airborne dispersal of fungal pathogens occurs frequently. However if airborne spore dispersal conforms to a non-exponentially bound (or &#x2018;fat-tailed&#x2019;) distribution model rather than an exponential model, long distance dispersions will occur relatively frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brown 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shaw 1994)</xref>. Weather patterns are a proto-typical example of such &#x2018;fat-tailed&#x2019;, &#x2018;chaotic&#x2019; (small differences in initial conditions, leading to large differences in outcome) distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lorenz 1963)</xref>. However, effective quantification of the potential contribution of airborne dispersal is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Meyer et al. 2017)</xref> and beyond the scope of this paper. Overall, we consider environmental factors to be the better explanation because (i) <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> is fundamentally an environmental organism (ii) there is limited human migration between Southeast Asia and East/Southeast Africa and (iii) long distance dispersal by environmental factors, including wind, is well established for fungal pathogens.</p>
<p>We found no correlation between root-to-tip phylogenetic distance and time since isolation in any of the three main VNIa sub-clades. One reason for the lack of a molecular clock could be the fact that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> can enter a quiescent state, in the form of hardy spores. The lack of molecular clock indicates <italic>C. neoformans</italic> spends enough time in the quiescent state to efface the clock-like signal, at least over the relatively short time scale sampled here. The lack of molecular clock has also been reported for the spore-forming bacterium <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sahl et al. 2016)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c"><title><italic>C. neoformans</italic> internal branches are very short compared with the terminal branches</title>
<p>A striking feature of all three within sub-clade phylogenies (VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93) was the difference between the length of the internal branches and the terminal branches. Median internal branch lengths were between 3 and 6 SNPs, while median terminal branch lengths were 44.5-77.5 SNPs. Long terminal branches are to be expected in an environmentally acquired organism, with no human-to-human transmission, but the contrast between these long terminal branches and the short internal branches is striking. Since the human host is considered a dead end for <italic>C. neoformans</italic> life-cycle, it is likely that most of the accumulation of variation represented by the internal branches occurred in the environment, rather than within humans. The short average internal branch indicates that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> VNIa does not generally acquire a lot of substitutions in the environment, implying a lack of cellular division and growth. In contrast, the terminal branches are almost all long, due to observed substitutions, and substitutions imply cell division. This leads to an apparent contradiction, as the terminal branches of the 5 environmental isolates in VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93 from our study and Desjardins et al. represent, on average, 75 SNPs. Therefore, to resolve this contradiction, we propose a scenario where <italic>C. neoformans</italic> VNIa is typically quiescent in the environment, and as a pre-condition for being cultured from the environment it must be recently derived from a population which is actively growing. This hypothesis could be tested by comparing the culture positive rates for <italic>C. neoformans</italic> from the environment, with positive rates by molecular testing e.g. PCR from the same samples. A higher number of positives for molecular testing compared with culture would support our hypothesis.</p>
<p>What are the implications of this idea for the clinical isolates which make up most of our cases? What we know is that the vast majority of clinical isolates have long terminal branches and that this amount of growth does not frequently occur in the environment. Therefore, the long terminal branches either occur within the patient, or are a pre-condition for infection of the human lung. We investigated the idea that, if the SNPs occur in patient the organisms may be evolving under pressure from the host, as has been observed for <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al. 2017</xref>). The dN/dS of the SNPs in the terminal branches was consistent between sub-clades, ranging between 0.82-0.84 compared with the even lower dN/dS of SNPs in the long branches defining VNIa-4 (dN/dS = 0.38) and VNIa-5 (dN/dS = 0.33). This shows that SNPs in the terminal branches are relatively permissive of non-synonymous SNPs. This could be due to the SNPs occurring in an environment with relatively high positive selection, or more likely because there has been less time for mildly deleterious non-synonymous mutations to be lost. A small proportion (1.5&#x0025;, 1.8&#x0025;, 0.4&#x0025;) of terminal branch SNPs were homoplasies. It is interesting that the majority of homoplasies were in intergenic regions, considering that according to standard models, these should be under weak or no selective pressure. It is possible that these intergenic regions have an unidentified regulatory role, as has recently been proposed for bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Thorpe et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hammarl&#x00F6;f et al. 2018</xref>), or the homoplasies could be the result of recombination.</p>
<p>While we cannot put an accurate molecular clock to this dataset, it has been reported that within patients there is accumulation of 1 SNP every 58 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al. 2017</xref>). If this rate holds for the terminal branches in our analysis then the average terminal branch represents between 7 and 12 years. This is an unfeasible length of time for a patient to have an uncontrolled <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection, so either there is growth during latency or the substitution rate accounting for the terminal branch SNPs is higher than that reported by Chen <italic>et al</italic>. or much of the terminal branch mutation occurs outside the infected human.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d"><title>Large numbers of polytomies in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> phylogeny</title>
<p>One reason behind the short average internal branch length was the high number of polytomies in each sub-clade. A polytomy is a section of a phylogeny that cannot be fully resolved into dichotomous branching events. When observed in a phylogeny, they can either be due to a lack of information which allows the true relationship to be revealed (a &#x2018;soft&#x2019; polytomy) or due to more than 2 simultaneous &#x2018;speciation&#x2019; events (a &#x2018;hard&#x2019; polytomy). As we are using reference genomes that are on average 277-361 SNPs from the isolates, in a &#x007E;19 Mbp genome, it seems unlikely that we are lacking SNP information that would resolve these polytomies. The lowest percentage coverage of the H99 reference genome in our analysis was 95&#x0025;, indicating that the vast majority of the genome is being interrogated in these analyses. Therefore, the large numbers of polytomies we have observed are likely to be hard polytomies. Of course, at this fine scale, they are not speciation events, but rather the seeding of numerous progeny by a genetically homogenous population with no or very limited intermediate growth (if there was lots of intermediate growth, there would be accumulation of substitutions).</p>
<p>These polytomies occurred throughout the sub-clade trees, both near the tips and deeper in the tree. We showed that the isolates arising directly (i.e. immediate inferred ancestor was a polytomy) from the same polytomy could be remarkably diverse in their spatio-temporal distribution. The maximum difference in isolation time between two isolates arising from the same polytomy was 10 years, and the average ranged between 1 and 5.5 years for the different sub-clades. This temporal spread is not that surprising, considering the extended latent period of infection, and the lack of molecular clock in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. What is more surprising is that 14-49&#x0025; of polytomies result in infections of patients from different countries, and 3-25&#x0025; result in infections of patients on different continents. This means that polytomies are unlikely to be entirely explained by exposure of all patients to the same point source of infectious propagules. One biological process which could explain these polytomies is long distance transmission of quiescent propagules. In other published studies, there were very few phylogenetically informative SNPs (two between 10 strains) reported in <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> VGIIa, although the authors ascribed this to lack of sampling; it is unclear to us how the addition of further isolates will provide information which further differentiates these published sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Billmyre et al. 2014)</xref>. Polytomies have been observed in phylogenetic analysis of <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sahl et al. 2016)</xref>, which also forms spores. A similar pattern of long terminal branches and short internal branches can be seen in the spore forming <italic>C. difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Knetsch et al. 2017)</xref>.</p>
<p>Desjardins et al. established that there is still recombination on-going within VNIa. However, within each sub-clade, recombination appears to be a relatively minor contributor of genetic diversity. LD decay over genomic distance was minimal in all three sub-clades, although the small number of SNPs with a Minor Allele Frequency &#x003E; 0.1 (due to short internal branches) means that this analysis was not well powered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3e"><title>Is the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> spore the quiescent propagule?</title>
<p>We present multiple strands of evidence (polytomies, difference between internal and terminal branch lengths, lack of molecular clock, long distance dispersal) which indicate that a quiescent phase is important in the epidemiology of <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>. The most obvious candidate for this quiescent stage is the well described <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> spore, which can be produced by either mating or fruiting. Due to the preponderance of one mating type, it is more likely that same sex fruiting is responsible for spore generation than mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lin et al. 2005</xref>). High rates of recombination have been reported during both fruiting and mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lin et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ni et al. 2013)</xref>. However, in our data there was limited within sub-clade recombination, consistent with the lack of recombination within closely related outbreak clades of <italic>C. gattii</italic> in the Pacific Northwest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Billmyre et al. 2014)</xref>. There was also limited genome re-arrangement, and little correlation between the number of SNPs and the number of genome re-arrangements.</p>
<p>Our failure to identify significant recombination leads us to believe that either fruiting is not the phenomenon which produces quiescent propagules or our results suffer from technical bias due to use of short read assemblies to detect genome re-arrangements. The <italic>C. neoformans</italic> genome is rich in transposons, which would be expected to break a short-read assembly, therefore transposon mediated re-arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Idnurm et al. 2005)</xref> may not be detected by our analyses. Therefore, long read (Oxford Nanopore or Pacbio) sequencing should be used to address this technical explanation. Our data highlight an inconsistency in the literature between the clonal nature of globally distributed VNI and the putative role of spores in the natural history of cryptococcosis when recombination is expected to occur in both fruiting and mating. An alternative quiescent propagule which has been previously described in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is desiccated yeast cells. Although minimal work has been done on this cell type, there is no obvious requirement for genetic re-arrangements during the desiccation process.</p>

<sec id="s3f"><title>Association between lineage and clinical features</title>
<p>We observed two associations between lineage and clinical phenotype. Firstly, the previously described association between VNIa-5 and the infection of HIV uninfected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Day et al. 2017)</xref> and secondly, the novel finding of a significantly lower risk of death at 10 weeks in patients infected with VNIa-93, in contrast to previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wiesner et al. 2012)</xref>.</p>
<p>One interesting difference between the VNIa-5 isolates and the rest of VNIa was identified in the mitochondrial sequence. We observed a small recombination event which introduced 8 SNPs which were present in every VNIa-5 isolate and absent in every non-VNIa-5 isolate. The most likely candidate for the donor sequence was chromosome 5 of the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> nuclear genome, which encodes a sequence which varies by only 1 bp from the 21 bp putative recombinant fragment. While this has not been previously described in the literature, since these positions were not mixed, and the reads containing the divergent sequence mapped well to the mtDNA, we deem it likely that the mitochondrial sequence has been accurately re-constructed, while the origin of the divergent sequence is much less certain. That this change occurs in the mitochondrion is particularly intriguing as changes in mitochondrial morphology have been reported as underlying the hyper-virulence of the Vancouver outbreak <italic>C. gattii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ma et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Voelz et al. 2014)</xref>. The putative recombination is in an intergenic region of the mitochondrion so if this variant underlies a modified phenotype, it is likely driven by changes in gene expression. Fungal mitochondrial 5&#x2019; untranslated leader sequences have been described between 81 to 220 bp in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sch&#x00E4;fer 2005</xref>), while the putative recombination occurs 200 bp upstream of CNAG_09009.</p>
<p>In summary, the analysis of 699 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> genomes has revealed that clinical isolates of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> from Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Uganda and Malawi are concentrated in three main sub-clades. The phylogenetic structure indicates that there is either a high extinction rate in isolates causing human infections, or there has been a recent rapid expansion e.g. into a new niche such as HIV infected people. While it is frequently transmitted between continents, it likely spends the majority of it&#x2019;s time in the environment in a quiescent state, but has always undergone a significant period of growth when cultured from the environment or infected people. We also show that VNIa-93, which has previously been associated with poorer outcomes is associated with a significantly reduced risk of death by 10 weeks compared with VNIa-4. We show that genome sequencing for fungal pathogens can provide insight into diverse clinical, epidemiological and ecological features.</p>

<sec id="s4a"><title>Strain Selection</title>
<p>The Vietnamese isolates (N=441) were clinical isolates from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients enrolled in a prospective, descriptive study of HIV-uninfected patients with central nervous system (CNS) infections (n=67) enrolled between 1997 and 2014, a randomized controlled trial of antifungal therapy in HIV-infected patients between 2004 and 2011, the CryptoDex trial, and 3 environmental isolates from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beardsley et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chau et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Day et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">2013</xref>). The whole genome sequences of 8 Vietnamese strains in this analysis have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Day et al. 2017)</xref>. Lao isolates were from 73 patients with invasive cryptococcal infection admitted to Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, between 2003 and 2015, including 5 from the CryptoDex trial. Isolates from Uganda (132), Malawi (13) and Thailand (40) were all from HIV infected patients enrolled into the CryptoDex trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beardsley et al. 2016)</xref>. Sixty-nine isolates from Vietnam and 8 from Laos were derived from patients not known to be infected with HIV. All clinical trials had ethical approval from the local IRB in each centre and from the Oxford Tropical Ethics Committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b"><title>Micro and molecular biology</title>
<p>Isolates were revived from storage by incubation on Sabouraud&#x2019;s agar at 30&#x00B0;C for 72 h. Single colonies were spread for confluent growth and incubated at 30&#x00B0;C for 24 h. For Illumina sequencing, genomic DNA was extracted from approximately 0.5 g (wet weight) of yeast cells using the MasterPure Yeast DNA purification kit (Epicentre, USA) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Whole genome sequencing was carried out on Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the Sanger Institute UK, and commercially through Macrogen, Korea using the HiSeq 4000 platform. DNA for PacBio sequencing was extracted according to the protocol in Supplementary methods which was modified from dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.ewtbfen. PacBio sequencing was performed by Macrogen, Seoul, Korea, for 20kb SMRT library production, with 2 SMRT cells per sample, according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.</p>

<sec id="s4c"><title>Species identification, principal components analysis</title>
<p>Species identification was carried out using mash screen function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ondov et al. 2016)</xref> comparing the sample FASTQs against the whole refseq database. For the principal components analysis all variant positions were loaded into an adegenet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jombart and Ahmed 2011)</xref> (devel branch, commit 43b4360) genlight object using RStudio. Then the ade4 dudi.pca function was used to determine the principal components. K-means clustering was run on the first two principal components, with values to K between 2 and 10. The total within-cluster sum of squares was plotted for each K, and the number of clusters determined as the &#x2018;elbow&#x2019; in the plot of K vs total within-cluster sum of squares. As the previously described VNIb and VNIc were grouped into one cluster in the analysis of the first two PCs, the same analysis was carried out on the 3rd and 4th PCs, which separated these two established lineages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d"><title>Phylogenetics analysis</title>
<p>FASTQ data were mapped against the H99 reference (GCF_000149245) using bwa mem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li 2013</xref>), SNPs were called using GATK v3.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McKenna et al. 2010)</xref> in unified genotyper mode. Positions where the majority allele accounted for &#x003C; 90&#x0025; of reads mapped at that position, which had a genotype quality of &#x003C; 30, coverage &#x003C; 5x, or mapping quality &#x003C; 30 were recorded as Ns in further analyses. These steps were carried out using the PHEnix pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/phe-bioinformatics/PHEnix">https://github.com/phe-bioinformatics/PHEnix</ext-link>) and SnapperDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dallman et al. 2018)</xref>. Positions in which at least one strain had a SNP passing quality thresholds were extracted and used as the input for RAxML v8.2.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stamatakis 2014)</xref> maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis. Ancestral state reconstruction was carried out using IQ-TREE v1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nguyen et al. 2015)</xref>. To place our data into the broadest possible context, we included WGS data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Desjardins <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>. To ensure efficient use of computational resources, a preliminary phylogenetic analysis was carried out, including all our data and representatives of VNI, VNBI, VNBII and VNII from Desjardins et al. For polytomy analysis ete3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huerta-Cepas et al. 2010)</xref> was used to delete/collapse nodes (branches) in the tree that represented 0 SNPs. Any node in this new tree with collapsed branches with 3 or more children was defined as a polytomy. Pacbio data was assembled using Canu v1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Koren et al. 2017)</xref> and default parameters, polishing with Illumina data from the corresponding isolate using Pilon v1.22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Walker et al. 2014)</xref> for multiple rounds until the number of indels being corrected per round was less than 2.</p>

<sec id="s4e"><title>Analysis of effect of sub-clade on outcome</title>
<p>We assessed the effect of sub-clade on time to death (10 weeks and 6 months) in HIV infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis with a Cox proportional hazards regression model with sub-clade as the main covariate. We included all patients with available data from our two randomized controlled trials. The model was adjusted for country, induction antifungal treatment (amphotericin monotherapy for 4 weeks, amphotericin combined with flucytosine for 2 weeks, or amphotericin combined with fluconazole for 2 weeks) and the use of adjunctive treatment with dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beardsley et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Day et al. 2013)</xref>. We tested the proportional hazard assumption based on scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Since we knew from the Cryptodex trial that the covariate dexamethasone does not satisfy this assumption, we included a time varying coefficient for dexamethasone use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f"><title>Recombination analysis</title>
<p>Recombination analysis was carried out independently for VNIa-4, VNIa-5 and VNIa-93. Linkage disequilibrium (R2) was calculated on a per-lineage basis using vcftools v0.1.14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Danecek et al. 2011)</xref> and the &#x2013;geno-r2 option and a minimum allele frequency (MAF) of 0.1, LD was grouped in 100000 bp windows as there were not many SNPs with a MAF &#x003E; 0.1 within sub-clades due to the short internal branches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g"><title>Genome rearrangement analysis</title>
<p>Twenty five representatives of each sub-clade were <italic>de novo</italic> assembled using Velvet according to previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Makendi et al. 2016)</xref> and pairwise alignment carried out with Mauve (snapshot_2015-02-25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Darling et al. 2010)</xref>. The XMFA output of Mauve was then parsed using this python script (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gist.github.com/flashton2003/b6c3e4e31e9084220fd30188988808f5">https://gist.github.com/flashton2003/b6c3e4e31e9084220fd30188988808f5</ext-link>) which briefly, looked within contigs with more than one co-linear block and checks whether the paired contig has more than one co-linear block. If so, it checks that the other co-linear blocks match between the two contigs and if not, infers a re-arrangement.</p>
