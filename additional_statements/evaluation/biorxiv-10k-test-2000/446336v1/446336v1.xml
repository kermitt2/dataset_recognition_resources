<abstract>
<p>Cells in a developing organism are subjected to particular mechanical forces, which shape tissues and instruct cell fate decisions. How these forces are sensed and transmitted at the molecular level is thus an important question, which has mainly been investigated in cultured cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here, we elucidate how mechanical forces are transmitted in an intact organism. We studied <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle attachment sites, which experience high mechanical forces during development and require integrin-mediated adhesion for stable attachment to tendons. Hence, we quantified molecular forces across the essential integrin-binding protein Talin, which links integrin to the actin cytoskeleton. Generating flies expressing three FRET-based Talin tension sensors reporting different force levels between 1 and 11 pN enabled us to quantify physiologically-relevant, molecular forces. By measuring primary <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle cells, we demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Talin experiences mechanical forces in cell culture that are similar to those previously reported for Talin in mammalian cell lines. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> force measurements at developing flight muscle attachment sites revealed that average forces across Talin are comparatively low and decrease even further while attachments mature and tissue-level tension increases. Concomitantly, Talin concentration at attachment sites increases five-fold as quantified by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, suggesting that only few Talin molecules are mechanically engaged at any given time. We therefore propose that high tissue forces are shared amongst a large excess of adhesion molecules of which less than 15&#x0025; are experiencing detectable forces at the same time. Our findings define an important new concept of how cells can adapt to changes in tissue mechanics to prevent mechanical failure <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The shape of multicellular organisms critically depends on the presence of mechanical forces, during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Forces not only generate form and flows within tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] but can also control cell fate decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] or trigger mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. There are various ways to quantify forces at the cellular or tissue level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], however mechanical forces experienced by proteins in cells have only recently become quantifiable with the development of F&#x00F6;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based molecular tension sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. These sensors contain a donor and an acceptor fluorophore connected by a mechano-sensitive linker peptide, which reversibly unfold and extend when experiencing mechanical forces. As a result, such sensors report forces as a decrease in FRET efficiency resulting from an increase in distance between the fluorophores. Since previous studies analysed molecular forces using <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] and insights from <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments are still limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], it remains largely open how mechanical loads are processed at the molecular level in tissues of living organisms.</p>
<p>Integrins are a major and highly conserved force bearing protein family. They connect the actomyosin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and are essential for numerous mechanically regulated processes <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> it is particularly unclear how integrin-based structures are mechanically loaded since forces have so far been analysed in focal adhesions, which typically are not found in soft tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Therefore, we chose to investigate <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle attachment sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, which experience high mechanical forces during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] and depend on integrin-based attachment of muscle fibers to tendons cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. For the molecular force measurements we selected the integrin activator and mechanotransducer Talin, which is essential for all integrin mediated functions and binds with its globular head-domain to the tail of &#x03B2;-integrin and with its rod-domain to actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Thus, Talin is in the perfect position to sense mechanical forces across integrin-dependent adhesive structures. Surprisingly, we find that less than 15&#x0025; of the Talin molecules experience significant forces at muscle attachments <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting that high tissue forces are rather sustained by recruiting a large excess of Talin molecules to muscle attachments. This may have important impact for the robustness of muscle attachment under peak mechanical load in muscles.</p>

<title>A <italic>Drosophila</italic> Talin tension sensor</title>
<p>To enable quantitative force measurements, we generated various <italic>Drosophila</italic> Talin tension sensor and control flies by modifying the endogenous <italic>talin</italic> (<italic>rhea</italic>) gene using a two-step strategy based on CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering and &#x03D5;C31-mediated cassette exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Extended data Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. This strategy enabled us to generate an entire set of Talin tension sensor fly lines with YPet and mCherry (mCh) FRET pairs and three different mechano-sensitive linker peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], Flagelliform (F40), Villin headpiece (HP) and its stable variant (HPst), reporting forces of 1-6 pN, 6-8 pN and 9-11 pN, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The sensor modules were inserted both internally between the Talin head- and rod-domains (F40-TS, TS, stTS) at the analogous position used in mammalian Talin to report forces <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], and C-terminally as a zero-force control (C-F40-TS, C-TS, C-stTS). Furthermore, the individual fluorescent proteins were inserted at both positions as controls (I-YPet, I-mCh, C-YPet, C-mCh). Importantly, all stocks are homozygous viable, fertile and do not display any overt phenotype indicating that the Talin tension sensor proteins are functional.</p>

<p>To assess the functionality of the Talin tension sensor protein (Talin-TS) more rigorously, we first analysed Talin-TS localization in adult hemi-thoraxes and found that Talin-TS localizes to myofibril tips as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c-f</xref>). Second, we performed western blot analysis to ensure that the tension sensor module is incorporated into Talin protein isoforms as designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Third, we quantified sarcomere length in flight muscles and found the expected length of 3.2 &#x03BC;m in wild type (WT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and <italic>talin-TS</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1h-j</xref>). Forth, we tested flight ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and found that the insertion of neither the sensor module or the individual fluorescent proteins into the internal position nor the sensor module at the C-terminus caused flight defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1k</xref>). Finally, we confirmed that Talin-TS (or Talin-I-YPet) is expressed correctly at all developmental stages (embryo, larva and pupa) and is detected most prominently at muscle attachment sites as previously reported for endogenous Talin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1l-q</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Together, these data demonstrate that the tension sensor module is properly incorporated into Talin and the resulting protein is functional. This permits the quantification of mechanical tension across Talin in any tissue and at any developmental stage of <italic>Drosophila in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Forces across <italic>Drosophila</italic> Talin in primary muscle fiber cultures</title>
<p>To ensure that our approach is comparable to previous Talin force measurements in cultured mammalian cells, we established muscle fiber cultures by incubating primary myoblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> for 5-7 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Isolated myoblasts from <italic>talin-I-YPet</italic> embryos differentiated into striated, often multinucleated muscle fibers and efficiently adhered to the underlying plastic substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). In these cells, Talin-I-YPet localises to adhesions at the fiber tips and at myofibril ends as well as to costameres, which connect myofibrils at the sarcomeric Z-discs to the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Primary muscle fibers generated from <italic>talin-I-YPet</italic>, <italic>talin-TS</italic> and <italic>talin-C-TS</italic> embryos display similar morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c-e</xref>) and contract spontaneously (Supplementary Video 1). Adhesions at the fiber tips do not move during these contractions while costameres are mobile and thus not fixed to the plastic substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>

A decrease in FRET efficiency of Talin-TS (TS) compared to the C-terminal zero-force control (C-TS) indicates force.

<p>For establishing force measurements using these primary fiber cultures, we performed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to determine the FRET efficiency of the Talin tension sensor containing the HP sensor module (TS) compared to the zero-force control (C-TS). We created distinct masks for Talin FRET signals either in the entire fiber, or only in cell-substrate adhesions at the fiber tips, or in costameres along myofibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2g-j</xref>). Consistent with earlier Talin force measurements, we observed a reduction in FRET efficiency of TS compared to the control C-TS within the entire fiber, indicating that Talin indeed experiences mechanical forces in these adherent, primary muscle fibers. As expected, we find higher average forces across Talin at muscle-substrate adhesions compared to the rest of the cell. In costameres, which are not fixed to the plastic substrate, the FRET efficiency of TS is indistinguishable from the control, indicating that forces across Talin at costameres are lower and do not exceed 6-8 pN. Together, these data demonstrate that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Talin tension sensor reports similar Talin forces at adhesions of cultured muscle fibers as were previously described for Talin in focal adhesions of mammalian fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>

<title>Forces across <italic>Drosophila</italic> Talin <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To quantify forces across Talin <italic>in vivo</italic>, we chose the developing muscle-tendon attachments of the flight muscles as a model system. At 20 hours after puparium formation (h APF), the developing myotubes have initiated contact with the tendon epithelium and immature muscle attachment sites are formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>). At 24 h APF, the attachment sites have started to mature while the myotubes compact and long cellular extensions from the tendon epithelium are formed. During this process, increasing mechanical tension is build up in the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. At 30 h APF, the myotubes reach their maximally compacted stage and initiate myofibrillogenesis, before the muscles elongate and grow to fill the entire thorax by the end of the pupal stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Since muscle attachment critically depends on integrins and Talin function to resist tissue tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], it is an ideally suited developmental system to investigate molecular forces across Talin <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>We measured Talin forces between 18 and 30 h APF in living pupae at the anterior muscle attachment sites of the dorsal-longitudinal flight muscles using the HP-sensor module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref> and workflow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). For calculating the FRET efficiency, we determined the donor fluorescence lifetime in flies expressing YPet alone at the internal position of Talin (I-YPet) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). In addition, we excluded the possibility that FRET between neighbouring molecules (intermolecular FRET) affects our measurements throughout the entire time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>) and confirmed that our lifetime measurements are independent of signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). When we compared FRET efficiencies in <italic>talin-TS</italic> and <italic>talin-C-TS</italic> animals, we detected a significant drop in FRET efficiency for Talin-TS at 18-28 h APF. However, the FRET efficiency reduction at muscle attachment sites was significantly smaller compared to the <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of cultured muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2k</xref>) or of cultured mammalian fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. At 30 h APF, no difference in FRET efficiencies was detected, suggesting that there is little or no tension across Talin at this time point. Together, these data suggest either that forces per Talin molecule are largely below 6-8 pN or that only a small percentage of Talin molecules at muscle attachments experience forces above 6 pN at 18-28 h APF. Contrary to our expectation, the average force across Talin decreases during muscle compaction when tissue tension is known to build up and myofibrils are assembled.</p>
<p>To substantiate these findings, we compared flies carrying the HP-based Talin sensor (6-8 pN) to those with the stable variant HPst (9-11 pN), which only differs in two point mutations. We found similar and highly reproducible differences in FRET efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>) indicating that at 20-24 h APF, some Talin molecules experience forces of even &#x2265;10 pN at muscle attachment sites. Importantly, comparison of TS to its stable variant (stTS) revealed a significant difference in FRET efficiency at 20 h APF while the respective zero-force controls were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>). This demonstrates that a proportion of the mechanically engaged Talin molecules experience a range of forces between 7 and 10 pN at muscle-tendon attachments <italic>in vivo</italic>, further emphasizing that the observed differences are force-specific.</p>
<p>To test whether the remaining Talin molecules experience forces that are too low to be detected by the HP or HPst sensor modules, we generated flies with the F40 sensor module, which is sensitive to forces of 1-6 pN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Again, we quantified a decrease in FRET efficiency relative to the control at 20 h and 24 h APF but FRET efficiency differences remained small and no change was observed at 30 h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Thus, a large proportion of the Talin molecules at muscle attachment sites are not exposed to significant mechanical forces during development.</p>
<p>To quantify the proportion of mechanically engaged Talin molecules at 20 h and 24 h APF, we applied biexponential fitting to our FLIM data and calculated the ratio of open <italic>vs</italic>. closed sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3f</xref>, see methods for details). This analysis revealed that only 13.2&#x0025; and 9.6&#x0025; of all Talin molecules are mechanically engaged at 20 h and 24 h APF, which contrasts <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of focal adhesions that are characterized by a Talin engagement ratio of about 70&#x0025; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>

<title>Talin concentration at developing muscle attachments</title>
<p>Since Talin is thought to play an important mechanical role during tissue formation, we wanted to test whether such a small proportion of mechanically engaged Talin molecules <italic>in vivo</italic> could still contribute a significant amount of tissue-level tension. We therefore quantified the absolute amount of Talin molecules present at muscle attachment sites by combining <italic>in vivo</italic> fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with quantitative confocal imaging (see workflow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Extended Data Fig. 4a-d</xref>). From FCS measurements in the muscle interior we calculated the counts per particle (CPP) value, i.e. the molecular brightness of a single Talin-I-YPet particle in each pupa. Since such a particle may correspond to a Talin monomer or dimer, we compared the Talin-I-YPet brightness to the brightness of free monomeric YPet expressed in flight muscles and found no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We conclude that Talin is mostly monomeric in the muscle interior.</p>

As more Talin is recruited during muscle attachment maturation, the proportion of mechanically-engaged Talin molecules decreases even further.</p>

<p>Next, we calculated the Talin concentration a muscle attachment sites by calibrating confocal images using the molecular brightness (CPP) information from the FCS measurements. Using a dilution series of Atto488, we ascertained that the fluorescence intensity increases linearly with the concentration over multiple orders of magnitude in our measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>). The resulting images with pixel-by-pixel Talin concentration values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>) indicate an average concentration at the muscle attachment of 5.9 &#x03BC;M (20 h), 10.9 &#x03BC;M (24 h) and 30.9 &#x03BC;M (30 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Thus, the local concentration of Talin molecules increases approximately two-fold from 20 h to 24 h and five-fold to 30 h, indicating that Talin may contribute to the overall increase in tissue stress by its strong recruitment to maturing muscle attachment sites.</p>
<p>To confirm this hypothesis, we estimated the density of Talin molecules on the membrane by dividing the number of Talin molecules per pixel by the estimated membrane area in the confocal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref>, see Methods for details). This resulted in about 400, 700 and 2300 Talin molecules per &#x03BC;M<sup>2</sup> at 20 h, 24 h and 30 h APF, respectively, which corresponds to 20 nm &#x00D7; 20 nm space per molecule at 30 h APF. This space can easily accommodate the size of a Talin head domain (about 4 nm &#x00D7; 10 nm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], and the estimated density is comparable to previous studies of integrins in focal adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>By combining our force quantifications with the estimated Talin density at muscle attachment sites, we calculated the Talin-mediated tissue stress to be in the order of 0.40-0.5 kPa at 20-24 h APF (see methods for details). These values are remarkably close to a previously published stress estimate of 0.16 kPa determined by traction force microscopy in focal adhesions of cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Thus, Talin does contribute a significant amount of tissue stress despite the small proportion of mechanically engaged molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings highlight the importance of investigating tissues in their natural mechanical environment <italic>in vivo</italic>. While the forces per Talin molecule and the tissue stress <italic>in vivo</italic> are in the same order of magnitude as in previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of focal adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], a surprisingly small proportion of Talin molecules (&#x003C;15&#x0025;) experience detectable forces during muscle development <italic>in vivo</italic>. An obvious question arising from our finding is: What are the other Talin molecules doing at muscle attachment sites, for which we cannot detect significant mechanical forces&#x003F; Likely, the pool of mechanically engaged Talin molecules exchanges dynamically with the other Talin molecules present at the muscle attachment site. Such a dynamic system can allow the attachment to rapidly adjust to changes in tissue forces preventing rupture of the muscle-tendon attachment upon a sudden increase in tissue force.</p>
<p>It has been shown previously in focal adhesions of cultured cells, that the length of Talin can fluctuate dynamically on the time scale of seconds, with Talin being transiently extended from 50 nm up to 350 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. This can be explained with reversible folding and unfolding of some of the 13 helical bundles in the Talin rod upon actomyosin-dependent stretching of Talin. The unfolding of the helical bundles makes binding sites accessible leading to recruitment of vinculin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. The dynamic stretching of Talin could allow it to act as a &#x2018;shock-absorber&#x2019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], consistent with our finding that only some molecules are under force at the same time, while additional molecules could be present to make the attachment robust against higher forces.</p>
<p>The forces required to unfold the Talin rod domains to enable vinculin binding are well within the range of the force sensors used here. The rod domain R3 unfolds at about 5 pN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] and the remaining rod domains unfold when forces larger than 8 pN are applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Hence, our force sensors detect biologically significant forces that change the Talin structure making vinculin binding sites accessible and allowing a mechanotransduction response.</p>
<p>Previous estimates of forces transmitted by integrins based on studies of focal adhesions <italic>in vitro</italic> cover a wide range of forces. Studies using extracellular sensors with synthetic integrin ligands (that report forces based on double-stranded DNA rupture) suggest that integrins can experience very high forces in cells plated on glass (more than 53 pN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. However, other data generated with FRET-based extracellular sensors suggest that about 70&#x0025; of the integrins in focal adhesions experience low forces (less than 3 pN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. While these <italic>in vitro</italic> systems have the advantage that they are accessible for precise manipulations, the artificial mechanical environment may have a strong impact on the amount of force experienced by the individual proteins and the number of molecules that are mechanically engaged. Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first insights into molecular forces acting on integrin-mediated attachments <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here we focus on developing muscle attachments in pupae, notably the built reagents should enable future force measurements in all integrin-based processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Based on our finding that only a small proportion of Talin molecules (&#x003C;15&#x0025;) are experiencing forces higher than 6-8 pN at muscle attachments, we hypothesize that tissues prevent mechanical failure during development <italic>in vivo</italic> with the following mechanism: a large pool of molecules dynamically share the mechanical load, such that a sudden increase in tissue tension can be rapidly buffered by mechanically engaging additional molecules already present at the attachment site. Mechanical failure of integrin-mediated attachments <italic>in vivo</italic> needs to be avoided at all cost, particularly in muscle fibers or cardiomyocytes, to prevent fatal consequences for the animal. Hence, creating a buffer to withstand peak forces can be an important concept for the survival of animals.</p>

<title>Calculation of the proportion of mechanically engaged Talin</title>
<p>We determined the number of mechanically engaged (&#x003D;open) tension sensor <italic>N<sub>open</sub></italic> relative to the total number of molecules <italic>N<sub>total</sub></italic> at the muscle attachment site using biexponential fitting similarly as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].

The lifetime of the open sensor <italic>&#x03C4;<sub>no</sub>FRET</italic> approximately corresponds to the lifetime of the donor alone, because of the large contour length increase upon opening of the sensor.

The lifetime <italic>&#x03C4;<sub>FRET</sub></italic> was determined from zero-force control (Talin-C-TS) data. Since the Talin-C-TS sample contains fully fluorescent sensor (<italic>&#x03C4;<sub>fret</sub></italic>) and sensor with non-fluorescent mCherry acceptor (<italic>T<sub>noFRET</sub></italic>), we used a biexponential fit with fixed <italic>&#x03C4;<sub>no</sub>FRET</italic> to determine <italic>&#x03C4;<sub>FRET</sub></italic>.

Autocorrelation curves were analysed with our open-source software <italic>PyCorrFit</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] (Version 1.0.1, available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pycorrfit.craban.de/">http://pycorrfit.craban.de/</ext-link>). For fitting Rhodamine 6G data we used a model accounting for triplet transitions and three-dimensional diffusion (denoted &#x201C;T-3D&#x201D; in <italic>PyCorrFit</italic>). The detection volume <italic>V<sub>eff</sub></italic> was calculated based on the measured diffusion time (<italic>&#x03C4;<sub>diff</sub></italic>) and the published diffusion coefficient D &#x003D; 414 &#x03BC;M<sup>2</sup>/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]:

<p>For all measurements, the axis ratio of the detection volume S &#x003D; 5 was consistently fixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. In living pupae, fluorescent proteins (YPet or Talin-I-YPet) were measured by FCS using a park and probe procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]: In images, three positions in the muscle interior next to the muscle attachment site were manually selected for FCS (10x 40s recordings). For fitting of Talin-I-YPet autocorrelation curves (time bins &#x003E; 1 &#x03BC;s), a two-component three-dimensional diffusion model with two non-fluorescent dark states (denoted &#x201C;T&#x002B;T&#x002B;3D&#x002B;3D&#x201D; in <italic>PyCorrFit)</italic> was applied. Transient dark states were assigned either to triplet transitions (&#x03C4;<sub>trip1</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>) in the time range of 1-20 &#x03BC;s and photochemical flickering (&#x03C4;<sub>trip2</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>) in the time range of about 200-600 &#x03BC;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. The first diffusion time was assigned to protein diffusion in the muscle interior whereas the second diffusion term was merely a descriptive term accounting for slow long tail behaviour that cannot be avoided in a crowed intracellular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Autocorrelation curves derived from visibly unstable intensity traces were excluded from further analysis. Due to the high endogenous expression levels, the contribution of non-correlated background was negligible. Thus, the molecular brightness, i.e. the counts per particle (CPP) value of Talin-I-YPet was determined by dividing the average intensity <italic>I</italic> (brackets indicate the average) by the number of molecules in the focal volume <italic>N</italic>, which is dependent on the autocorrelation amplitude G(0) (of the autocorrelation function G(&#x03C4;)) and the dark fractions T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> from the fit:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="446336_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Since freely diffusing YPet diffuses faster than Talin-I-YPet, the signal fluctuations related to flickering and diffusion cannot be distinguished in YPet measurements. Therefore, the autocorrelation curves of free YPet were fitted by a simplified model function accounting only for transient triplet states and two diffusive terms, of which the first combines contributions of both protein diffusion and flickering (denoted &#x201C;T-3D-3D&#x201D; in <italic>PyCorrFit</italic>). To estimate true particle numbers, we corrected for triplet transitions and flickering globally by using the average fractions T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> from corresponding Talin-I-YPet measurements performed with the same excitation power density:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="446336_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The diffusion constant of freely expressed YPet was in good agreement to other fluorescent proteins in the cytoplasm of living cells, suggesting the point spread function positioned in the muscle cell is still diffraction limited. This finding justifies the external calibration of the detection volume by Rhodamine 6G.</p>

<title>Calibration of confocal images</title>
<p>For quantification of the Talin-I-YPet concentration at muscle-tendon attachment sites, the developing flight muscles were imaged in photon counting mode (512&#x00D7;512 px, pixel dwell time <italic>PT</italic>&#x003D;50 &#x03BC;s). Saturation of the detector was carefully avoided (<italic>I</italic>(x,y) &#x003C; 2 MHz). The counts in each pixel of an image were calibrated by the molecular brightness (CPP) value determined for Talin-I-YPet in the interior of the same muscle fiber by FCS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Due to the monomeric state of Talin-I-YPet, intensity values stored in each pixel <italic>I</italic>(x,y) could be directly transformed into numbers of Talin molecules:

<p>Using the Avogadro constant and the detection volume (<italic>V<sub>eff</sub></italic>) as determined by Rhodamine 6G measurements, we then calculated concentration maps:

</disp-formula></p>
<p>Finally, the muscle attachment sites were isolated in the Talin-I-YPet concentration maps by creating a mask with the same thresholding algorithm as used for FLIM-FRET. The concentration values were averaged across pixels within the mask resulting in a mean concentration value per pupa.</p>

<title>Estimation of Talin density and tissue stress</title>
<p>To estimate Talin density on the membrane from pixel-by-pixel concentration values, we divided the average number of molecules in the focal volume at the muscle attachment sites by the membrane area in the focal volume. The focal volume was determined by Rhodamine 6G FCS measurements as described above. For the shape of the focal volume we assumed an ellipsoid with the long axis (z) being 5-times the short axis (x&#x003D;y). Hence, for a focus volume of 0.32 fL, the membrane area in the z-y-plane is 0.63 &#x03BC;M<sup>2</sup>. Taking into account that there are two membranes (one from the tendon and one from the muscle) and that the membrane is not flat (ruffles approximately increase the area 2-fold as determined from EM-images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]) the total membrane area in the focal volume is about 2.5 &#x03BC;M<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>To estimate Talin-mediated tissue stress, we calculated <italic>force threshold of sensor</italic> &#x00D7; <italic>Talin density</italic> &#x00D7; <italic>proportion of mechanically engaged Talin</italic> &#x003D; 7 pN &#x00D7; 400 molecules/&#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup> &#x00D7; 13.2&#x0025; &#x003D; 0. 37 kPa for 20 h APF and 7 pN &#x00D7; 700 molecules/&#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup> &#x00D7; 9.6&#x0025; &#x003D; 0.47 kPa for 24 h. Note, that these values are lower estimates since individual molecules might experience forces higher than 7 pN.</p>

<caption><title>Talin tension sensor genome engineering.</title>
<p><bold>a, Top:</bold> Gene model of <italic>talin</italic> (<italic>rhea</italic>, <italic>isoform RF</italic>) with the insertion sites (green) in the linker region between Talin head and rod (internal), and at the C-terminus. The gene <italic>CG6638</italic> immediately follows <italic>talin</italic> and therefore was included, too. <bold>Middle:</bold> Tension sensor allele with the sensor module inserted into the target exon in the linker region of Talin. attR sites left in the surrounding introns are shown in light blue. <bold>Bottom:</bold> C-terminal control sensor allele with the sensor module inserted at the C-terminus of Talin. Gene models are drawn to scale. <bold>(b)</bold> Scheme showing how tension sensor alleles were generated. <bold>Step 1:</bold> The target exon in the linker region (green) was replaced by a splice acceptor (SA)-3xStop-SV40 terminator (pA)-3xP3&#x003E;dsRed-pA cassette flanked by attP sites (P) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Specifically, a dsRed donor vector containing 1.5 to 2.0 kb homology arms was injected into <italic>Act5C</italic>-Cas9 expressing embryos (also carrying a <italic>lig4<sup>169</sup></italic> mutation to favour homology directed repair over non-homologous end-joining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]) together with two <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed single guide (sg)RNAs (target sites in blue). Successful targeting was identified by screening for fluorescent red eyes. <bold>Step 2:</bold> &#x03D5;C31-mediated cassette exchange was performed to replace the dsRed cassette by the original target exon including a tension sensor module consisting of YPet, a flexible calibrated, mechano-sensitive linker peptide (dark blue) and mCherry (mCh). To this end, a tension sensor donor vector including flanking attB sites (B) was injected together with vasa-&#x03D5;C31 plasmid. Thereby, the tension sensor was inserted seamlessly into the gene (after Talin amino acid 456) except for two attR sites (R) in the flanking introns. Successful exchange events were identified by screening for the absence of fluorescent red eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Control fly lines with one fluorophore and fly lines with different tension sensor modules were generated by repeating step 2 with different donor vectors. <bold>(C)</bold> Scheme showing how C-terminal zero-force sensor alleles were generated using the same strategy. However, at the C-terminus three exons (green) were replaced by the dsRed cassette in the first step, because the last intron in <italic>talin</italic> is small and the gene <italic>CG6638</italic> follows immediately after <italic>talin</italic>. All three exons were put back in the second step together with the sensor module resulting in one attR site in a <italic>talin</italic> intron and one in an <italic>CG6638</italic> intron. Respective controls with the individual fluorophores were also generated.</p>

<caption><title>Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy workflow.</title>
<p><bold>a</bold>, Living <italic>talin-TS</italic> or control pupae were prepared for imaging by opening a window in the pupal case above the thorax containing the developing flight muscles (magenta)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. <bold>b</bold>, Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was performed on a confocal microscope equipped with a pulsed laser (indicated by green peak) for exciting the donor fluorophore (YPet) and a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)-detector for recording photon arrival times (indicated by yellow dot). <bold>c</bold>, A YPet intensity image created from the FLIM data was used to manually draw a region of interest (ROI) containing the anterior muscle attachments sites of the dorso-longitudinal flight muscles close to the surface of the thorax. From this ROI a mask for the muscle attachment sites was created by Multi-Otsu thresholding. <bold>d</bold>, Photon arrival times of all photons inside the mask were plotted in a histogram. The tail of the curve was fitted by a monoexponential decay to determine the lifetime <italic>&#x03C4;</italic>. By comparing the lifetime of the Talin tension sensor <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>DA</sub> with the lifetime of respective donor-only control <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>D</sub>, the FRET efficiency <italic>E</italic> was calculated. <bold>e</bold>, Interpretation of FRET results: A high FRET efficiency indicates mostly closed sensor modules and therefore low force. Vice versa, a low FRET efficiency indicates mostly open sensor modules and therefore high force.</p>

<caption><title>Quantitative imaging workflow and control measurements for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS).</title>
<p><bold>a</bold>, Living <italic>talin-I-YPet</italic> pupae were prepared for quantitative imaging by opening a window in the pupal case above the thorax containing the developing flight muscles (magenta)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. <bold>b</bold>, A confocal image and three FCS measurements were acquired using the same detector on a confocal microscope. <bold>c</bold>, Autocorrelation curves from the FCS measurements were fit to obtain a counts per particle (CPP) value for each pupa. <bold>d</bold>, The CPP value was used to calibrate each image resulting in a pixel-by-pixel concentration image. This image was used to manually draw an ROI around the muscle attachment site. From this ROI a muscle attachment mask was created automatically by Multi-Otsu thresholding. Finally, the average concentration at the attachment was calculated from the pixel-values inside the mask for each pupa. <bold>e</bold>, Pixel-by-pixel photon count values measured in an Atto488 dye dilution series (mean with standard deviation). Note that the photon count values increase linearly with the concentration of the dye for the entire range measured.</p>
