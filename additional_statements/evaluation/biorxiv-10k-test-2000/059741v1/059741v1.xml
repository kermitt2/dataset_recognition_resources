<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Emergence of new protein structures has proved difficult to trace in nature and engineer in the laboratory. However, one aspect of structure evolution has proved immensely helpful for determining the three-dimensional structure of proteins from their sequences: in the vast majority of cases, proteins that share more than 30&#x0025; sequence identity have similar structures. Below this mark is the &#x201C;twilight zone&#x201D; where proteins may have identical or very different structures. These observations form the foundational intuition behind structure homology modeling. Despite their importance, however, they have never received a comprehensive biophysical justification. Here we show that the onset of the twilight zone is more gradual for proteins with low contact density, a proxy for low thermodynamic stability, than proteins with high contact density. Then we present an analytical model that treats divergent fold evolution as an activated process, in analogy to chemical kinetics, where sequence evolution must overcome thermodynamically unstable evolutionary intermediates to discover new folds. This model explains the existence of a twilight zone and explains why its onset is more abrupt for some classes of proteins than for others. We test the assumptions of the model and characterize the dynamics of fold evolution using evolutionary simulations of model proteins and cell populations. Overall these results show how fundamental biophysical constraints directed evolutionary dynamics leading to the Universe of modern protein structures and sequences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A wide variety of protein structures exist in nature, however the evolutionary origins of this panoply of proteins remain unknown. While protein sequence evolution is easily traced in nature and produced in the laboratory, the emergence of new protein structures is rarely observed and difficult to engineer (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). One approach to studying structure evolution is to examine how proteins&#x2019; structural similarity varies over a range of sequence identities. Such investigations proceed by aligning many pairs of proteins so that their sequence identity and structural similarity can be assessed (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The result is a cusped relationship between sequence and structure divergence: Sequences reliably diverge up to 70&#x0025; without significant evolution of protein structure. Below 30&#x0025; sequence identity, the structural similarity between proteins abruptly decreases, giving rise to a &#x201C;twilight zone&#x201D; where little can be said about the relationship between sequence identity and structural similarity without more advanced methods. This finding has provided the foundation of one of the most important methods in protein biophysics: structure homology modeling (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Despite the fact that the plateau of high structural similarity above 30&#x0025; sequence identity has been crucial for homology modeling and the abrupt onset of the twilight zone has motivated many of the advanced structure prediction methods, the cusped relationship between sequence and structural similarity has not yet received a detailed biophysical justification (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
<p>Randomly mutating 70&#x0025; of the residues in a protein will almost surely unfold it as even a small number of point mutations can destroy a protein&#x2019;s structure (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Therefore, it is clear that without evolutionary selection, the range of 100-30&#x0025; sequence identity could not correspond to nearly identical structures. Previous models of protein structure evolution have been able to explain many fundamental features of the protein universe using purely physical models, without any selection. Dokholyan et al. constructed a protein domain universe graph in which protein domain nodes are connected by an edge if they are structurally similar. The resulting graph is scale-free, which they showed would be the result of duplication and structural divergence of proteins (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Similarly, the birth, death, innovation models developed by Koonin et al. explains the power law-like distribution of gene family sizes that exists in many genomes (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, because these works use neutral models, they are unable to explain the cusped sequence-structure relationship.</p>
<p>A small but growing collection of cases where protein structure evolution has been observed or inferred provides mechanistic insight into the role of selection in protein structure evolution. They show that it is possible for proteins to be within a small number of point mutations of a fold evolution event (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) but also that structure emergence may often pass through thermodynamically destabilized intermediates. Among Cro bacteriophage transcription factors, a pair of homologous proteins with 40&#x0025; sequence identity (indicating that they share a recent common ancestor) but different structures was found. Subsequent studies showed that some Cro proteins might be just a few mutations away from changing fold (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Similarly, a trajectory of point mutations was engineered to convert a natural protein adopting a 3&#x03B1; fold into a 4&#x03B2;&#x002B;&#x03B1; fold. A major result of this work was finding a rare sequence of mutations that avoided unfolded intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Computational investigations of protein fold evolution using model proteins of Protein Data Base structures also show that structure evolution traverses unstable intermediates and found that less stable proteins are more evolvable at the structural level (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we explore the evolutionary dynamics of discovery of new protein structures. Given the fact that most globular proteins must adopt a well-defined 3D structure in order to function and the strong evidence that many fold evolution pathways require protein destabilization, we hypothesize that protein structure discovery requires crossing of valleys of low fitness on fitness landscapes corresponding to genetic encoding of evolutionarily transient, unstable proteins. Therefore, the strength of selection for folding stability under which a protein evolves may modulate its capacity to evolve a new structure. In this work we study evolution of protein folds using the data on sequence structure relationships in natural proteins and a variety of evolutionary models of increasing complexity and realism and find that the cusped relationship between structure and sequence divergence is a direct consequence of the interplay between evolutionary dynamics and biophysical constraint for protein folding stability. The sharpness of the &#x201C;cusp,&#x201D; but not its position (70&#x0025; of structural similarity for natural proteins) is determined by the strength of evolutionary selection for folding stability.</p>

<title>Structure-sequence relationship in the protein universe</title>
<p>A cusp-like relationship between structure and sequence divergence has long been observed in the record (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) when the sequence identity and structural similarity is determined for many pairs of protein domains. Here, we explore how selection for protein stability affects the shape of the relationship between sequence and structure divergence. We use the SCOP database of protein domains and examine the evolution of globular proteins as sequences diverge by aligning the sequences and structures of SCOP domains (See <italic>Methods</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Sequences were aligned using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm as implemented in MATLAB and structures were aligned using the Template-Modeling (TM) algorithm and given a TM score between 0 and 1 to quantify their degree of structural similarity (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>

<p>We define thermodynamic stability of a protein as the fraction of molecules in the ensemble that resides in the native state. It is an experimentally observable thermodynamic property of proteins that is related to fitness and as such might be under evolutionary selection (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). For single domain proteins that fold as two state systems this quantity is directly related to the folding free energy &#x0394;<italic>G</italic> through the Boltzmann relation of statistical mechanics:
<disp-formula id="eqn1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>T</italic> is temperature and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is Boltzmann constant. Here we consider only single domains as defined in SCOP and use the number of amino acid contacts normalized by the domain length, the contact density (CD), as a proxy for the folding free energy &#x0394;<italic>G</italic> of a protein in order to compensate for the relative deficiency of experimental thermodynamic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The connection between CD and folding free energy has been established through several lines of evidence. Inter-residue contacts stabilize a protein structure through van der Waals interactions, so the more contacts in a protein structure the more stable the structure. Indeed, proteins of thermophilic organisms have greater contact density than their mesophilic homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Finally, protein length correlates with both contact density and folding free energy. Correlation between length and contact density is a consequence of the globular structure of proteins where surface to volume ratio depends on total length. Folding free energy is an extensive property that increases with the total number of amino acids in a protein (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Generally lower free energy does not necessarily mean greater stability ( <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic>). That is, a protein consisting of two identical thermodynamically independent domains each having folding free energy &#x0394;<italic>G</italic>, will not be more stable than each domain in separation. However, for single-domain proteins that fold in a two-state manner folding free energy is directly related to stability as can be seen from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq.1</xref>.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1B-D</xref> (Dataset S1), the data are subdivided by contact density, such that only proteins in the bottom 10&#x0025; (CD &#x003C; 4.13 contacts per amino acid residue), middle 10&#x0025; (4.65 &#x003E; CD &#x003E; 4.57 contacts per amino acid residue), and top 10&#x0025; (CD &#x003E; 4.93 contacts per amino acid residue), of contact density are compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>, C, and D respectively). For the most stable proteins, there is a bimodal distribution of TM-align scores with a peak at high TM-align scores corresponding to diverging proteins maintaining near identical structures and a peak at low TM-align scores corresponding to proteins that are unrelated or whose folds have evolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). However in the class of low contact density proteins there is only a peak at low TM-align score. For high and intermediate contact density domain, there is a pronounced cusp in the sequence-structure relationship. By contrast, the transition from homologous structures to diverged structures is more gradual for the low contact density domains, without a visible cusp. Overall, this analysis indicates that, as proteins diverge, the onset of structure evolution occurs earlier for less stable proteins than for more stable ones.</p>
<p>A possible confounding factor could be that proteins of different CD might be enriched in different structural classes so that our finding presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1</xref> might reflect differences in evolutionary scenarios for different protein structural classes. We analyzed that and found that there are no significant differences in the shape of the sequence-structure relationship when the data is subdivided by protein family or class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

<title>A simple analytical model for the twilight zone</title>
<p>An evolutionary trajectory of sequential amino acid substitutions can be imagined connecting proteins of any two structures. There are many experimental studies supporting the vision of an evolutionary landscape where sequences folding into stable structures are connected by sequences that do not adopt stable structures (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In general, a protein&#x2019;s stability determines the cellular amount of folded, and therefore functional, protein as well as the amount of unfolded protein, which not only is nonfunctional but also can form toxic aggregates (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The fitness of an organism is thereby directly related to the ability of proteins to carry out their functions and therefore their stability.</p>
<p>Based on these understandings, we construct a simple model of protein structure evolution on a fitness landscape where sequences encoding high-fitness (thermodynamically stable) proteins form peaks separated by fitness valleys. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The model is based on three postulates. First, new folds are discovered in divergent evolution from existing folds. Second, in analogy with chemical kinetics we treat the events leading to structure evolution as an activated process, where wait times between fitness valley crossing events are exponentially distributed. The evolutionary reaction coordinate is a mutational path connecting two protein structure states. A free energy barrier separating two states in chemical kinetics is analogous to the evolutionary barrier formed by a fitness valley separating two stable protein structures that confer high fitness on their carrier organisms. Just as the ratio of the free energy barrier to temperature controls the rate of barrier crossing in chemical kinetics, the ratio of the effective fitness barrier to the strength of evolutionary selection controls the rate of structure discovery in the evolutionary context of the model (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Proteins under strong evolutionary pressure in this model will be &#x201C;fit&#x201D; and stable since we assume stability is a main component of fitness throughout this paper. Third, we postulate that crossing the fitness valley leads to the discovery of novel folds that are structurally dissimilar to the original fold.</p>
<p>We begin by calculating the rate of structure evolution. From the Arrhenius equation, we have
<disp-formula id="eqn2"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where &#x0394;<italic>G<sub>f</sub></italic> is the fitness barrier height and <italic>T<sub>sel</sub></italic> is the &#x201C;evolutionary&#x201D; selection temperature, which tunes the strength of selection acting on the evolving proteins. The probability, <italic>q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), that an ancestral structure (the structure at time <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 0) is unchanged at time <italic>t</italic> follows immediately:
<disp-formula id="eqn3"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Next, it is necessary to substitute the variable of time for the variable of sequence identity for two reasons. First, sequences can reach mutation saturation. Second, this transformation will permit direct comparison between the analytical and the bioinformatics results. The relationship for the expected Hamming distance between the evolving protein at time <italic>t</italic> with respect to the ancestral protein at time <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 0 is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn4"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>l</italic> is the length of the protein and <italic>a</italic> is the number of amino acid types, typically 20 (see Supplementary Text for derivation). This expression only takes into account the point mutations that become fixed in the evolving population because the model only takes into account mutations that might contribute to the emergence of a new fold.</p>

Families of homologous proteins are formed by sequence evolution between structure evolution events. The rate of fold discovery depends on the free energy barrier to evolving a new fold (a property of protein biophysics) and an evolutionary &#x201C;temperature&#x201D; corresponding to the strength of selection for folding stability under which proteins evolve such that <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.

The histograms show the probability that the ancestral structure has persisted (top) versus the probability that new structure has emerged (bottom) after at most 74&#x0025; of the residues have been mutated.

The model fit to the data is presented in dashed lines while binned bioinformatics data is presented in solid lines for each contact density subgroup: low contact density (blue), intermediate contact density (green), high contact density (orange).

<p>Excluding the time variable from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">equations (3)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">(4)</xref>, we determine the probability <italic>q</italic> that a structure has persisted after once its sequence is different at <italic>S</italic> from its ancestral (<italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 0) sequence.
<disp-formula id="eqn5"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqn5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the dependence of structure survival probability as a function of sequence identity (<italic>q</italic>(<italic>S</italic>) v. 1 &#x2212;<italic>S</italic>). When &#x2212;&#x0394;<italic>G<sub>f</sub></italic>/<italic>T<sub>sel</sub></italic> &#x2248; 1 selection pressure is so weak that the evolutionary barriers are not a significant impediment and the protein is free to diffuse through structure space as easily as it does through sequence space. As selection pressure increases and proteins become more stable, the barriers between protein structures begin to retard structure evolution giving rise to activated dynamics. When the ratio &#x2212;&#x0394;<italic>G<sub>f</sub></italic>/<italic>T<sub>sel</sub></italic> &#x226B; 1, the sequence identity degrades to random before the first structure evolution events take place, resulting in an abrupt decrease in <italic>q</italic>(<italic>S</italic>) at very low <italic>S</italic>. Conceptually, this is because broad exploration of sequence space takes place over the course of many mutations before there arises a sequence that is stable yet which has a new ground state. The histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> also indicate that differences in selection pressure may explain heterogeneity that has been observed in fold family sizes (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). For each of the selection ratios tested, the histogram shows the probability that the structure has (bottom) or has not (top) evolved after some evolutionary time. The curves and histograms for strong selection are consistent with the high contact density class of proteins while those for weaker selection are consistent with the low contact density class of proteins. Proteins evolving under weak selection pressure move rapidly through fold space, providing little time for gene duplication and sequence divergence to populate a particular fold family when compared to their strong selection counterparts.</p>
<p>Finally, we confirm that the analytical model predicts a decreasing rate of structure evolution, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, when fit to the three protein domains subgroups with increasing contact density. The bionformatic data featured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> was binned and averaged for each contact density subgroup and the rate of structure evolution <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and twilight zone offset, <italic>c</italic>, were then fit to this bioinformatics data (See <italic>Methods</italic>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, this fit confirms both that the analytical model correctly reproduces the shape of the sequence-structure relation for proteins of different contact densities, and that contact density correlates negatively with protein structure evolution rate, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, (inset, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>). Interestingly, while it might be expected that the analytical model reproduces the correlation between contact density and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline7.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> when comparing protein domain groups with very different contact densities, it also seems to be able to discriminate between protein subgroups with smaller differences in average contact density. Protein domains in the four structural classes, &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;, &#x03B1;/&#x03B2;, &#x03B1;&#x002B;&#x03B2;, have average contact densities that range from 4.33 contacts/residue (&#x03B1;) to 4.66 contacts/residue (&#x03B1;/&#x03B2;). While differences in the shape of the sequence-structure relation among the four classes remain hardly distinguishable by eye even after this binning and fitting, the fitted <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline8.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> values do decrease monotonically with the classes&#x2019; increasing contact density indicating that structure evolution rates are sensitive even to modest differences in contact density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Structure evolution of model proteins</title>
<p>We now turn to explicit modeling of protein structure evolution in order to test the assumptions of our analytical model and to get mechanistic insight into the biophysics of fold emergence. Details of the model are provided in the <italic>Methods</italic> section. In brief, each model protein consists of 27 amino acid residues that fold into a compact 3&#x00D7;3&#x00D7;3 cube (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). All 103,346 possible compact structures of such model proteins have been enumerated, and, following Heo et al., we use a representative subset of randomly selected 10,000 conformations as our space of possible protein structures for computational efficiency throughout this work (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Neighboring amino acid residues that are not connected by a covalent bond interact according to a Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) potential (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In line with previous discussion, the stability of each model protein is <italic>P</italic> represented by <italic><sup>P</sup>nat</italic>, the Boltzmann probability that a protein adopts its lowest energy (native) state. For any 27-mer sequence, <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> can be determined exactly within this model (see <italic>Methods</italic>).</p>
<p>We ran many evolutionary simulations where new structures were evolved under a stability (<italic>P</italic><sub>nat</sub>) constraint as follows. Each generation, an amino acid substitution was introduced into the evolving protein. Stabilizing mutations that increase <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> were always accepted, while destabilizing mutations were accepted according to the Metropolis criterion with a selective temperature <italic>T<sub>sel</sub></italic> that establishes stringency of evolutionary selection (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) (see <italic>Methods</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref> and Dataset S2). Simulations ran for 1,000 generations (mutation attempts, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and the structure, sequence, and stability (<italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic>) were recorded every 10 generations.</p>
<p>First, we quantify the structural similarity between the &#x201C;wild-type&#x201D; and mutant structure for each time step where a structure discovery event occurs in order to test the structural bimodality assumption made by the analytical model. The structural similarity of two model proteins is straightforwardly captured by the number of amino acid residue contacts that two structures have in common (Q-score, see <italic>Methods</italic>)(<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, representative individual trajectories from four selection regimes are plotted such that protein structure discovery events are reflected as dips in Q-score, and protein stability is indicated by color. The average Q-score, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline15.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, between a random pair of model proteins is 0.19 &#x00B1; 0.08, as indicated by the red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>. For each tested selection pressure, the average Q-scores associated with fold evolution events, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline16.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, is depicted in the bottom inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>. <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline17.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> ranges from 0.25&#x00B1;0.11 when <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline18.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to 0.42&#x00B1;0.17 when <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline19.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. The connection between <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline20.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline21.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> likely reflects that discovering a mutant fold similar to the wild-type (high <italic>Q</italic>) avoids destabilizing evolutionary intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>). However, even strong selection pressure does not increase <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline22.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> above &#x007E;0.43 because there exist so few structures with <italic>Q</italic> &#x003E; 0.43 for any given evolving protein structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5</xref>). The underlying rarity of similar structures in the space of model protein structures erects evolutionary barriers to fold evolution and limits the capacity of structure evolution to occur incrementally. This is reflected in the distribution <italic>P</italic>(<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>t, t</italic>&#x002B;10</sub>), which is bimodal with a peak at <italic>Q</italic> &#x003D; 1 and <italic>Q</italic> &#x2248; 0.29 (See below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A-D</xref>).</p>
<p>A key assumption of the analytical model was that fold evolution is an activated process (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). We tested this assumption by examining whether wait times between fold discovery events were distributed exponentially, which is the hallmark of an activated process, and found that indeed, model protein evolution does follow activated dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Alleviating purifying selection for stability accelerates the rate of structure evolution by allowing proteins to maintain lower stability on average (lower <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline23.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>). The average wait time between structure discovery events diminishes rapidly as simulations are run at higher <italic>T<sup>sel</sup></italic> such that the stability of the evolving proteins diminishes. When <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline24.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> selection pressure was so weak that nearly every recorded generation explored a different fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref> top insert), akin to the &#x2212;&#x0394;<italic>G<sub>f</sub></italic>/<italic>T<sub>sel</sub></italic> &#x2248; 1 regime in the analytical model. The abrupt transition from diffusive to activated dynamics is also apparent in the distribution of fold discovery events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig. S6A</xref>) which shows that the distribution is Poisson when <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline25.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, where structure evolution events are rare, and that the mean number of fold discovery events increases when <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline26.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> falls below 0.74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig. S6A</xref>, Dataset S2).</p>
<p>In summary, structure evolution of model proteins follows activated kinetics in the strong selection regime and newly discovered structures appear much different from parent ones, providing strong supports of the postulates of the analytical theory. Now we determine whether structure-sequence relationship reproduces the cusp shapes observed in real proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1</xref>). For unstable proteins the pace of structure evolution outstrips sequence evolution leading to a concave sequence-structure relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>), which is consistent with the &#x2212;&#x0394;<italic>G<sub>f</sub></italic>/<italic>T<sub>sel</sub></italic> &#x2248; regime of the analytical model and not observed in real proteins. The most interesting cases are at intermediate selection regimes where there is a sigmoidal cusp-like transition from high average structural similarity to low structural similarity at higher sequence divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B-C</xref>). In this selection regime, proteins dwell in a particular structure while accumulating sequence mutations, yet are periodically, at longer time scales, able to transition to another structure, which is substantially different from the preceding one. For extremely stable proteins, by contrast, sequence can still evolve readily, but structure evolution is severely hindered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). The increased dwell-time in a particular protein structure also allows sequences adopting that fold to proliferate over time, which is reflected in the correlation between <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline27.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and the mean structure family size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>The analytical model and simulations indicate that a divergent scenario reproduces the key features of the sequence structure relationships shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1</xref>. An important question is whether an alternative, convergent, mechanism of structure discovery can reproduce these relationships equally well. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and 4C we accompany the divergent evolution results described above with the results of convergent evolution simulations, shown in gray. To simulate convergent evolution, proteins start from sequences that stably fold into a randomly chosen structures but the fitness function favors sequence convergence to another, &#x201C;target&#x201D; protein (see <italic>Methods</italic> for details). Under weak selection for folding stability, the convergence of protein structure as sequences evolve follows a similar path as it does during divergent evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). By contrast, under strong selection for stability, protein structures begin to converge at a much higher sequence identity than where they begin to diverge (approximately 85&#x0025; and 25&#x0025; respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Proteins converging under the constraint of stability also attain only 69 &#x00B1; 9&#x0025; sequence identity with respect to the target sequence after 3,000 mutation attempts and only 0.5&#x0025; of the evolving proteins attained the target structure, compared to 100&#x0025; in the weak selection regime.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results from divergent and convergent evolution scenarios indicate that selection pressure generates a peculiar hysteresis in evolutionary trajectories: When proteins diverge under selection for folding stability, they long retain the same structure because evolving a new structure involves passing through a fitness valley. Were two highly diverged (different sequence and structure) proteins to converge on the same sequence again, they would long retain <italic>different</italic> structures for the same reason. Such a scheme was realized experimentally in (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) in which two proteins with different sequences and structures were subjected to engineered single point mutations which increased their sequence identity up to 88&#x0025; yet did not unfold the proteins or change their original structures.</p>

<title>Population size modulating selection pressure</title>
<p>Evolutionary simulations of individual model proteins, while biophysically realistic, lack biological realism: the concepts of fitness and selection are applicable to whole cells and populations rather than individual proteins. To address this shortcoming we performed simulations of an evolving population of competing single-cell model organisms, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and described in detail in <italic>Methods</italic> and (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Model organisms have genes that encode 27-mer lattice model proteins. Each generation, an organism can die, divide, undergo a gene duplication event, or undergo a genetic point mutation. This evolutionary scheme mimics the natural emergence of protein families and was previously used to explain the power-law distribution of protein family and superfamily sizes observed in nature (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). In contrast to the previous model, selection pressure is here applied to the whole organisms rather than only the evolving proteins, which makes the situation more biologically realistic and non-trivial. The strength of selection (proxied by <italic>T<sub>sel</sub></italic> in the previous model of individual protein evolution) is determined by the population size (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) in the present, more biologically realistic model.</p>
<p>Evolutionary runs were simulated over a range of maximum population sizes, <italic>N<sub>max</sub></italic>, from 500 to 5,000 organisms, in replicates of 50. Whenever birth of new organisms drives the population size, <italic>N</italic>, above <italic>N<sub>max</sub></italic>, <italic>N</italic> &#x2212; <italic>N</italic><sub>max</sub> randomly selected organisms are removed to ensure constant population size, simulating a turbidostat (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p>
<p>After many generations, we recorded the extant proteins from all organisms in a particular evolutionary run, calculated their stabilities, and calculated the sequence identity and structural similarity (Q-score) of all pairs of proteins. We found that the evolutionary runs yielding unstable proteins have qualitatively different relationships between sequence and structure divergence than other replicas. In these cases, the extremely rapid turn-over of structures is manifested in a concave-up dependence of average Q-score on sequence identity (green and blue trajectories in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>), as in the low <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> regime of the Monte Carlo simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Once the population size passes the critical threshold, of about 1,250 organisms, the characteristically cusped sequence-structure relationships become the most probable result of evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>, middle and bottom). On the other hand, we do not see a population size where structure evolution is almost entirely shut down, even at the largest population sizes probed in simulations. This could reflect that in larger populations, there is a larger influx of beneficial as well as deleterious mutations, so more neutral or beneficial fold evolution events can occur.</p>
<p>We found that the average <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> of proteins at the end of 3,000 generations (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline35.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>) strongly anti-correlates with the diversity of structures observed in the population, as reflected in the structure entropy:
<disp-formula id="eqn6"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqn6.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic> is the probability of finding structure <italic>i</italic> in the final generation of the simulations (inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). The correlation between <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline36.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <italic>H</italic> reflects the fact that less stable proteins have faster rates of structure evolution. This correlation does not depend on population size (different colors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref> inset). Rather, we found that population size modulated the number of evolutionary replicas that failed to evolve stable proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). This is also reflected in the relative peak heights of the Q-scores shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally we examine the size of the average protein structure family across the range of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline37.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> explored in the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The size of protein structure family is defined as the number of genes encoding non-redundant protein sequences (sequence identity &#x003C; 25&#x0025;) but whose gene products adopt the same native state structure. In datasets of natural proteins, protein families of various sizes have been observed and overall, there is a positive correlation between family size and protein contact density (<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In the context of these simulations, which instantiate the crucial mechanisms of structure family creation and growth (sequence evolution, gene duplication, and structure evolution) we observe a strong positive correlation between <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline38.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of proteins at the end of an evolutionary replica and the average structure family size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>). The significance of the trend is further magnified by the observation that the total number of genes in a population at the end of a simulation actually correlates negatively with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline39.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Fig. S7</xref>). Overall, this observation supports the view that stable proteins are trapped in particular structures, providing more time for the number of sequences adopting this structure to grow.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We presented a simple analytical model of protein structure evolution that explains why there is a cusped relationship between structure and sequence evolution. Using the model, we were able to explain the role that contact density, a proxy for protein stability, plays in structure evolution in the bioinformatics protein record. Importantly, our work indicates that the cusped structure-sequence relationship with approximate 30&#x0025; sequence similarity threshold is not the result of a biophysical constraint that 70&#x0025; of a protein&#x2019;s residues must be changed in order for a new structure to emerge, but rather that continual sequence evolution under the constraint of protein folding stability degrades sequence identity over the time scale needed to find the mutations that could encode a switch to an alternative <italic>stable</italic> structure. Evolutionary simulations with model proteins strongly corroborate the model as well as the idea of a fitness barrier blocking fold evolution.</p>
<p>Intuitively, our results show that strong selection for stability hinders structure evolution, while weak selection permits rapid exploration of structure space, of predominantly unstable proteins. The bioinformatics and simulation data indicated that selection tunes how gradually the twilight zone begins, and this is consistent with our activated dynamics model of fold discovery. Yet it is curious that selection does not tune the position of the onset of the twilight zone, i.e. below 30&#x0025; for proteins under strong selection pressure or above 30&#x0025; for proteins under weak selection. In fact, we found that a different analytical model of fold creation, one based on the &#x201C;gatekeeping&#x201D; mechanism of fold determination <italic>does</italic> predict a shift in the twilight zone position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8</xref>) (<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The gatekeeping model of protein folds posits that several gatekeeping residues determine a protein&#x2019;s structure (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Therefore we posited that mutations in these key residues may be necessary and sufficient for discovering a new fold. That we do not observe a moving twilight zone in the data indicates that either folds have roughly the same number of gatekeeper residues regardless of stability or that structure evolution is mediated globally rather than via a few key residues.</p>
<p>Along with tuning the rate of structure evolution, another effect of selection is to modulate the size of fold families, i.e. families of sequences that fold into the same native structure. This is because strong selection slows the pace of structure evolution more dramatically than sequence evolution, so during the time period a protein is &#x201C;trapped&#x201D; in a particular fold by selection, continued duplication and exploration of the sequences adopting that fold generates larger and larger fold families.</p>
<p>It has been clear for years that protein contact density is deeply connected to evolution. Proteins with high contact density tend to be old, part of larger gene families, and part of larger structural neighborhoods (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The root of these observation has been attributed to intrinsic evolvability conferred upon a protein by its contact density, and it has been hypothesized that young proteins may evolve quickly because they are under positive selection to evolve stability of new functions (<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Our work provides an alternative framework within which to interpret these findings. We suggest that pressure for folding stability causes proteins to evolve high contact density, severely constraints structure evolution, leading to larger gene families, and to the extent that its possible, selects for discovery of structures similar to the ancestral structure, leading to larger fold neighborhoods. Further bioinformatics and experimental studies may test this interpretation.</p>

<p>We use the set of all &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;, &#x03B1;&#x002B;&#x03B2;, and &#x03B1;/&#x03B2; protein domains in SCOP including mutants (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The contact density of each domain was calculated as a predictor of thermodynamic stability. When calculating contact density, we consider two residues in contact if any of their non-hydrogen residues are within 4.5 angstroms of each other. Proteins belonging to top (&#x003E;4.93 contacts/residue), middle (4.57&#x003C;CD&#x003C;4.65 contacts/residue), and bottom 10&#x0025; (&#x003C;4.13 contacts/residue) with respect to contact density were studied further.</p>
<p>Following Chothia and Lesk (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), who studied the divergence of proteins within protein families, we studied the divergence of proteins classified into the same SCOP fold. By choosing a broader classification than family, we could track divergence over the long timescales over which significant structure evolution takes place. SCOP folds are extremely broadly defined so proteins sharing a fold classification often adopt significantly different structures. The structural similarity of protein domains classified in the same fold, in the same contact density class (both having high, intermediate, or low contact density) and comparable length (within 10 amino acids) were compared using the Template Modeling-align (TM-align) algorithm which yields a number representative of the similarity between two folds, ranging from zero to one (<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Then their percent sequence identity was calculated from their alignment by the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and Blosum30 substitution matrix, implemented in MATLAB. Proteins classified in different SCOP folds do not share significant sequence homology or structural similarity and were therefore not compared. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B-D</xref> and the corresponding Dataset 1, the data are subdivided by contact density alone, not by protein class or fold.</p>

<title>Fitting analytical model to bioinformatics data</title>
<p>In order to quantify the differences in structure evolutionary rates of real proteins apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we fit the analytical expression for structure evolution, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">equation (5)</xref>, to the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-D</xref> (where sequence and structure similarity is subdivided by contact density) as well as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1</xref> (where the data is subdivided by structural class). We proceeded by binning the data into 50 bins spanning sequence identity of zero to one. This step was necessary to achieve a fit to the data because otherwise the large majority of data points at low sequence identity and low structural similarity dominate and foreclose the possibility of a meaningful fit to the high sequence identity and cusp regions of the data. Because the twilight zone of the analytical model occurs at 5&#x0025; sequence identity, the average sequence identity between two random sequences, while the bulk of proteins compared in the twilight zone share 20&#x0025; sequence identity for real proteins, possibly reflecting that sequence alignment algorithms seek to maximize the overlap of sequence pairs being aligned, we added a parameter <italic>c</italic> to the equation in order to shift the analytical model twilight zone to the twilight zone of the data. The exact curve that was fitted to the data was

where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline42.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the sequence identity as a function of structure survival probability, a rearrangement of (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) plus <italic>c</italic>, the twilight zone shift.

<title>Protein model</title>
<p>We use standard 27-mer lattice-model proteins to simulate the structural evolution of proteins (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Lattice proteins can fold into 103,346 fully compact structures for the 3&#x00D7;3&#x00D7;3 cubic lattice, and following (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), we use a representative subset of 10,000 randomly chosen structures for computational efficiency. There are 20 amino acid types in the model. The energy of a protein in any given structure can be computed from the Miyazawa Jernigan (MJ) potential (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), which contains interaction energies for each spatially proximal pair of any two amino acid types. The energy of a 27-mer sequence adopting a particular structure, <italic>S</italic>, is given by

Where <italic>C</italic><sup>(<italic>S</italic>)</sup> is the contact matrix of structure <italic>S</italic>, whose elements <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline45.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> when residues <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> form a non-covalent contact and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline46.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> otherwise. <italic>M</italic> is the MJ interaction energy matrix such that the element <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>AA</italic>(<italic>i</italic>)<italic>AA</italic>(<italic>j</italic>)</sub> contains the interaction energy of the amino acid types of residues <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>. The Boltzmann probability, <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic>(<italic>T</italic>), of a protein adopting its native state (lowest energy) structure is therefore given by the canonical partition function:
<disp-formula id="eqn9"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqn9.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Where <italic>E<sub>i</sub></italic> is the protein&#x2019;s energy in structure <italic>i</italic> and <italic>T</italic> is the temperature in arbitrary units. The structure in which a protein&#x2019;s energy is minimized is considered the protein&#x2019;s native state.</p>
<p>The degree of structural homology between two model proteins is quantified using the number of contacts the structures have in common, normalized by the total number of contacts (28 contacts for all compact 27-mer model proteins) (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).

<title>Monte Carlo algorithm for divergent evolution</title>
<p>The model proteins were evolved under selection for folding stability, <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic>. This constraint captures two biological features. First, most proteins must be folded to carry out their function (the obvious exception is intrinsically disordered proteins). Second, unfolded or misfolded species can be toxic (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Each simulation of model protein evolution proceeded in two steps. First, each simulation was initialized with a protein stably adopting a particular structure (<italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> &#x003E; 0.99). Stable proteins were made by generating a random 27-mer amino acid sequences, introducing random mutations, and accepting the mutations only if they stabilized a predetermined ground state (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). This procedure, rather than a Monte Carlo procedure, is sufficient for generating unique, stable sequences for each structure. Then, evolutionary trajectories at different selection pressures for folding stability were carried out as follows. Each generation, the protein was subjected to a point mutation. The fitness effect of the point mutation was defined as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn11"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqn11.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline47.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the stability of the protein with the mutation and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline48.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the stability of the protein prior to the mutation. Any neutral mutation or mutation increasing fitness was accepted while destabilizing mutations were accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion with <italic>f</italic>/<italic>T<sub>sel</sub></italic>. The selective temperature, controls the stringency of selection for protein stability; the more destabilizing a mutation, the less likely it is to be accepted (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). <italic>T<sub>sel</sub></italic> directly tunes the equilibrium <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> of evolving proteins (SI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and Table 1). Simulations ran for 1,000 mutation attempts, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and the structure, sequence, and stability (<italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic>) were recorded every 10 generations. This was repeated for approximately 2,750 different starting structures at different strengths of selection for stability <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic> (set by <italic>T</italic><sub>sel</sub>).</p>

<title>Monte Carlo algorithm for convergent evolution</title>
<p>In these simulations, many proteins all initially adopting different structures with high <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline49.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> evolve under selection pressure to maximize their sequence identities with respect to the same designated &#x201C;target&#x201D; sequence. The target sequence is a randomly selected sequence with a thermodynamically stable ground state. To simulate the regime where selection pressure for folding stability is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), any mutation increasing sequence identity with respect to the target sequence (<italic>SID</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,target</sub>) was accepted. No selection pressure for folding stability was applied. The regime where selection pressure for folding stability is high was simulated by using the fitness function <italic>SID</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,target</sub> &#x00D7; <italic>P<sub>nat</sub></italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A single convergent evolution simulation was run in each selection regime, consisting of 100 proteins converging over 3,000 generations in the weak selection regime while 200 protein converging over 3,000 generation were used in the strong selection regime to compensate for slower evolution and improve statistics. To determine the sequence-structure relationship for convergent evolution, the sequence identity and Q-score of the converging proteins were calculated every 100 generations within each regime.</p>

<title>Multi-scale modeling of protein evolution</title>
<p>We used the multi-scale simulation algorithm developed and described in detail in <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Zeldovich 2007</xref> (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Because this evolutionary procedure yields fold families of sizes matching the distributions observed in nature, it is an ideal source of comparison with SCOP data. The simulations were initialized with 100 identical organisms, each consisting of a single gene (81-mer DNA) with random sequence and its 27-mer gene product. (Thus, an average initial protein has a <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline50.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> corresponding to average stability of random sequences) At each step in evolutionary time, one of five fates affects each organism with equal probability (1) no event (2) point mutation at a random position in the genome to a random nucleotide at rate <italic>m</italic> &#x003D; 0.3 per unit time per base pair (3) gene duplication with rate <italic>&#x03BC;</italic> &#x003D; 0.03 of a random gene in the organism&#x2019;s genome (4) death of the organism with rate <italic>d</italic> as given by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline51.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and (5) division of the organism into two equivalent daughter cell with birthrate <italic>b</italic> &#x003D; 0.15. Thus, for example, there is a 20&#x0025; chance that gene duplication is selected as an organism&#x2019;s possible fate and a further probability <italic>u</italic> that a gene will actually be duplicated. As the population evolves, the population size may increase until it reaches a carrying capacity, <italic>N<sub>max</sub></italic>. Once the maximum population size is attained it is maintained by removing <italic>N</italic> &#x2212; <italic>N<sub>max</sub></italic> randomly chosen organisms from the population each generation. We modulate the strength of selection in the population by simulating populations with size <italic>N<sub>max</sub></italic> set at 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250, 2500, 3000, and 5000.</p>
<p>Fifty evolutionary trajectories were run at each population size. As the simulation progresses, proteins evolve, becoming more stable and periodically changing structure, spawning new protein families. Trajectories were terminated after 3,000 generations or when the population went extinct. Only simulations that ran the full 3,000 generations were analyzed, and even among these evolutionary runs, in some cases, the proteins did not evolve high <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline52.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B-C</xref>). For our analysis of structure divergence, we calculate the pairwise sequence identity and Q-score of each extant pair of proteins harvested from a particular evolutionary run.</p>

<title>Derivation of the analytical model of protein evolution with structure evolution barriers</title>
<p>We begin by deriving an expression for the Hamming distance, <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), between a protein at time <italic>t</italic> and its ancestral sequence at time <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 0, i.e. the number of derived rather than ancestral amino acid types comprising the protein at time <italic>t</italic>. A relationship for the expected Hamming distance between the evolving protein at time <italic>t</italic>&#x002B;1/<italic>&#x03BC;</italic> with respect to the ancestral protein is given by
<disp-formula id="eqnS1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqnS1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>l</italic> is the length of the protein and <italic>a</italic> is the number of amino acid types (typically 20) and <italic>&#x03BC;</italic> is the mutation rate of the protein. Each of the three terms in (S1) captures one of the three possible effects of a mutation. First, a mutation may increase <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) by one if it substitutes a residue in its ancestral state with a different amino acid type. Second, a mutation may revert a residue from a derived amino acid type back to its ancestral type, decreasing <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) by one. Finally, <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) remains constant if a mutation substitutes a residue with a derived amino acid type with another non-ancestral amino acid type. This expression simplifies to
<disp-formula id="eqnS2"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqnS2.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Setting <italic>a<sub>k</sub></italic> &#x003D; <italic>S</italic>(<italic>k</italic>/<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>), we obtained a mathematic sequence, a closed form for which can be found by using generating functions. Define <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline53.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Noting that <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x003D; <italic>S</italic>(0) &#x003D; 0, we have

<p>Expanding the function into a power series yields
<disp-formula id="eqnS7"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqnS7.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>This implied <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline55.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and recalling that <italic>S</italic>(<italic>k</italic>/<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>) &#x003D; <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), we concluded

<disp-formula id="eqnS9"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqnS9.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>From the Arrhenius equation, we have that the rate of structure change
<disp-formula id="eqnS10"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqnS10.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where &#x0394;<italic>G<sub>f</sub></italic> is the &#x201C;free energy&#x201D; barrier to evolution of a new structure and <italic>T<sub>sel</sub></italic> is the evolutionary selection temperature. This gave us an expression for probability that the structure will not yet have changed at time <italic>t</italic> (i.e. the structure survival probability).
<disp-formula id="eqnS11"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqnS11.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The expression for <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) can be rearranged to solve for <italic>t</italic> which will permit us to write a parametric equation for structure evolution versus sequence evolution.
<disp-formula id="eqnS12"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqnS12.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>

<p>Thus, the expression for structure evolution with respect to sequence divergence is

<title>Derivation of an analytical model of protein evolution with key gatekeeper residues</title>
<p>Here, we build a phenomenological theory of protein structure evolution with additional structural, mechanistic detail. Consider a protein of length <italic>l</italic> residues where each amino acid can mutate to any of the other <italic>m</italic> &#x003D; 19 amino acids. The protein&#x2019;s structure is determined by <italic>n</italic> key residues (<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). A structure evolution event occurs each time that all <italic>n</italic> key residues mutate to any of v amino acid types that encode a different fold, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig S8A</xref>. The parameters <italic>n</italic> and <italic>v</italic> reflect the degree of selection pressure under which a protein is evolving. As before, the sequence evolution is captured by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnS9">equation (S9)</xref>.</p>
<p>Rigidly fixing the number of key residues sets a hard lower bound on the minimum number of mutations before a fold evolution event can occur. Assuming that fold evolution is a Poisson process governed by mutation of key residues, we derived the &#x201C;survival&#x201D; probability that a fold evolution event has not occurred after time <italic>T</italic> (below). With this model, both the shape and position of the twilight zone are adjusted by the strength of evolutionary selection. The requirement that all key residues must mutate before the structure evolves reflects that epistasis among the structures <italic>n</italic> key residues and that extensive exploration of sequence space may be necessary before a sequence coding for a stable mutant fold is discovered.</p>
<sec id="s5b1">
<title><underline>Derivation of structure survival probability time (<italic>F</italic>(<italic>t</italic>))</underline></title>
<p>An analytic solution for the probability that the protein has undergone a structural change is derived here. For this, we will first need to calculate the characteristic wait time between fold evolution events. After <italic>i</italic> &#x201C;good&#x201D; mutations (mutations of designated residues to any of the <italic>v</italic> other amino acid types that encode another fold), the probability of a mutation being a good one is given by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline63.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. The time for the protein to change structure is <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline64.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the <italic>n</italic> th harmonic number, then
<disp-formula id="eqnS14"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqnS14.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Now assume that after a protein changes structure, the clock &#x201C;resets&#x201D;. That is, after a structural change, the model is applied to the protein as if it were an ancestral state. Looking over some interval of time &#x0394;<italic>t</italic>, we expect that the protein has undergone a structural change event &#x0394;<italic>t</italic>/<italic>T</italic> times. Therefore, after <italic>cT</italic>time has elapsed, the expected number of structural changes is <italic>c</italic>. Now, letting the time domain be infinite, we can divide it into intervals of length <italic>cT</italic>, and the number of changes in each interval should be random, roughly independent, and on average <italic>c</italic>. The lack of independence is because there is a minimum number of time steps between structural transitions, so a transition that happens at the end of one interval will prohibit a transition at the beginning of the next. However if selection is strong, the probability distribution of the number of structural change events in an interval <italic>cT</italic> should be roughly Poisson

</p>
<p>If there are <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline65.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> changes, the average wait time <italic>t</italic> between transitions is well-approximated by <italic>cT</italic>/<italic>k</italic>, so we have that
<disp-formula id="eqnS16"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="059741_eqnS16.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Assume now, that <italic>cT</italic>/<italic>t</italic> is continuous. If we choose <italic>c</italic> such that <italic>ce</italic><sup>&#x2212;<italic>c</italic></sup> &#x226A; 1, there will be only a negligible probability that <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="059741_inline66.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is between 0 and 1, which implies that there is a negligible chance that <italic>&#x03C4;</italic> is greater than <italic>cT</italic>. From this we can obtain a continuous cumulative distribution function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig S8B</xref>).

<title>Protein evolution with key gatekeeper residues</title>
<p>(A) No structure or ordered sequence is explicitly modeled. Rather, in a protein of length <italic>p</italic>, <italic>n</italic> residues are designated as residues crucial for fold stability (indicated with yellow edge), <italic>v</italic> amino acid types out of 19 are considered &#x201C;good.&#x201D; Once all designated residues acquire a &#x201C;good&#x201D; mutation (shown in green), we consider a fold discovery event to have taken place. In this model, <italic>n</italic> and <italic>v</italic> tunes the selection pressure on fold evolution. From weakest to strongest selection pressure: <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 1, <italic>v</italic> &#x003D; 19 (blue), <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 10, <italic>v</italic> &#x003D; 10 (green), <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 15, <italic>v</italic> &#x003D; 5 (red), <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 27, <italic>v</italic> &#x003D; 5 (orange).</p></caption>
