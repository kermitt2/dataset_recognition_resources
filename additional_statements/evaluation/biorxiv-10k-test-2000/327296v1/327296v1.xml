<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Filoviruses, which include ebolaviruses and marburgvirus, can cause outbreaks of highly lethal hemorrhagic fever. This disease causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans and non-human primates, with human fatality rates reaching 90&#x0025; during some outbreaks.

Since early symptoms of filovirus infection mimic more common diseases, there is a strong unmet public health and biodefense need for broad-spectrum filovirus rapid diagnostics. We have generated a panel of mouse single-chain Fv-antibodies (scFvs) to filovirus glycoproteins (GPs) using cell-free ribosome display and determined their cross-reactivity profiles to all known filovirus species. Two scFvs (4-2 and 22-1) were able to detect all known <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> species. This is the first report on ribosome display scFvs that can detect a broad set of filovirus GPs, which demonstrates their potential use in the development of a new generation of rapid diagnostic immunoassays.</p></abstract>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Filoviruses, such as Ebola virus, cause severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans. The current Ebola virus outbreak is a health crisis with global repercussions and underscores the need for rapid and inexpensive diagnostics to detect filovirus infection. For these reasons, we used a ribosomal display method to rapidly generate single-chain antibodies (scFv&#x2019;s) for use in diagnostics against all six pathogenic filoviruses from mice immunized with EBOV virus-like particles (VLPs). We have successfully isolated two scFvs that can detect all known <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> species using this method. This method is inexpensive, rapid, and can be used to quickly develop repertoires of high-affinity antibodies for detection of a broad set of filovirus GPs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recent Ebola virus pandemic was a health crisis with global repercussions (PMID 27813879). Rapid spread of the disease within the epidemic regions coupled with migration of infected persons has underscored the need for rapid, robust and inexpensive diagnostic tools. There are six filoviruses known to be pathogenic in humans: four ebolaviruses (Ebola (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), Tai Forest (TAFV), and Bundibugyo (BDBV) and two marburgviruses (Ravn (RAVV) and Marburg (MARV)) (PMID 21046175). Currently, diagnostics for active infection are largely based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platforms. While these are very sensitive and portable units have been made, they are expensive and require considerable training for proper use. There are ELISA-based detection platforms for EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV VP40, but sensitivity and specificity is low relative to PCR-based assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, most of the diagnostic platforms of all types have centered on detection of EBOV. There are fewer readily available monoclonal antibodies for SUDV, BDBV, TAFV, MARV, and RAVV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], severely limiting development of antibody-based diagnostics. The WHO has recently established ideal guidelines for Ebola virus diagnostics, which include ease of handling, portability, and rapid results (WHO, 2015)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In 2014, the FDA issued 9 emergency use authorizations for EBOV diagnostics. Of these, 8 were PCR-based, and 1 was an antigen ELISA with variably low sensitivity and low specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Additional concerns exist regarding filovirus mutants, which may not be detected by standard assays. The recent EBOV Makona strain had mutated so that multiple known antibody epitopes had changed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. This would invalidate certain diagnostic platforms that cannot rapidly be modified to detect emerging viral mutants. In addition, in the presence of selective pressure, filoviruses have been shown to readily mutate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. There is thus a strong unmet public health and biodefense need for broad-spectrum rapid diagnostics and outbreak control.</p>
<p>Ribosome display is a powerful tool for selecting specific antibodies from a large library in cell-free system. It involves the generation of stable antibody-ribosome-mRNA ternary complexes (ARM) followed by panning of the ARM ternary complexes against an immobilized ligand. The mRNA encoding selected target-binding library members is then recovered as DNA from the bound ternary complexes using <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR and either analyzed directly by sequencing for <italic>E. coli</italic> expression to screen for desirable candidates or subjected to subsequent rounds of panning for enriching ligand-specific binding molecules. The use of <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR also facilitates automation of the entire ribosome display process. Ribosome display has been explored to rapidly produce novel molecules from very large libraries, in combination with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. This technology can also be combined with DNA mutagenesis for antibody evolution <italic>in vitro</italic> to produce high-affinity antibodies. More recently ribosome display have been used to obtain ligands with sub-picomolar affinities for the relevant antigen, outperforming the affinities of most conventional mAbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In addition to antibodies, ribosome display has been explored to select for scaffolds, peptides, ligand-binding molecules, receptors, enzymes, membrane proteins and engineered vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. It can also be combined with protein microarrays to allow library-versus-library screening for high-throughput generation of antibodies and genomic discovery of protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Single chain Fvs (scFvs) are recombinant antibody fragments, which consists of a full variable (epitope-binding) region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH) and the corresponding variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain (VL) variable domains that are connected by a flexible peptide linker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. They represent the smallest functional antigen-binding domain of an antibody necessary for high-affinity binding of antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we report the use of a rapid, cell-free ribosomal display system to isolate a panel of scFv&#x2019;s that can bind the glycoprotein (GP) of EBOV, SUDV, RESTV, BDBV, TAFV, and MARV. The resulting antibodies have been characterized in a range of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays which demonstrates their diagnostic potential.</p>

<title>Anti-ZEBOVGP scFv antibodies generated from cell-free ribosomal display</title>
<p>To determine whether ribosomal display is suitable for generation of antibodies against filoviruses, we vaccinated mice with virus-like particles (VLPs) consisting of EBOV VP40 and GP. The use of VLPs as a protective vaccine is well-established, as we and others have shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>For ribosome displayed scFv antibody libraries, the immunoglobulin VH and VL regions joined to a 20 amino acid flexible linker [(G4S)4] were constructed using RNA isolated from the spleen of mouse &#x0023;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and S1 Table). cDNA was synthesized using a single consensus primer MVKR (specific reverse primer) and then pooled and directly used as a template for PCR amplification of the VH and VL chain gene fragments. The gene fragments from mouse were pooled in one reaction tube together with primers that contain overlapping linker sequences which allow the VH and VL gene segments to be assembled by overlap extension to form strep tag-conjugated scFvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). The amplified PCR product was the expected size of about 900 bp. The final DNA template encoding the library flanked by a T7 site was used in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ribosome display with a single selection step with recombinant EBOV GP as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

<p>After selection, the mRNA was recovered as DNA from the bound ternary complexes by <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2 B and C</xref>). The PCR product was then cloned into pGEM-T vector DNA from ten randomly chosen clones from the libraries was sequenced and were aligned using Clustal Omega. Their amino acid sequences were deduced and three complementary determining regions (CDRs) and four framework (FW) regions were identified in each of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain fragments. A 20 amino acid [(G4S)4] linker was also present. Following alignment with each other, significant diversity in the VH and VL chain was observed especially in the CDRs. Variability was also noted in the framework regions. No two clones had identical VH or VL fragments. The aligned amino acid sequences of ten clones from library are shown in S1 Fig. The framework regions (FRs) and CDRs were determined by the IMGT information system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imgt.cines.fr/">http://imgt.cines.fr/</ext-link>)(IMGT&#x00AE;/V-Quest)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The length of CDRs was variable. The length of CDR1 VH, with an average length of 8 amino acid residues, CDR2VH with an average length of 8 residues, CDR3 VH ranged from 10 to 18 amino acid residues, with an average length of 13 residues, CDR1 VL with an average length of 9 residues, while 3 amino acid residues were found in CDR2VL and 9 amino acid residues were found in CDR3 VL.</p>
<p>After expression of scFv clones, samples were harvested, lysed, purified, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (to confirm the integrity and purity) followed by Western blot. A prominent band of about 33 kDa was confirmed the identity of the purified protein on Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

<title>Specificity, cross-reactivity and affinity of GP-specific scFvs</title>
<p>The scFvs were screened by ELISA for their specificity and cross-reactivity with recombinant GPs of the other known filoviruses in the genus Ebolavirus (SUDV, TAFV, BDBV and RESTV) and Marburg virus (MARV). Several different profiles for the cross-reactivities of these antibodies were found (S2 Table and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B and C</xref>). Two scFvs (EBOVGP4-2 and EBOVGP22-1) reacted strongly with all tested GPs of Ebolavirus and Marburg species. Six scFvs (EBOVGP3-2, EBOVGP13-1, EBOVGP16-1, EBOVGP18-1, EBOVGP35-2, and EBOVGP35-1) bound weakly to GPs of some viruses in addition to EBOV, EBOVGP scFv3-2 reacted only to TAFV and MARV, and EBOVGP scFv27-5 didn&#x2019;t react with any GPs. Importantly, these different reactivity profiles enabled us to distinguish the known Ebolavirus species by using scFvs (4-2 and 22-1), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B and C</xref> and S2 Table. Representative scFvs for each obtained cross-reactivity profile showing the highest OD values were selected for dose response relationship studies.</p>
<p>Dose response curves were determined for scFvs EBOVGP4-2 and EBOVGP22-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A&#x0026;B</xref>), (S3-S6 Tables, highlighted rows) Both scFvs bound tightly to all six GPs, with EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging from 4 to 12 &#x03BC;g/mL. EBOVGP scFv4-2 and EBOVGP scFv22-1 showed the strongest binding to all six ebolavirus species, with EC<sub>50</sub>s below 9 and 12 &#x03BC;g/mL, respectively. The EBOVGP-scFv 4-2 demonstrated about almost 2-fold enhanced binding compared to EBOVGP-scFv 22-1. Binding constant (KD) determinations were estimated by fitting a dose response curve and the KD estimates for the scFvs against all six GPs are shown in S7 Table. The highest affinity scFv was the anti-EBOVGP scFv4-2, which was about 2-fold greater towards all six GPs than the anti-EBOVGP scFv22-1.</p>

<p>To assess the ability of the anti-EBOVGP scFvs to recognize the six filovirus GPs in a denatured format, western blotting was performed on purified GPs. Anti-EBOVGP scFvs 4-2 and 22-1 binding to ebolavirus GPs was completely lost upon denaturation, while binding to GP<sub>MARV</sub> was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>). The reactivities of these GP-specific scFvs were further tested by immunoprecipitation analysis (IP) using lysates of filovirus GP expressed in 293T cells. The results demonstrated that the anti-EBOVGP scFvs were able to immunoprecipitate filovirus GPs, confirming the ELISA data. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The latest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has highlighted the urgent need for rapid and effective diagnostics against filoviruses. Here we report novel murine scFv antibodies with a range of cross-reactivity to five species of ebolavirus and to marburgvirus. Two of these scFvs can cross-react to all six known pathogenic filoviruses, representing pan-filovirus binding. This is the first report of the use of cell-free ribosome display and epitope mapping to generate broadly-reactive scFvs against filoviruses.</p>
<p>Of the 10 anti-EBOV GP scFvs tested by ELISA, there were two that were highly cross-reactive to all ebola&#x002D; and marburgvirus GPs (S2 Table and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). Holtsberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] demonstrated that a single MAb (m21D10) reactive to three GP (EBOV, SUDV, and MARV) molecules and six clones reactive to both EBOV and SUDV but nonreactive to MARV were identified. Keck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] identified a set of broadly reactive pan-ebolavirus MAbs with strong binding to EBOV, SUDV, BDBV, and RESTV GP; two MAbs also exhibited weak binding to MARV GP. Other studies have also found broadly cross-reactive ebolavirus GP antibody (PMID 28525756 and 28525755). Our binding data showed that the cross-reactive scFvs, 4-2 and 22-1, exhibited moderate to higher binding with submicromolar EC<sub>50</sub>s to five ebolavirus and a marburgvirus GPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). Our results are comparable to the results from the dose-dependent binding of mAb m21D10 to EBOV, SUDV, and MARV GP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and FVM04, exhibited balanced binding at subnanomolar concentrations to four ebolavirus species tested, shows weak binding to MARV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. scFv4-2 antibody showed an approximate 2-fold high affinity to all GPs in comparison to the scFv22-1 antibody (S7 Table and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Rodr&#x00ED;guez-Mart&#x00ED;nez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] reported that the scFv-13C6 mAb exhibited the highest EBOV GP-binding activity, followed by scFv-13F6 and Fab-KZ52 in ELISA experiments.</p>
<p>Western blot suggests that the epitope of these scFvs is completely lost in denaturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, these scFvs recognized MARV, suggesting that these scFvs bind to a different epitope (data not shown). These scFvs bound to all six GPs in an ELISA, but not a Western Blot (except for MARV GP), suggesting these can recognize GP in its natural conformation and binds to a conformational epitope.</p>
<p>On IP analysis using lysates of filovirus GPs produced in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>), the cross-reactivity profiles and virus specificities were similar to those obtained by ELISA. These scFvs, cross reactive to all known ebolaviruses, may be very important for the development of Ebola and Marburg virus antigen detection assays.</p>
<p>Although a previous study demonstrated in vivo efficacy of anti-marburgvirus GP scFvs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], this is the first report of a scFv antibody (4-2 or 22-1) that exhibits broadly cross-reactive activity against filovirus GP. These scFvs also have the potential for identification of as yet unknown Ebolavirus species. During the first reported outbreak of BDBV, initial diagnosis was made using an antigen capture ELISA using a combination of anti-ZEBOV, SUDV and RESTV mAbs as well as hyper-immune polyclonal anti-EBOV rabbit serum, whereas the specimens were initially negative when tested by RT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. This highlights the value of scFvs to potentially identify new Ebola and Marburg virus species. The scFvs generated in this study may therefore offer some advantage in generating a highly sensitive assay for diagnostic use.</p>
<p>In summary, a panel of EBOVGP-specific scFvs from ribosome display and their cross-reactivity profiles to all known human pathogenic filoviruses was established. This is the first report on ribosome display scFvs that can detect all known ebolaviruses. These broadly cross-reactive scFvs produced in this study have potential use in the development of new generation rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of filoviruses.</p>

<title>Antibody library construction</title>
<p>Total spleen RNA was prepared as described by Andris-Widhopf <italic>et al.</italic> (2001). Mice spleens were minced and homogenised in 10 mL TRIzol (Invitrogen). The total RNA pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 500 &#x03BC;L of nuclease-free water (stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from approximately 25 &#x03BC;g of total RNA using a SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) following the manufacture&#x2019;s instructions provided.</p>
<p>For antibody library construction, the PCR primers were based on published sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] with minor modifications (see S1 Table). The primers were designed to introduce in-frame NcoI and NotI restriction sites to the 5&#x2019; end of the VH sequence and to the 3&#x2019; end of the VL sequence, respectively. The VH_F/VH_R and VL_F/VL_R sets of primers (see S1 Table) were used for PCR amplification of VH and VL gene segments using the cDNA template. The VH_R and VL_F set of primers (see S1 Table) were used to introduce overlapping sequences which enabled the scFv gene fragments to be assembled by overlap extension PCR and these primers encode a 20 amino acid linker sequence (G4S)4. The amplified heavy and light-chain products were purified and pooled, and an aliquot of light and heavy-chain templates was subjected to overlap extension PCR amplification using Link to introduce Strep II tag and Kozak sequence on the 5&#x2019; end and an overlap extension on the 3&#x2019; end to facilitate joining to the variable heavy-chain libraries using MKR and KzSTREPII. Finally, the PCR product encoding all the variable heavy-chain and light-chain combinations was amplified with primers RDT7 and MKR to introduce T7 site into Strep tag II-conjugated VH-VL library and to produce the DNA encoding the anti-Ebola immunoglobulin scFv libraries. The initial PCR amplification reactions were performed at a 52&#x00B0;C annealing temperature with 30 cycles, and the subsequent library assembly step used 16 cycles with <italic>GoTaq</italic> DNA polymerase and 20 pmoL of each primer pair per reaction. DNA fragments were resolved by gel electrophoresis on 1&#x0025; (wt/vol) agarose gels. DNA isolation from agarose gels was carried out following QIAquick DNA gel purification kit instructions. The final purified PCR product &#x007E;0.9 kb is a template for Ribosome Display.</p>

<title>Cell-free Ribosome display technology</title>
<p>To select specific antibody fragments, we have used a modified eukaryotic ribosome display with slight modifications[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription and translation reaction was based on a coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega&#x2019;s TNT quick-coupled transcription-translation system) and performed according to the supplier&#x2019;s protocol. The PCR-generated DNA library of antibody-coding genes derived from mouse 1 were expressed in this lysate system. Briefly, 50 &#x03BC;L of transcription/translation mixture containing 40 &#x03BC;L of TNT T7 Quick Master Mix, 2 &#x03BC;L of DNA library (0.1 to 1.0 &#x03BC;g), 1 &#x03BC;L (1 mM) of methionine, 1 &#x03BC;L of DNA enhancer, and 6 &#x03BC;L of water were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 30&#x00B0;C for 90 min. Then, 5 &#x03BC;lLof RNase-free DNase I (Roche) (2,000 U/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30&#x00B0;C (in order to remove the DNA template so that subsequent PCR only picks up pulled down RNA sequences).</p>
<p>To select specific antibody fragments the 0.5 mL PCR tubes were coated with 1 &#x03BC;g/mL of the recombinant Zaire Ebov GP in 100 &#x03BC;L PBS at 4 &#x00B0;C overnight. Protein coated tubes were washed with PBS and blocked with 100 &#x03BC;L of molecular biology grade Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS (10 mg/mL) (New England Biolabs) for 1 hour at room temperature. The translation/transcription mixture (containing the protein-ribosome-mRNA (PRM) complexes) was added to the washed and blocked protein-coated tubes and incubated on ice for 1 hour. The PCR tubes were washed three times with ribosome display washing buffer (PBS containing 0.01&#x0025; Tween 20, 5 mM Magnesium acetate and 0.1&#x0025; BSA, pH 7.4) and two times quick wash with ice-cold RNase-free water, and the retained RNA (antibody sequences) subjected to the following recovery process; <italic>in situ</italic> Single-Primer RT-PCR Recovery was performed in the PCR tubes carrying selected ARM complexes using a SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA).</p>
<p>The obtained cDNA was amplified in a 25 &#x03BC;L PCR mixture for 35 cycles of 30 s at 94&#x00B0;C, 30 s at 52&#x00B0;C, and 1 min at 72&#x00B0;C, and 10 min at 72&#x00B0;C with MKR and KzStrep II using <italic>GoTaq</italic> DNA polymerase (Promega, USA).

<title>Cloning, expression and purification of an anti-Ebov GP scFvs</title>
<p>The RT-PCR product from a third round of ribosome display was cloned into the pGEM&#x00AE;-T Easy vector (T-Cloning&#x00AE; Kit, Promega) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The ligation products were transformed in pGEM&#x00AE;-T Easy vector <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and positive colonies were chosen by blue-white selection and confirmed by DNA sequencing using T7 and SP6 standard primers (S1 Table). Based on the sequencing results, the clones in right reading frame without stop codon were chosen for prokaryotic expression. EbovGP-scFv is expressed in the form of C-terminal 6xHis fusion from the prokaryotic expression vector pBAK1, previously constructed in our laboratory is based on pET-26b vector (Novagen).

<caption><title>Alignment of the derived aminoacids sequences of the randomly chosen scFvs from linked antibody library and complementary determining regions (CDRs).</title>
<p>FRs and CDRs are determined by the IMGT information system. Diversity was found predominantly in the CDR regions. A normal 20 amino acid linker [(G4S)4] joins the VH and VL chains. Alignments were <bold>colour coded</bold> according to residue property groups. AVFPMILW-red, DE-blue, RK-magenta, STYHCNGQ-green, others-grey.</p>
<p>Symbols in the alignment are as follows: (&#x002A;) indicates where there is a conserved amino acid; (:) indicates an amino acid position with conserved similarity; (.) indicates a semi-conserved amino substitution has occurred; (-) indicates spaces introduced to optimise the alignment.</p></caption>
