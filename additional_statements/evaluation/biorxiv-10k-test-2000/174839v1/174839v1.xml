<title>Abstract</title>
<p>There are numerous sources of variation in the rate of synonymous substitutions inside genes, such as direct selection on the nucleotide sequence, or mutation rate variation. However the majority of the codon models which are developed and widely used today still incorporate an assumption of effectively neutral synonymous substitution rate, constant between sites of each gene. Here we propose a simple yet effective extension to codon models, which incorporates codon substation rate variation along the gene sequence. We assess the performance of our approach in simulations and on real data. We find strong effects of nucleotide rate variation on positive selection inference, both under models with variation of protein selection and with branch-site variation of protein selection. We also demonstrate that the computational load of our approach remains tractable, and therefore we are able to apply it to genome scale positive selection scans. We apply our new method to two datasets: 767 vertebrate orthologs and 8,606 orthologs from twelve Drosophila species. We demonstrate that our new model is strongly favored by the data, and the support of the model increases with the amount of information. Moreover, it is able to capture signatures of nucleotide level selection acting on translation initiation and on splicing sites within the coding region. Finally, we show that rate variation is highest in the highly recombining regions, and we hypothesize that recombination and mutation rate variation, such as high CpG mutation rate, are the two main sources of nucleotide rate variation. Overall, nucleotide rate variation in substitutions is an important feature to capture, both to detect positive selection and to understand gene evolution, and the approach that we propose allows to do this in genome-wide scans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Detecting the selective pressure affecting pro-tein coding genes is an important component of molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics. Codon models are one of the main tools used to infer selection on protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Koonin and Wolf, 2010</xref>). This is done by comparing the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>) that are changing the amino-acid sequence with the rate of synonymous substitutions (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>) that are supposed not to affect the gene function.</p>
<p>While there is overwhelming evidence of negative and positive selection acting on the amino acid sequence of the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boyko et al., 2008</xref>), the synonymous substitutions affecting the protein coding genes are assumed to be effectively neutral. This is a reasonable first approximation, especially for species with low effective population size, such as many mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Keightley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Romiguier et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore the synonymous substitution rate can be used as a proxy for the neutral substitution rate, and comparison between <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> can be used to identify the selection acting on the level of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yang and Bielawski, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Two similar approaches to model the evolution of codons have been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goldman and Yang (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Muse and Gaut (1994)</xref>. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goldman and Yang (1994)</xref> model, selection pressure on the protein sequence is represented by a single parameter (<italic>&#x03C9;</italic>), which defines the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> /<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>). In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Muse and Gaut (1994)</xref> model, both <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> are estimated as two independent parameters called <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>) and <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>). Neither of these approaches makes a molecular clock assumption, i.e. overall substitution rates are free to vary between the branches of a phylogenetic tree. On the other hand, both approaches originally incorporated an assumption of constant rates or ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions between sites over the gene sequence. Moreover, they originally incorporated an assumption of constant ratio between branches.</p>
<p>Various extensions have been proposed over the years to those models, allowing the incorporation of variation of selection acting on the protein sequence between codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yang et al., 2000</xref>) and/or between phylogenetic branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Yet for almost all of those new models an assumption of effectively neutral synonymous substitution rate, which is constant between sites, was kept. This leads to an assumption that all variability along the sequence is due to variability of the selection at the protein level. For the rest of this paper, we will use the term &#x201C;uniform rate&#x201D; to denote the assumption of constant nucleotide rates between sites within a gene, whether there is variation in rates or in selection between branches or not.</p>
<p>There is no biological reason to assume that the rate of synonymous substitutions is uniform in this way. In practice, it has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang, 2014</xref>) that the effect of the variation in the rate of synonymous substitutions should not substantially bias the inference of selection strength. The idea is that since the comparison between <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> is a contrast between the rates before and after the action of selection on the protein coding gene, while all the other factors will affect both rates in the same way. This reasoning might work when assigning a single <italic>&#x03C9;</italic> value to the whole alignment, and the estimated value is an average. But for more sophisticated models, where <italic>&#x03C9;</italic> varies between branches and sites, violation of the assumption of uniformity of the synonymous rate can affect the model performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There are numerous sources of variation in the rate of synonymous substitutions inside genes. First, the neutral mutation rate across each genome significantly varies. One of the strongest effects on the mutation rate in mammals are CpG sites. Transitions at CpGs are more that 10-fold more likely than transitions at non-CpG sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Leffler et al., 2013</xref>) due to spontaneous deamination, which causes a mutation from C to T, or from G to A. Both mutation frequency and repair efficiency are highly dependent on the context. E.g., the mammalian CpG mutation rate is lower in high GC regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fryxell and Zuckerkandl, 2000</xref>). This is probably related to strand separation and hydrogen bonding in the neighboring region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Segurel et al., 2014</xref>). High GC regions themselves are characterised by a higher mutation rate, which is probably caused by less efficient repair by the exonuclease domain. There are other contextdependent effects which are known, many of which lack a mechanistic explanation, such as a higher mutation rate away from T with an increasing number of flanking purines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hwang and Green, 2004</xref>) (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hodgkinson and Eyre-Walker (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Segurel et al. (2014)</xref>)</p>
<p>Mutation rate is also affected by replication time: it is usually higher in the late-replicating regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). This effect is caused by the variation in the efficiency of mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Supek and Lehner, 2015</xref>). It is not clear that this affects variation within genes, as opposed to between genes, but it could affect very long genes.</p>
<p>Mutation rates are also correlated with recombination rates. Some suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lercher and Hurst, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hellmann et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2008</xref>) that recombination itself can have a mutagenic effect, possibly through an interaction with indels. Alternatively this correlation can be a result of GC-biased gene conversion (GC-BGC), whereby mutations increasing GC content have a higher chance of fixation in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Duret and Galtier, 2009</xref>). While GC-BGC is a fixation bias, in some cases it can create a pattern which is hard to distinguish from positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ratnakumar et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the synonymous substitution rate can be affected by selection on the nucleotide level. First, while synonymous substitutions do not affect the protein sequence, they might affect translation efficiency. This effect is not limited to species with large effective population size, such as Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carlini and Stephan, 2003</xref>), since selection for codon usage was identified even in Homo sapiens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Comeron, 2004</xref>) and other mammals, especially for highly expressed genes. It has been suggested that bias in codon usage reflects the tRNAs abundance, and thereby provides a fitness advantage through increased translation efficiency/accuracy of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bulmer, 1991</xref>), although in many cases there is no dependency between tRNA abundance and codon frequency, and the source of the bias remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Selection on the nucleotide sequence can be also caused by secondary structure avoidance, as secondary structure can reduce translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kertesz et al., 2010</xref>). Other potentially important sources of selection on the nucleotide sequence, independent of the coding frame, include splicing motifs located within exons, exon-splicing enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Majewski and Ott, 2002</xref>), or functional non-coding RNAs, such miRNAs or siRNAs, which often reside within coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mattick and Makunin, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of all these mutational and selective biases, it is important to model rate variation not only for protein selection, but also at the nucleotide level. There are in principle two different approaches to incorporate rate variation into codon models. First, it is possible to model synonymous and non-synonymous rates separately extending a two-rate model, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pond and Muse (2005)</xref>. Second, it is possible to incorporate site-specific rates as an independent parameter into one-rate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scheffler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al., 2011</xref>). In the second case, the rate parameter captures biological factors, such as mutation rates, fixation rates, or nucleotide selection, which act on all substitutions, both synonymous and nonsynonymous.</p>
<p>Here we focus on the second approach, due to its more straightforward selection parameter (<italic>&#x03C9;</italic>) and interpretation, and to its superior performance for <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> /<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Spielman et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>While codon models accounting for nucleotide rate variation are available for more than a decade, they are still rarely used for large-scale selection analyses, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kosiol et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moretti et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al. (2014)</xref>. This is probably because these models have even higher computational demands, and the performance of different approaches to nucleotide rate variation was never compared.</p>
<p>Here we extend the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scheffler et al. (2006)</xref> model, which captures variation between codons, i.e. uses a single rate per codon, and perform a direct comparison with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al. (2011)</xref>, which captures variation between nucleotides, i.e. with three rate parameters per codon. We also assess the impact of nucleotide rate variation on the BS-REL-family model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Murrell et al., 2015</xref>). We chose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Murrell et al. (2015)</xref> as a comparison, since it is the only BS-REL model for gene-wide identification of positive selection, while other positive selection models in that family are intended for inference of selection on individual sites.</p>
<p>We first use simulations to compare different approaches of modeling synonymous rate variation. Then we use our model to detect positive selection in twelve Drosophila species and in a vertebrate dataset.</p>
<p>We detect positive selection on genes from those two datasets under our new model, and we demonstrate that it is important to take rate variation into account for such positive selection inference. We investigate factors affecting the nucleotide substitution rate, and we show that the new model successfully detects synonymous selection acting on regulatory sequences within the coding sequence. We also identify which gene features most affect rate heterogeneity.</p>

<title>New approaches</title>
<p>We model the process of codon substitution as a Markov process defined by the instantaneous rate matrix <italic>Q</italic>. In a general case the <italic>Q</italic> can be written as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al., 2011</xref>):
<disp-formula>
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="174839_ueqn1.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sup>(<italic>h</italic>)</sup> is the substitution rate for a site <italic>h</italic>, and <italic>&#x03BB;</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the substitution factor to change from nucleotide <italic>i</italic> to nucleotide <italic>j</italic>, which is typically used to account for the difference between transitions and transversion rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hasegawa et al., 1985</xref>). Here the rate <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sup>(<italic>h</italic>)</sup> is used to account for various effects that are not captured by the variation in <italic>&#x03C9;</italic>; in particular it accounts for variation in mutation rate and selection acting on the nucleotide sequence.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al. (2011)</xref>, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sup>(<italic>h</italic>)</sup> is modeled using a one parameter gamma distribution across sites of the alignment, such that the mean substitution rate is equal to 1, i.e. <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sup>(<italic>h</italic>)</sup> <italic>&#x223C; Gamma</italic>(<italic>&#x03B1;</italic>, 1/<italic>&#x03B1;</italic>). Keeping a mean rate of 1 is important to avoid biases in the estimation of branch lengths. There is no implicit assignment of rates to sites, as in the CAT model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lartillot and Philippe, 2004</xref>). Instead, a random-effects model is used: the gamma distribution is split into equally probable discrete categories using quantiles, and the site likelihood is computed as the average of the likelihoods for each possible rate assignment. This approach adds only one extra parameter to the model, but it is computationally intensive, since for <italic>k</italic> discrete categories, <italic>k</italic><sup>3</sup> likelihoods have to be computed per site.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scheffler et al. (2006)</xref>, unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al. (2011)</xref>, the three positions of each codon have the same rates. Here a codon belongs to one of three categories, each one represented by a single rate value. The rates and their respective proportions are estimated from the data, which leads to the estimation of four different parameters (two rates, as the third one is fixed by the constraint that the mean rate <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="174839_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and two proportions). This approach is virtually equivalent to adding a branch length multiplier for certain site classes, and therefore likelihood can be computed efficiently.</p>
<p>Here we propose having one rate per codon, while allowing this rate to vary following the gamma distribution, <italic>&#x03C1;k &#x223C; Gamma</italic>(<italic>&#x03B1;</italic>, 1/<italic>&#x03B1;</italic>).</p>
<p>With this approach we are combining the strengths of both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scheffler et al. (2006)</xref>: we only increase parameter space by one parameter (<italic>&#x03B1;</italic>), allow a flexible distribution of rates, and keep the computational tractability of the model. Moreover, having similar parametrization and rate distributions allows us to compare the statistical performance of site rate and codon rate variation models.</p>
<p>Using the proposed approach we extended two widely used codon models: M8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yang et al., 2000</xref>) and the branch-site model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). In principle our approach could be applied to any GY94-based model. These models were implemented in Godon, a codon model optimizer in Go, in three variants: no rate variation, site rate variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al., 2011</xref>) and codon rate variation as described above.</p>
<p>Three models out of six were implemented and used for the first time to our knowledge: branch-site model with the site rate variation similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al. (2011)</xref> and M8 and branch-site models with gamma distributed codon rate variation, as proposed above.</p>

<p>We have simulated three datasets using various flavours of the M8 model: a dataset without rate variation, a dataset with site rate variation, and a dataset with codon rate variation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We then used three corresponding models to infer positive selection in those datasets. In all three cases, as expected, the model corresponding to the simulations shows the best result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and Supplementary Table S1).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In the absence of rate variation, the statistical performance of the three methods is very similar even though the M8 model without rate variation has a slightly better performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S1A). With the dataset with site rate variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S1B), there is a large underperformance when not accounting for variation. On the other hand, codon variation performs almost as well as site variation, and clearly bet-ter than the model with no variation. With the dataset with codon rate variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S1C), there is a relatively large decrease in the performance of both other models, while, as expected, accounting for site rate variation performs better compared to the model without rate variation. False positive rates exceed the significance levels when rate variation is not taken into account (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Codon rate variation even increases the false positive rate above 50&#x0025; for the model without rate variation at the significance level of 0.05. Stronger rate variation (i.e. smaller <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> value) causes a higher false positive rate (Supplementary Fig. S2).</p>
<p>From this we can conclude that a) the performance of models accounting for codon variation is acceptable in all three scenarios, i.e. no rate variation, site rate variation and codon rate variation; b) in the presence of codon rate variation in the data, models not accounting for this kind of variation suffer from a notable loss of statistical performance.</p>
<p>The total inference computation time was 76 CPU hours for the model with no rate variation, 232 CPU hours for codon rate variation, and 4,023 CPU hours for site rate variation.</p>

<title>Branch-site models</title>
<p>The simulations based on the branch-site model show a qualitatively similar behaviour to the simulations based on the M8-type models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Tables S2, S3), although the performances are more similar between models. As with M8-type models, codon rate variation models performs well in all three cases, while simulating with codon rate variation causes a clear underperformance in both other models. Unlike in the case of M8-type models, false positive rates are only marginally inflated compared to theoretical expectations (Supplementary Fig. S4). Nevertheless, the model with codon rate variation shows the best performance.</p>
<p>The total inference computation time was 37 CPU hours for the model with no rate variation, 101 CPU hours for codon rate variation, and 1,630 CPU hours for site rate variation.</p>
<p>More complex models have a computational cost. Analyses with codon rate variation were 3.0 and 2.8 times slower compared to no rate variation for M8 and branch-site models respectively, while those with site rate variation were 52.7 and 44.3 times slower respectively. Thus codon rate variation captures biological signal at a much lower computational cost than site rate variation.</p>

<title>Comparisons with BS-REL</title>
<p>It was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Murrell et al., 2015</xref>) that in certain cases the statistical power of BS-REL is superior to other methods, therefore it is important to study how rate variation affects the performance of those models. The only BS-REL model suitable for the gene-wide identification of positive selection is BUSTED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Murrell et al., 2015</xref>), and the current implementation supports neither rate variation nor <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> variation as implemented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pond and Muse (2005)</xref>.</p>
<p>Because of differences in the simulations and model assumptions we did not compare model accuracy and ROC, but we focused instead on the effect of the rate variation on the false positive rate. In other words we are asking whether the unaccounted rate variations in the evolutionary process can cause false positives in positive selection inference.</p>
<p>BUSTED shows highly inflated rates of false positives in the presence of codon rate variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S5); at a typical significance level of 0.05 the false positive rate of BUSTED is close to 0.3 and 0.2 for the M8 and branch-site simulations, respectively.</p>

<title>Vertebrate dataset</title>
<p>Given the good performance of our model in the simulations, we applied it to the real data. First we used 767 one-to-one orthologs from vertebrate species. This represents a set of genes with high divergence (more than 450 My), conservative evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Studer et al., 2008</xref>), and relatively low effective population sizes (although some vertebrates have high <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gossmann et al. (2012)</xref>), thus relatively weak impact of natural selection. We analyzed them with three variants of the branch-site model: no rate variation, site rate variation and codon rate variation.</p>
<p>We observed that in most of the cases (a branch of a gene tree) the data supports (Akaike information criterion, AIC) the codon rate variation model: out of 26,721 individual branches tested, data supports codon rate variation in 85&#x0025; of the tests, site rate variation in 15&#x0025;, and no rate variation model was favored only in a single test (0.01&#x0025;).</p>
<p>A large proportion of branches detected to be under positive selection with the no rate variation model are not detected to be under positive selection with the codon rate variation model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). More than 40&#x0025; of the positive predictions from the standard branchsite model are not supported when codon rate variation is accounted for. This suggests that evolution on these branches can be explained by nucleotide substitution rate variation without positive selection.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Supplementary Table S4 shows prediction agreement between each model and the best supported model out of three, confirming the good performance of the codon variation model.</p>
<p>The branch-site model analysis took 9, 76 and 1,732 CPU hours for no variation, codon rate variation and site rate variation models. Thus codon rate variation model was 8.4 times slower, while site rate variation model was 190 times slower.</p>
<p>With real data, differences between genes are not only stochastic, but are expected to be driven by underlying biological differences. It is thus interesting to find which factors affect rate variation as estimated by the model, as well as to know which genes favoured the model with codon rate variation the most. In order to perform this analysis we averaged parameters obtained by testing different branches of the tree.</p>
<p>The relative support of the model with codon rate variation is mostly affected by total branch length, alignment length, and mean GC content of the gene (Supplementary Table S5). The positive correlation with tree length and alignment lengths is probably related to the increase in total amount of information available for the model. The relation to average GC content might be due to the relationships between recombination rates, substitution rates, and GC content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Duret and Galtier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rudolph et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>For the shape parameter of the gamma distribution <italic>&#x03B1;</italic>, the strongest explanatory variable is also the length of the alignment (Supplementary Table S6). Counterintuitively, shorter alignments are characterized by larger rate variation (low <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> value corresponds to the large gamma distribution variance). We also observe a weak relation with maximal expression level. Highly expressed genes tend to have a higher rate variation, which could be explained by higher nucleotide level selection on certain parts of the gene.</p>

<title>Drosophila dataset</title>
<p>Second, we used 8,606 one-to-one orthologs from Drosophila genomes. The Drosophila data set is ten-fold larger than the vertebrate dataset. Since analyses on the simulated and vertebrate datasets show consistent superiority of codon rate over site variation rate, with a much lower computational cost, we ran only codon variation and not site variation model on this dataset. Therefore for the Drosophila data we are comparing models with and without codon rate variation. Drosophila have large effective population sizes on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gossmann et al., 2012</xref>), thus stronger impact of natural selection; the genes studied are less biased towards core functions than in the vertebrate dataset, and have lower divergence: about 50 mya for Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Russo et al., 2013</xref>) compared to more than 450 mya for the vertebrate dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Betancur-R et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In total 66,387 branches were tested for positive selection. The model with codon rate variation was supported by the data using AIC in 97&#x0025; of the tests. As with the vertebrate dataset, predictions were not consistent between the two models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). In this case the majority of predictions of positive selection given by the model without rate variation are not supported by the model accounting for rate variation.</p>

<p>The slowdown of branch-site model with codon rate variation was 9.3 times and it took about 10,200 CPU hours.</p>
<p>The relative support of the model with codon rate variation is mainly explained by average GC content, alignment length and tree length (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>), which is consistent with the vertebrate results (Supplementary Table S5). We also see a correlation with the number of sequences and alignment and sequence lengths, which also represent the amount of information available (higher coding sequence length means less gaps for the same alignment length).</p>

<p>We also observe a dependence on the number of exons and on recombination rate. A larger number of exons implies more exonintron junctions, which might affect variation in levels of nucleotide sequence selection (see below). And recombination might affect GC-BGC, mutation rate, and selection strength acting on synonymous sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Campos et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The rate variation parameter <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> can be explained by several features of genes (Supplementary Table S7). Most of the effects are not reproduced between the two datasets. Counterintuitively the direction of dependence is reversed for the number of sequences, but this dependency is not very strong and not very significant. The strongest and the most consistent effect between the two datasets is dependence of the rate variation on GC content (smaller <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> implies higher variance of gamma distribution, hence higher rate variation).</p>

<title>Signatures of selection at the nucleotide level</title>
<p>Codon rate variation can be influenced by various factors such as mutation bias, fixation bias (e.g., gene conversion), or selection acting against synonymous substitutions. Notably, it is well known that exon regions adjacent to the splicing sites are evolving under purifying selection at the nucleotide level (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Majewski and Ott (2002)</xref>). We determined posterior rates for positions of protein coding gene regions located in the proximity of exon-intron and intron-exon junctions; first exons were excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>We observe in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) that our codon rate variation model captures these selection constraints: the codon rate is lower at the exon-intron junction than at the intron-exon junction, and both have lower rates than the rest of the exon. This is in agreement with splicing motif conservation scores (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cartegni et al. (2002)</xref>), and consistent with negative selection acting on spicing sites.</p>
<p>We used the M8 with codon rate variation to simultaneously estimate the effect of factors which affect substitution rates of nucleotide and protein sequences, again in Drosophila. We observed that the model is able to recover opposing trends acting on the 5&#x2019; region of the protein coding gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). These trends are probably a results of the high functional importance of the 5&#x2019; nucleotide sequence, but low functional importance of the corresponding amino acid sequence (see discussion). We observe that the top 25&#x0025; most highly expressed genes show both stronger conservation of the amino acid sequences (Supplementary Fig. S6) and more pronounced decrease in the substitution rate of the 5&#x2019;-region (Supplementary Fig. S7). The relation with expression levels is consistent with the assumption that we are measuring natural selection on gene sequences, rather than mutation rates.</p>

<title>Nucleotide level selection in coding regions</title>
<p>There is strong evidence of selection acting on synonymous substitutions within protein coding sequences, and the strength of this selection is expected to vary across the coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chamary et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In particular, negative selection strongly affects regulatory sequences, such as exonic splicing enhancers or exon junction regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cartegni et al., 2002</xref>). This variation in the selection strength affecting both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions can affect the performance of codon models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al., 2011</xref>) and it is essential to take it into account. While there are multiple ways to do this, for instance by modeling the synonymous and non-synonymous rates separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pond and Muse, 2005</xref>), here we focused on modeling the ratio of non-synonymous vs synonymous rates as a single parameter (<italic>&#x03C9;</italic>), while allowing the substitution rate (<italic>&#x03C1;</italic>) to vary along the sequence.</p>
<p>Our approach succeeds in recovering a signal of splicing motif conservation jointly with positive selection acting on the gene sequence.</p>
<p>We also demonstrate that our model is able to disentangle opposite trends acting on the same sequence, i.e. stronger negative selection acting on the nucleotide sequence combined with weaker amino-acid selection towards the beginning of the reading frame.</p>
<p>Selection on the 5&#x2019; nucleotide sequence is probably due to selection for translation initiation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bentele et al., 2013</xref>), and is probably related to suppression of mRNA structures at the ribosome binding site. At the same time N-terminal amino acids are more likely to be unstructured, and they are relatively less important to protein function and stability compared to the core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Guharoy and Chakrabarti, 2005</xref>).</p>

<label>II.</label>
<title>Determinants of rate variation</title>
<p>The vast majority of gene alignments in the study indicated better support for the model with codon rate variation. Moreover, the relative probability of the models incorporating codon rate variation increases with the amount of information available, be it number of sequences, alignment length or total number of substitutions. This indicates that these models are better in describing the underlying evolutionary process, and if we have enough data these models are favored. We detect a strong signal of nucleotide variation in two quite different datasets: flies have high effective population size, thus natural selection is relatively strong, including on codon usage or splicing; and vertebrates have higher sequence divergence, which does not appear to mask the signal of nucleotide evolution, despite lower effective population sizes in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gossmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Romiguier et al., 2014</xref>). Thus the effect of nucleotide rate variation appears quite general, and will probably be found in many other species.</p>
<p>The strongest determinant of the relative support of the model with codon rate variation is GC content. It is well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fullerton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marais et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chamary et al., 2006</xref>), that high-GC regions have higher recombination rates as a result of GC-BGC, notably in the species studied here. It has also been shown that models accounting for rate variation show significantly better performance in the presence of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scheffler et al., 2006</xref>), even if the true tree topology is used.</p>
<p>The effect of recombination rate as measured in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Comeron et al. (2012)</xref> on the relative support of codon rate variation is weaker than the effect of GC content alone. In mammals the higher CpG dinucleotides mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kong et al., 2012</xref>) can increase the substitution rate disparitiy and therefore contribute to the dependence of the GC content and the relative model support.</p>
<p>Yet we see a similar dependence of Drosophila, where there is no significant neighboring base contextual effects on the mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Keightley et al., 2009</xref>). Here we hypothesize that the GC content can be viewed as a proxy for the average recombination rate over time via GC-BGC. Considering the rapid evolution of recombination hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ptak et al., 2005</xref>), GC content is probably better capturing historical recombination rates, while the direct measurement of recombination rate captures only the current state.</p>
<p>In both datasets we observe a signficant positive association of rate variation with the maximal expression level. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Drummond et al., 2005</xref>), and codon choice affects expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bentele et al., 2013</xref>). One of the main causes of selection on the codon sequence of highly expressed genes is protein misfolding avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yang et al., 2010</xref>), but selection for efficient translation initiation is also a cause of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pop et al., 2014</xref>). It is reasonable to assume that only certain parts of protein coding genes will be affected by strong nucleotide sequence selection, and that this selection will be stronger on more expressed genes. Indeed our results show strong negative selection acting on the coding sequence of translation initiation regions, and the relative selection strength is higher for the 25&#x0025; highest expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. S7). This can lead to the overall increase in the substitution rate variation.</p>
<p>Given the stronger negative selection on the coding sequence and the stronger variation in the substitution rate in highly expressed genes, it is especially important to take this variation into account. Having a few quickly evolving codons in combination with a low average <italic>&#x03C9;</italic> of highly expressed genes can be interpreted as positive selection by models without rate variation. Indeed, in Drosophila the rate of false positives, i.e. genes identified to evolve under positive selection only by the model without rate variation, is strongly correlated with the maximum expression levels of the gene (Supplementary Table S8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<label>III.</label>
<title>Codon models and rate variation</title>
<p>Widely used mechanistic codon models rely on the assumption of constant synonymous substitution rates. This assumption is often violated due to factors such as mutation bias or nucleotide selection, which vary across the gene. While substitution rate variation can be caused by multiple factors, we use a single compound rate parameter to model this variation.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate that a simple model captures such rate variation, and that it both detects new biological signal, and substantially decreases the false positive rate in positive selection detection. Not only do we observe this effect in simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), but inconsistency between models is even higher when applied to the vertebrate and fly datasets. Up to 50&#x0025; of the positive selection predictions performed using models without rate variation can be explained by the nucleotide rate variation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Tables 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>), and thus can be considered as probable false positives.</p>
<p>This indicates that the underlying biological process is highly variable across positions, and that a model selection procedure is able to capture this once enough information is available.</p>
<p>An important question is why accounting for rate variation changes the statistical properties of the test. Indeed it has been argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang, 2014</xref>) that comparison between <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> is a contrast between the rates before and after the action of selection on the protein, and should not be biased by nucleotide rate variation. We hypothesise that <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> /<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> overestimation is caused not only by the variation in <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, but also by codon-specific substitution rates. Indeed, having a small percentage of rapidly evolving codons in the gene would not be captured by an overall rate for <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, and therefore would be interpreted as positive selection by models with protein level but without nucleotide level rate variation. Whereas fully accounting for rate variation allows to detect these codons as rapidly evolving by the signatures of both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions.</p>
<p>There is recent evidence that double mutations in coding sequences increase the branchsite model false positive rate from 1.1&#x0025; to 8.6&#x0025; in similar datasets to those investigated here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Venkat et al., 2017</xref>). The interaction between this effect and rate variation along the gene is worth investigating.</p>
<p>We compared two different models accounting for rate variation: the site variation model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al. (2011)</xref> and our new codon variation model which extends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scheffler et al. (2006)</xref>. The codon rate variation model can be informally thought of as a special case of the site rate variation model. Despite that, the codon rate variation performs better both in the simulations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, Supplementary Table S2) and on the vertebrate dataset (Supplementary Table S4). There are probably two reasons for that. First, the fact that we can assign a rate to a particular nucleotide position does not necessary mean that we can reliably estimate it. Only two amino acids allow single nucleotide synonymous substitution associated with the first or second codon positions. This means that individual position rates can be estimated mostly through non-synonymous substitutions, which are typically rare compared to synonymous ones. Moreover, branch-site and M8 models allow variation in the nonsynonymous rate over codon positions, which means estimates of <italic>&#x03C9;</italic> and site rates are not independent.</p>
<p>Secondly, we expect site rates to be autocorrelated along the sequence since many factors, such as GC content, recombination rate, or chromatin state change slowly over the gene. Indeed we see a weak signal of such autocorrelation in our data (not shown). Therefore having an independent rate for every site is probably redundant.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of codon variation relative to site variation is computational performance. Having a distinct rate for every position increases the number of site classes for which likelihood computations have to be performed by a factor of <italic>k</italic>3, where <italic>k</italic> is the number of discrete categories for gamma distribution. Whereas having a rate only for each codon increases the number of site classes by a factor of <italic>k</italic>. Which means that even for four discrete categories, the slowdown of likelihood computation for site rate gamma model will be about 64 times, vs. only 4 times for codon rate variation model. In practice this ratio between the two models was respected in simulated and vertebrate data. This makes codon rate variation model usable in large real-world datasets, as we demonstrate including on the large 12 Drosophila genomes set.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional mechanistic codon models, our new models allow independent estimations of substitution rate at the nucleotide level and of selective pressure on amino acid sequences. It should be noted that individual site rates estimates may be still noisy because of the amount of data available. But given enough data it is possible to have accurate estimates of selection acting on specific regions, e.g. splicing motifs, within coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We present here a new codon rate variation model family. These mechanistic codon models relax an unrealistic assumption that the only source of substitution rate variation over the gene sequence is selection on the protein. Failure to account for this leads to both type I and type II errors. We demonstrate that our model has a good statistical performance both in the presence and in the absence of rate variation. Rate variation is strongly supported by homologous genes both from species with larger (flies) and smaller (vertebrates) effective population sizes. We are able to capture differences in substitution rate caused by nucleotide selection. Importantly, while being more complex these model remain computationally tractable and therefore can be applied to large-scale datasets. These models open the opportunity of simultaneous analysis of different layers of selection.</p>

Each dataset contains 1,000 alignments simulated under the null hypothesis H0 with no positive selection (all <italic>&#x03C9; &#x2264;</italic> 1) as well as 1,000 alignments under the alternative hypothesis H1 with positive selection (some <italic>&#x03C9; &#x003E;</italic> 1). All the datasets had between 8 and 12 sequences composed of sequences of 100 to 400 codons and were simulated using the software cosim. The parameters of each simulation, including the alignment length and the number of species, were generated at random from their respective distribution (Supplementary Table S9, Supplementary Fig. S8). Values of <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> were within the range of values estimated from the real data (Supplementary Fig. S9), with an emphasis on smaller values where the variation is stronger. For the simulations including rate variation, we used four discrete gamma categories that we assigned either to sites or to codons. The M8 model assumes that the neutral sites and those under purifying selection have an <italic>&#x03C9;</italic> drawn from a beta distribution and we represented this distribution using five discrete categories. Finally, to simulate evolution under the branchsite model, we randomly selected one &#x2018;foreground&#x2019; branch of the phylogenetic tree (either internal or terminal) for every simulated alignment.</p>

<title>Vertebrate and Drosophila datasets</title>
<p>We analyzed two biological datasets. Our goals were to compare the fit of the different models on real data, and to study which gene features are contributing to the variation of the substitution rate. First, we used a vertebrate one-to-one orthologs dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Studer et al.

This dataset was already used in previous studies of codon models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fletcher and Yang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gharib and Robinson-Rechavi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davydov et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<p>For all the tests on simulated data we used the correct (i.e. simulated) tree topology, but starting branch lengths were estimated using PhyML v. 20131022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Guindon et al., 2010</xref>) with the model HKY85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hasegawa et al., 1985</xref>). We did not start the optimization from the true branch lengths, by similarity to a real use-case, when only gene sequences are available, and the true branch lengths are unknown. While tree topology is also inferred in real use-cases, and wrong topology could impact the inference of positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Diekmann and PereiraLeal, 2015</xref>), investigating this is outside the scope of our study.</p>
<p>Optimization of all model parameters jointly with branch lengths is not practical and substantially increases the computational load. We instead first estimated branch lengths using the simpler M0 model, which assumes a constant <italic>&#x03C9;</italic> across branches and sites, and optimized in a second step the model parameters of the M8 or branch-site models with or without rate variation, while fixing branch lengths. A similar approach was used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scheffler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moretti et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>We show that this approach at least in the case of the absence of variation does not decrease significantly the statistical properties of the positive selection inference (Supplementary Fig. S10).</p>
<p>The model optimization was performed in Godon, followed by model selection (see below).</p>
<p>For BUSTED we used an implementation available in HyPhy v. 2.2.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pond et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>For the biological datasets, all the internal branches were tested using the branch-site model for positive selection. Tip branches were not tested to reduce the potential effect of sequencing errors. The M8 model was also applied to estimate substitution rates and <italic>&#x03C9;</italic> for individual sites.</p>

<title>Model selection</title>
<p>During model selection we had six model to choose from: three rate variation approaches and, for each, the absence or presence of positive selection. Although LRT can be used to test for positive selection, it is not possible to use it to compare across all six models that we tested (i.e. any pair of codon rate variation and site rate variation models cannot be represented as a nested pair).</p>
<p>We thus first used the AIC on the alternative model to select one of the three approaches to model rate variation: no rate variation, site rate variation or codon rate variation.</p>
<p>The relative support of each model was computed as a log ratio between Akaike weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wagenmakers and Farrell, 2004</xref>) of the model with codon rate variation and the model without rate variation.</p>
<p>Once the rate variation model was selected, we performed LRT to detect positive selection on the corresponding pair of models, i.e. model with <italic>&#x03C9; &#x2264;</italic> 1 and model without this constraint. A 50:50 mix of <italic>&#x03C7;</italic><sup>2</sup> distribution with one degree of freedom and of a point mass of 0 was used as a null distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yang and dos Reis, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Posterior rates inference</title>
<p>In order to estimate rates of synonymous substitution for individual codons we used an approach similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rubinstein et al. (2011)</xref>. First, we estimated the probability of a codon be-longing to each rate as <italic>P</italic> = <italic>Pr</italic>(<italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sup>(<italic>h</italic>)</sup> = <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>&#x007C; x</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>, <italic>&#x03B7;</italic>), where <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sup>(<italic>h</italic>)</sup> is the rate of codon <italic>h</italic>, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the <italic>i</italic>-th discrete gamma rate, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> is the data observed at codon <italic>h</italic>, and <italic>&#x03B7;</italic> are the parameters of the model (e.g. for M8 <italic>&#x03B7;</italic> = {<italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>p</italic>, <italic>q</italic>, <italic>s</italic>}). In this approach, <italic>&#x03B7;</italic> is replaced with the maximum likelihood estimate of model parameters <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="174839_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Thus codon rates can be estimated as a weighted sum <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="174839_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to use Bayes empirical bayes (BEB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al. (2005)</xref>) instead. However BEB was developed and tested for site detection in particular codon models, and we do not know how well is it applicable to rate variation. On top of that given the increased parametric space of the model, BEB would be computationally intensive. Since we are averaging rates over multiple sites, random noise should not introduce a substantial bias.</p>
<p>Site <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> /<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> ratios in the M8 model can be estimated using a similar approach, while replacing codon rate categories with the <italic>&#x03C9;</italic> categories.</p>
<p>Posterior site rate and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> /<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> estimation is implemented in Godon. In all cases we used an alternative model codon rate estimation. Since the null model for every pair is a special case of the alternative, we can use the later for parameter estimation without any significant loss of precision.</p>
<p>For the branch-site model we averaged position rate estimates from all the individual branch tests.</p>
