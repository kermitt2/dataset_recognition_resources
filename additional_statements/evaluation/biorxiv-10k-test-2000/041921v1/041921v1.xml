<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Haplotypes with reduced or missing homozygosity may harbor deleterious alleles that compromise juvenile survival. A scan for homozygous haplotype deficiency revealed a short segment on bovine chromosome 19 (Braunvieh haplotype 2, BH2) that was associated with high juvenile mortality in Braunvieh cattle. However, the molecular genetic underpinnings and the pathophysiology of BH2 remain to be elucidated.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The frequency of BH2 was 6.5 &#x0025; in 8,446 Braunvieh animals from the national bovine genome databases. Both perinatal and juvenile mortality of BH2 homozygous calves were higher than the average in Braunvieh cattle resulting in a depletion of BH2 homozygous adult animals (P=9.3x10<sup>&#x2212;12</sup>). The analysis of whole-genome sequence data from 54 Braunvieh animals uncovered a missense mutation in <italic>TUBD1</italic> (rs383232842, p.H210R) that was compatible with recessive inheritance of BH2. The availability of sequence data of 236 animals from diverse bovine populations revealed that the missense mutation also segregated at a low frequency (1.7 &#x0025;) in the Fleckvieh breed. A validation study in 37,314 Fleckvieh animals confirmed high juvenile mortality of homozygous calves (P=2.2x10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>). Our findings show that the putative disease allele is located on an ancestral haplotype that segregates in Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle. To unravel the pathophysiology of BH2, six homozygous animals were examined at the animal clinic. Clinical and pathological findings revealed that homozygous calves suffered from chronic airway disease possibly resulting from defective cilia in the respiratory tract.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>A missense mutation in <italic>TUBD1</italic> is associated with high perinatal and juvenile mortality in Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle. The mutation is located on a common haplotype likely originating from an ancient ancestor of Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that deleterious alleles may segregate across closed cattle breeds without recent admixture. Homozygous calves suffer from chronic airway disease resulting in poor growth performance and high juvenile mortality. The respiratory manifestations resemble key features of diseases resulting from impaired function of airway cilia.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Reducing calf mortality is an important objective in cattle breeding populations both for animal welfare and economic reasons. Bovine calf losses including late abortions, stillbirths and diseases during rearing may be in excess of 10 &#x0025; [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most rearing losses are attributable to infectious diarrheal and respiratory diseases [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. While a number of genetic variants predisposing to high perinatal mortality have been identified in bovine populations (<italic>e.g.</italic>, [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), the mapping of loci affecting disease susceptibility and rearing success is difficult because of their low heritability [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Case-control association testing using genome-wide marker data facilitated the discovery of causal variants for monogenic disorders that result in high juvenile mortality [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although the pathophysiology of such conditions is heterogeneous, pertinently affected calves may be apathetic, without vigor, retarded in growth or highly susceptible to infectious disease. Affected calves may be born without typical signs of disease but develop clinical features shortly after birth [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The availability of large-scale genotype data enables the identification of haplotypes with homozygosity depletion [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Haplotypes with reduced or missing homozygosity in adult animals are likely to harbor recessive alleles that are associated with an increased pre-, peri-or postnatal mortality. A scan for homozygous haplotype deficiency in Braunvieh cattle uncovered a short segment on bovine chromosome 19 (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Braunvieh haplotype 2 or BH2) that was associated with high juvenile mortality [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we exploit comprehensive genotyping and sequencing data to detect a missense mutation in <italic>TUBD1</italic> that is most likely causal for the high juvenile mortality of BH2 homozygous calves. We validate the missense mutation in an independent cattle population and provide evidence that homozygous calves suffer from chronic respiratory disease.</p>

<title>BH2 compromises juvenile survival in Braunvieh cattle</title>
<p>We used array-derived genotypes of 8,446 Braunvieh animals from the national genomic reference and validation populations to narrow BH2 down to a 1.14 Mb segment (from 10,694,269 bp to 11,833,182 bp) on BTA19. The frequency of BH2 was 6.5&#x0025;. Only one animal was homozygous although 41 were expected (P=9.3x10<sup>&#x2212;12</sup>). Insemination success was not reduced in BH2 risk matings (P=0.85) ruling out homozygous haplotype deficiency to result from early embryonic losses. The analysis of 32,100 calving records revealed that the first-year mortality of descendants from BH2 risk-matings was increased by 4.6 &#x0025; compared to non-risk matings (P=1.8x10<sup>&#x2212;28</sup>)(<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>Two male Braunvieh calves homozygous for BH2 were detected in the Swiss bovine genome database. According to the possessing farmers, both calves were underweight at birth. One calf died for an unknown cause at 72 days of age and was not available for phenotyping. The second calf (BH2<sub>hom</sub>) was referred to the animal clinic at 66 days of age. During a hospitalization period of 95 days, BH2<sub>hom</sub> suffered repeatedly from bronchopneumonia. At 161 days of age, BH2<sub>hom</sub> was euthanized because of suddenly occurring severe dyspnea.</p>

<title>A missense mutation in <italic>TUBD1</italic> is compatible with recessive inheritance of BH2</title>
<p>To identify the causal mutation for the high mortality of BH2 homozygous calves, we analyzed re-sequencing data of BH2<sub>hom</sub>, five heterozygous BH2 carriers and 48 control animals of the Braunvieh population. The average genome coverage in BH2<sub>hom</sub>, five heterozygous carriers and 48 control animals, respectively, was 17.36, 12.08&#x00B1;1.39 and 11.46&#x00B1;1.54 fold. Multi-sample variant calling in 54 sequenced animals yielded genotypes for 9974 single nucleotide and short insertion and deletion polymorphisms and 3065 structural variants located within a 1.3 Mb interval (from 10.6 Mb to 11.9 Mb) encompassing BH2. These 13,039 polymorphic sites were filtered for variants that were compatible with recessive inheritance of BH2 that is homozygous for the alternate allele in BH2<sub>hom</sub>, heterozygous in BH2 carriers and homozygous for the reference allele in control animals. This filtering revealed six candidate causal variants for BH2 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6a"><bold>Additional File 1</bold></xref>): five were located in intergenic regions and one variant (rs383232842) was located in the <italic>TUBD1</italic> (<italic>tubulin delta 1</italic>) coding region (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6b"><bold>Additional File 2</bold></xref>). All intergenic variants that were compatible with recessive inheritance of BH2 were more than 65 kb away from coding sequences. Thus we considered the rs383232842 mutation in the <italic>TUBD1</italic> coding region as the most likely causal mutation. The rs383232842 C-allele causes a substitution of a histidin by an arginin at a conserved position in tubulin delta 1 (ENSBTAP00000001700.5:p.H210R) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6c"><bold>Additional File 3</bold></xref>). The amino acid substitution is predicted to be damaging to protein function (SIFT-score: 0.03, Polyphen-score: 0.23). We obtained genotypes of the rs383232842 polymorphism in 661 adult Braunvieh animals using a KASP genotyping assay; the mutation was in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with BH2 (r<sup>2</sup>=0.98) and none of 661 genotyped animals were homozygous for the C-allele (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>The mutation in <italic>TUBD1</italic> affects rearing success in another cattle breed</title>
<p>The analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 236 animals from six bovine breeds other than Braunvieh revealed that rs383232842 was heterozygous in seven out of 149 Fleckvieh animals (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6a">Additional File 1</xref>). To obtain genotypes for rs383232842 in a large sample of the Fleckvieh population, we genotyped 3807 randomly selected adult animals using a KASP genotyping assay. Among these, 142 were heterozygous and none was homozygous for the C-allele corresponding to a C-allele frequency of 1.86&#x0025;. Of 3807 animals that had been genotyped at rs383232842, 1974 were also genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD Bead chip. The availability of dense marker data enabled us to detect an 1.05 Mb haplotype (BH2<sub>FV</sub>; from 10,406,017 bp to 11,453,904 bp) that was specific for the rs383232842 C-allele: ninety-two animals that carried the C-allele were heterozygous carriers of BH2<sub>FV</sub>, whereas 1882 animals that were homozygous for the reference allele did not carry BH2<sub>FV</sub>. In 37,314 Fleckvieh animals of the national bovine genome databases that had been genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead chip, the frequency of BH2<sub>FV</sub> was 1.68&#x0025;. Only four animals were homozygous for BH2<sub>FV</sub> although ten were expected (P=0.09). The analysis of 46,566 calving records revealed that the first-year mortality of descendants from BH2<sub>FV</sub> risk matings was increased by 6.1 &#x0025; compared to progeny from non-risk matings (P=2.2x10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>A common haplotype with the rs383232842 C-allele segregates in Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle</title>
<p>BH2 encompasses a 1.14 Mb segment from 10,694,269 bp to 11,833,182 bp. It is defined by eleven SNPs of the Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead chip. BH2<sub>FV</sub>, defined by 249 SNPs of the Illumina BovineHD Bead chip, is located between 10,406,017 bp and 11,453,904 bp. The BH2 alleles are a subset of the BH2<sub>FV</sub> alleles within a 741 kb segment between 10,694,269 bp and 11,435,269 bp (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6d">Additional File 4</xref>). Since both BH2 and BH2<sub>FV</sub> contain the rs383232842 C-allele, a common origin of the two haplotypes is most likely. The analysis of pedigree records enabled us to track BH2 and BH2<sub>FV</sub> back to the Braunvieh bull Rancho Rustic My Design (&#x002A;1963) and the Fleckvieh bull Polzer (&#x002A;1959), respectively. However, we were not able to identify common ancestors in their pedigrees. Cluster analyses using genome-wide marker data revealed no evidence for a recent exchange of genetic material between Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6e">Additional File 5</xref>).</p>

<title>BH2 segregates in the Holstein breed, but does not contain the rs383232842 C-allele</title>
<p>To test if the common BH2 / BH2<sub>FV</sub> haplotype segment segregated in another dairy breed, we analyzed haplotypes of 8840 adult Holstein animals that had been genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead chip. We identified 917 heterozygous and 30 homozygous carriers of BH2 among the genotyped Holstein animals. The observed haplotype distribution did not deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P=0.54). We additionally genotyped the rs383232842 polymorphism in 503 Holstein bulls using a KASP genotyping assay. All of them including 74 heterozygous and two homozygous BH2 carriers were homozygous for the rs383232842 reference allele (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6d">Additional File 4</xref>). Another 311 Holstein animals that had been sequenced within the 1000 bull genomes project [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] were homozygous for the reference allele indicating that the rs383232842 C-allele does not segregate in this breed.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Identification of BH2 homozygous calves</title>
<p>To unravel the pathophysiology associated with BH2, we initiated a monitoring project in the Austrian and Swiss Braunvieh populations. Breeding consultants collected ear tissue samples of calves descending from BH2 risk matings immediately after birth for genetic investigations. Of 117 genotyped calves, twelve were homozygous for the rs383232842 C-allele (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Among those, eight were stillborn or died shortly after birth. All stillborn homozygotes were underweight at 25 to 30 kg and appeared underdeveloped although gestation length was normal (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6f">Additional file 6</xref>). Apart from low body weight, necropsy revealed no signs of disease. Four live born homozygous calves (BV1-BV4) were referred to the animal clinic.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="041921_tbl3.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>During the sampling of BH2 homozygous calves, we encountered a male Fleckvieh calf (FV1) with low birth weight and postnatal growth restriction that descended from a BH2<sub>FV</sub> carrier bull. At 40 days of age, its weight was 28.5 kg, which is only a third compared to healthy Fleckvieh calves of the same age. FV1 was tested negatively for two recessive mutations that are known to cause retarded growth [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>],[<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Another 16-months old Braunvieh bull (BV5) with poor growth performance and a history of recurrent respiratory disease was reported by a farmer. Inspection of the bull&#x2019;s pedigree revealed BH2 carriers among its paternal and maternal ancestors. Sanger sequencing of DNA samples from FV1 and BV5 confirmed that both animals were homozygous for the rs383232842 C-allele. Both animals were referred to the animal clinic.</p>

<title>Homozygous animals suffer from chronic airway disease</title>
<p>At admission, six homozygous animals were emaciated and their heads appeared elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6g">Additional file 7</xref>). Initial examination revealed aberrant breathing sounds (<italic>i.e.</italic>, enforced vesicular breathing, rhonchus, coughing), tachypnea, tachycardia and excessive mucous exudation from the nostrils (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). The analysis of blood parameters revealed iron deficiency and increased monocyte counts in some animals possibly indicating ongoing response to infectious disease (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6h">Additional file 8</xref>). The clinical features led to the diagnosis of bronchopneumonia and the animals were treated accordingly. Although the medication alleviated the clinical symptoms, respiratory disease recurred repeatedly. Due to the steadily declining health condition with no prospect for improvement, all animals were euthanized and subjected to necropsy.</p>

<p>At necropsy, the animals were underweight and emaciated. Macroscopic abnormalities of the respiratory tract such as mucopurulent rhinitis, tracheobronchitis and lung lesions became evident in all animals (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6i">Additional file 9</xref>). Histological sections of tissue samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract revealed hyperplastic ciliated epithelia with intraepithelial neutrophils and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) hyperplasia, respectively, accompanied by bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6j">Additional file 10</xref>). The lumen of bronchi and bronchioles were obstructed by mucopurulent exudate and the surrounding lung tissue was atelectatic and showed minimal intra-alveolar infiltration of inflammatory cells. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) data of ciliated epithelial tissue were available from the upper and lower respiratory tract of four animals (FV1, BV1, BV2, BV4). Analyses of TEM sections revealed defective microtubule organization in 20-30 &#x0025; of ciliary cross-sections including transposition faults, microtubular disorganization, absence of outer and central microtubule pair and aberrations of the outer and inner dynein arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Homozygosity for BH2 may be incompletely penetrant</title>
<p>Breeding consultants reported another three Braunvieh animals that were homozygous for BH2. These homozygous animals were detected during routine genomic evaluation using genotypes of the Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead chip. Sanger sequencing of DNA samples confirmed homozygosity for the rs383232842 C-allele in all animals. While one young bull was healthy and normally developed at the age of 370 days, two animals were retarded in growth and had a history of recurrent respiratory disease (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6k">Additional file 11</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We show that Braunvieh haplotype 2 is associated with high peri-and postnatal calf losses, corroborating previous findings in European and North-American Braunvieh populations [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The first-year mortality of calves descending from BH2 risk matings is less than expected for a lethal recessive disorder, indicating that some BH2 homozygous calves may reach adulthood. Despite its detrimental effect on juvenile survival, the frequency of BH2 is high (6.5 &#x0025;). Deleterious alleles may reach high frequency in cattle populations because of the widespread use of unnoticed carrier bulls in artificial insemination and pleiotropic effects on desirable traits [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. So far, there is no evidence that BH2 has desirable effects on important breeding objectives. Several harmful conditions other than BH2 segregate in the Braunvieh populations [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Pinpointing the causal mutation allows for the implementation of efficient genome-based mating programs to avoid the inadvertent mating of carrier animals while maintaining genetic diversity and high rates of genetic gain. A missense mutation (rs383232842, p.H210R) in <italic>TUBD1</italic> was found to be compatible with recessive inheritance of BH2. Affected, carrier and non-carrier animals were homozygous for the alternate allele, heterozygous and homozygous, respectively, for the reference allele at rs383232842. Although BH2 is in high LD with rs383232842, the identification of carrier animals is less reliable with haplotype information. Five out of 661 animals were misclassified based on the haplotype test indicating both lower specificity and sensitivity of haplotype-based classification of animals into carriers and non-carriers which agrees with previous findings in cattle [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Pinpointing causal mutations is often difficult as many sequence variants may be compatible with the presumed pattern of inheritance (<italic>e.g.</italic>, [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). In 54 sequenced Braunvieh animals of our study, five intergenic variants were in complete LD with rs383232842. Yet we consider rs383232842 as the most likely to be causal because it results in a substitution of a conserved amino acid residue. Moreover, all compatible non-coding variants are far away from annotated transcripts and are thus less likely to be functionally important. However, it cannot be ruled out <italic>a priori</italic> that such variants affect gene regulation, <italic>e.g.</italic>, if located in a distant enhancer region. A criterion for causality is often that the segregation of the candidate variant is restricted to the population affected by the condition (<italic>e.g.</italic>, [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Strictly applying this criterion to our data would have led to the exclusion of rs383232842 as a plausible causal mutation for BH2, since it segregates in Fleckvieh cattle where a previous scan for homozygous haplotype deficiency did not detect homozygosity depletion at the BH2 region [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, we specifically tested the BH2<sub>FV</sub> haplotype with the rs383232842 C-allele for association with juvenile mortality in more than 37,000 Fleckvieh animals. Homozygosity depletion at BH2<sub>FV</sub> was not significant (P=0.09) possibly because most Fleckvieh animals of the present study were genotyped shortly after birth, before typical signs of disease may become manifest. However, the first-year mortality of descendants is significantly higher in BH2<sub>FV</sub> risk than non-risk matings (P=2.2x10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>) corroborating a detrimental effect of BH2<sub>FV</sub> and consequently supporting the causality of the rs383232842 mutation.</p>
<p>The exchange of genetic material between breeds may result in the manifestation of the same recessively inherited conditions in different populations [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Kumar Kadri et al. identified a sequence variant that compromises fertility in three admixed Nordic dairy breeds [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Dr&#x00F6;gem&#x00FC;ller et al. mapped a sequence variant for an autosomal recessive skin disease in two geographically separated albeit genetically related dog populations [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The discovery of a recessive mutation that compromises juvenile survival in Fleckvieh and Braunvieh cattle demonstrates for the first time, that deleterious alleles may segregate across closed cattle populations, <italic>e.g.</italic>, populations without recent admixture. Fleckvieh and Braunvieh animals with the rs383232842 C-allele share a common haplotype, indicating they inherited the corresponding chromosome segment from a common ancestor. However, our data neither revealed common ancestors nor provided evidence of a recent exchange of genetic material between both breeds. A version of the ancestral haplotype without the rs383232842 C-allele also segregates in Holstein cattle at relatively high frequency (5.5 &#x0025;). These findings indicate that the rs383232842 mutation occurred in an ancient ancestor of Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle, however, after the divergence from Holstein cattle, which is compatible with the history of those breeds [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While BH2 and BH2<sub>FV</sub> affect juvenile survival in Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle, respectively, the haplotype version without the rs383232842 C-allele does not exhibit homozygous haplotype deficiency in Holstein cattle providing additional evidence for causality of the rs383232842 polymorphism.</p>
<p>To investigate the pathophysiology that may result from the rs383232842 mutation in <italic>TUBD1</italic>, we examined six homozygous animals. Although the age of the examined animals differed, the disease manifestation was homogeneous: recurrent airway disease resulted in a steadily declining general condition and poor growth performance despite excellent husbandry conditions and medical treatment at the animal clinic. Thus, a more severe disease progression in homozygous animals kept under normal husbandry conditions in conventional farms is likely. The respiratory manifestations resemble disease patterns arising from defective cilia of the respiratory tract [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We observed microtubular assembly defects in 20-30 &#x0025; of the cilia of the respiratory epithelium in affected animals which is 4-6 times higher than in healthy individuals [<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Ultrastructural defects of the cilia might also result from infectious or inflammatory diseases [<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Persistent coughing, tachypnea and airway mucus obstruction in homozygous animals might indicate an impaired mucociliary clearance due to an aberrant ciliary beat pattern [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>-<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We used a cytology brush to collect viable epithelial cells from the nasal mucosa of affected calves to investigate ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency (data not shown). However, all collected samples were excessively covered with mucous exudate and contained numerous inflammatory cells, precluding the analysis of ciliary beating using standard protocols.</p>
<p>Several mutations in humans, mice and dogs lead to chronic airway disease because of disorganized cilia (<italic>e.g.</italic>, [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). Although required for microtubule polymerization in basal bodies that anchor cilia and flagella, sequence variants in <italic>TUBD1</italic> have not been associated with respiratory disorders so far [<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>-<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We observed disorganized microtubules in airway cilia of animals homozygous for the rs383232842 mutation pointing to a crucial role of TUBD1 for proper assembly of cilia. The conserved histidine residue at amino acid position 210 in TUBD1 is involved in microtubule polymerization [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Besides being involved in cilia assembly, microtubules constitute the bipolar spindle that binds and moves the chromosomes during the different meiotic phases. Disturbed microtubule formation may lead to erroneous segregation of chromosomes with negative effects on growth and differentiation (<italic>e.g.</italic>, [<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]). Such disturbances could be responsible for frequently observed prenatal growth retardation and stillbirth of fetuses from BH2 risk matings.</p>
<p>Most homozygous calves (75 &#x0025;) were stillborn or died shortly after birth. Six hospitalized calves suffered from airway disease early in life. The general condition of all hospitalized animals declined steadily because the disease was not responsive to medical treatment. However, homozygosity for the rs383232842 mutation does not necessarily have fatal consequences as evidenced by a bull homozygous for the putative disease allele without any apparent signs of disease. Although minimizing exposure to environmental pollutants and respiratory pathogens may contribute to a less severe disease progression [<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], our results suggest that the mutation is highly penetrant because 17 out of 18 homozygous animals were stillborn or diseased shortly after birth. In any case, our findings now enable to implement efficient genome-based mating strategies to avoid the mating of carrier animals thereby preventing the birth of homozygous calves that are likely to suffer from chronic disease.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A missense mutation in <italic>TUBD1</italic> is associated with high juvenile mortality in Braunvieh and, unexpectedly, Fleckvieh cattle. Since genomic analyses revealed no evidence for an exchange of genetic material between both breeds, we demonstrate for the first time that harmful recessive mutations may segregate in closed cattle populations. Homozygous animals suffer from chronic airway disease possibly resulting from defective cilia in the respiratory tract. Our findings now enable the implementation of genome-based mating strategies in order to prevent animal suffering and economic losses.</p>

<title>Animal ethics statement</title>
<p>Homozygous animals were descendants from matings between carrier animals that happened inadvertently in the Braunvieh and Fleckvieh populations prior to the declaration of BH2 carrier bulls. Ear tissue samples of homozygous calves were collected from breeding consultants. Seven homozygous animals were hospitalized and examined at the Clinic for Ruminants of the Veterinary University of Vienna, Austria and at the Clinic of Reproductive Medicine, Vetsuisse-Faculty, University Zurich, Switzerland as part of their regular practice. All hospitalized animals were euthanized because of steadily declining health condition with no prospect of improvement. No ethical approval was required for this study.</p>

<title>Animals, genotypes, quality control and phasing</title>
<p>Genotypes of 8,501 Braunvieh and 37,314 Fleckvieh animals were extracted from the Austrian and German bovine genome databases. All animals had been genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 bead chip (version 1 and version 2) comprising approximately 54,000 SNPs. The chromosomal position of the SNPs was based on the UMD 3.1 assembly of the bovine genome [<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Mitochondrial, X-chromosomal, Y-chromosomal SNPs and SNPs that had no known chromosomal position were not considered for further analyses. Animals with a call-rate less than 95 &#x0025; were excluded as well as animals with mendelian conflicts with their genotyped sires at more than 200 SNPs. We excluded SNPs with a minor allele frequency below 0.5 &#x0025; as well as SNPs with call rate less than 90 &#x0025; or more than 0.5 &#x0025; mendelian conflicts in sire-offspring pairs. The final Braunvieh data consisted of 8,446 animals and 35,382 autosomal SNPs with an average per-individual call-rate of 99.61 &#x0025;. The final Fleckvieh data consisted of 37,314 animals and 41,027 autosomal SNPs with an average per-individual call-rate of 99.82&#x0025;.

<title>Mapping of BH2<sub>FV</sub> in the Fleckvieh cattle population</title>
<p>To identify a haplotype specific for the rs383232842 C-allele, we exploited haplotypes of 10,363 Fleckvieh animals that had been genotyped and (partially) imputed at 652,853 SNPs [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We extracted haplotypes of 1947 animals that had also been genotyped at rs383232842 (see below). A haplotype window consisting of five adjacent SNPs was centered at rs383232842 and increased by one SNP on either side as long as a common haplotype (BH2<sub>FV</sub>) was heterozygous in all animals that were heterozygous at rs383232842.

The insemination success in risk matings (carrier bulls mated to daughters of carrier sires) was compared with non-risk matings (non-carrier bulls mated to daughters of carrier sires) using a logistic regression model. Perinatal and first-year mortality was analyzed in 32,100 and 46,566 Braunvieh and Fleckvieh calvings, respectively, with known haplotype states from sires and maternal grandsires. Calves that left the recording system within 365 days after birth for other reasons than death (<italic>e.g.</italic>, export to other countries) were not considered.

<p>Description: Principal component analysis (PCA) using genotypes of 42,056 autosomal SNPs</p>
<p>(a) and 1121 SNPs located on chromosome 19 (b), respectively. The PCA separated the animals by breed without any evidence for a recent admixture. There was no indication that BH2 and BH2<sub>FV</sub> carriers were more closely related to each other than to non-carrier animals. Hierarchical clustering using genotypes of 1121 SNPs located on chromosome 19 (c). Animals were clearly separated by breed without any evidence of a recent admixture of BH2 and BH2<sub>FV</sub> carriers.</p>

<p>Description: A homozygous young bull at the age of 370 days (a). According to the possessing farmer, the bull did not suffer from respiratory disease in the past. The weight of another homozygous young bull at the age of 271 days was 243 kg (b). The possessing farmer reported that the young bull suffered from life-threatening bronchopneumonia early in life. Although the animal recovered from the disease, coughing and excessive mucous exudation from the nostrils were apparent during its entire life. Multiple lung lesions were noticed after slaughter. A female calf homozygous for the rs383232842 C-allele at the age of 194 days with an unaffected coeval (c-e). Photographs were kindly provided by Franz Birkenmaier (a, c-e) and Attilio Rossoni (b).</p>
