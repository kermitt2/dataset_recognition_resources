<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Edwardsiella piscicida</italic> (<italic>E. piscicida</italic>) is an intracellular pathogen within a broad spectrum of hosts. Essential to <italic>E. piscicida</italic> virulence is its ability to survive and replicate inside host cells, yet the underlying mechanisms and the nature of the replicative compartment remain unclear. Here, we characterized its intracellular lifestyle in non-phagocytic cells and showed that intracellular replication of <italic>E. piscicida</italic> in non-phagocytic cells is dependent on its type III secretion system. Following internalization, <italic>E. piscicida</italic> is contained in vacuoles that transiently mature into early endosomes, but subsequently bypasses the classical endosome pathway and fusion with lysosomes which depends on its T3SS. Following a rapid escape from the degradative pathway, <italic>E. piscicida</italic> was found to create a specialized replication-permissive niche characterized by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. We also found that a T3SS effector EseJ is responsible for intracellular replication of <italic>E. piscicida</italic> by preventing endosome/lysosome fusion. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments confirmed that EseJ is necessary for bacterial colonization of <italic>E. piscicida</italic> in both mice and zebrafish. Thus, this work elucidates the strategies used by <italic>E. piscicida</italic> to survive and proliferate within host non-phagocytic cells.</p><sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intracellular pathogens often invade host cells as a means of escaping extracellular immune defenses and creating a safe niche for replication. However, internalized pathogens are not entirely protected, as they are normally routed to lysosomes for degradation. Invasive pathogens must devise strategies to avoid this. Typically, intracellular pathogens either (i) reside within a customized, membrane-bound compartment, which limits trafficking along the endosomal pathway, as observed for <italic>Legionella</italic> [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], <italic>Brucella subspp</italic> [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], or (ii) rupture and escape their vacuole to reside and replicate in the host cytosol, as in the case for <italic>Shigella</italic>, <italic>Listeria</italic>, and <italic>Rickettsia subspp</italic> [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Many pathogenic bacteria are found to proliferate in a membrane-bound compartment. These bacteria adopt different strategies to survive after phagocytosis. Some bacteria, such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and <italic>Coxiella burnetiid</italic> [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], survive and proliferate in an acidic compartment. Other pathogens avoid lysosomal fusion by blocking phagosome maturation, such as <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], or by hijacking the eukaryotic secretory pathway, such as <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>E. piscicida</italic> was reported to reside within membrane-bound vacuoles (ECVs) after infection of both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which the bacterium evade lysosomal degradation remains unclear.</p>
<p>Host cell manipulation by pathogenic bacteria is largely mediated through the delivery of an arsenal of virulence proteins called effectors to the host cell cytosol [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> produce multiple effector proteins which specifically target host proteins such as Arf1, Rab1 and Sec22b to ultimately create a replicative organelle [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> serovar Typhimurium is known to regulate <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV) trafficking via the action of SPI-2 T3SS-delivered effectors [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, SifA targets the host GTPase Rab9 to inhibit the process of Rab9-dependent M6PR recycling [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and SopD2 targets the host GTPase Rab7 to perturb endocytic trafficking [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that T3SS and T6SS mechanisms are essential for the virulence of <italic>E. piscicida</italic> [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. An increasing number of T3SS and T6SS effectors have been identified, including EseG [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], EseJ [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], EseH [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], EseK [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and EvpP [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. EseG was reported to localize to the ECV membrane, but its function remains undefined [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. EseJ was reported to be involved in the adhesion stage during infection [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the virulence factors involved in the regulation of replication of <italic>E. piscicida</italic> in host cells remain unknown.</p>
<p>Given previous findings supporting the ability of <italic>E. piscicida</italic> to invade, survive, and replicate within non-phagocytic cells [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the goal of the present work was to uncover the strategies and molecular mechanisms used by this pathogen to circumvent lysosomal routing and establish a replicative niche within the host. We have identified an effector EseJ that is required for intracellular replication in a specialized vacuole that is important for <italic>E. piscicida</italic> replication inside host cells. We found that EseJ acts by inhibiting lysosome degradation of the pathogen which we find is important for systemic infection in vivo. Through these strategies, <italic>E. piscicida</italic> successfully establishes an intracellular lifestyle that could contribute to its survival and dissemination during infection.</p>

<title>Intracellular replication of <italic>E. piscicida</italic> in non-phagocytic cells depends on its T3SS but not T6SS</title>
<p><italic>E. piscicida</italic> prefers an intracellular lifestyle upon infection in either epithelial [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or phagocytic cells [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the virulence factors involved in such an intracellular process remain undefined. Considering that T3SS and T6SS are the most important virulence factors for <italic>E. piscicida</italic>, we first monitored the survival and replication of both the wild-type EIB202 and the isogenic T3SS or T6SS mutant strains in three different non-phagocytic cells, HeLa, Caco-2 and ZF4. Both EIB202 and &#x0394;T6SS infection of nonphagocytic cells, followed by gentamicin-induced death of extracellular bacteria, revealed a progressive increase in intracellular bacterial numbers over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). In contrast, no replication was observed in the &#x0394;T3SS mutant, indicating that a functional T3SS, but not a T6SS, is required for intracellular survival of <italic>E. piscicida</italic> in non-phagocytic cells. In order to visualize bacterial invasion and intracellular replication, HeLa cells were infected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged <italic>E. piscicida</italic> strains, confocal microscopy images were acquired and the number of intracellular bacteria in EIB202-infected cells were scored over time. About 15&#x0025; of HeLa cells containing hyper-replicating bacteria were observed after EIB202 and &#x0394;T6SS infection for 8 h, but not with the &#x0394;T3SS mutant strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that <italic>E. piscicida</italic> can survive and replicate in non-phagocytic cells via a mechanism mediated by the T3SS, but not T6SS.</p>

<title><italic>E. piscicida</italic> prevents endosome maturation and lysosome fusion</title>
<p>Once inside host cells, invasive bacteria either replicate within the endosome or escape the vacuole and replicate in the cytoplasm. Consistent with our previous study [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], <italic>E. piscicida</italic> located within vacuolar compartment (s) after infection which we named the <italic>E. piscicida</italic>-contained vacuoles (ECVs) (S1A Fig). Galectin-3 is a &#x03B2;-galactoside binding protein that is specifically recruited to disrupted pathogen-containing vacuoles [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To further investigate if <italic>E. piscicida</italic> remains inside the vacuoles during its whole intracellular lifecycle, the presence of galectin-3 around the ECV was assessed using fluorescence microscopy. Less than 10&#x0025; of vacuoles harboring WT <italic>E. piscicida</italic> co-localized with galectin-3 in HeLa cells over time (S1B Fig). These data suggest that <italic>E. piscicida</italic> EIB202 resides and replicates inside pathogen-containing vacuoles throughout the course of infection.</p>
<p>Next, we wished to understand the strategies used by this pathogen to establish and maintain its intracellular life cycle. Following internalization, foreign particles and many bacteria are usually found within membrane-bound compartments that sequentially develop into early and late endosomes for ultimate fusion with lysosomes, where the particles are degraded. We monitored the acquisition of endosomal markers and lysosomal fusion in <italic>E. piscicida</italic>-containing vesicles over time using confocal microscopy. Early after invasion (1 h after infection), over 70&#x0025; of both intracellular wild-type and &#x0394;T3SS mutant were found enclosed within vacuoles that co-localized with the early endosomal protein Rab5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), indicating interactions with early endosomes. These interactions were transient, as Rab5 colocalization rapidly decreased to 5&#x0025; and 3&#x0025; by 4 h post-gentamicin incubation after infection with both wild-type EIB202 and the &#x0394;T3SS mutant strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). As Rab5 colocalization was progressively lost, an increasing number of &#x0394;T3SS mutant bacteria colocalized with the late endosomal markers Rab7 and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp-1) over time, which is consistent with vacuolar maturation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B-E</xref>). In contrast, the majority of the vacuoles containing wild-type EIB202 were negative for both Rab7 and Lamp1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B-E</xref>). These results suggest wild-type <italic>E. piscicida</italic> transiently interacts with early endosomes, but avoids endosome maturation during infection.</p>

<p>Considering that luminal acidification is another critical characteristic of endosome maturation, we used the fixable acid tropic probe LysoTracker to monitor acidic organelles in infected cells. A major overlap was found between the dye and &#x0394;T3SS mutant strain, but not wild-type EIB202 as early as 2 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Thus, these results suggest the ECVs formed by the wild-type bacterium avoid vacuolar acidification and maturation by perturbing the fusion with lysosomes. To further understand this process, we assessed ECV co-localization with TR-dextran. Prior to bacterial infection, cells were pulsed with TR-dextran for 6 h followed by overnight chase in dye-free medium to ensure that the probe is delivered from early and recycling endosomes to lysosomes [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Confocal immunofluorescence and quantification data showed that the majority of wild-type EIB202-containing vacuoles did not co-localize with TR-dextran (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). In contrast, when cells were infected with the &#x0394;T3SS strain, more than 70&#x0025; of the ECVs did co-localize with TR-dextran at 8 h post-infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that <italic>E. piscicida</italic> utilize its T3SS to successfully evade lysosomal fusion and ultimately replicate in nonacidic compartments lacking lysosomal or late endosomal characteristics.</p>

<title>ECVs acquire ER markers during maturation into a replicative organelle</title>
<p>Our results iundicate that wild-type <italic>E. piscicida</italic> circumvented the classical endocytic pathway to establish a specialized replication-permissive niche. This raises the possibility that the bacterium may interact with other intracellular compartments. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was reported to be recruited and hijacked by many intracellular pathogens to create their replication niche [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We first used a specific ER-tracker dye to assess the intracellular ER structures and analyzed the presence of ER marker in bacterium-containing vacuoles. Surprisingly, ER-tracker labeling was present in the EIB202 replication compartment located at the perinuclear regions of HeLa cells, but this was excluded in &#x0394;T3SS-containing vacuoles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).

<title>A T3SS effector EseJ is responsible for <italic>E. piscicida</italic>&#x2019;s intracellular replication</title>
<p>The finding that the T3SS plays a critical role in the inhibition of endosome maturation and <italic>E. piscicida</italic> lysosome degradation raised the question of what T3SS effectors are involved in this process. To date, several <italic>E. piscicida</italic> T3SS effectors including EseG [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], EseJ [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], EseH [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and EseK [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] have been identified. To assess the role of individual effectors, we tested the ability of WT and isogenic <italic>E. piscicida</italic> effector mutants to replicate inside non-phagocytic host cells. We found that only the <italic>eseJ</italic> mutant showed a marked deficiency in intracellular replication compared to wild-type bacteria as assessed by CFU intracellular counts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). To determine whether the impaired ability of the <italic>eseJ</italic> mutant to replicate intracellularly was attributed to effects on lysosome fusion and degradation, we investigated the characteristics of the &#x0394;<italic>eseJ</italic>-containing compartments over time. Coincident with the intracellular fate of &#x0394;T3SS, &#x0394;<italic>eseJ</italic>-containing vacuoles progressively co-localized with Rab7 (S2A Fig) and Lamp-1(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and S2B Fig). Moreover, the mature Lamp-1-positive &#x0394;<italic>eseJ</italic>-containing vacuoles were found to be fused with lysosomes as assessed using the acidification probe LysoTracker Red DND-99 and pre-loaded Dextran (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). These findings suggest that the effector EseJ is critical for <italic>E. piscicida&#x2019;</italic>s replication inside cells by disrupting vacuolar trafficking to the lysosome during infection.</p>

<p>To further assess the function of EseJ, we analyzed the effect of EseJ expression on the transport and the degradation of exogenously added DQ-Red bovine serum albumin (BSA), which emits red fluorescence upon proteolytic degradation and is used as a sensitive indicator of lysosomal activity [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Bright punctate signal intensity of DQ-Red BSA were significantly attenuated in cells stably expressing EseJ compared with that observed in cells expressing vector alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>), indicating that EseJ expression suppresses lysosome function. Consistently, cells infected with wild-type, but not &#x0394;T3SS or &#x0394;<italic>eseJ E. piscicida</italic> mutants displayed a remarkable decrease in DQ-Red BSA fluorescence intensity (S2C Fig). Next, we investigated the delivery of endosomal cargo to lysosomes by pre-loading cells with dextran 488 prior to transfection and then treated the cells with rhodamine dextran. In line with the results shown above, the dextran derivatives co-localized with a Mander&#x2019;s coefficient of more than 0.5 in control cells, suggesting significant endosome-lysosome fusion, whereas EseJ-HA expression resulted in significantly less co-localization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that T3SS effector EseJ is both necessary and sufficient to block endocytic trafficking to lysosomes and consequently critical for <italic>E. piscicida</italic>&#x2019;s intracellular replication.</p>

<title>Role of EseJ in <italic>E. piscicida</italic>&#x2019;s infection in vivo</title>
<p><italic>E. piscicida</italic> T3SS was reported to act as a critical virulence factor in disease pathogenesis in both mouse and fish infection models [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To assess the role of the T3SS effector EseJ in animal infection, C57BL/6 wild-type mice were orally infected with wild-type and isogenic &#x0394;<italic>eseJ E. piscicida</italic> strains. Compared to wild-type EIB202, the &#x0394;<italic>eseJ</italic> strain showed reduced bacterial burdens in the cecum and intestinal lumen as well as systemic sites including the liver, spleen and kidneys (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). Likewise, reduced colonization of the &#x0394;<italic>eseJ</italic> mutant was observed in zebrafish larvae after infection when compared to the wild-type bacterium (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Notably, zebrafish infected with wild-type <italic>E. piscicida</italic> showed marked mortality, with &#x007E;75&#x0025; of the animals succumbing by day 3&#x2013;4 post-infection whereas only &#x007E;50&#x0025; of fish succumbed to infection with the <italic>eseJ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>E. piscicida</italic> was recently shown to invade and proliferate within many non-phagocytic cells [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but the mechanism by which the bacterium its own survival inside host cells remained unclear. Here we report a comprehensive description of how <italic>E. piscicida</italic> turns the intracellular environment into a hospitable niche that allows for efficient bacterial replication. Subversion of the phagocytic pathway by intracellular bacteria is a general mechanism to establish an appropriate replication niche. Pathogens are known to adopt diverse strategies to disrupt the maturation process at different stages and to prevent its delivery into a phagolysosome. For example, <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> remains within an early endosomal compartment [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that excludes the vacuolar ATPase, thus inhibiting the acidification of the bacterial phagosome. The maturation of the SCV is arrested at a late endosome-like stage, selectively excluding proteins such as mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPR) and lysosomal cathepsin proteins [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the present study, we tracked the acquisition of endosomal markers and lysosomal fusion in <italic>E. piscicida</italic>-containing vesicles over time using confocal microscopy and demonstrated that <italic>E. piscicida</italic> bypassed the classical endosome pathway after transiently interactions with early endosomes. Our studies indicate that using this strategy, <italic>E. piscicida</italic> disrupts endosomal maturation and evades lysosome degradation.</p>
<p>Our study characterized an important contribution of the T3SS effector EseJ in regulating endocytic trafficking of <italic>E. piscicida</italic> within host cells. Intracellular expression of EseJ was found necessary and sufficient to block endocytic progression to lysosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Notably, the <italic>eseJ</italic> mutant was greatly impaired in intracellular replication when compared to the wild-type bacterium, indicating that EseJ is an important factor for intracellular survival and replication of <italic>E. piscicida</italic>. However, it remais unclear how EseJ evades fusion with lysosomes to evade degradation. One possibility is that EseJ interacts with host small guanine nucleotide binding proteins (GTPases), phospholipids or other host proteins that are enriched and central for endocytic trafficking. The strategy of interacting with endosome-bounded proteins is an efficient tactic used by other pathogens to combat the host&#x2019;s bactericidal defenses. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) secretes SapM, a phosphatase that removes PI(3)P from Mtb-containing vacuoles by converting it to PI, thereby arresting endosomal maturation [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> secreted VipD to interact with early endosomal protein Rab5 to protect from endosomal fusion [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Another question is whether EseJ act in concert with other virulence factors involved in the regulation of ECV trafficking which needs to be investigated in future studies.</p>
<p>Orchestration with other intracellular compartments and routing into a specialized compartment favorable for replication is another important mechanism for the survival of bacterial pathogens inside host cells. For example, biogenesis of <italic>Legionella</italic>-replicative compartments depends upon a rapid interception of COPI-dependent vesicular trafficking from endoplasmic ER exit sites [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Formation of SCVs is associated with the Golgi apparatus and induces endosomal tubulations that extend towards the cell periphery [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed obvious ER characteristic associated with ECVs. However, how <italic>E. piscicida</italic> recruits and interacts with ER remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Overall, our studies demonstrate a complex and deliberate intracellular life cycle of <italic>E. piscicida</italic> in non-phagocytic cells (see model in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). The bacterium not not only invades the host cells, but also subverts trafficking of bacterium-containing vacuoles through the endosomal pathway and translocation to an specialized aggressively replication niche. Moreover, we showed that a T3SS effector EseJ is essential for the intracellular replication by disrupting endosomal maturation and lysosome fusion, which is critical for virulence of <italic>E. piscicida in vivo</italic>.</p>

<caption><title>Proposed model for <italic>E. piscicida</italic> intracellular life cycle in non-phagocytic cells.</title>
<p>After entry, intracellular wild type <italic>E. piscicida</italic> resides within vacuoles (ECVs) that interact with early endosomes. At intermediate stages of infection, an T3SS effector EseJ was secreted into cell cytosol to globally disrupt endocytic trafficking to lysosomes, which helps to protect ECVs from lysosome fusion. Therefore, these early ECVs bypass the regular lysosomal routing but contact with the ER to facilitate its later robust replication.</p></caption>
