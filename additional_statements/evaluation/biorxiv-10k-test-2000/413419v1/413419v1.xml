<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 6 plays an important role in skeletal system development and progression. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of BMP6 in cartilage cell proliferation and differentiation remains unknown. In this study, cartilage cells were isolated from shanks of chicken embryos and treated with different concentrations of GH. Cell proliferation and differentiation potential was assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and CCK-8 assays in vitro. The results showed that at 48 h, the Collagen II and BMP6 expression levels in 50 ng/&#x03BC;l GH-treated cartilage cells were significantly higher than in groups treated with 100 ng/&#x03BC;l or 200 ng/&#x03BC;l GH. We further observed that knockdown of BMP6 in cartilage cells led to significantly decreased expression levels of Collagen II and Collagen X. Moreover, the suppression of BMP6 expression by a specific siRNA vector led to significantly decreased expression levels of IGF1R, JAK, PKC, PTH, IHH and PTHrP. Taken together, our data suggest that BMP6 may play a critical role in chicken cartilage cell proliferation and differentiation through the regulation of IGF1, JAK2, PKC, PTH, and Ihh-PTHrP signaling pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted-type multifunctional proteins belonging to the transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x03B2; superfamily. Many studies have reported that BMPs play very important roles in bone formation and cartilage induction in both vertebrates and invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]; moreover, they are also considered crucial molecules involved in cell growth, differentiation, chemotaxis and apoptosis during embryonic development and postnatal tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. BMPs stimulate target cells mainly through their specific type I and type II receptors on the cell membrane. When signal transduction occurs, BMPs usually combine with the type II receptor, then increase the expression and activation of receptor type I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. BMPs first bind to the receptors on the membrane and transmit this signal through the Smads pathway to promote the differentiation of chondrocytes into the osteogenic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. In addition to the Smads signaling pathway, other signaling pathways can also transmit signals from the BMP family, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>In the BMP family, BMP2, 4 and 6 are all thought to play the most important roles in skeletogenesis. Many studies have suggested that BMP2 is a pivotal signal for the regulation of osteoblastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Mas et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] also showed that BMP2 promotes the expression of Ihh in anterior hypertrophic chondrocytes and the proliferation of chondrocytes. BMP6 is mainly expressed in cartilaginous tissue, where it stimulates mesenchymal cell differentiation into chondrocytes and promote the synthesis of chondrocytes and articular cartilage-specific glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. BMP6 can also induce the differentiation of MSCs into chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In BMPs, BMP6 is a strong factor for bone induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. In addition to the differentiation of MSCs, chondrocytes can be derived from BMSCs, ADSCs and other stem cells induced by BMP6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. These findings indicate that BMP6 is an important regulator of bone and cartilage cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the biological activity of BMP6 in cartilage cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as related signaling pathways, has remained unclear. Therefore, a further understanding of the molecular mechanism of BMP6 in cartilage is urgently needed.</p>
<p>In this study, we first extracted and cultured cartilage cells from different breeds of chickens, and we then investigated the expression of BMP6 and the changes in expression of key genes involved in related signaling pathways through GH-mediated induction at different concentrations to determine its potential role in cell proliferation and differentiation. Finally, to explore the mechanism of BMP6-mediated effects on the proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells, we modulated the expression of BMP6 through siRNA and measured its effects by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Collectively, this study provides evidence that within cartilage cells, BMP signaling regulates genes associated with both cell proliferation and differentiation.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Avian broiler and Yellow bantam chickens, which have major differences, were used in this study. Avian broilers were provided by the Zheng Da Company (Chengdu, China). Yellow bantam chickens were provided by the Jin Ling Company (Guangzhou, China). All animal studies were performed in accordance with appropriate guidelines. All experimental protocols were approved by the Committee on Experimental Animal Management of Sichuan Agricultural University, permit number 2014-18.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>The eggs were incubated for 15 days after sterilization. Primary cartilage cells were isolated from the shank of 15-day-old chicken embryos with 0.25&#x0025; trypsin (Gibco, USA), digestion for 0.5 h and then 0.1&#x0025; collagenase &#x2161; (Gibco, USA) for 1.5 h at 37&#x00B0;C under sterile conditions. The cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10&#x0025; fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin (Gibco, USA) in a humidified atmosphere of 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x00B0;C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Cartilage cells were fixed in 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde for 20 min after adhering for 24 h in the incubator and were then washed three times in PBS, 5 min per wash. The cells were permeabilized with 0.5&#x0025; Triton-X-100 (Gibco, USA) for 15 min at room temperature and then washed three times in PBS, 5 min per wash. The cells were blocked with Blocking buffer (Bio-Rad, USA) for 2 h at 37&#x00B0;C and then washed as above. The cells were incubated in PBS containing an antibody towards type II collagen (1:1000) (Abcam, USA) overnight at 4&#x00B0;C. The following day, the cells were washed as described above and incubated in PBS containing IgG (1:250) (Abcam, USA) for 2 h at 37&#x00B0;C under dark conditions. After washing three times, the cells were counterstained with DAPI. Photomicrographs were taken using an Olympus digital camera system.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Cell viability assay</title>
<p>Cell proliferation activity was evaluated via Cell Counting Kit-8 assay (CCK8, Bioss, China). At different time points, the medium was replaced with 100 &#x03BC;l of fresh medium containing 10 &#x03BC;l of CCK8. Three hours after the addition of CCK8, cell viability was determined with a microplate reader (Thermo Electron, USA) at a wavelength of 450 nm. All plates had control wells containing medium without cells to obtain a value for background luminescence, which was subtracted from the test sample readings. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.</p>

<title>Cell treatments</title>
<p>Cells were treated with 0 ng/&#x03BC;l, 50 ng/&#x03BC;l, 100 ng/&#x03BC;l, and 200 ng/&#x03BC;l GH while cells were grown to 80&#x0025; confluence. Cells were harvested after transfection for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.</p>
<p>Two siRNAs were designed based on the sequence from NCBI (XM-418956.4) and are listed in Table 1. The cartilage cells were grown to 80&#x0025; confluence and transfected with 5 &#x03BC;l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) and 5 &#x03BC;l of siRNA (Sangon Biotech, China) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Cells were harvested after transfection at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.</p>

<title>RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNAiso plus Reagent (Takara, Japan) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript&#x2122; RT reagent Kit reverse transcriptase (Takara, Japan) with 1 &#x03BC;g of total RNA according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. &#x03B2;-actin was chosen as an internal standard to control for variability in amplification due to differences in the starting mRNA concentrations. The forward and reverse primer sequences used to amplify the genes were designed according to the sequence retrieved from the NCBI and listed in Table 2. Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR technology with a Bio-Rad CFX Connect Real Time System (Bio-Rad, USA). PCR was performed at 98&#x00B0;C for 120 s, followed by 40 amplification cycles (98&#x00B0;C for 2 s, X&#x00B0;C for 15 s, 72&#x00B0;C for 10 s), followed by 65&#x00B0;C to 95&#x00B0;C per second and then 4&#x00B0;C forever. The relative gene expression level was calculated using the 2<sup>-&#x0394;&#x0394;C<sub>T</sub></sup> method. All PCR runs were performed in triplicate.</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>BMP6</italic> mRNA after GH induction</title>
<p>Based on the growth curves and the relative expression of BMP6 mRNA in cartilage cells of avian broilers and yellow bantams, we selected cartilage cells of avian broilers for induction by GH and interference by siRNA targeting BMP6. Collagen II, a special marker for cartilage cells, was detected in cartilage cells after GH-induction. Relative to the &#x03B2;-actin gene, the expression levels of BMP6 mRNA varied considerably at different times (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). As seen from the results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>(A)), the proliferation of cartilage cells in the three treatment groups at 24 h and 7 2 h was not significantly higher than that in the blank treatment group (P&#x003C;0.05). However, at 48 h, the proliferation of cartilage cells was significantly elevated in the treatment group compared to that of the blank group, 100 ng/&#x03BC;l and 200 ng/&#x03BC;l groups (P&#x003C;0.05). These results indicated that 50 ng/&#x03BC;l GH was the most sensitive to the proliferation induction of cartilage cells. The relative expression levels of BMP6 mRNA in cartilage cells after induction are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> (B). In the 50 ng/&#x03BC;l- and 100 ng/&#x03BC;l-treatment groups, the expression of BMP6 mRNA was significantly increased relative to the blank treatment group and 200 ng/&#x03BC;l at 48 h, which was consistent with the expression of Collagen II mRNA (P&#x003C;0.05). This showed that the expression of BMP6 mRNA was significantly increased in the process of proliferation of cartilage cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Currently, studies regarding the BMP6 gene in chondrocytes have primarily focused on humans, mice, rabbits and other mammals, with few studies focused on chickens. We used immunofluorescence to identify and observe the cell morphology, used CCK8 assays to detect the proliferation of cartilage cells and real-time PCR to detect the BMP6 mRNA expression in cartilage cells cultured from avian broiler and yellow bantam chickens. Collagen II is a representative protein indicating the proliferation of chondrocytes, and thus can be used as a cell marker; many studies have examined the expression of type II collagen in the mandibular condyle, using both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Our results showed that the avian and yellow bantam cartilage cells had no significant difference. According to these results, we selected cartilage cells cultured from avian chicken growth plates to research the function of BMP6 for regulating the proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells.</p>
<p>GH is an important regulatory factor for longitudinal growth of the bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Local injection of GH can increase the number of cartilage cells in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The expression of GH can promote the expression of Collagen II mRNA in cartilage cells and maintain a chondrocyte phenotype. We used GH to induce the cartilage cells in order to detect the expression of BMP6 mRNA in proliferative cells. The results showed that the sensitivity of cartilage cells to GH varied with GH concentration. When cartilage cells proliferated, the expression of BMP6 was significantly increased. Therefore, we speculated that BMP6 participates in the proliferation of cartilage cells.</p>
<p>RNA interference uses homologous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to induce the silencing of specific target genes and block gene activity. SiRNA (small interfering RNA) is the intermediate of RNA interference, which is necessary for the RNA interference and can stimulate the complementary target mRNA silencing. Collagen X is specifically expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In this experiment, two siRNAs were designed and synthesized according to the BMP6 gene CDS region, and the expression of BMP6 mRNA was inhibited. BMP6 was involved in the proliferation of cartilage cells, and, when the expression of BMP6 mRNA was suppressed in cartilage cells, the expression of Collagen II and Collagen X mRNA&#x2014;two marker genes representing the proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells&#x2014;decreased in cartilage cells. These results showed that the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes were both blocked following the disruption of the expression of BMP6. Together with the previous results, we speculate that BMP6 is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells, which is consistent with the existing research findings.</p>
<p>IGF1 plays an important role in the growth and development of bone cells; it can regulate the function of osteoblasts in various forms and participates in bone reconstruction. IGF1 can significantly promote the proliferation of bone progenitor cells both in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The signal transmission mediated by IGF1 is specifically induced by the IGF1R on the cell surface, thus promoting the growth, differentiation and apoptosis of tissue cells. To explore whether IGF1R is involved in the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation of BMP6, the expression of IGF1R mRNA was detected while using RNAi technology to interfere with the expression of BMP6. When the expression of BMP6 was inhibited, the expression of IGF1R was also inhibited. Therefore, we speculate that BMP6 has a regulatory effect on IGF1.</p>
<p>JAK2 is a common signaling pathway induced by multiple cytokine- and growth factor-mediated signaling within cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. When JAK activity is inhibited, osteoarthritis articular chondrocytes can reproduce and differentiate normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Interleukin-6 and interleukin-7 can induce cartilage cell activity through the JAK2/STAT signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. It has been found that BMP7 can promote osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts through JAK2/STAT5B signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], and we hypothesized that BMP6 may regulate the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes through the JAK2/STAT signaling pathway. To explore whether JAK2 is involved in the regulatory effects of BMP6 on the proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells, we used RNAi technology to interfere with the expression of BMP6 and subsequently detect the expression of JAK2 in the JAK2/STAT signaling pathway. Our results showed that the expression of JAK2 was also inhibited when the expression of BMP6 was decreased. We hypothesize that BMP6 has regulatory effects on JAK2 expression.</p>
<p>PKC is an important substance in cell signal transduction pathways and participates in the process of proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes; it is one of the important signal transducers affecting the growth and development of cartilage and its eventual degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. PKC signaling and multiple other signaling pathways participate in IGF1 induction of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Estrogen and vitamin D-mediated signaling depends on the PKC&#x03B1; pathway to regulate the activity of cartilage cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. To explore whether PKC is involved in the BMP6-mediated regulation of the proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells, we used RNAi technology to interfere with the expression of BMP6 and detect the subsequent expression of PKC. Our results showed that PKC expression was inhibited when the expression of BMP6 was inhibited. We hypothesize that PKC is involved in the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation mediated by BMP6.</p>
<p>The main function of PTH is to regulate Ca2<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Phosphorous metabolism and promote bone absorption. PTH stimulates the expression of Collagen II in cartilage cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. A previous study found that PTH interacts with the TGF-beta signaling pathway at the receptor level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. BMP6 belongs to the TGF-beta family, therefore we speculated that PTH may participate in the regulation of chondrocytes by BMP6. We used RNAi technology to interfere with the expression of BMP6 and detected subsequent PTH expression. Our results showed that PTH expression was also inhibited when the expression of BMP6 was inhibited. We hypothesize that PTH participates in the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation by BMP6. Ihh/PTHrP signaling is important in bone development regulation, modulating the differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts, maintaining the cartilage cell proliferation state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] and determining the length of the growth plate cartilage by regulating the bone longitudinal growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. PTHrP can inhibit osteoblast differentiation by down-regulating BMP2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. We hypothesized that the Ihh/PTHrP signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation by BMP6 of chondrocytes. We used RNAi technology to interfere with the expression of BMP6 and detect the subsequent expression of Ihh and PTHrP. Our results showed that the expression of Ihh and PTHrP mRNA was also inhibited when the expression of BMP6 mRNA was decreased. The Ihh/PTHrP signaling pathway participates in the regulation by BMP6 of the proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells.</p>
<p>BMP6 belongs to the TGF&#x03B2; family, and current research indicates that the regulation of chondrocytes is mainly achieved through the Smad signaling pathway of TGF&#x03B2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. BMP2, BMP9 and BMP6 belong to the BMP family. BMP2 can increase the proliferation of chondrocytes and the elongation of chondrocytes by inducing the expression of Ihh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. BMP9 and GH can synergize the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through the JAK/STAT/IGF1 signaling pathway. As one of the strongest members of the BMPs family, BMP6 may regulate the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes through other signaling pathways in addition to the Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, we analyzed the IGF1/JAK/PKC/PTH/Ihh-PTHrP signaling pathways, which play important roles in the process of proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells, and detected the expression changes of several key genes (IGF1R, JAK2, PKC, PTH, Ihh, PTHrP) in these signaling pathways when the expression of BMP6 mRNA was inhibited. The results collectively showed that the expression of these genes decreased significantly. IGF1/JAK/PKC/PTH/Ihh-PTHrP are involved in the regulation by BMP6 of the proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There was no significant difference in cartilage cells cultured from different chicken breeds. BMP6 was highly expressed when cartilage cells proliferated. When the expression of BMP6 mRNA was decreased, the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes was blocked, indicating that BMP6 is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells. The expression levels of key genes involved in the IGF1R, JAK2, PKC, PTH, IHH and PTHrP signaling pathways were significantly lower in cartilage cells when the expression of BMP6 mRNA was decreased. These key genes involved in signaling pathways were involved in the regulation by BMP6 of the proliferation and differentiation of cartilage cells.</p>
