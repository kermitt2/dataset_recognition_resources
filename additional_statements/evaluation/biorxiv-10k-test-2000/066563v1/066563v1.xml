<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, the causative agent of cholera, is an abundant environmental bacterium that can efficiently colonize the intestinal tract and trigger severe diarrheal illness. Motility, and the production of colonization factors and cholera toxin, are fundamental for the establishment of disease. In the aquatic environment, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> persists by forming avirulent biofilms on zooplankton, phytoplankton and chitin debris. Here, we describe the formation of artificial, biofilm-like communities, driven by exposure of planktonic bacteria to synthetic polymers. This recruitment is extremely rapid and charge-driven, and leads to the formation of initial &#x201C;seed clusters&#x201D; which then recruit additional bacteria to extend in size. Bacteria that become entrapped in these &#x201C;forced communities&#x201D; undergo transcriptional changes in motility and virulence genes, and phenotypically mimic features of environmental biofilm communities by forming a matrix that contains polysaccharide and extracellular DNA. As a result of this lifestyle transition, pathogenicity and <italic>in vivo</italic> host colonization decrease. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic polymers to disarm pathogens by modulating their lifestlye, without creating selective pressure favoring the emergence of antimicrobial resistant strains.</p>

<title>SIGNIFICANCE</title>
<p><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> is an important human pathogen and causes watery diarrhea after consumption of contaminated water. Its reservoir are aquatic environments, where it persists in an avirulent biofilm state. Upon ingestion, it escapes biofilms and expresses virulence factors, leading to colonization and pathogenicity within the human host. Here, we show that capture by charged polymers rapidly immobilizes <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and artificially forces it into a sessile state. This mimics environmental cues for biofilm formation and leads to repression of virulence factors through loss of motility. This work highlights a novel artificial lifestyle and an efficient way to neutralize virulent <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and block disease and transmission.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for several million incidences of enteric disease and up to 142,000 deaths every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Many of these cases are attributable to the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> El Tor biotype, which is the cause of an ongoing global epidemic, the 7<sup>th</sup> to sweep our planet in recorded history. A natural inhabitant of aquatic environments, El Tor&#x2019;s success has been attributed to genetic systems for quorum sensing, chitin breakdown and virulence. Within the human host, the bacterium initiates a virulence programme including the induction of colonization factors and toxins. The two major virulence factors expressed by El Tor strains are cholera toxin and the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). Cholera toxin is an ADP-ribosyltransferase of the AB<sub>5</sub> family, which leads to the profuse watery diarrhea and electrolyte loss characteristic of the disease. Its subunits are encoded by <italic>ctxA</italic> and <italic>ctxB</italic> which are organized in an operon(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). TCP, a type IV pilus, is required for formation of bacterial microcolonies in the small intestine and leads to a local enhancement in toxin concentration at the site of infection. The major pilus subunit is encoded <italic>by tcpA</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In aquatic environments, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> persists by forming biofilms on the surfaces of phytoplankton, zooplankton and chitin debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Biofilms, which are composed of a matrix of exopolysaccharide and extracellular DNA surrounding the bacteria, offer a protective environment against aquatic predators as well as the host environment. Thus, biofilm formation is an important contributing factor to human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Efficient colonization of the host intestine, however, requires disassembly of biofilms, and a switch to active motility allowing the bacterium to search out and attach to the host epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Indeed, escape from the biofilm is a prerequisite for induction of the virulence programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) and failure to escape from the biofilm state results in decreased host colonization fitness <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Clearly, the ability to switch between motile and sessile lifestyles, along with the carefully controlled induction of virulence factors, is central to the establishment of disease and the emergence of Cholera epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>Although efforts to develop a widely effective vaccine against <italic>V. cholerae</italic> are ongoing, the efficacy of existing vaccines is low. Attenuated <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, for example, elicits protective immunity in as few as 16&#x0025; of patients in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). In addition, current vaccines offer protection for only two years, a time period shorter than many epidemics. Currently, and in the absence of a vaccination program, the best way to prevent such outbreaks is by water treatment and provision of sanitation infrastructure. As such, low-tech measures to facilitate decontamination of drinking water, such as simple means of filtration, are desirable and can have a dramatic impact on disease incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Moreover, there is a lack of understanding of how <italic>V. cholerae</italic> responds to these strategies, and how this pathogen regulates virulence and motility upon immobilization onto a filtration device. To this end, we demonstrate here that linear, cationic polymers can rapidly capture <italic>V. cholerae</italic> from aqueous environments and, upon sequestration into these artificially precipitated communities, induce an avirulent phenotype in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> that mimics environmental biofilm formation. Overall, the polymers force <italic>V. cholerae</italic> into an artificial sessile lifestyle, which inhibits virulence factor production, colonization and dissemination.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Cationic polymers rapidly form three-dimensional clusters upon contact with <italic>V. cholerae</italic></title>
<p>Many polycationic polymers have been designed to maximize their antimicrobial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and previously published work demonstrated a trade-off between the charge and hydrophobicity in cationic polymers and their ability to cluster bacteria, and/or affect bacterial viability within clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Based on our previous work with closely related species <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), we decided to investigate the potential of (poly(<italic>N</italic>-(3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide), pAPMAm &#x2013; P1 and (poly(N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]methacrylamide), pDMAPMAm - P2, to remove <italic>V. cholerae</italic> from aqueous environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1a</bold></xref>). These polymers are both cationic under neutral aqueous conditions and were synthesized via free radical polymerization with high purity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2</xref></bold>). Upon contact with <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, both polymers rapidly formed clusters <italic>in situ</italic> in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1b</bold></xref>), and cluster formation reached equilibrium within minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1c</bold></xref>). Cluster formation proceeded via initial nucleation of small layers or sheets of bacteria, which increased in size both by lateral interaction with additional bacteria, as well as stacking of bacteria on existing sheets to form clusters over the first 15 minutes, and then remained stable over the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1b,d</bold></xref>). No significant differences were observed between both polymers, suggesting that clustering was mainly dominated by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged polymers and the negatively charged bacteria. Bacterial clusters were stable for at least 24 hours and had a well-defined three-dimensional structure (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3</xref></bold>). Both polymers induced bacterial clustering with high efficiency, and the endpoints were practically indistinguishable in terms of numbers of particles and cluster size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1b</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of polymer-induced clustering on bacterial growth and membrane integrity</title>
<p>The effect of cationic polymers on bacterial viability varies significantly with charge, hydrophobicity, polymer concentration and the bacterial species tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Thus, we explored if and how clustering of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> affects bacterial proliferation and viability under physiological conditions. Bacterial proliferation during co-incubation of GFP expressing <italic>V. cholerae</italic> with different concentrations of polymers was measured, monitoring GFP fluorescence over 25 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2a</bold></xref>). Bacterial proliferation was generally unaffected, except at very high polymer concentrations (0.5 mg/ml of P1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2a</bold></xref>). However, it was unclear from these experiments whether the slower increase in fluorescence was due to inhibition of bacterial growth, as is observed within subsets of cells within bacterial biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), or due to cellular damage commonly observed with highly charged cationic polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Flow cytometry of bacterial samples exposed to polymers and LIVE/DEAD<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> cell viability stains allowed us to determine bacterial viability via measuring membrane integrity of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> sequestered in clusters at the experimental endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2b</bold></xref>). Viability and membrane integrity were largely unaffected by clustering even following overnight incubation, except at very high polymer concentrations (0.5 mg/ml P1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2b</bold></xref>). We also investigated the effect of both polymers on host cells, in this case cultured Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, using lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH) assays to probe cellular membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4"><bold>Figure S4</bold></xref>). <bold>P1</bold> and <bold>P2</bold> both compromised membrane integrity of epithelial cells at 5&#x00B7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> and 5&#x00B7;10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup> mg/mL or above, respectively, compared to untreated control cells. Thus, for functional experiments, we focused on investigating the effects of the highest effective, non-toxic concentration of both polymers.</p>

<title>Sequestration of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> into polymer clusters induces a biofilm-like state and suppresses bacterial virulence at the transcriptional level</title>
<p>The switch to a sessile lifestyle and biofilm formation in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is initiated by surface sensing and downregulation of bacterial motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).

<p>Since sequestration into polymer clusters promotes a sessile state, we investigated what impact this environmental signal would have on virulence regulation. For this purpose, we created a series of transcriptional reporter strains, by introducing, via conjugation, a variant of the pRW50 plasmid containing oriT into <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4a</bold></xref>). Thus, we could follow the induction of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> promoters during growth in medium mimicking inducing conditions within the host environment (DMEM, 37 &#x00B0;C), using &#x03B2;-galactosidase assays. AphA is a master regulator of virulence that is required for the activation of <italic>tcpP</italic>. TcpP, in turn, activates <italic>toxT</italic>, which activates downstream virulence genes, including those responsible for the production of cholera toxin and the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). In the absence of polymer, the <italic>aphA</italic> promoter was strongly induced (&#x007E;9-fold compared to vector control) in mid-log phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4b</bold></xref>). Sequestration of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> into clusters significantly repressed the <italic>aphA</italic> promoter activity (approx. 70&#x0025; and 55&#x0025; suppression with <bold>P1</bold> and <bold>P2</bold>, respectively). The <italic>toxT</italic> promoter was also strongly induced (&#x007E;12-fold over vector control) in the absence of polymer but significantly repressed in bacterial clusters (&#x007E;30&#x0025; and 20&#x0025; inhibition by <bold>P1</bold> and <bold>P2</bold>, respectively). Similarly, the promoters of the two key virulence factors, <italic>ctxAB</italic> and <italic>tcpA</italic>, were strongly induced under conditions mimicking the host environment (12-fold and 4-fold induction over vector control, respectively) with both <bold>P1</bold> and <bold>P2</bold> suppressing <italic>ctxAB</italic> transcription by approximately 60&#x0025; and 70&#x0025;, respectively. The effect on <italic>tcpA</italic> was less pronounced, with <bold>P1</bold> showing only mild suppression, and <bold>P2</bold> suppressing transcription by &#x007E;50&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4b</bold></xref>). We also investigated the effect of physical immobilization within artificial clusters on transcriptional regulation of genes encoding for components of the flagellar systems (<italic>flaE</italic> and <italic>flaA</italic>, respectively). Both of these were comparatively weak promoters (&#x007E;2 to 2.5-fold induction compared to vector control). Interestingly, both <italic>flaE</italic> and <italic>flaA</italic> were downregulated by P1 mediated clustering, while P2, which is more hydrophobic than <bold>P1</bold>, had no effect on <italic>flaA</italic> or <italic>flaE</italic> transcription levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5"><bold>Figure S5</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Polymer sequestration of bacteria abolishes <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and intestinal colonization <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Since polymer-induced clustering repressed the induction of key virulence factors, we asked what impact clustering would have on <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection. Initially, we tested the effect of clustering on colonization and toxicity towards cultured intestinal epithelial cells. Sequestration of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> by polymers led to a significant reduction in bacterial attachment to host cells, as determined both by dilution plating/CFU counts and imaging of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><bold>Figure 5a-c</bold></xref>). Imaging of Caco-2 cells infected with either planktonic or clustered <italic>V. cholerae</italic> also revealed a decrease in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> mediated toxicity as a result of bacterial clustering. Host cells infected with clustered bacteria showed less cell death and more intact cell-cell junctions than cells infected with planktonic bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><bold>Figure 5c</bold></xref>). This protective effect of the polymers was also observed when cytotoxicity was measured by LDH release assays, following infection with planktonic or clustered <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><bold>Figure 5b</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we tested whether non-bactericidal concentrations of polymers would protect against intestinal colonization by <italic>V. cholerae in vivo</italic>. Previously, zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) have been established as an aquatic host which can be colonized and infected by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in a concentration dependent manner, and infection eventually leads to mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). We tested if bacterial clustering would affect subsequent colonization of zebrafish larvae by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> following a 6 hour exposure. Zebrafish larvae exposed to either 10<sup>7</sup> or 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL of planktonic or polymer-clustered GFP-expressing <italic>V. cholerae</italic> were first imaged and then sacrificed, and intestinal <italic>V. cholerae</italic> were extracted from the tissue and enumerated by dilution plating on selective TCBS agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><bold>Figure 6a-b</bold></xref>). Images of infected fish showed that GFP-expressing <italic>V. cholerae</italic> had specifically colonized the gastrointestinal tract, with the majority of bacteria attached to the mid-intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><bold>Figure 6c</bold></xref>). The bacterial burden was visibly lower in fish infected with clustered bacteria, compared to fish infected with planktonic bacteria. Bacterial sequestration was more efficient in blocking colonization at an infectious dose of 10<sup>7</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><bold>Figure 6a</bold></xref>) where bacterial burden was reduced more than 100-fold. At a dose of 10<sup>8</sup> <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, colonization was still significantly inhibited by polymer-induced clustering, albeit the effect was much smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><bold>Figure 6b</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The interaction between bacteria and polycationic molecules plays an important role in nature. Many antimicrobial peptides are polycationic, and their interactions with and impact on bacterial physiology is well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Polycationic synthetic polymers have been researched as a cheaper and more stable alternative to mimic the effect of naturally occurring AMPs, and their design and use in previous studies is often targeted at maximizing their antimicrobial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Recent work has however highlighted the potential of such materials to bind bacteria with the aim to manipulate bacterial behaviors, such as quorum sensing, without impacting bacterial viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In the face of increasing problems with the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains in clinical settings, such strategies, which would potentially provide less selective pressure on the emergence of drug-resistance, become more and more relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). For <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, alternative approaches targeting virulence, rather than bacterial viability, have been the topic of previous research for some time, underpinning the need for novel ways to prevent and treat infections with this globally important human pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Anti-adhesion therapies are often proposed as attractive anti-virulence strategies, that compromise the ability of the pathogen to colonise the host and thus establish an infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Similarly, removal of the pathogen through sequestration is often proposed as a cost-effective approach to decontaminate water sources. However, little is known about <italic>V. cholerae</italic> response to these artificial environments and how binding to these materials may affect regulation of virulence in these pathogens.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we set out to synthesize a set of two polymers with different cationic groups, but identical backbones, to evaluate their impact on bacterial clustering and behavior in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Based on our previous research with <italic>V. harveyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), pAPMAm &#x2013; P1 and pDMAPMAm - P2, were investigated. We anticipated that P1 would present higher toxicity towards both bacteria and host cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). We found that both polymers were able to induce clustering of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> irrespective of their cationic nature, and the clusters quickly became big enough to precipitate out of solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Both polymers had little impact on bacterial growth, viability and membrane permeability, in particular at concentrations below 0.05 mg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Overall, P1 has a bigger effect on bacterial growth and viability than P2, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), but even P1 showed bactericidal activity only at the highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml). Similarly, charge and buffering impacted on eukaryotic membrane integrity, with both P1 and P2 able to disrupt host cell membranes at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4"><bold>Figure S4</bold></xref>). For both materials, this cytotoxicity would result in a narrow therapeutic window, and thus future applications of polymers inducing bacterial clustering by electrostatic interactions alone would likely lean more towards an <italic>ex vivo</italic> preventative application, for example as part of a low-tech water decontamination/filtration strategy. Although this is in itself a promising approach, our future efforts will also focus on the synthesis of materials with decreased toxicities that exhibit high affinity towards the bacteria by other means (e.g. incorporation of natural ligands for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> such as N-acetyl-glucosamine into the polymer). This approach may open up new avenues to extend future applications of such materials towards a prophylactic or therapeutic use in patients.</p>
<p>Infectious <italic>V. cholerae</italic> are often taken up as small biofilms, from which bacteria escape to colonize the epithelium. Once bound, bacteria initiate microcolony formation, before eventually exiting the host&#x2019;s GI tract, often following re-organization into biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), to cause environmental dispersal and onward-transmission. The ability to transition between motile and sessile states is thus key to <italic>V. cholerae</italic>&#x2019;s virulence regulation upon entering the human host and initialization of its colonization programme. Active bacterial motility and induction of virulence factors are both crucially required for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> pathogenesis. In natural environments, the transition of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to a sessile lifestyle and inhibition of motility is accomplished both by transcriptional repression of flagellar genes, as well as induction of extracellular polysaccharide production, both of which are mediated by c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). The cues triggering these motile to sessile transition in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> are still subject to investigations, but recent work showed that both lowered temperatures as well as type IV pili-mediated surface sensing can feed into c-di-GMP signaling and thus biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). With our polymers bacterial motility is also largely abolished, albeit by physical deposition into polymer-based clusters. Interestingly, while both polymers cause immobilization to a similar extent, P1 but not P2 caused transcriptional repression of flagellar genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5"><bold>Figure S5</bold></xref>). This suggests that physicochemical properties of the adhesive surface, rather than the mechanical process of surface sensing alone, also impact the transition to a sessile lifestyle. Interestingly, despite their different effects on gene regulation in response to immobilization, both polymers lead to an increase in bacterial deposition on an abiotic surface upon bacterial clustering, which was accompanied by an increased release in extracellular DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><bold>Figure 3b-d</bold></xref>). This increase would suggest that these polycationic polymers may act as an alternative cue to promote a transition toward a sessile, community-based lifestyle for <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. At the same time, clustering of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lead to a decrease in virulence factors at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4b</bold></xref>). Regulation of virulence genes in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is a complex process and several pathways converge at this point. Crucially, both high cell density, via quorum sensing, and c-di-GMP dependent signaling can act to repress virulence genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Based on the fact that a &#x201C;biofilm-like state&#x201D; is induced by clustering in our system, while quorum sensing leads to HapR-dependent suppression of biofilm formation, we conclude that the transcriptional repression of virulence genes we observe here is triggered by a cue that mimics more closely the transition towards a sessile lifestyle in aquatic environments, rather than high cell density dependent signaling. The net effect of this polymer-induced phenotypical switch towards avirulence is a decrease in colonization and a decrease in cytotoxicity towards cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we evaluated the potential of these dual-action polymers to inhibit infection in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model. Zebrafish are a suitable natural host model for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> colonization and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) as their gastrointestinal development and physiology closely mimics that of mammalian organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Additionally, ease of propagation and live imaging made them a good choice of host for our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Due to license restrictions on the experimental duration in the zebrafish infection model, we were unable to characterize the effect of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> on zebrafish survival. However, the observed decrease in initial colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>) supports the notion that clustering would be an effective way to &#x201C;neutralize&#x201D; <italic>V. cholerae in vivo</italic>. Overall, our results show that the tested materials mainly act to modulate bacterial behavior in a way that positively impacts on the outcome of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>).</p>

<p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> are often ingested as small biofilms, from which they escape to initiate infection of the host intestinal epithelium. Downregulation of biofilm genes and upregulation of virulence genes, such as cholera toxin and toxin-coregulated pilus, are necessary for successful infection.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Here, we have shown that linear polymers that can sequester the human pathogen <italic>V. cholerae</italic> into clusters, downregulate virulence and mitigate colonization and toxicity in relevant <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Using cationic polymers and a combination of phenotypic and transcriptional assays, we demonstrate that this reduction in virulence is a result of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> switching to a non-pathogenic environmental-like phenotype upon clustering. Our observations suggest that polymeric materials can underpin the development of novel cost-effective strategies to minimize <italic>V. cholerae</italic> pathogenicity without promoting antimicrobial resistance. As such we anticipate that these materials can act as a blueprint for the development of novel cost-effective prophylactic or therapeutic polymers, but to this end, a clear understanding of how these materials trigger phenotypic responses in these pathogens is essential. Our efforts to optimize affinity toward <italic>V. cholerae</italic> while minimizing toxicity towards the host will be reported in due course.</p>

<p>Polymers were characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer operating at 300 MHz and fitted with a 5 mm BBFO probe. Chemical shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2</xref>) are reported in ppm (&#x03B4;) referenced to the corresponding solvent signals: DMSO-<italic>d</italic>6 (&#x03B4; = 2.50) and D2O (&#x03B4; = 4.79). GPC was recorded on a Shimadzu Prominence LC-20A, fitted with Shodex Asaphipak GF-510 HQ (300 &#x00D7; 7.5 mm, 5 &#x03BC;m) and GF-310 HQ (300 &#x00D7; 7.5 mm, 5 &#x03BC;m) columns in series, and equipped with a Thermo Fisher Refractomax 521 detector. GPC analysis was carried out using 100 mM acetate buffer at pH 2.9 as eluent at 40 &#x00B0;C and a flow rate of 0.6 mL min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Molecular weights were calculated based on a standard calibration method using polyethylene glycol.</p>

<p><italic>N</italic>-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]methacrylamide (DMAPMAm) (2.2 mL, 12.025 mmol), 2,2&#x0027;-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) (19.6 mg, 0.117 mmol) and 2-mercaptoethanol (4.0 &#x03BC;L, 0.056 mmol) were dissolved in toluene (9.5 mL). This solution was degassed under argon for 10 minutes and then heated at 70 &#x00B0;C under stirring for 18 hours. After this time, the reaction flask was opened to the air and the crude was precipitated twice: first into diethyl ether (200 mL) and then into a diethyl ether/ hexane mixture (1:1) (100 mL). The precipitate was freeze-dried and a crystalline white solid was obtained (1.66 g, 87&#x0025; yield). <sup>1</sup>H-NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-<italic>d</italic>6) &#x03B4; (ppm): 7.51 (br, 1H, CO-NH), 2.96 (br, 2H, CO-NH-<underline>CH<sub>2</sub></underline>), 2.19 (br, 5H, <underline>CH<sub>2</sub></underline>-N-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> &#x002B; CH<sub>3 backbone</sub>), 2.11 (br, 6H, N-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), 1.50 (br, 2H, <underline>CH<sub>2</sub></underline>-CH<sub>2</sub>-N), 0.78 (br, 2H, CH<sub>2 backbone</sub>).

<title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title>
<p><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> strains used in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>) were derived from the El Tor strain N16961 used as parental strain. Strains were propagated at 37 &#x00B0;C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 50 &#x03BC;g/&#x03BC;L spectinomycin, 30 &#x03BC;g/&#x03BC;L kanamycin or 10 &#x03BC;g/&#x03BC;L tetracycline where selection was required. Plasmids were introduced into <italic>V. cholerae</italic> by conjugation, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Briefly, aliquots of overnight cultures of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> N16961, <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5a carrying the desired plasmid (donor) and an <italic>E. coli</italic> SM10 helper strain carrying pRK2013 were mixed at a volumetric ratio of 1:2:2 and spotted onto brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar. Following overnight incubation, spots of bacterial growth were dislodged and suspended in 3 mL of PBS. 100 &#x03BC;L of bacterial suspension were plated onto M9 media containing 50 &#x03BC;g/&#x03BC;L of spectinomycin. Resulting colonies were checked by PCR and sequencing in the case of pRW50-oriT constructs, and also by screening for green fluorescence in the case of pMW-<italic>gfp</italic> transformants.</p>

<title>Imaging and sizing of bacterial clusters</title>
<p>An overnight culture of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> was diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0 in DMEM without phenol red and polymers were added to final concentrations ranging from 0&#x2013;0.5 mg/mL (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3</xref></bold>). For imaging of clusters, aliquots were taken after 15 and 60 min of incubation and mounted with ProLong<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Antifade Gold solution (LifeTechnologies). Cured samples were visualized using a Nikon-Eclipse TE2000-U microscope and Plan Apo 60&#x00D7;/ 1.40 NA oil DIC objective (Nikon) and captured with QICAM Fast1394 camera (Q imaging). Representative images were taken using Nikon NIS-Elements software and prepared with ImageJ and Corel Draw X5 software. The size distribution of bacterial clusters was determined using a Mastersizer 3000 (Malvern) through a period of time of 10 minutes following addition of polymer. P1 was added at 5&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> mg/mL and 5&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> mg/mL with stirring and recorded particle diffraction was plotted as percentage of the particles with a diameter larger than 2 &#x03BC;m. The cutoff size for clusters versus individual bacteria was determined on the median diameter of particles from a sample containing no polymer (2 &#x03BC;m).</p>

<title>Cytotoxicity in Caco-2 cells</title>
<p>Overnight cultures of the GFP-expressing <italic>V. cholerae</italic> were grown in LB at 37 &#x00B0;C. Prior to infection, cultures were adjusted to an MOI of 10 and incubated for 1 hour in 1 mL of DMEM without phenol red and polymers as indicated, at 30 &#x00B0;C. Caco-2 cells were washed with PBS to remove media containing antibiotics and infections were started by transferring the solution of bacteria into the wells. Plates were centrifuged at 1000x g for 5 min at 20 &#x00B0;C to synchronize the infections. After an incubation of 7 hours at 37 &#x00B0;C under 5&#x0025; CO2, supernatants were used to measure lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity using LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Takara Clonetech) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The data was expressed as percentage of cytotoxicity, normalized to untreated cells (0&#x0025;) and 0.1&#x0025; Triton X-100 lysed cells (100&#x0025; lysis) and was calculated according to the formula: &#x0025; cytotoxicity=100 x ([OD490 for experimental release - OD490 for spontaneous release]/ [OD490 for maximum release&#x2013; OD490 for spontaneous release]).</p>

<title>Imaging of infected Caco-2 cells and zebrafish embryos</title>
<p>In the case of samples for imaging, Caco-2 cells were seeded onto sterilized glass cover slips inserted into wells of the plate. Imaging of infected Caco-2 cells was done by fixing the samples with 4&#x0025; formaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes and then washing with PBS. Cells were permeabilized by adding 0.1&#x0025; Triton X-100 in PBS and incubation at room temperature for 5 minutes, and washed three times with PBS. Samples were stained with 10 &#x03BC;g/mL Hoechst and 66 ng/mL of rhodamine-phalloidin in the dark for 10 minutes to visualize DNA and F-actin, respectively. Staining was followed by three washing steps with PBS (5 minutes each). Samples were mounted using antifade gold mounting solution (Life-Technologies) and cured overnight at 22 &#x00B0;C prior to visualization. Visualization of zebrafish embryos was done by directly mounting the embryos in 0.4&#x0025; low melting point agarose containing 160 &#x03BC;g/mL of Tricaine-S.
