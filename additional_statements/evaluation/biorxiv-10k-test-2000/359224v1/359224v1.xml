<sec>
<title>Motivation</title>
<p>Relief is a family of machine learning algorithms that uses nearest-neighbors to select features whose association with an outcome may be due to epistasis or statistical interactions with other features in high-dimensional data. Relief-based estimators are non-parametric in the statistical sense that they do not have a parameterized model with an underlying probability distribution for the estimator, making it difficult to determine the statistical significance of Relief-based attribute estimates. Thus, a statistical inferential formalism is needed to avoid imposing arbitrary thresholds to select the most important features.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We reconceptualize the Relief-based feature selection algorithm to create a new family of STatistical Inference Relief (STIR) estimators that retains the ability to identify interactions while incorporating sample variance of the nearest neighbor distances into the attribute importance estimation. This variance permits the calculation of statistical significance of features and adjustment for multiple testing of Relief-based scores. Specifically, we develop a pseudo t-test version of Relief-based algorithms for case-control data.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We demonstrate the statistical power and control of type I error of the STIR family of feature selection methods on a panel of simulated data that exhibits properties reflected in real gene expression data, including main effects and network interaction effects. We compare the performance of STIR when the adaptive radius method is used as the nearest neighbor constructor with STIR when the fixed-<italic>k</italic> nearest neighbor constructor is used. We apply STIR to real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder and discuss its straightforward extension to genome-wide association studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epistasis is a well known concept in genetics that can be statistically modeled as a deviation from the additive effect of DNA variants on a phenotype or trait. A similar effect can be observed at the gene expression level, where the phenotypic effect of one gene is modified depending on the expression of another gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Park and Lehner (2013)</xref>). A manifestation of this &#x201C;expression-epistasis&#x201D; effect is differential co-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Lareau etal. (2015)</xref>). The embedding of these interactions in a regulatory network may lead to, not only pairwise interactions, but also higher-order epistasis network effects. Thus, feature selection methods are needed for high-dimensional data &#x2013; such as genome-wide association and gene expression studies &#x2013; that are able to identify relevant features when their effect on a phenotype may be obscured by a complex interaction architecture.</p>
<p>Relief-based feature selection methods are known for their ability to identify interactions with computational efficiency based on nearest neighbor calculations in the high-dimensional feature space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Urbanowicz et al. (2017c)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Kononenko et al. (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">McKinney et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Kira and Rendell (1992)</xref>). The early Relief-based algorithms used arbitrary parameter choices for the number of nearest neighbors and heuristic Relief-score thresholds for selecting the most important features. Recent work has been done to address the selection of the number of nearest neighbors, such as the constant neighborhood radius in spatially uniform ReliefF (SURF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Greene et al. (2009)</xref>), adaptive radii in multiSURF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Urbanowicz et al. (2017a)</xref>) and feature-specific optimal k in ReliefSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">McKinney et al. (2013)</xref>). However, until the current study, the threshold for selecting the top variables has remained arbitrary because Relief scores have not had a null distribution.</p>
<p>Methods like ANOVA and the generalized linear model have parametric probability distribution assumptions that easily and efficiently permit the calculation of p-values. However, these methods are not able to detect interactions unless each interaction term is explicitly included in the model. Explicit interaction modeling becomes computationally intractable for high-dimensional data and/or higher-order interactions due to the combinatorial explosion of hypothesis tests. Relief-based methods circumvent the combinatorial explosion in the following way. When updating the importance of a single attribute, the Relief-based algorithm uses values of that attribute from each instance&#x2019;s nearest neighbors, where the nearest neighbors are determined in the space of <italic>all</italic> attributes. In other words, when estimating the importance of a feature, the nearest neighbors are modeling a hyper-dimensional decision boundary in the full feature space.</p>
<p>Relief-based methods are, thus, an excellent tool for detecting interactions, but, as noted, there remains the challenge of determining statistical thresholds or statistical significance. With the aim of addressing this challenge, we recently developed a mixture model and a permutation approach to estimate statistical thresholds for ReliefF and network centrality scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Lareau et al. (2015)</xref>). However, permutation testing can be computationally prohibitive. To address this issue, in the current study we introduce a new family of Relief-based algorithms that allows for statistical inference and false discovery rate adjustment.</p>
<p>The new STatistical Inference of Relief (STIR) formalism represents a new type of Relief-based score that follows a pseudo t-distribution. Presaging STIR, we recently demonstrated that scores from the standard Relief algorithm are equivalent to a difference of mean attribute value differences between nearest hit and miss groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">McKinney etal. (2013)</xref>). This equivalence suggests a reformulation of Relief scores that accounts for the variance within and between groups. STIR in the current study is able to detect attributes whose association with the phenotype may be due to higher-order interactions while simultaneously assigning statistical significance to the attribute scores. The STIR formalism applies to the broad family of Relief-based algorithms, including Relief with fixed k and multiSURF.</p>
<p>The paper is organized as follows. In the Methods section, we develop the new formalism of STIR that enables the calculation of the STIR pseudo t-statistics (STIR scores) and statistical significance of these scores. We discuss our simulation strategy involving main effects and realistic network interaction effects of varying strengths, sample sizes, and number of attributes. In the Results section, we apply the STIR method to the panel of simulated data to assess power and false discovery rates. We use STIR to obtain FDR-adjusted statistical significance levels and compare with permutation testing. We compare STIR using <italic>k</italic> neighbors (constant for each instance) with multiSURF (variable for each instance) as the Relief-based nearest-neighbor algorithms. We apply STIR to a real RNA-Seq dataset from a study of major depressive disorder, and we note that STIR also applies to GWAS data. In the Conclusion section, we discuss challenges and opportunities for further development of the new STIR family of feature selection algorithms.</p>

<p>In this section, we develop the mathematical formalism for computing the statistical significance of Relief-based scores for feature selection for binary-class (case-control) data. We generalize the STIR formalism to all current nearest-neighbor methods, discuss the relationship between multiSURF and fixed-<italic>k</italic> methods, and demonstrate how the reformulation of Relief-based algorithms can be used to improve the performance of the algorithms.</p>

<title>Diff function and nearest neighbors</title>
<p>Before importance scores can be computed for each attribute, Relief-based algorithms identify the nearest neighbors in the space all attributes. The distance between instances <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>R<sub>j</sub></italic> is calculated in the space of all attributes <italic>a</italic> &#x03F5; <italic>A</italic>, typically using a Manhattan (<italic>p</italic> = 1) metric but may also use a Euclidean (<italic>p</italic> = 2) metric:
<disp-formula id="eqn1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where the standard &#x201C;diff&#x201D; function between two instances <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>R<sub>j</sub></italic> for a real valued attribute <italic>a</italic> is:
<disp-formula id="eqn2"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>This diff is appropriate for gene expression and other real-valued predictors. For genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, where attributes are categorical, one simply modifies the diff, but the rest of the algorithm is otherwise unchanged. The diff function is part of the metric used by Relief methods to compute the distance matrix for finding nearest hit and miss neighbors, but the diff is also essential for computing the Relief importance scores, as will be seen in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2a3">Sec. 2.1.3</xref>.</p>

<title>Hit and miss nearest-neighbor ordered pairs</title>
<p>For general Relief-based algorithms, one may represent the set of ordered pairs (<italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>M<sub>ji</sub></italic>(<italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>)), or simply (<italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>M<sub>ji</sub></italic>), of <italic>m</italic> instances <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic> (<italic>i</italic> = 1,&#x2026;, <italic>m</italic>) with their nearest <italic>k<sub>M<sub>i</sub></sub></italic> misses, <italic>M<sub>j<sub>i</sub></sub></italic>, as nested sets:
<disp-formula id="eqn3"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where the index <italic>j<sub>i</sub></italic> for the inner set ranges from 1 to <italic>k<sub>M<sub>i</sub></sub></italic>, which is the number of nearest miss neighbors for subject <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>. The outer set ranges over all <italic>m</italic> instances. Similarly for hits, the set of ordered pairs (<italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>H<sub>j<sub>i</sub></sub></italic> (<italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>)) of <italic>m</italic> instances <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic> (<italic>i</italic> = 1,&#x2026;, <italic>m</italic>) with their <italic>k<sub>H<sub>i</sub></sub></italic> nearest hits, <italic>H<sub>j<sub>i</sub></sub></italic>, may be written as
<disp-formula id="eqn4"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Note that in both miss and hit sets, the inner index <italic>j<sub>i</sub></italic> depends on the outer index <italic>i</italic>. This is important for multiSURF, where each instance <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic> will, in general, have a different number of misses and hits (<italic>k<sub>M<sub>i</sub></sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>H<sub>i</sub></sub></italic>) and these values may differ between instances. Thus, for multiSURF, the sets <italic>M</italic> and <italic>H</italic> can be thought of as irregular or ragged matrices of ordered pairs. For ReliefF algorithms, where the number of neighbors is constant across subjects, the hit and miss matrices are proper (non-ragged) matrices of ordered pairs.</p>

<title>Reformulation of Relief-based estimators as difference of hit and miss means</title>
<p>Once the hit and miss groups, <italic>H</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. 4</xref>) and <italic>M</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref>), are determined by the distance matrix <italic>D<sub>ij</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref>), coupled with a neighborhood definition (<italic>e.g.</italic>, ReliefF fixed number of neighbors <italic>k</italic> or multiSURF instance-dependent radius), we can compute average hit and miss diff means and attribute importance weights. We showed in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">McKinney et al. (2013)</xref>) that the ReliefF importance weight for an attribute, <italic>a</italic>, can be expressed as a difference of mean diffs between hit and miss groups. Here we extend this difference to any Relief-based neighborhood scheme.</p>
<p>The mean diff for attribute <italic>a</italic> averaged over of all pairs of nearest-neighbor misses <italic>M</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref>) can be expressed as
<disp-formula id="eqn5"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>M<sub>j<sub>i</sub></sub></italic> is the <italic>j</italic><sup>th</sup> nearest neighbor from different classes of the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> instance, <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>, and <italic>k<sub>M<sub>i</sub></sub></italic> is the number of nearest miss neighbors of instance <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>. This scaling by 1/<italic>k<sub>M<sub>i</sub></sub></italic> inside the sum makes the neighborhood average weighting consistent with multiSURF and with uniform neighborhood methods like SURF and ReliefF. For nearest neighbor hits, the mean is
<disp-formula id="eqn6"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn6.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where, similarly, <italic>k<sub>H<sub>i</sub></sub></italic> is the number of nearest hit neighbors of instance <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic>. The Relief-based importance score can then be expressed simply as
<disp-formula id="eqn7"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn7.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The formulation as a difference applies to any Relief-based algorithm. We will use <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq. (7)</xref> as the basis for computing permutation p-values for comparison purposes. However, as noted, permutation can have prohibitive computational times, and, thus, in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2b">Sec. 2.2</xref>, we extend <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq. (7)</xref> to develop a Relief-based pseudo t-test and a more computationally efficient means of computing statistical significance of attributes.</p>

<title>Optimization with reformulation and ReliefF limits of general formalism</title>
<p>In our implementation of STIR on <monospace>R</monospace> ver. 3.4.4, we reshape all |<italic>M</italic>| and |<italic>H</italic>| ordered miss and hit pairs, <italic>M</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref>) and <italic>H</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. 4</xref>), into |<italic>M</italic>| &#x00D7; 2 and |<italic>H</italic>| &#x00D7; 2 matrices to take advantage of <monospace>R</monospace>&#x2019;s fast vectorization capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The reformulated algorithm may be optimized by pre-computing the neighborhood matrices <italic>H</italic> and <italic>M</italic> (Algorithm 2, line 7) and vectorizing the diff function so that we can simply perform vector subtraction (Algorithm 2, lines 10 and 11) and bypass the two nested <monospace>for</monospace> loops in the original algorithm (Algorithm 1, lines 9-11) in the calculation of the weight for each attribute. The description of the reformulated algorithm is simplified and allows for vectorization, which has a performance advantage over for loops in <monospace>R</monospace>.</p>

<title>Beyond Relief-based estimators: STatistical Inference for Relief (STIR)</title>
<p>We now introduce a new type of Relief-based score that incorporates the pooled standard deviations about the mean hit and miss diffs to transform the Relief-based score (<italic>W<sub>R</sub></italic>) into a pseudo t-statistic. For attribute <italic>a</italic>, we construct the following STIR weight (or STIR score) from the Relief difference of means (<italic>W<sub>R</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq. 7</xref>) in the numerator and the standard error in the denominator:
<disp-formula id="eqn10"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn10.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="359224_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="359224_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> are the total number of miss and hit neighbors across all instances. The pooled standard deviation is
<disp-formula id="eqn11"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn11.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
and the group variances are
<disp-formula id="eqn12"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn12.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
and
<disp-formula id="eqn13"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="359224_eqn13.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The pooled standard deviation above allows for unequal variances in the hit and miss nearest neighbor diffs and allows for a different number of diffs in the hit and miss groups, which is common for multiSURF. For Relief with fixed neighbors <italic>k</italic>, the above equations can be simplified by letting <italic>k<sub>M<sub>i</sub></sub></italic> = <italic>k<sub>H<sub>i</sub></sub></italic> = <italic>k</italic> and |<italic>M</italic>| = |<italic>H</italic>| = <italic>mk</italic>. The <italic>W</italic><sub>STIR</sub> score (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10">Eq. 10</xref>) approximately follows a t-distribution from which we compute p-values. We use <italic>df</italic> = |<italic>M</italic>| &#x002B; |<italic>H</italic>| &#x2212; 2 as the degrees of freedom for calculating the p-value.</p>
<p>We highlight that STIR applies to any Relief-based algorithm. In this work, we focus on two different approaches for the neighbor finding algorithm (ReliefF and multiSURF) for use in STIR. ReliefF requires the user to specify a fixed <italic>k</italic> while multiSURF uses a neighborhood radius that varies for each instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Urbanowicz et al. (2017a)</xref>). In multiSURF, the radius for each instance is the average of all distances of the instance to all other instances. The multiSURF method counts another instance as a neighbor if it is within this average radius. The expected value of all Manhattan (L-1) distances between pairs of <italic>m</italic> random points in a <italic>p</italic>-dimensional unit hypercube is <italic>p</italic>/3. We show empirically that, given two simulation scenarios of balanced datasets, an approximation to the expected number of neighbors within the multiSURF radius is <italic>k</italic> = <italic>m</italic>/6. We show that the performance of STIR<sub><italic>k=m/6</italic></sub> closely follows that of STIR-multiSURF.</p>

<title>Simulation methods</title>
<p>To address power and false positive performance of STIR, we use the simulation tool from our private Evaporative Cooling (pEC) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Le et al. (2017)</xref>). This tool was designed to simulate realistic main effects, correlations, and interactions that one would expect in gene expression or resting-state fMRI data. In the current study, we first simulate main effect data with <italic>m</italic> = 100 subjects (50 cases and 50 controls) and <italic>p</italic> = 1000 real-valued attributes with 10&#x0025; functional (true positive association with outcome). We chose a sample size consistent with real gene expression data but on the smaller end to demonstrate a more challenging scenario. Similarly, an effect size bias of <italic>b</italic> = 0.8 was selected to be sufficiently challenging with power approximately 40&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Le et al. (2017)</xref>). More details on the theoretical relationship between power and the simulation parameters is provided in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Le etal. (2017)</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of Relief-based methods is the ability to detect statistical interactions. Thus, our second type of simulation uses the differential co-expression network-based simulation tool in pEC to simulate interactions. Full details of the simulation approach can be found in Refs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Le etal. (2017)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Lareau etal. (2015)</xref>). Briefly, we simulate <italic>m</italic> = 100 samples and <italic>p</italic> = 1000 attributes with 10&#x0025; targeted for interaction. Starting with a dataset of random normal expression levels, we induce a co-expression network with Erd&#x0151;s-R&#x00E9;nyi connectivity by making connected genes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>g<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>g<sub>j</sub></italic>) have a linear dependence (<italic>g<sub>j</sub></italic> = <italic>g<sub>i</sub></italic> &#x002B; <italic>s<sub>int</sub></italic>) with average correlation noise <italic>s<sub>int</sub></italic>. A <italic>lower</italic> value of <italic>s<sub>int</sub></italic> yields <italic>higher</italic> average co-expression and thus <italic>higher</italic> average interaction effect size.</p>
<p>The interaction is enforced by randomly targeting 10&#x0025; of the attributes and permuting their values within the group of instances designated as cases. By permuting the values of the gene in cases, no main effect is created but the co-expression between the gene&#x2019;s connections is destroyed in the case group, creating differential co-expression or interaction effects with that gene&#x2019;s connections. We chose the 10&#x0025; of targets randomly, which means that a few attributes may not have correlation with other attributes and hence may not actually be functional. On the other hand, other target attributes may be highly interconnected and, hence, may be involved in high-order interactions. This complexity makes assessing true/false positives/negatives challenging; however, our goal is to simulate realistic data and the 10&#x0025; of targets is a reasonable surrogate for true associations. We use a relatively challenging interaction effect size <italic>s</italic><sub>int</sub> = 0.4. See Ref. (Le etal. (2017)) for further discussion of main effect and interaction effect sizes.</p>

<title>Real-world dataset</title>
<p>We used an RNA-Seq study of 462 major depressive disorder (MDD) subjects and 452 healthy controls (HC) (Mostafavi et al. (2014)) to assess the performance of STIR. This dataset consists of whole blood RNA-Seq measurements of 15,231 genes in all subjects. Sequencing yielded an average of 70 million reads per individual, and gene expression levels were quantified from reads of 21,578 annotated protein-coding genes, followed by low read-count removal and adjustment for technical and biological covariate effects (Mostafavi et al. (2014)). To avoid potential gender confounding in gene discoveries, we selected only female individuals from the original dataset, resulting in 360 MDD and 282 HC.</p>

<title>Performance metrics</title>
<p>We compare the performance of STIR across Relief-based methods with permutation test as well as univariate t-test in both main and interaction effect simulations. We choose a univariate t-test as a comparison method for main effect simulations because it gauges the effect size and the t-test is an effective standard approach for analyzing gene expression without multiple conditions or covariates. Specifically, an attribute is considered functional if its mean values from two different outcome groups are significantly different from each other. Moreover, the STIR p-values are analogous to a t-test. STIR p-values are simply computed from a t-test distribution from each attribute&#x2019;s STIR score (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10">Eq. 10</xref>). Relief-based permutation p-values are computed based on the reformulated Relief-based score (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq. 7</xref>). For permutation, we first compute the observed score for each attribute. We then permute the class label 10,000 times, recomputing attribute scores for each permuted dataset. The fraction of permutations for which the observed score exceeds the permuted score is the attribute&#x2019;s p-value.</p>
<p>All resulting p-values (STIR, permutation, and univariate t-test) are adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Benjamini et al. (2001)</xref>). Attributes with adjusted p-values less than 0.05 are counted as a positive test (null hypothesis rejected), else the test is negative. We assess the performance of each method by averaging the following performance metrics across 100 replicates of each simulation scenario: True Negative Rate (TNR), Precision, and Recall of the statistical tests. We remind the reader of the following definitions applied for the detected attributes

<title>Comparison of the performance of STIR with Relief-based permutation</title>
<p>Our first aim is to determine whether the more computationally efficient pseudo t-test approach of STIR is a reliable alternative to a model-free permutation test. We use multiSURF as the neighborhood algorithm in STIR, but constant <italic>k</italic> algorithms are expected to perform similarly (see succeeding subsection). Using an FDR adjusted p-value threshold <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> = 0.05, we observe that STIR (<bold>orange</bold>) and permutation (<bold>blue</bold>) indeed perform nearly the same in both main effect and interaction effect simulations in terms of True Negatives, Precision, and Recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). For completeness and to provide an indicator of power, we also compare STIR with the performance of a univariate t-test (green). For main effect simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>), all methods have a similarly low Recall because the simulated main effect size and sample size were chosen to be relatively low and challenging.</p>

<p>As we discuss more in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3b">Sec. 3.2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), for main effects, it is possible to further increase the Recall of STIR beyond a univariate t-test if one uses STIR with ReliefF and a larger <italic>k</italic> (up to the maximum <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="359224_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>; however, this <italic>k</italic> would cause a decrease in performance for interactions relative to STIR with lower values of <italic>k</italic>. The multiSURF neighborhood constitutes a compromise between main effect and interaction effect performance, as we explore more below.</p>

</fig>
<p>For interaction simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>), the t-test still has a similarly high True Negative Rate to STIR. However, this high rate is because no t-tests are true positive: there are no main effects and the t-test has zero Precision and Recall. STIR on the other hand still has high Precision and Recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>) because Relief-based methods are sensitive to interactions among attributes (provided the number of neighbors is not too large).</p>

<title>The effect of <italic>k</italic> in detecting functional attributes</title>
<p>Our next aim is to gain insight into the performance of STIR with a ReliefF neighborhood (fixed <italic>k</italic> neighbors) and how its performance relates to STIR with a multiSURF neighborhood (adaptive radius). In the main effect simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>), as <italic>k</italic> increases, STIR gains more power to detect the functional attributes (increasing Recall) and with an expected increase in false positive attributes (decreasing Precision). The increasing Recall with <italic>k</italic> is expected for main effects because ReliefF becomes more myopic (more like a univariate t-test) as <italic>k</italic> increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Robnik-&#x0160;ikonja and Kononenko (2003)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">McKinney et al. (2013)</xref>). The increase in Recall is limited in part by the maximum number of neighbors being <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="359224_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>In contrast, for interaction simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>), the relationship between <italic>k</italic> and Recall is no longer monotonic. Rather, the Recall reaches a maximum at approximately <italic>k</italic> = <italic>m</italic>/6 and this performance is similar to using the adaptive radius in multiSURF. As <italic>k</italic> increases beyond <italic>k</italic> = <italic>m</italic>/6 to the maximum <italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub>, ReliefF becomes more myopic and has nearly zero Precision and Recall. This result corroborates the findings in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Urbanowicz et al. (2017a)</xref> that multiSURF is sensitive to two or three-way interactions. However, we also note that the STIR-ReliefF with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="359224_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> results are similar to STIR-multiSURF for main effect and interaction effect simulations (because the average <italic>k</italic> in multiSURF is close to <italic>m</italic>/6). These versions of STIR will yield similar results for balanced data that are optimal for detecting interactions while being reasonably powerful for main effects. STIRf<sub><italic>k</italic>=<italic>m</italic>/6</sub> has a computational speed advantage over STIR-multiSURF, but STIR-multiSURF may have an advantage when there is class imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Urbanowicz et al. (2017a)</xref>). If one wanted to optimize the sensitivity of STIR for main effects and neglect interactions, one would use STIR<sub><italic>k</italic>=<italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub></sub>. Furthermore, in all simulation scenarios, the correlation values of STIR scores (pseudo t-statistic) and the original Relief-based scores (diff function) are above 0.98 (see Supplement Fig. 1 for more detail).</p>

<title>Real-world data</title>
<p>We apply STIR-multiSURF to the RNA-Seq study of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Ref. Mostafavi et al. (2014). Using an FDR threshold of 0.05, STIR detected 22 statistically significant associations out of 15,231 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Meanwhile, with the same FDR threshold of 0.05, a Welch two-sample t-test did not identify any significant associations between gene expression levels and MDD (the original study with additional samples increased the FDR to 0.25 to detect associations).</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float" orientation="portrait">

<graphic xlink:href="359224_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Reproducing associations from the original study is not feasible because we focused on female subjects to avoid confounding (using 360 MDD and 282 controls) and Relief-based methods are currently not adept at correcting for covariates. However, we note that the top STIR association, Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier I (MPC1), also known as Brain Protein 44-Like (BRP44L), forms a heterocomplex with MPC2 to mediate uptake of pyruvate into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Herzig et al. (2012)</xref>). This interaction is noteworthy because MPC2 contains a variant that is associated with Schizophrenia in GWAS of East Asians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Xiao and Li (2016)</xref>). While an association with Schizophrenia seems indirect to MDD, symptom complexes such as anhedonia and psychosis can be shared across psychiatric disorders (Lee et al. (2013)).</p>
<p>Albeit beyond the scope of the current study, STIR feature selection could be embedded in a nested cross-validation approach or private evaporative cooling to learn a classifier for MDD. Characterization of interactions could also be performed to create an expression-epistasis network from the STIR MDD genes (McKinney etal. (2009); Lareau etal. (2015)) and help identify underlying mechanisms of MDD susceptibility. Using the STIR genes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, we predicted a functional interaction network (Supplement Fig. 2) with the Integrative Multi-species Prediction Tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Wong et al. (2015)</xref>). Functional interactions were predicted between STIR MDD genes MED29 and MED19 in a cluster of other MED genes. STIR gene B4GALT7 was also predicted to be in this MED cluster, and the STIR gene NIPSNAP3A connects clusters of other STIR genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, STIR is the first method to use a theoretical distribution to calculate the statistical significance of Relief attribute scores without the computational expense of permutation. Previously, it was difficult to assess the false discovery rate of Relief-based attribute lists because arbitrary thresholds were used. STIR is able to report statistical significance of Relief-based scores by a pseudo t-test that accounts for variance in the mean difference of miss and hit nearest neighbor diffs. We assessed STIR&#x2019;s power and ability to control false positives using realistic simulations with main effects and network interactions. We applied STIR to real data to demonstrate the identification of biologically relevant genes.</p>
<p>We show that the statistical performance using STIR p-values is the same as using permutation p-values. This validates the STIR pseudo t-test and means one can use it instead of costly permutation testing. We chose the number of permutation to be 10,000 to minimize the computational expense while obtaining accurate permutation p-values. Specifically, if only 1,000 permutations were performed, the p-values would be bounded below by 0.001, which would lead to an inflation of insignificant tests after FDR correction (<italic>p<sub>adj</sub></italic> &#x003E; 0.05) in simulated datasets with 1,000 attributes. Nevertheless, 10,000 permutations requires considerable computation time, especially inlarge datasets such as the analyzed gene expression data. Hence, by showing very similar performance to permutation, STIR shows an efficient implementation to compute the p-value for each attribute while producing scores that are highly correlated with the standard Relief-based scores.</p>
<p>We showed the STIR formalism generalizes to all Relief-based neighbor finding algorithms, including MultiSURF. We show that STIR-MultiSURF and STIR<sub><italic>k</italic>=<italic>m</italic>/6</sub> perform similarly for main effect and interaction simulations. This suggests that one may prefer to use constant-<italic>k</italic> STIR<sub><italic>k</italic>=<italic>m</italic>/6</sub> for the computational speed advantage; however, we have not tested the statistical performance for imbalanced data. Our results suggest that power for detecting interactions is maximized near <italic>k</italic> = <italic>m</italic>/6 (higher or lower <italic>k</italic> decreases the power). Power for detecting main effects is highest with the myopic maximum <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="359224_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Real biological data will likely contain a mixture of main effects and epistasis network effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Mckinney and Pajewski (2012)</xref>). The value <italic>k</italic> = <italic>m</italic>/6 is a good compromise because it maximizes the radius for detecting interactions while still giving reasonable power for detecting main effects. However, the STIR formalism may help tune the elements of an attribute-specific <italic>k</italic> vector, where each attribute, <italic>a</italic>, is allowed to use a different <italic>k<sub>a</sub></italic> to preferentially detect a main effect or interaction effect as informed by the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">McKinney et al. (2013)</xref>). For those using a constant-<italic>k</italic> (ReliefF) approach, our results suggest that using <italic>k</italic> = <italic>m</italic>/6 may offer a better default than the pervasive use of <italic>k</italic> = 10, which was an arbitrary choice in the early literature.</p>
<p>Our simulation study focuses on obtaining a quality assessment of statistically significant STIR associations between an attribute and the outcome while taking into account the complex underlying architecture of interactions among attributes. Therefore, the simulation is designed to generate realistic and challenging datasets leading to relatively low Recall. In datasets with larger sample size (<italic>m</italic> = 200), we observe higher Recall values but otherwise similar findings as presented in the Results section (results for <italic>m</italic> = 200 not shown). Furthermore, from a machine learning point of view, if the researcher wishes to include more attributes in their subsequent analysis, they may increase the FDR threshold to allow for more false positives and improve the Recall value. A future study that analyzes this Recall/Precision trade-off would prove valuable in understanding statistical characteristics of selected features from Relief-based methods.</p>
<p>The STIR score improves the standard Relief-based scores because, rather than simply being a difference of means, STIR incorporates within and between group variances. Moreover, this pseudo t-test score can be transformed into a p-value. The advancement of STIR over Relief-based scores is similar to going from a fold change to describe differential expression to a t-test. The assumptions of a t-test &#x2013; independent observations and normality of the population distributions &#x2013; are not satisfied for the STIR test in general, which is why we refer to it as a pseudo t-test. When the average number of neighbors k is sufficiently large, duplicate pairs will occur in the estimate of the average hit and miss diffs. The dependence induced by duplicate neighbors may increase the false positive rate because the variance estimates are narrowed, the STIR statistics inflated, and the p-values deflated. One could simply remove duplicates; however, the duplicates are beneficial with respect to power because they add weight to pairs of instances that are very similar to each other. The effect of duplicates has a similar effect as a distance-based weighting scheme such as the exponential decaying influence of neighboring instances used in some Relief-based algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Robnik-&#x0160;ikonja and Kononenko (2003)</xref>).</p>
<p>A related approach to reduce the dependence-induced false positive rate is to perform sub-sampling of the neighbor pairs, which reduces duplicates but maintains some distance-based weighting. An alternative approach would be to incorporate variance regularization into the STIR statistic to inflate the variance to a level consistent with independent neighbors. Despite the dependence of neighbors, our empirical results show that, even when unmodified, the STIR pseudo t-test shows comparable performance with permutation test in both simulation scenarios with main and interaction effects.</p>
<p>Transformations such as the square root help increase the normality of the distribution of distances. However, to stay close to the original Relief score formula, we did not transform the distance values in the results shown here, but the transformation is provided as an option via the <monospace>transform</monospace> parameter of the STIR function in our software. Preliminary analysis indicates little difference when transformation is applied (results not shown).</p>
<p>It has been shown that Relief-based algorithms benefit from the iterative removal of the worst attributes and then repeating the estimation of the remaining attributes. Thus, another future direction is to develop a strategy for STIR that incorporates iterative attribute removal in a way that minimizes the false positives due to iteration-induced multiple testing. Effective strategies also must be developed for testing for replication of significant STIR effects because typical replications do not have dependence among other features, whereas Relief scores depend on the context of other variables in the data.</p>
<p>Extensions of STIR will involve multi-class data, quantitative trait data (regression) and correction for covariates. Just as an ANOVA extends the t-test to multiple conditions, we anticipate the extension of STIR to multi-state will involve an ANOVA formalism and F-test. Similarly, we envision regression-STIR to follow a linear model formalism. The current implementation of STIR does not deal with missing data. In a future implementation, we will modify the diff to estimate the probability that two instances (one or both possibly missing) have different values conditioned on their class. Application to GWAS data requires no additional modifications other than specification of a different diff function for categorical variables. Future studies will apply STIR to GWAS as well as eQTL and other high dimensional data to identify interaction effects.</p>
