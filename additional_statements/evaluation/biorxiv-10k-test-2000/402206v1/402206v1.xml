<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The response of ATP-sensitive K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channels (K<sub>ATP</sub>) to cellular metabolism is coordinated by three classes of nucleotide binding site (NBS). We used a novel approach involving labeling of intact channels in a native, membrane environment with a non-canonical fluorescent amino acid and measurement (using FRET with fluorescent nucleotides) of steady-state and time-resolved nucleotide binding to dissect the role of NBS2 of the accessory SUR1 subunit of K<sub>ATP</sub> in channel gating. Binding to NBS2 was Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-independent, but Mg was required to trigger a conformational change in SUR1. Mutation of a lysine (K1384A) in NBS2 that coordinates bound nucleotides increased the EC<sub>50</sub> for trinitrophenyl-ADP binding to NBS2, but only in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, suggesting that this mutation disrupts the ligand-induced conformational change. Comparison of nucleotide-binding with ionic currents suggests a model in which each nucleotide binding event to NBS2 of SUR1 is independent and promotes K<sub>ATP</sub> activation by the same amount.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>ATP-sensitive K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channel (K<sub>ATP</sub>) closure initiates the electrical response of pancreatic &#x03B2;-cells to metabolic changes induced by increased extracellular glucose<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. K<sub>ATP</sub>&#x2019;s metabolic sensitivity is accomplished through the coordinated activity of three classes of intracellular adenine nucleotide binding site (NBS), one inhibitory and two stimulatory. Despite the recent publication of several cryo-EM structures of K<sub>ATP</sub> showing these NBSs at near atomic resolution<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, the detailed mechanism by which energetic contributions from nucleotide binding to each site sum to affect channel gating remains obscure. K<sub>ATP</sub> is formed by four inward-rectifier K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channel subunits (Kir6.2 in &#x03B2;-cells)<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, each associated with a modulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1 in &#x03B2;-cells)<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The inhibitory NBS of K<sub>ATP</sub> is located on Kir6.2<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and clearly resolved in several of the cryo-EM structures<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Like other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, SUR1 has two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), which associate to form two NBSs at the dimer interface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. These mediate K<sub>ATP</sub> activation by Mg-nucleotides<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. SUR1 also confers inhibition by antidiabetic sulfonylureas (SUs) and activation by K<sub>ATP</sub>-specific K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channel openers (KCOs)<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Gating of K<sub>ATP</sub> is a complex function of the intrinsic opening and closing of the channel pore and the converging influences of the excitatory and inhibitory NBSs. Mutations that directly disrupt the NBSs or their ability to transduce nucleotide occupancy to the pore result in diseases of insulin secretion<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. It is crucial to our understanding of K<sub>ATP</sub> to be able to independently measure (i) the occupancy of each NBS in real time, (ii) the effect each NBS has on K<sub>ATP</sub> conformation, and (iii) how binding to each NBS affects channel open probability (P<sub>open</sub>). Electrophysiology, radioligand binding, and ATPase assays have provided rich mechanistic insight into K<sub>ATP</sub> gating. However, the ultimate readout of such studies is a function of nucleotide binding to all three NBSs as well as the conformational equilibria affected by binding. Photoaffinity labeling studies enable binding to each NBS to be separated, and some determination of their affinity and specificity, but require partially purified proteins, long incubation times, and involve irreversible covalent labeling<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>An ideal method to separate the nucleotide interactions at each class of site on K<sub>ATP</sub> would have high spatial (specific for a single NBS) and temporal resolution, would require only small amounts of protein, could be used in a native environment (i.e. the cell or plasma membrane), and would operate under conditions compatible with electrophysiological experiments. We have developed a novel approach for studying ligand binding that fits these criteria. K<sub>ATP</sub> was labeled with the fluorescent non-canonical amino acid L-3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropionic acid (ANAP)<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and binding of fluorescent, trinitrophenyl (TNP) nucleotide derivatives was measured using FRET. This enabled us to parse the individual contribution of NBS2 to nucleotide binding/channel gating and has provided insight into the mechanism by which Mg-nucleotides affect the conformation of SUR1, and the effect this conformational change has on P<sub>open</sub>.</p>

<p>Binding of nucleotides to NBS2 is believed to stimulate K<sub>ATP</sub> activation<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. ANAP was introduced at position Y1353 (Y1353&#x002A;) of NBS2 using a transfectable amber codon suppression system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and fluorescence emission spectra were acquired from &#x201C;unroofed&#x201D; membrane fragments expressing SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>; <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. In the nucleotide-bound structures of K<sub>ATP</sub>, the aromatic ring of Y1353 forms a &#x03C0;-stacking interaction with the adenine ring of ADP<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To probe nucleotide binding to K<sub>ATP</sub>, we measured FRET between SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 and fluorescent TNP-nucleotides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,d,e</xref>). The absorbance spectra of TNP nucleotides overlap with the emission spectrum of SUR1-Y1353&#x002A; (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2a</xref>), making them suitable FRET partners. <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2b</xref> shows the calculated distance dependence of FRET between SUR1-Y1353&#x002A; and TNP-nucleotides. This steep distance dependence provides the spatial resolution necessary to discriminate between nucleotides bound directly at NBS2 (FRET efficiency close to 100&#x0025;) or at other sites.</p>
<p>TNP-nucleotides have been used previously to probe nucleotide binding to several ABC proteins including NBD1 of SUR2A, as well as the cytoplasmic domain of Kir6.2<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d</xref> shows that MgTNP-ADP was able to activate K<sub>ATP</sub> formed by wild-type SUR1 with a mutated Kir6.2 (Kir6.2-G334D) in inside-out patches (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). G334D disrupts inhibitory nucleotide binding to Kir6.2<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, allowing activation to be measured in isolation<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>FRET between SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 and bound TNP-ADP produced a concentration-dependent decrease (quenching) of the donor ANAP peak at 470 nm and a concomitant increase in the TNP-ADP fluorescence at &#x223C;565 nm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). We quantified nucleotide binding using the decrease in ANAP fluorescence, as this signal was specific to K<sub>ATP</sub> (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1b,c</xref>) and we observed non-specific association of TNP-nucleotides in sham-transfected membranes at high concentrations (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2e</xref>). No change in fluorescence was observed when saturating concentrations of MgATP or MgADP were applied to SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 channels (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2f</xref>), indicating that quenching of the ANAP signal results from FRET and not an allosteric change in the environment surrounding 1353&#x002A; caused by nucleotide binding.</p>

MgTNP-ADP bound with &#x223C;7-fold lower EC<sub>50</sub> than MgTNP-ATP (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), consistent with the lower EC<sub>50</sub> for activation of SUR1/Kir6.2-G334D channels by MgADP vs. MgATP (7.7 &#x03BC;M vs. 112 &#x03BC;M)<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Quite unexpectedly, we observed binding of both TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP to NBS2 in the <italic>absence</italic> of Mg<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, i.e. in 1 mM EDTA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). Both nucleotides bound with similar affinities in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but neither fully quenched SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). Although quenching was not 100&#x0025;, the amount of FRET obtained in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is still consistent with nucleotides binding at NBS2. The difference in FRET efficiency at saturating nucleotide concentrations in the presence and absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> may reflect a change in orientation between the donor and acceptor, as the NBDs are expected to change conformation in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;,<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively close proximity of NBS1 to Y1353&#x002A; (39 &#x00C5; to TNP-ATP aligned at NBS1, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), the FRET we observes was primarily the result of quenching by TNP-ATP/ADP bound at NBS2. When nucleotides are bound directly to NBS2, FRET efficiency is very high and any nucleotide binding at NBS1 would have little or no effect on our measurements<sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Nucleotides at NBS1 would only contribute to the observed FRET signal if NBS2 were unoccupied. However, with no nucleotide bound to NBS2, the NBDs would not dimerize and 1353&#x002A; would be &#x223C;56 &#x00C5; away from TNP-nucleotides bound to NBS1 (based on PDB 6BAA)<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. At this distance, the predicted FRET efficiency is &#x003C;20&#x0025; (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2b</xref>), much less that the FRET efficiencies we observed for TNP nucleotide quenching &#x00B1;Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f,g</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In the Mg-nucleotide-bound &#x201C;quatrefoil&#x201D; structure of K<sub>ATP</sub>, the inhibitory NBS of Kir6.2 is within &#x223C;33 &#x00C5; of Y1353 (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. To eliminate a possible contribution of nucleotide bound at Kir6.2 to our measured FRET signal, we measured binding of MgTNP-ADP to SUR1-Y1353&#x002A; co-expressed with Kir6.2-G334D (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3b</xref>). The EC<sub>50</sub> was very similar to that measured with SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that either the NBS on Kir6.2 was too distant for FRET with Y1353&#x002A;, or that appreciable binding to Kir6.2 did not occur at concentrations at which NBS2 was unoccupied.</p>

<title>Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> locks nucleotides at NBS2</title>
<p>If nucleotides can bind NBS2 in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, why is K<sub>ATP</sub> only activated in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>? The simplest explanation is that binding to NBS2 is Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-independent, but Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is required to support the conformational change that promotes channel activation. Presumably, this conformational change involves NBD dimerization, as observed in the structures of K<sub>ATP</sub><sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Because nucleotide dissociation would require opening of the NBD dimer, it is expected to slow the nucleotide off rate. We therefore measured the time course of nucleotide dissociation from SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 in the presence and absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>.</p>
<p>In the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, TNP-ADP dissociated very rapidly from SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,e</xref>; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Dissociation of TNP-ADP was greatly slowed by the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (p = 0.001). Similar, but less dramatic results were obtained with TNP-ATP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,e</xref>; p = 0.0001; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Whereas the time courses of dissociation of TNP-ADP &#x00B1;Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and TNP-ATP in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> were well described by single exponential decays, the dissociation of TNP-ATP in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> appeared biexponential.</p>
<p>Our data are consistent with an activation model for K<sub>ATP</sub> in which the NBDs of SUR1 dimerize in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, preventing rapid nucleotide dissociation. However, it is formally possible that Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> could directly stabilize nucleotide binding without any conformational change in the NBDs. In a two-state binding equilibrium for TNP-nucleotides and SUR1 (SCHEME 1),

</disp-formula>
the dissociation constant, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>, is equal to <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub>. Therefore, any effect on <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> (e.g. via a direct stabilization of nucleotide binding by Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>) would affect <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> proportionately. In our experiments, the off-rate for TNP-ADP was reduced &#x223C;5-fold in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, whereas the EC<sub>50</sub> for TNP-ADP was largely unaffected (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4a</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>,<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> reduced the off-rate for TNP-ATP by a factor of 2.2, but actually increased the EC<sub>50</sub> for binding by a factor of &#x223C;3 (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4b</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>,<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These results are not compatible with a simple equilibrium as shown in Scheme 1. A more parsimonious explanation is that, in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, there is no longer a simple equilibrium for binding and unbinding and that Mg-nucleotide binding is coupled to an additional process, which we propose is the activating conformational change in SUR1 (starting with NBD dimerization).</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we examined nucleotide dissociation rates in the presence of the sulfonylurea (SU) tolbutamide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d,e</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The cryo-EM structure of Kir6.2/SUR1 in the presence of glibenclamide suggests that SUs prevent NBD dimerization<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, and electrophysiological studies further suggest that SUs prevent Mg-nucleotide induced current activation<sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. In the presence of tolbutamide, the dissociation rates for MgTNP-ADP and MgTNP-ATP were not significantly different from those measured for nucleotides in the absence of both tolbutamide and Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; p = 0.07, for TNP-ADP, p = 1 for TNP-ATP). This argues that the slower off rate for TNP-ADP and TNP-ATP in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> must result from NBD dimerization, not a direct stabilization of nucleotide binding by Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>.</p>
<p>As further support, we tested the effect of diazoxide (a KCO) on the nucleotide dissociation rate. It has been proposed that nucleotide binding at the NBDs of SUR2A stabilizes binding of the KCO pinacidil<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The time course of nucleotide dissociation in the presence of diazoxide did not follow a single exponential decay, but the drug greatly reduced the dissociation rates for both MgTNP-ADP and MgTNP-ATP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d,e</xref>; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This suggests that KCOs function by stabilizing the activated (NBD-dimerized) conformation of SUR1.</p>
<p>The nucleotide dissociation rates measured in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> are slower than the deactivation rates observed for SUR1/Kir6.2-G334D currents following nucleotide washout<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. However, it should be noted that current decay reflects a conformational change in the channel and not the rate of nucleotide dissociation, and may be affected by the presence of four SUR1 monomers per channel. Furthermore, the deactivation rates were measured for MgATP/ADP and not TNP-nucleotides. Ultimately, a direct comparison of TNP-nucleotide dissociation rates and deactivation rates will require simultaneous measurement of current and binding.</p>

<title>Mutation of the Walker<sub>A</sub> lysine of NBS2 affects channel conformation, not nucleotide binding</title>
<p>Our ability to measure nucleotide binding to SUR1 in the presence and absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> provides a framework for mechanistically separating nucleotide binding from the conformational changes that occur subsequent to binding. In the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> the apparent nucleotide affinity is influenced by both binding and the conformational change. In the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, however, no conformational change is expected and the apparent affinities measured reflect true (state-independent) binding affinities. Therefore, mutations that affect the apparent nucleotide affinity in the presence and absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> can be interpreted as direct effects on ligand binding, whereas mutations that only affect the apparent nucleotide affinity in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> must exert their effect on binding allosterically.</p>
<p>We mutated the lysine residue in the Walker<sub>A</sub> motif of NBS2 to alanine (K1384A) in channels labeled with ANAP at NBS2 (SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;,K2A/Kir6.2) and measured nucleotide binding with and without Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).

<p>In the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> we observed no significant difference in TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP binding to SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;,K2A/Kir6.2 compared to SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,c</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). MgTNP-ATP binding was also unaffected by the K2A mutation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However the K2A mutation disrupted MgTNP-ADP binding (EC<sub>50</sub> = 16.5 &#x03BC;M for K2A vs. 4.8 &#x03BC;M for SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;, p = 0.04; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As we observed no change in TNP-ADP binding in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, we conclude that the K2A mutation affects nucleotide binding indirectly, by reducing the ability of MgTNP-ADP to cause NBD dimerization. Consistent with this, the K2A mutation also affected the slope of the MgTNP-ADP concentration-response relationship (p = 0.03, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which would not be expected from a change in the intrinsic binding affinity. To confirm this result, we measured the rate of MgTNP-ADP dissociation from SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;,K2A/Kir6.2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). The K2A mutation increased the off-rate for MgTNP-ADP compared to SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 channels (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; p = 0.04), implying the K2A mutant destabilized NBD dimerization. Consistent with this, previous electrophysiological studies showed that the K2A mutation reduced the maximal MgATP activation of SUR1/Kir6.2-G334D and shifted the concentration dependence of MgADP activation &#x003E;20-fold to higher concentrations, such that the maximal response could not be determined<sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Correlation of binding with gating</title>
<p>We next sought to correlate nucleotide binding with changes in channel activity. Despite our ability to demonstrate a Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>- and nucleotide-dependent conformational change in SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2, we were unable to measure activation of SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 channels by Mg-nucleotides. There are two possible explanations for this observation. The first is that SUR1-Y1353&#x002A; disrupts communication between the NBD-dimerized SUR1 and Kir6.2. Inspection of the Mg-nucleotide-bound &#x201C;quatrefoil&#x201D; structure<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> shows that position 1353 is adjacent to residues (e.g. R1352) at the interface between SUR1 and Kir6.2. Mutation of R1352 disrupts K<sub>ATP</sub> activation<sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the lack of K<sub>ATP</sub> current activation is that channels containing SUR1 subunits truncated at Y1353 (i.e. no ANAP incorporated) trafficked to the plasma membrane. These channels would not be expected to support activation as they lack a complete NBS2. In fluorescence measurements, we only observe full-length SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 channels as only these are labeled with ANAP (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). However, in electrophysiological experiments there is no <italic>a priori</italic> way of distinguishing between currents through channels with truncated SUR1 and full-length channels with impaired activation coupling.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, we noticed no difference in the current magnitude from patches excised from cells expressing SUR1-Y1353<sup>amber</sup>/Kir6.2 in the presence of ANAP (where full-length channels will be present) or in its absence (where all channels would be expected to be truncated). Using a surface expression assay<sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, we also observed no difference in the ability of full-length and truncated SUR1-Y1353<sup>amber</sup> to chaperone HA-tagged Kir6.2 to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5a</xref>). We therefore sought to label an additional position near NBS2 for which only full-length, ANAP-labeled channels would support surface expression of Kir6.2. We mutated 34 different residues (amino acids 1386-1397, 1400-1408, and 1410-1423) to the amber stop codon and screened the constructs for their ability to promote surface expression of HA-Kir6.2 only in the presence of ANAP. We focused on SUR1-T1397<sup>amber</sup>, as this mutation strongly increased the surface expression of HA-Kir6.2 in the presence of ANAP (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5a</xref>; p = 0.005, n = 7). Further, in the absence of ANAP, this construct decreased the surface expression of HA-Kir6.2 (p = 0.009, n = 6) compared to no-SUR1 controls (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5a</xref>), suggesting that channels with SUR truncated at this position may be selectively retained within the cell. Western blots of total protein from cells expressing SUR1-T1397<sup>amber</sup> in the presence of ANAP and a dominant negative ribosomal release factor<sup><xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> confirmed that &#x003E;95&#x0025; of SUR1-T1397&#x002A; was full length (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5b</xref>). The expected distance between T1397 and TNP-nucleotides bound to NBS2 is &#x223C;18.3 &#x00C5; (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), close enough for &#x003E;99&#x0025; FRET efficiency (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2b</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Taken together, our data suggest a modified model for SUR1/Kir6.2 K<sub>ATP</sub> activation through nucleotide binding to SUR1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). ADP and ATP bind to NBS2 in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. However, without Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> as a co-factor, adenine nucleotides cannot dimerize the NBDs and initiate the conformational change in SUR1 required to affect P<sub>open</sub>. As the NBDs fail to dimerize, nucleotides dissociate rapidly. If both Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and nucleotides are present, the NBDs dimerize, resulting in slower nucleotide dissociation. NBD dimerization initiates a conformational change in SUR1 that ultimately communicates nucleotide occupancy to the pore, affecting P<sub>open</sub>. Inhibitory SUs prevent NBD dimerization. Thus, nucleotides dissociate rapidly even in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and P<sub>open</sub> is not affected by nucleotide occupancy at NBS2. KCOs have the opposite effect. They stabilize NBD dimerization, prolonging nucleotide occupancy at NBS2 and channel activation.</p>

<p>Although our data do not offer any direct structural insight into how NBD dimerization propagates to Kir6.2, our ability to measure MgTNP-ADP binding to NBS2 of SUR1 and channel activation under similar conditions furnishes some mechanistic insights into the relationship between nucleotide binding and channel opening. We simultaneously fit the combined data sets for MgTNP-ADP binding to SUR1-T1397&#x002A;/Kir6.2 and activation of SUR1-T1397&#x002A;/Kir6.2-G334D currents with several gating models. For each model, equations for binding and P<sub>open</sub> used common values for <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> (the equilibrium association constant in units of M<sup>-1</sup>, constrained such that K<sub>A</sub> &#x003E; 0), L (the equilibrium constant for the intrinsic opening of unliganded SUR1-T1397&#x002A;/Kir6.2, fixed to 0.52 based on the measured P<sub>open</sub> of SUR1/Kir6.2-G334D<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>), and E (the factor by which MgTNP-ADP binding favors activation, constrained to E&#x003E;1). Goodness of fit was assessed by comparing the residual sum of the squared deviations (RSS) between the data and fit curves. As K<sub>ATP</sub> channels open in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and nucleotides, we excluded any gating models that lacked unliganded opening. None of the available cryo-EM structures<sup>3,4,6,34,35</sup> show any direct interactions between neighboring SUR1 subunits. Therefore, we excluded models in which binding to one SUR1 directly affects binding to the other SUR1 subunits (i.e. with binding cooperativity).</p>

<p>Previous attempts to determine the stoichiometry of Mg-nucleotide activation of K<sub>ATP</sub>, i.e. how many SUR1 subunits must bind nucleotide in order to activate current, have produced varying results<sup><xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. We also fit MgTNP-ADP binding to NBS2 and current activation for SUR1-T1397&#x002A; with models in which fixed stoichiometries of 1-4 nucleotide-bound SUR1 subunits were necessary to increase P<sub>open</sub> (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). All of these models used the same assumptions as the MWC model in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, but none fit the data so well.</p>
<p>Our binding and activation data were determined in separate experiments. Whereas the equations for binding and current activation both have a term (L) representing the intrinsic opening equilibrium, there is no way of knowing the P<sub>open</sub> of channels in an unroofed membrane. To derive more quantitative values, ideally experiments should be performed using patch-clamp fluorometry in which binding and current are measured simultaneously<sup><xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. However, we were unable to obtain inside-out patches from cells expressing SUR1-T1397&#x002A;/Kir6.2-G334D with sufficient fluorescence intensity to measure reliable spectra. The concentration-response relationship for current activation was normalized to the minimum and maximum current values, as reflected in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">equation 7</xref>. If the true maximum and minimum P<sub>open</sub> in a given experiment could be accurately determined, then the quantity E could be computed directly from the minimum P<sub>open</sub> in the absence of ligand, L/(L&#x002B;1), and the maximum P<sub>open</sub> at saturating nucleotide concentrations, E<sup>4</sup>L/(E<sup>4</sup>L&#x002B;1). This would be of particular use as the error in our estimate of E is quite high. In practice, however, these values are difficult to measure for K<sub>ATP</sub> in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> as channel rundown from loss of PIP<sub>2</sub> results in an intrinsic P<sub>open</sub> (L) that is constantly changing<sup><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, our analysis provides useful qualitative information regarding the mechanism by which nucleotide binding to NBS2 of SUR1 activates Kir6.2.</p>
<p>The affinities we measured for (Mg)TNP-ADP and (Mg)TNP-ATP binding are higher than those previously estimated for (Mg)ATP and (Mg)ADP from photoaffinity labeling studies on SUR1 in the absence of Kir6.2<sup><xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> or from ATPase assays preformed on isolated NBD2 fusion proteins<sup><xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. This may reflect a higher affinity of TNP nucleotides for NBS2 of SUR1 compared to ATP and ADP, as observed for other ABC transporters<sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> or the absence of Kir6.2. Nevertheless, the EC<sub>50</sub> values obtained from MgTNP-ATP and MgTNP-ADP binding to SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 were in reasonably good agreement with those measured for MgATP and MgADP activation of SUR1/Kir6.2-G334D currents<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. It is unlikely that the introduction of ANAP modified the binding affinity of NBS2 as the apparent affinity for TNP-nucleotides in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> was unaffected by the site at which ANAP was inserted (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The difference in apparent affinities between SUR1-Y1353&#x002A; and SUR1-T1397&#x002A; in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> may indicate a difference in the ability of bound nucleotides to promote NBD dimerization.</p>
<p>Our ability to separate effects on nucleotide binding from channel activation will be of considerable value for future investigations. They will allow us to address the role of nucleotide binding at NBS1 and Kir6.2, and explore the mechanistic ramifications of disease-associated K<sub>ATP</sub> mutations. Furthermore, simultaneous binding and current measurements will yield precise information regarding the coupling of stimulatory and inhibitory nucleotide binding to the channel pore. This coupling of ligand binding to an effector domain (the channel pore) that lies tens of &#x00C5; away provides an excellent model for studying long-range communication within protein complexes. It has also not escaped our notice that our method is readily adaptable to the study of other ABC proteins, ATP-gated channels like P2X receptors, and any protein for which there is a suitable fluorescent ligand.</p>

<p>SUR1 constructs were site-specifically tagged with the fluorescent amino acid ANAP using amber codon suppression as described by Chatterjee <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. 30 mm dishes of HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with pANAP (0.5-1 &#x00B5;g), Kir6.2 (0.5 &#x00B5;g), and SUR1 (1-1.5 &#x00B5;g) constructs containing an amber stop codon (TAG) at amino acid position 1353 or 1397 (1353<sup>amber</sup> or 1397<sup>amber</sup>) using TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC; Madison, WI) in a ratio of 3 &#x00B5;L of TransIT per &#x00B5;g of total DNA. Following transfection the media was supplemented with 20 &#x00B5;M ANAP (free acid or methyl ester). pANAP encodes a tRNA/tRNA synthetase pair specific for ANAP. In the presence of ANAP, cells transfected with pANAP generate tRNAs charged with ANAP that recognize the amber stop codon. Thus, full-length ANAP-tagged SUR can be produced. Proper co-assembly of Kir6.2 subunits with SUR1 subunits is ensured by the fact that the two subunits rely on one another for proper exit from the ER and trafficking to the plasma membrane<sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.

<title>Preparation of unroofed membrane fragments for imaging</title>
<p>Unroofed membranes were prepared using a modification of a protocol from the Heuser laboratory<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Briefly, a coverslip containing adherent cells was removed from the cell culture media and a small piece (0.5-1 cm) was broken off using jewelers forceps (#5) and washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:3 in deionized water. Cells were exposed 3&#x00D7;10 s to a solution of 0.01&#x0025; poly-L-lysine (Sigma) with intervening washes in diluted PBS to adhere them more firmly to the coverslips. The coverslip fragment was then placed in a 30 mm culture dish filled with 2-3 mL of 1/3X PBS and sonicated very briefly (&#x223C;100 ms) using a probe sonicator (Vibra-cell), leaving behind adherent plasma membrane and sometimes additional cellular material. The unroofed fragments in our experiments were sometimes visible under bright-field illumination, a potential result of our modified &#x201C;unroofing&#x201D; procedure. Morphologically, such cell fragments resemble the &#x201C;partially unroofed&#x201D; cells identified by Usukura <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Cells cultured on poly-D-lysine coated FluoroDishes were unroofed in diluted PBS with no additional poly-L-lysine treatment. This procedure yielded a higher percentage of completely unroofed plasma membranes (i.e. nearly invisible with brightfield illumination).</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Microscopy/spectroscopy</title>
<p>Unroofed membrane fragments were imaged directly on FluoroDishes (FD35-PDL-100, World Precision Instruments) or on broken coverslips placed in a FluoroDish (FD3510, World Precision instruments) using a Nikon TE2000-U microscope equipped with a 40x (S Fluor, 1.3 NA, Nikon) or 100x (Apo TIRF, 1.49 NA, Nikon; Kingston Upon Thames, UK) oil-immersion objective and low-fluorescence immersion oil (MOIL-30, Olympus; Southend-on-Sea, UK) or a 60x water immersion objective (Plan Apo VC, 1.20 NA, Nikon). ANAP was excited using a ThorLabs LED source (LED4D067) at 385 nm connected to the microscope using a liquid light guide with a 390/18 nm band-pass filter (MF390-18, ThorLabs; Newton, NJ) and MD416 dichroic (ThorLabs). For imaging, emitted light was filtered through a 479/40 nm band-pass filter (MF479-40, ThorLabs). GFP was imaged using a similar setup with excitation at 490 nm, a 480/40 band-pass excitation filter (Chroma; Bellows Falls, VT), a DM505 dichroic mirror (Chroma), and 510 nm long-pass emission filter. For spectroscopy, ANAP was excited as above, but emitted light was passed through a 400 nm long-pass filter (FEL0400, ThorLabs) and directed through the slit of an Isoplane 160 spectrometer (300 g/mm grating; Princeton Instruments; Trenton, NJ). Spectral images (spatial information on the <italic>y</italic>-axis and wavelength on the <italic>x</italic>-axis) were acquired using a PIXIS 400B CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) attached to the spectrograph (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1c</xref>). Exposure times were typically 100 ms for brightfield images, 1-10 s for steady-state spectra and 1-5 s for time-course experiments. The emission spectrum of ANAP-labeled SUR1 showed a peak around 470 nm, which was used to differentiate labeled channels from autofluorescence (which typically had a broad emission spectrum), from cytoplasmic ANAP (or potentially ANAP-conjugated to tRNA), which peaks &#x223C;480 nm or from bright, fluorescent debris on the coverslip which was morphologically distinct from unroofed membranes and had spectra peaking at either &#x223C;450 nm or 480-485 nm.</p>
<p>To verify that the fluorescence signal we observed in unroofed membrane fragments derived from SUR1-Y1353&#x002A;, we co-transfected cells with Kir6.2 and GFP-tagged SUR1 with or without an amber stop codon at position Y1353. After unroofing, membranes from transfected cells could be identified by the green fluorescence of SUR1_GFP/Kir6.2. <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1b</xref> shows that membranes expressing SUR1_GFP-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 were brightly fluorescent for both GFP and ANAP, whereas those from SUR1_GFP expressing cells had only GFP fluorescence. We also acquired emission spectra from membranes expressing SUR1_GFP-Y1353&#x002A;/Kir6.2 (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1c</xref>). The intensity of the ANAP peak in our fluorescence was linearly proportional to the peak GFP fluorescence, and the intensity of the ANAP peak at zero GFP (i.e. no expression of SUR1_GFP-Y1353&#x002A;) was zero. Taken together, these data suggest that non-specific ANAP background was very low. We also performed Western blotting on FLAG-tagged SUR1-Y1353<sup>amber</sup> constructs to verify that we produced full-length, ANAP-labeled SUR1, and that cells were unable to read through the amber stop codon to produce full-length protein in the absence of ANAP (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1d</xref>).</p>
<p>To prevent accumulation of fluorescent nucleotides in the bath, FluoroDishes were perfused with either (in mM) 140 KCl, 20 NaCl, 10 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES pH 7.2 w/NaOH or 140 KCl, 20 NaCl, 1 EDTA, 10 HEPES pH 7.2 w/NaOH using a peristaltic pump (Ismatec). Unroofed membranes were directly perfused with nucleotides using an 8-channel &#x00B5;Flow perfusion system (ALA Scientific Instruments; Farmingdale, NY). Solution change with the &#x00B5;Flow was rapid (&#x03C4; = 0.73 s &#x00B1;0.02 s) as measured from single exponential fits to wash-out of 50 &#x00B5;M tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMRM) after switching to a solution with 0 TMRM. TMRM was excited with a 565 nm LED with a D540/25X band-pass filter (Chroma) and DM565 dichroic mirror (Chroma). Emitted light was collected through a D605/55M band-pass filter (Chroma).</p>
<p>Images and spectra were acquired using LightField (Princeton Instruments). The solution changer, camera, and light source were all controlled using pClamp 10.5 (Molecular Devices; San Jose, CA) and a DigiData 1440 A/D converter.

<title>Analysis of images and spectra</title>
<p>Images were adjusted and displayed using Fiji<sup><xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Spectra were analyzed using custom code written in Matlab (Mathworks; Natick, MA). Regions of interest corresponding to fluorescent membrane fragments were manually selected from the spectral images and averaged for each wavelength. A background region of similar size was selected and the average was subtracted from the spectrum of the region of interest. The peak fluorescence (&#x223C;470 nm) was automatically selected by determining the maximum of a boxcar average of 31 points (corresponding to &#x223C;10 nm) of the data in the absence of nucleotides. Data were corrected for photobleaching by fitting an exponential decay to the normalized peak of 5-6 images acquired prior to washing on TNP-nucleotides and dividing the raw spectra by the resulting fit at each cumulative exposure time. Corrected data were normalized by the peak ANAP fluorescence at 0 [TNP-nucleotide] (F/F<sub>max</sub>) and displayed as 1-F/F<sub>max</sub>. On occasion data were normalized instead to the fluorescence at 50 nM nucleotide, as we consistently saw no effect at this concentration. TNP-nucleotide concentration-response relationships were fit with the Hill equation

<p>To generate the plot of GFP fluorescence vs. ANAP fluorescence in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1c</xref>, spectra of ANAP and GFP tagged SUR1 subunits expressed in unroofed membrane fragments were acquired as above. We were able to resolve a GFP peak at 510 nm with 385 nm excitation, even though this wavelength is far from the &#x03BB;<sub>max</sub> for GFP. It is possible that GFP emission was enhanced via FRET between ANAP and GFP. The ANAP peak fluorescence at 470 nm did not overlap with the GFP emission peak. However, the peak GFP at 510 nm was contaminated by the shoulder of the ANAP peak. Therefore, the GFP fluorescence was corrected by subtracting the averaged (from 16 membranes) fluorescence of ANAP incorporated into SUR1, scaled to match the 470 nm peak in the ANAP-GFP spectrum.</p>
<p>To measure the time course of nucleotide unbinding, the fluorescence at the TNP-nucleotide peak (usually around 560 nm) was plotted as a function of time after exchanging to a zero-nucleotide solution, as following the time course of the rise in ANAP fluorescence was complicated by photobleaching. After complete wash out of nucleotides, the fluorescence at 560 nm was non zero, as the shoulder of the ANAP emission spectrum extends into the range of wavelengths at which TNP-nucleotides emit. Therefore, the time course data were corrected by subtracting a linear fit to the data following complete washout. This corrected for the shoulder of the ANAP spectrum as well as the continued photobleaching of ANAP. Data were normalized to the maximum fluorescence at t = 0 and fit with single-exponential decays

<p>Wash-out time courses following exchange to [TNP-nucleotide] = 0 should be independent of the nucleotide concentration before wash.

For experiments in diazoxide and tolbutamide, the nucleotide concentration prior to wash was 50 &#x03BC;M.</p>
<p>In some experiments, there was evidence of cross-contamination of our wash solution or low-nucleotide solutions via back-flow of solutions with higher concentrations of nucleotide (as evident by accumulation of yellow TNP-nucleotides).

<p>In order to detect SUR1 via Western blot, a 3xFLAG (MDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK) tagged construct (tag in an extracellular loop between amino acid positions T1042 and L1043) was used (SUR1-3xFLAG) with or without amber stop codons at amino acid positions 1353 or 1397. HEK-293T cells were transfected in 6-well plates using the conditions described above, but with 1 &#x03BC;g of SUR1 DNA. After 48 h, cells were washed and harvested with gentle pipetting in 1 mL of PBS (Sigma). Cells were pelleted (4 min at 0.2 &#x00D7; <italic>g</italic> yielding 20-50 mg pellets) and solubilized in 50-100 &#x00B5;L of 0.5&#x0025; Triton X-100 in 110 mM potassium acetate, buffered at pH 7.4. 125 U of benzonase (Sigma) was added to each sample and samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 7.5 &#x00B5;L of each sample was mixed with 2.5 &#x00B5;L of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and 1 &#x00B5;L NuPAGE sample reducing agent (Invitrogen) and run on a NuPAGE 4-12&#x0025; Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) at 200 V for 40 min in 1X MOPS-SDS buffer (Invitrogen). Protein was transferred overnight at 10 V to an Immobilon-P membrane (Merck Millipore; Burlington, MA) in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 20&#x0025; methanol &#x002B; 0.1&#x0025; SDS. Following transfer, the membrane was rinsed in TBS-Tw (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.2, and 0.05&#x0025; Tween 20) and incubated (with shaking) for 30 min in 5&#x0025; milk in TBS-Tw. The membrane was rinsed three times in TBS-Tw and incubated for 30 min with primary antibody (M2 anti-FLAG from Sigma, diluted 1:500 in TBS-Tw).

As the 3xFLAG tag was N-terminal to SUR1, we used it to probe for both full-length and truncated SUR1. As a positive control, we transfected 3x-FLAG-tagged SUR1 with no stop codon, which was only expected to produce full-length protein (lane 1). This protein ran above our 140 kDa marker as expected (predicted MW is &#x223C;180 kDa). In the absence of ANAP or in cells transfected without the pANAP plasmid, only truncated 3xFLAG-SUR1 protein was evident (lanes 4 and 5), confirming that there was no full-length protein produced by accidental read-through of the amber (TAG) codon. In the presence of both pANAP and ANAP, we obtained a mixture of full-length (66&#x0025;) and truncated (34&#x0025;) SUR1. The majority of our experiments in unroofed membrane fragments were performed under such conditions as the signals we measured (fluorescence) were derived solely from full-length (i.e. ANAP-labeled) channels. Finally, we were able to increase expression of full-length SUR1 as needed by transfecting an additional plasmid, pERF1-E55D, which encodes a dominant negative ribosomal release factor<sup><xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.

<p>In parallel experiments, we expressed SUR1_GFP-Y1353<sup>amber</sup> in the absence of ANAP. Under such conditions, we observed a few cells with diffuse GFP fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm. We believe that the signal from such cells was derived from soluble GFP generated from an internal methionine after position 1353 and not read-through of the amber stop codon, as the distribution of this protein differed from that of SUR1_GFP (which was confined to the plasma membrane and presumably ER/Golgi).

Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 4&#x00B0; C in PBS &#x002B; 1&#x0025; BSA with a 1:1000 dilution of rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche; Basel, Switzerland) and washed 5&#x00D7;10 min on ice with PBS &#x002B; 1&#x0025; BSA. HRP-conjugated goat anti-rat polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch; Ely, UK) was applied in PBS &#x002B; 1&#x0025; BSA and cells were incubated an additional 30 min at 4&#x00B0; C. Finally, cells were washed 4&#x00D7;10 min in PBS &#x002B; 1&#x0025; BSA and 5&#x00D7;10 min in PBS on ice. After the wash, coverslips were removed from PBS and placed in clean, untreated 35 mm culture dishes. 300 &#x03BC;L of SuperSignal ELISA Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added and the luminescence was measured using a Glomax 20/20 Luminometer (Promega; Madison, WI) after a 10 s incubation. For display purposes, data were normalized to the mean of the luminescence with wild-type SUR1. Background was assessed with cells that were transfected with HA-tagged Kir6.2, but no SUR1.</p>

<title>Chemicals</title>
<p>ANAP trifluoroacetate salt and methyl ester were obtained from Asis Chemicals (Waltham, MA). A 1 mM stock of the salt was prepared in 30 mM NaOH and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0; C. The methyl ester was dissolved at 5 mM in DMSO and stored at &#x2212;20&#x00B0; C. The two forms were used interchangeably, as the final product (when ANAP is incorporated into a protein) is identical and in our experience both free acid and methyl ester were membrane permeant. Trinitrophenyl (TNP) nucleotide analogues were purchased from Jena Bioscience (Jena, Germany). 1 mM stocks were prepared in buffer and stored at &#x2212;20&#x00B0; C. Stocks were verified using UV-Vis spectroscopy (Beckman Coulter DU800 spectrophotometer; Pasadena, CA) as needed. Paper chromatography (mobile phase 40:10:25 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, glacial acetic acid: H<sub>2</sub>O) was used to verify that older TNP-ATP stocks had not undergone hydrolysis. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Diazoxide was prepared in a 34 mM stock in 100 mM KOH and stored at &#x2212;20&#x00B0; C before use. Tolbutamide was dissolved at 100 mM in DMSO and stored at &#x2212;20&#x00B0; C.</p>

<title>Data presentation and statistics</title>
<p>All data were plotted as mean &#x00B1;SEM, with the exception of the box plots in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5a</xref>, the boxes of which represented &#x00B1;SD. The number of experiments (n) represents the number of patches or membranes used in a given experiment. For surface expression assays, n represents the number of transfected coverslips. Plots and curve fitting were generated using Origin 9.1 (OriginLab Corporation; Northampton, MA). Curves in the figures (and parameters reported in the figure legends) represent fits to the combined data sets, with errors representing the standard error of the fits. Shaded regions indicate 95&#x0025; confidence intervals. Fit parameters reported in Tables are the mean &#x00B1;SEM (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) or &#x00B1;SD (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) of the fits to individual experiments. Pairwise comparisons were performed using two-tailed Student&#x2019;s <italic>t</italic>-tests with the Welch correction (not assuming equal variance) and the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, as needed. Comparisons of EC<sub>50</sub> values were performed on log-transformed data as the untransformed EC<sub>50</sub> is not normally distributed.</p>

<p><bold>(a)</bold> Chemiluminescence assay for surface expression of HA-tagged Kir6.2 in the presence and absence of SUR1, in SUR1-Y1353<sup>amber</sup>-transfected HEK-293T cells cultured in the presence or absence of 20 &#x00B5;M ANAP, and in SUR1-T1397<sup>amber</sup> transfected HEK-293T cells cultured in the presence or absence of 20 &#x00B5;M ANAP. <bold>(b)</bold> Western blot for 3xFLAG-tagged SUR1 subunits expressed in HEK-293T cells. All cells were co-transfected with Kir6.2 and cultured in the presence of 20 &#x03BC;M ANAP. Two separate experiments are shown. In each, the positive control was 3xFLAG_SUR1 with no amber stop codon. The negative control was SUR1 with no FLAG tag. The next two lanes show 3xFLAG_SUR1-T1397<sup>tag</sup> co-transfected with pANAP and pERF1-E55D, or with pERF1-E55D and no pANAP. The positions of the full-length and truncated (at amino acid 1396) proteins are marked. <bold>(c)</bold> Inhibition of SUR1-T1397&#x002A;/Kir6.2 (gray) and SUR1/Kir6.2 (brown) channels by ATP in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> measured in inside-out patches.
