<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mutations in transmembrane inner ear (<italic>TMIE</italic>) cause deafness in humans; previous studies suggest involvement in the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) complex in sensory hair cells, but TMIE&#x2019;s precise role is unclear. In <italic>tmie</italic> zebrafish mutants, we observed that GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b, which are putative subunits of the MET channel, fail to target to the hair bundle. In contrast, overexpression of Tmie strongly enhances the targeting of Tmc2b-GFP to stereocilia. To identify the motifs of Tmie underlying the regulation of the Tmcs, we systematically deleted or replaced peptide segments. We then assessed localization and functional rescue of each mutated/chimeric form of Tmie in <italic>tmie</italic> mutants. We determined that the first putative helix was dispensable and identified a novel critical region of Tmie, the extracellular region and transmembrane domain, which mediates both mechanosensitivity and Tmc2b-GFP expression in bundles. Collectively, our results suggest that Tmie&#x2019;s role in sensory hair cells is to target and stabilize Tmc subunits to the site of MET.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Hair cells mediate hearing and balance through the activity of a pore-forming channel in the cell membrane. The transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) protein is an essential component of the protein complex that gates this so-called mechanotransduction channel. While it is known that loss of TMIE results in deafness, the function of TMIE within the complex is unclear. Using zebrafish as a deafness model, Pacentine and Nicolson demonstrate that Tmie is required for the localization of other essential complex members, the transmembrane channel-like (Tmc) proteins, Tmc1/2b. They then evaluate twelve unique versions of Tmie, each containing mutations to different domains of Tmie. This analysis reveals that some mutations in Tmie cause dysfunctional gating of the channel as demonstrated through reduced hair cell activity, and that these same dysfunctional versions also display reduced Tmc expression at the normal site of the channel. These findings link hair cell activity with the levels of Tmc in the bundle, reinforcing the currently-debated notion that the Tmcs are the pore-forming subunits of the mechanotransduction channel. The authors conclude that Tmie, through distinct regions, is involved in both trafficking and stabilizing the Tmcs at the site of mechanotransduction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The auditory and vestibular systems detect mechanical stimuli such as sound, gravity, and acceleration. These two systems share a sensory cell type called hair cells. The somas of hair cells are embedded in the epithelium and extend villi-like processes from their apex into the surrounding fluid. The shorter of these, the stereocilia, are arranged in a staircase-like pattern adjacent to a single primary cilium known as a kinocilium. Neighboring cilia are connected by protein linkages. Deflection of the kinocilium along the excitatory axis tugs the interconnected stereocilia, which move as a single unit called the hair bundle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">l</xref>]. When tension is placed on the upper-most linkages known as tip links, the force is thought to open mechanosensitive channels at the distal end of the shorter stereocilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. These channels pass current, depolarizing the cell and permitting electrical output to the brain via the eighth cranial nerve. The conversion of a mechanical stimulus into an electrical signal is known as mechano-electrical transduction (MET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The proteins located at the site of MET and involved in gating the MET channel are collectively known as the MET complex. How the components of the MET complex, including the channel itself, are localized to and maintained at the stereocilia tips is not well understood.</p>
<p>To characterize the molecular underpinnings of MET and the underlying cause of pathology in human patients, it is essential to examine the individual components of the transduction complex in a comprehensive fashion. Thus far, only a few proteins have been designated as members of the MET complex. The identity of the channel itself remains contentious, but currently the best candidates for the pore-forming subunits are the Transmembrane Channel-like (TMC) proteins TMC1 and TMC2. Mutations in <italic>TMC1</italic> cause human deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], and double knock-outs of mouse <italic>Tmc1/2</italic> result in the loss of MET currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In zebrafish, overexpression of a fragment of Tmc2a generates a dominant negative effect on hair-cell mechanosensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and Tmc2a and Tmc2b are required for MET in hair cells of the lateral line organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. The TMCs localize to the tips of stereocilia, the site of MET, in mice and zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. A point mutation in mouse <italic>Tmc1</italic> results in altered channel properties, suggesting direct changes to the pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Likewise, in TMC2 knockout mice, channel permeation properties are altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Regardless of whether the TMCs are the pore-forming or accessory subunits of the channel, they are essential for MET.</p>
<p>Another key component of the complex is Protocadherin-15 (PCDH15), which comprises the lower end of the tip link [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] and interacts with the TMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. A fourth membrane protein, Lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5, formerly called TMHS), interacts with PCDH15 and is critical for localizing PCDH15 to the site of MET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. LHFPL5 is also required to properly localize TMC1 in mouse cochlear hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. However, loss of LHFPL5 in cochlear hair cells does not completely abolish MET currents, and currents can be rescued by overexpression of PCDH15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. This evidence suggests that LHFPL5 is not essential but rather acts as an accessory protein. Another TMC1/2 interacting partner is Calcium and integrin binding protein 2 (CIB2), which is a cytosolic protein that is localized in stereocilia and required for MET in cochlear hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>A sixth essential member of the MET complex is the transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) protein. Loss of TMIE results in deafness in all vertebrate organisms studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that TMIE is required for active MET channels in cochlear hair cells of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. These authors showed that despite normal morphology of the inner ear, hair cells lacking TMIE fail to label with aminoglycosides or FM 1-43, both of which are known to permeate the MET channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. TMIE was first localized to the stereocilia of hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], and then to the stereocilia tips where MET occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Zhao et al. further demonstrated that loss of TMIE ablates MET currents, that TMIE interacts with both LHFPL5 and the CD2 isoform of PCDH15, and that interfering with the TMIE-CD2 interaction alters MET. They proposed that TMIE could be a force-coupler between the tip link and channel. However, the CD2 isoform of PCDH15 is only essential in cochlear hair cells and not vestibular hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Zebrafish do not possess the CD2 isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], and yet they still require Tmie for hair-cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. These findings raised the tantalizing possibility that Tmie might have an additional role in MET that is independent from the tip links. Here, we present an alternative role for Tmie in hair cell function.</p>
<p>We first confirmed that mechanosensitivity is absent in a zebrafish mutant of <italic>tmie, rul000</italic>, and demonstrated that this defect is rescued by transgenic Tmie-GFP. The localization of Tmie-GFP is maintained in the absence of other transduction components, suggesting that Tmie traffics independently to hair bundles. Unexpectedly, GFP-tagged Tmcs fail to localize to the hair bundle in <italic>tmie</italic> mutants, and overexpression of Tmie leads to a corresponding increase in bundle expression of Tmc2b-GFP. To determine which regions of Tmie are involved in regulating the Tmcs, we performed a domain analysis of <italic>tmie</italic> by expressing mutated or chimeric transgenes of <italic>tmie</italic> in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic>, and made three key discoveries: (i) Tmie can function without its putative first transmembrane domain, (<italic>ii</italic>) the remaining helix (2TM) and adjacent regions are responsible for Tmie&#x2019;s function in hair cells, and (iii) dysfunctional <italic>tmie</italic> constructs have reduced efficacy in localizing the Tmcs, supporting the conclusion that impaired MET is due to reduction of Tmc protein. Our evidence suggests that Tmie&#x2019;s role in the MET complex is to promote localization of Tmc1/2 to the site of MET in zebrafish sensory hair cells.</p>

<title>Gross morphology is normal in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish</title>
<p>The literature on TMIE&#x2019;s role in sensory hair cells is somewhat contradictory. Earlier studies proposed a developmental role for TMIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], while later studies evidenced a role in MET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. To begin our analysis and attempt to clarify the issue in zebrafish, we examined live <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> larvae at 5-7 dpf using confocal microscopy. The <italic>ru1000</italic> allele harbors a nonsense mutation leading to an N-terminal truncation, L25X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. We observed that mature hair cells of <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> larvae were grossly normal compared to wild type siblings in both the inner ear cristae and the lateral line organ, an organ specific to fish and amphibians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). We noted a slight thinning of the mutant hair bundles, as revealed using a transgene Actin-GFP. Thin bundles have been observed in other zebrafish MET mutants, such as those carrying mutations in <italic>ap1b1</italic> and <italic>tomt</italic>. Both genes have been previously implicated in protein trafficking in hair cells, with <italic>tomt</italic> having a specific role in targeting Tmc1/2 proteins to the hair bundle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>

<title>Tmie-deficient zebrafish are deaf due to a defect in hair cell mechanosensitivity</title>
<p>Next, we used an assay for the auditory evoked behavior response (AEBR) to quantify hearing loss in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> mutants. We exposed 6 dpf larvae to a loud pure tone stimulus (157 dB, 1000 Hz, 100 ms) once every 15 seconds for three minutes and recorded their startle responses (sample traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Larvae deficient in <italic>tmie</italic> appear to be profoundly deaf, with little to no response as compared to wild type siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). We then determined basal (unevoked) hair cell activity of <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> larvae using FM 1-43 or FM 4-64. Both are vital dyes that permeate open channels, making them useful as a proxy measure of the presence of active MET channels in hair cells [27, 28, 34]. A 30-second bath application of FM dye readily labels hair cells of the lateral line organ, which are arranged in superficial clusters called neuromasts. We briefly exposed wild type and <italic>tmie<sup>rul000</sup></italic> larvae to FM dye and then imaged the neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). Consistent with previous findings [21, 22, 26], <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> neuromasts have a severe reduction in FM labeling, suggesting that these hair cells have a MET defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1F</xref>). To characterize mechanically evoked responses of hair cells, we recorded extracellular potentials, or microphonics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1H</xref>). Using a piezo actuator, we applied a 200 Hz sine wave stimulus to 3 dpf larvae while simultaneously recording voltage responses from hair cells of the inner ear. In agreement with results from our FM dye assay and with microphonic recordings previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], microphonics are absent in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1H</xref>, gray trace).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Transgenic <italic>tmie-GFP</italic> rescues the functional defect in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> mutants</title>
<p>To rescue mechanosensitivity in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> larvae, we generated a construct of <italic>tmie</italic> tagged with GFP on its C-terminus, then expressed this transgene using a hair cell-specific promoter, <italic>myosin 6b (myo6b</italic>). Stably expressed Tmie-GFP rescued the FM labeling in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Tmie-GFP also restores microphonic potentials to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1H</xref>, orange trace). In a stable line with a single transgene insertion, we observed that Tmie-GFP expression varies among hair cells, even within the same patch of neuroepithelium (lateral crista, S1A Fig). Immature hair cells, which can be identified by their shorter stereocilia and kinocilia (S1A Fig, bracket and arrow, respectively), consistently show a bright and diffuse pattern of labeling. This high expression level in immature bundles is characteristic of transgenes expressed using the <italic>myo6b</italic> promoter, which drives expression more strongly in young hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. In mature hair cells, expression patterns of Tmie-GFP are variable. At high expression levels, Tmie-GFP is enriched in the bundle in a broader pattern (S1B Fig). At reduced levels, the GFP signal is concentrated at the beveled edge of the hair bundle (S1C Fig). At very low levels, we can observe puncta along the stereocilia staircase, consistent with localization at stereocilia tips (S1D Fig). We suspect that the diffuse &#x201C;bundle fill&#x201D; pattern is due to overexpression, and that lower levels of Tmie-GFP recapitulate the endogenous localization at the site of MET, as previously observed in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Tmie-GFP is capable of trafficking without other members of the MET complex</title>
<p>Having confirmed that our exogenously expressed Tmie-GFP is functional, we used this transgene to probe Tmie&#x2019;s role in the MET complex. First, we characterized Tmie&#x2019;s interactions with other MET proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> by expressing transgenic Tmie-GFP in mutant<italic>pcdh15a, lhfpl5a</italic>, and <italic>tomt</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). Because a triple knock-out of zebrafish <italic>tmc</italic> has not been reported, we used <italic>tomt</italic> mutants as a proxy for tmc-deficient fish based on recent studies of defective bundle localization of the Tmcs in tomt-deficient fish and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. As in wild type bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>), Tmie-GFP is detectable in the stereocilia in each of these MET mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B and 2D</xref>), even if hair bundles are splayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>, arrowheads). This result suggests that Tmie does not depend on interactions with other MET components for entry into the hair bundle.</p>

<title>Tmc1-GFP and Tmc2b-GFP fail to localize to stereocilia without Tmie</title>
<p>To determine if the loss of Tmie affects the other components of the mechanotransduction complex, we expressed GFP-tagged mechanotransduction proteins (Pcdh15aCD3, Lhfpl5a, Tmc1, and Tmc2b) in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> mutants. Both Pcdh15aCD3-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>) and GFP-Lhfpl5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>) showed GFP fluorescence in hair bundles with a punctate distribution, similar to the pattern seen in wild type bundles. This result is consistent with the intact morphology of <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> hair bundles. However, when we imaged Tmc1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>) and Tmc2b-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E</xref>), GFP fluorescence was severely reduced in the hair bundles of <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> mutants. In mature <italic>tmie<sup>rul000</sup></italic> hair cells, we often saw a signal within the apical soma near the cuticular plate, indicative of a trafficking defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E</xref>, arrows; position of cuticular plate denoted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1G</xref>). We quantified Tmc expression in the hair bundle region and observed a striking and consistent reduction in <italic>tmie</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3D and 3F</xref>). Previously, we reported that localization of transgenic Tmc-GFP is unaffected in <italic>pcdhl5a</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], demonstrating that mislocalization of Tmc1/2 is not a hallmark of all MET mutants.</p>

<title>Overexpression of Tmie increases bundle localization of Tmc2b-GFP</title>
<p>We hypothesized that if the loss of Tmie reduces Tmc localization in the hair bundle, then overexpression of Tmie may have the opposite effect. To test the consequence of overexpression of Tmie on Tmc localization, we created a second construct of <italic>tmie</italic> coupled with <italic>p2A-NLS(mCherry</italic>) driven by the <italic>myo6b</italic> promoter. The p2A linker is a self-cleaving peptide, which leads to translation of equimolar amounts of Tmie and NLS(mCherry). Hence, mCherry expression in the nucleus denotes Tmie expression in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3G</xref>, lower panels). We generated a stable <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> fish line carrying the <italic>tmie-p2A-NLS(mCherry</italic>) transgene and then crossed it to the <italic>Tg(myo6b:tmc2b-GFP); tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> line. We observed that overexpression of Tmie led to a 2.5-fold increase in expression of Tmc2b-GFP in the bundles of hair cells when compared to wild type siblings that carried only the <italic>tmc2b-GFP</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>). Combined with the finding that Tmc expression is lost in hair bundles lacking Tmie, our data suggest that Tmie positively regulates Tmc localization to the hair bundle.</p>

<title>Transgenes can effectively determine protein functionality</title>
<p>To gain a better understanding of Tmie&#x2019;s role in regulating the Tmcs, we characterized a new allele of <italic>tmie, t26171</italic>, which was isolated in a forward genetics screen for balance and hearing defects in zebrafish larvae. Sequencing revealed that <italic>tmie<sup>t26171</sup></italic> fish carry an A&#x2192;G mutation in the splice acceptor of the final exon of <italic>tmie</italic>, which leads to use of a nearby cryptic splice acceptor (S2A Fig, <italic>DNA, cDNA</italic>). Use of the cryptic acceptor causes a frameshift that terminates the protein at amino acid 139 (A140X), thus removing a significant portion of the C-terminal tail (S2A Fig, <italic>Protein</italic>). Homozygous mutant larvae exhibit severe auditory and vestibular deficits, being insensitive to acoustic stimuli and unable to maintain balance (S2A Fig, <italic>Balance</italic>). FM 4-64 labeling of <italic>tmie<sup>t26171</sup></italic> mutant hair cells suggests that the effect of the mutation is similar to the <italic>ru1000</italic> mutation (S2B and S2D Figs). This finding implicates the C-terminal tail, a previously uncharacterized region, in Tmie&#x2019;s role in MET. However, when we overexpressed a near-mimic of the predicted protein product of <italic>tmie<sup>t26171</sup></italic> (1-138-GFP) using the <italic>myo6b</italic> promoter, we observed full rescue of FM labeling defects in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> (S2C and S2D Figs), as well as behavioral rescue of balance and acoustic sensitivity (n&#x003D;19). These results revealed that when expressed at higher levels, loss of residues 139-231 does not have a significant impact on Tmie&#x2019;s ability to function.</p>
<p>This paradoxical finding highlighted an important advantage of the use of transgenes over traditional mutants. There are myriad reasons why a genomic mutation may lead to dysfunction, including reduced transcription or translation, protein misfolding and degradation, or mistrafficking. Exogenous expression may overcome these deficiencies by producing proteins at higher levels. Moreover, the use of transgenes enabled us to carry out a more comprehensive structure/function study of Tmie. To test a collection of deletions and chimeras of Tmie, we therefore used the <italic>myo6b</italic> promoter to drive exogenous expression of the constructs in hair cells of the <italic>tmie<sup>rul000</sup></italic> mutant.</p>
<p>We systematically deleted or replaced regions of <italic>tmie</italic> to generate 12 unique <italic>tmie</italic> constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). Earlier studies in zebrafish and mice proposed that Tmie undergoes cleavage, resulting in a single-pass mature protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, we generated the SP44-231 construct of Tmie, which replaced the N-terminus with a known signal peptide (SP) from a zebrafish Glutamate receptor protein (Gria2a). The purpose of the unrelated signal peptide was to preserve the predicted membrane topology of Tmie. We also made a similar construct that begins at amino acid 63, where the sequence of Tmie becomes highly conserved (<italic>SP63-231</italic>). Three of the constructs contained internal deletions (<italic>&#x0394;63-73; &#x0394;97-113; &#x039B;114-138</italic>). In three more constructs, we replaced part of or the entire second transmembrane helix (2TM) with a dissimilar helix from the CD8 glycoprotein (<italic>CD8; CD8-2TM; 2TM-CD8</italic>). We included our mimic of the zebrafish <italic>tmie<sup>t26171</sup></italic> mutant, which truncates the cytoplasmic C-terminus (<italic>1138</italic>). To further truncate the C-terminus, we made a construct that mimics the mouse <italic>sr<sup>J</sup></italic> mutant (<italic>1-113</italic>). In mice, this truncation recapitulates the full-deletion phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Finally, we included an alternate isoform of Tmie that uses a different final exon, changing the C-terminal sequence (<italic>Tmie-short</italic>). This isoform is found only in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and its function has not been explored.</p>

<title>Schema for a systematic domain analysis of Tmie and subcellular localization of Tmie constructs</title>
<p>(A) A linear diagram of 12 unique constructs of tmie used in our experiments. Full-length Tmie is predicted to contain two hydrophobic helices or transmembrane domains (1TM and 2TM). SP44-231 and SP63-231 replace part of the N-terminus with a signal peptide (SP) from the Glutamate receptor 2a (in blue). In the CD8, CD8-2TM, and 2TM-CD8 constructs, all or part of the 2TM is replaced by the helix from the CD8 glycoprotein (in yellow). Tmie-short is a fish-specific isoform of Tmie that contains an alternate final exon (in orange). Dotted lines represent internal deletions. (B) Representative confocal images of each construct being expressed as a GFP-tagged transgene in hair cells of 4-6 dpf <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> larvae. Expression is mosaic due to random genomic insertion into subsets of progenitor cells after single-cell injection. The expression of the CD8 construct is shown in a neuromast, while all others are in the inner ear middle crista. (C) The localization of each GFP fusion protein was determined by measuring the fluorescence/area in the bundle (b) and soma (s), and then calculating b/(b&#x002B;s). (D) Enrichment in the hair bundle is displayed as a ratio for each construct, with 1 being completely bundle-enriched and 0 being completely soma-enriched. Scale bar in (B): 5&#x03BC;m.</p></caption>

<title>Subcellular localization of mutated or chimeric Tmie reveals domains required for selflocalization to the bundle</title>
<p>We first determined the subcellular localization of each Tmie fusion protein. Plasmid DNA was co-injected into <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> eggs with transposase to generate mosaic expression of the constructs in a subset of hair cells. At 4-6 days post injection, we imaged individual hair cells expressing each transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). To quantify the enrichment in the bundle versus soma, we measured the integrated density of GFP fluorescence in a small central area of mature bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>, black oval) and separately in the plasma membrane or soma-enriched compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>, magenta oval). Correcting for area, we then divided the bundle values by the total values (bundle/bundle &#x002B; soma) and expressed this as a ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D</xref>). Values closer to 1 are bundle enriched, while values closer to 0 are soma-enriched. We excluded the <italic>CD8-GFP</italic> construct from further analyses because it was detected only in immature bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>, CD8).</p>
<p>Localization fell into three broad categories: bundle-enriched, soma-enriched, and equally distributed. Most of the fusion proteins were bundle-enriched, similar to full-length Tmie-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>). Three constructs were trafficked to the bundle but also expressed in the soma (<italic>SP63-231, CD8-2TM, 1-138</italic>). This result suggests that the deleted regions in these constructs have some role in designating Tmie as a bundle-localized protein. Also of note, the full replacement of the 2TM helix (<italic>CD8</italic>) was unable to maintain stable expression in mature bundles. Half-TM replacements (<italic>CD8-2TM, 2TM-CD8</italic>) revealed that loss of the first half of the helix affects trafficking, whereas alteration of the second half had no effect. Only two constructs were soma-enriched (<italic>Tmie-short</italic> and <italic>1-113</italic>), suggesting an inability to traffic to the bundle. These two transgenes were thus excluded from further analyses.</p>

While residues 63-73 have not been characterized, the &#x0394;97-113 result is consistent with the findings of previous publications in humans and mice, showing that mutations in this region impair hearing and hair cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Three constructs were capable of partial rescue (<italic>SP63-231, CD8-2TM</italic>, and <italic>2TM-CD8</italic>). Each one of the five dysfunctional constructs altered part of a contiguous region of Tmie: the 2TM and surrounding domains. These results highlight this region of Tmie as vital for function. To determine whether any of the constructs also have a dominant effect on hair-cell function, we compared FM label in wild type larvae with or without the individual transgenic <italic>tmie</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref>).

<title>Recordings of mechanically evoked responses confirm that the second transmembrane domain and adjacent regions are required for hair cell function</title>
<p>Bath applied FM dye demonstrates the presence of permeable MET channels, but does not reveal any changes in mechanically evoked responses in hair cells. Therefore, we also recorded microphonics of mutant larvae expressing individual transgenes. For our recordings, we inserted a recording pipette into the inner ear cavity of 3 dpf larvae and pressed a glass probe against the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). Using a piezo actuator to drive the probe, we delivered a step stimulus at increasing driver voltages while recording traces in current clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>). For each transgenic <italic>tmie</italic> line, we measured the amplitude of the response at the onset of stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6C-I</xref>).

<p>Three constructs showed full rescue of Tmc2b-GFP levels in the bundle. The SP44-231 cleavage mimic produced highly variable levels, some in the wild type range, others increasing Tmc2b-GFP expression above wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs 7B and 7H</xref>), as seen in overexpression of full-length Tmie (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>, right panel). We suspect that the exogenous Gria2a signal peptide leads to variable processing of Tmie and thus contributes to this variability in Tmc2b-GFP fluorescence. <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> larvae expressing the SP63-231 construct gave rise to values of Tmc2b-GFP fluorescence within the wild type range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C and 7H</xref>). When we recorded microphonics in these larvae, we found that co-overexpression of Tmc2b-GFP and SP63-231 resulted in better functional rescue of <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> (S3A Fig) than when SP63-231 was expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6E</xref>). We also determined that the microphonic potentials correlated with the levels of Tmc2b-GFP in the bundles (S3B Fig). Likewise, the 2TM-CD8 construct also generated values of Tmc2b-GFP fluorescence in the wild type range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7F and 7H</xref>). These larvae rescued microphonic potentials to wild type levels (S3C Fig), unlike when 2TM-CD8 was expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6E</xref>). Functional rescue again correlated with Tmc2b-GFP bundle levels (S3D Fig). These results indicate that functional rescue in the SP63-231 and 2TM-CD8 lines is Tmc dose-dependent.</p>
<p>Of the three constructs with little to no functional rescue, CD8-2TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7E and 7H</xref>) and &#x0394;97-113 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7G and 7H</xref>) had severely reduced levels of Tmc2b-GFP in hair bundles. In <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> expressing &#x0394;63-73, there was severely reduced but still faintly detectable Tmc2b-GFP signal though, as with the functional rescue, this difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7D and 7H</xref>). The bulk of this signal was observed in immature bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7D</xref>, arrows, and S4 Fig), but there was some detectable Tmc2b-GFP signal in mature bundles (S4 Fig). Overall, these results suggest that the level of functional rescue by the <italic>tmie</italic> constructs is correlated to the amount of Tmc2b present in the hair bundle.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>TMIE</italic> was first identified as a deafness gene in mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The predicted gene product is a relatively small membrane protein containing a highly conserved amino acid sequence near the second hydrophobic helix. Previous studies established that TMIE is required for MET in hair cells [21, 25, 26] and is an integral member of the complex (Zhao et al., 2014). How TMIE contributes to the function of the MET complex was not clear. Our comprehensive structure-function analysis of Tmie revealed that the functional capacity of various <italic>tmie</italic> mutant constructs is determined by their efficacy in localizing Tmc2b-GFP to the bundle, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8A</xref> and modeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8B</xref>. These findings unveil a hitherto unexpected role for Tmie in promoting the localization of the putative channel subunits Tmc1 and Tmc2b to the site of MET. These findings broaden our understanding of the assembly of the MET complex and point to a pivotal role of Tmie in this process.</p>

<p>A previous study of the <italic>ru1000</italic> mutant suggested that Tmie&#x2019;s role in zebrafish hair cells was developmental, with mutant lateral line hair cells showing stunted kinocilia and the absence of tip links [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. In our hands we did not observe any gross morphological defects, and the localization pattern and the levels of Pcdh15a and Lhfpl5a were unaffected in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> larvae. This observation is consistent with intact hair bundle morphology; stereocilia that are splayed or disorganized are a dominant feature of hair cells missing their tip links, as seen in <italic>pcdh15a</italic> or <italic>lhfpl5a</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. In TMIE-deficient mice, hair cell morphology is grossly normal up to P7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In agreement with a previous study in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], our results indicate that <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> mutants are profoundly deaf due to ablation of MET in hair cells. We fully rescued this deficit in zebrafish <italic>ru1000</italic> mutants by exogenous expression of a GFP-tagged transgene of <italic>tmie</italic>. Exogenous expression gave rise to variable levels of Tmie-GFP in hair bundles, with lower levels revealing a punctate pattern expected for a member of the MET complex, and higher expression levels leading to expression throughout the stereocilia. Excess Tmie-GFP did not appear to cause adverse effects in hair cells, which is consistent with a previous study in the <italic>circler</italic> mouse mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Tmie can localize to hair bundles independently</title>
<p>To determine the interdependence of trafficking of Tmie and the other MET components, we examined the localization of Tmie-GFP in mutants of essential MET genes: the tip-link protein <italic>pcdh15a</italic>; the accessory protein <italic>lhfpl5a</italic>; and in <italic>tomt</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>). In both zebrafish and mice, the secretory pathway protein Tomt is required for proper localization of the Tmc1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]; the <italic>tomt</italic> mutant likely simulates the condition of a triple knockout of all three zebrafish <italic>tmc</italic> genes (<italic>tmc1/2a/2b</italic>). Despite the absence of Pcdh15a, Lhfpl5a, and Tmcs, we found that Tmie-GFP still traffics to the bundles of hair cells. This finding suggests that Tmie can localize independently of the other proteins of the MET apparatus. This autonomy is an unusual feature for membrane components of the MET complex. For example, PCDH15 largely requires LHFPL5 for trafficking to the stereocilia [17, 18, 38], and depends on Cadherin 23 to maintain its localization at the site of MET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. LHFPL5 also requires PCDH15 to maintain localization at the stereocilia tips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Thus, Tmie appears to be the exception to the rule of co-dependent transport to the hair bundle.</p>
<p>Our results reveal that Tmie has distinct regions associated with self-localization and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8</xref>). Three constructs showed impaired targeting of Tmie to the bundle, namely SP63-231, CD8-2TM, and the 1-138 construct, the last of which truncates the C-terminus. Further manipulation to the C-terminus, either by removing more amino acids (<italic>1-113</italic>) or by using an alternative final exon (<italic>Tmie-short</italic>), results in targeting of the protein to the plasma membrane instead of the bundle. However, removing just a smaller internal segment has no effect on bundle localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>, <italic>&#x039B;114-138</italic>). We suspect that the abundance of charged residues in the C-terminus of Tmie (S2A Fig, <italic>Protein</italic>), as well as the regions altered in SP63-231 and CD8-2TM, contribute to recognition by bundle trafficking machinery. Mislocalization, however, did not necessarily correlate with functional rescue. Despite partial mislocalization to the plasma membrane, the 1-138 construct showed full functional rescue. Conversely, despite normal localization to the bundle, &#x0394;97-113 did not rescue function at all. These results demonstrate that Tmie&#x2019;s functional role is separate from its ability to target to the bundle.</p>

<title>Tmie promotes the levels of Tmc1/2 in the hair bundle</title>
<p>The regulatory role of Tmie with respect to the Tmcs is strongly supported by the strikingly different effects of loss of Tmie versus overexpression of Tmie. When Tmie is absent, so are the Tmcs; when Tmie is overexpressed, the level of Tmc2b in the bundle is boosted as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C-H</xref>). These results disagree with a previous finding in mice showing that Myc-TMC2 is present in hair bundles of TMIE-deficient cochlear hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. This discrepancy may be due to the use a cytomegalovirus promoter to drive high levels of expression of Myc-TMC2 in an <italic>in vitro</italic> explant of cochlear tissue. Localization of TMC1 in <italic>Tmie-/-</italic> mice, which is the predominant TMC protein in cochlear hair cells, was not reported. In addition, localization of the TMCs in vestibular hair cells was not characterized in <italic>Tmie-/-</italic> mice. Thus, further investigation is warranted to determine if the relationship between Tmie and the Tmcs uncovered by our experiments is a conserved feature or is potentially dependent on the type of hair cell, as MET components may vary among different cell types.</p>
<p>One important question is whether Tmie and the Tmcs can physically interact to form a complex that is transported to the hair bundle. A direct interaction of the mouse TMC1/2 and TMIE proteins was not detected in a heterologous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], however, our <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis suggests the possibility of an indirect interaction. The deletions and chimeric forms of Tmie in the present study highlight important motifs or regions of Tmie that are critical for localization of the Tmcs to the hair bundle.</p>

<title>The first hydrophobic helix of Tmie is dispensable</title>
<p>The membrane topology of Tmie has not been biochemically determined, however, online <italic>Phobius</italic> software predicts an N-terminal signal peptide in mouse and human TMIE and a transmembrane helix in zebrafish Tmie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Interestingly, the orthologues in C. elegans or Drosophila do not contain this first hydrophobic region of Tmie. Upon removal of this region, we observed that SP44-231 behaved like full-length Tmie, with a comparable pattern of localization and full functional rescue of <italic>tmie-deficient</italic> fish. In addition, SP44-231 rescues Tmc2b-GFP bundle expression to wild type levels or higher. To our knowledge, these results are the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that Tmie can function without the putative first transmembrane domain. Our study supports the notion that Tmie undergoes cleavage, resulting in a single-pass membrane protein that functions in the MET complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>

<title>The 2TM domain and adjacent regions of Tmie are functionally significant</title>
<p>The key functional domains of Tmie are located within and proximal to the remaining transmembrane domain. We found that replacement of the entire transmembrane domain with an exogenous membrane helix from the CD8 glycoprotein resulted in a protein that trafficked to the bundles of immature hair cells but was not expressed in mature bundles. This finding demonstrates that this domain is vital for stable localization of Tmie in mature hair cells. Half-chimeras of this domain revealed that the mislocalization effect is exclusive to the first half of the helix, but that both halves are functionally significant (the first half more so than the second). These results suggest that the transmembrane domain is critical for both Tmie&#x2019;s localization and function in the MET complex.</p>
<p>Removal of the cytoplasmic amino acids 97-113, directly after the 2TM, leads to a normal localization pattern but complete loss of function. This region contains arginine residues that have previously been implicated in human deafness [23, 41-43]. Mimics of these mutations in mouse cochlear hair cells lead to altered MET currents, which has been attributed to a reduction in binding to PCDH15-CD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, one of the mouse mutations, R93W, resulted in loss of TMIE localization at the site of MET. In contrast to these findings, when we remove this entire intracellular region from zebrafish Tmie, it is still capable of localization in hair bundles. This result may reflect species differences in recognition sequences for trafficking machinery.</p>
<p>The SP63-231 and &#x0394;63-73 constructs both lack different segments of the extracellular region of Tmie. These were the only two constructs with dominant negative effects, suggesting that each construct successfully integrates into the MET complex and interferes or competes with endogenous Tmie. Both constructs only minimally rescue mechanosensitivity in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> mutants and are thus predicted to weaken the efficiency of the MET complex. Other constructs such as the transmembrane chimeras also yield partial rescue but do not appear to affect the function of endogenous Tmie in wild-type hair cells. These data suggest that the full 2TM domain is required to produce the dominant negative effect on endogenous Tmie. Combined with the finding that replacement of the 2TM with an unrelated helix causes instability of Tmie in mature hair cells, we suggest that the 2TM is essential in integrating Tmie into the MET complex.</p>

<title>Impaired functionality corresponds to decreased Tmc expression</title>
<p>When co-expressed with Tmc2b-GFP, our Tmie constructs reveal a strong link between function and Tmc bundle expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs 7</xref> and S3). In larvae expressing CD8-2TM and &#x0394;97-113, both of which display little or no functional rescue, there is no detectable Tmc2b-GFP in the hair bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7E</xref>, 7G and 7H). In addition to defects in targeting Tmcs to the hair bundle, our data also suggest a role for Tmie in maintaining the levels of Tmc2b in stereocilia. The most dramatic effect on maintenance of Tmc signal in the bundle was seen in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> larvae expressing the &#x0394;63-73 construct. In these larvae, Tmc2b-GFP successfully traffics to the bundle in immature hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7D</xref>, arrows) but does not maintain strong expression in mature cells (S4 Fig). Based on this data, we conclude that the first half of the transmembrane domain and the intracellular residues 97-113 are involved in trafficking the Tmcs to the site of MET, while the extracellular residues 63-73 stabilize Tmc expression in the MET complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, SP63-231 and 2TM-CD8 rescue Tmc2b-GFP to wild type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C, 7F and 7H</xref>), even though functional rescue of <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> by GFP-tagged versions was reduced in both FM labeling experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>) and microphonic recordings of the inner ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). This result hints at an additional role for Tmie in MET that is independent of Tmc trafficking. However, the low level of functional rescue in <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> mutants by these two constructs was only observed in the background of endogenous levels of the Tmcs. When we co-expressed Tmc2b-GFP with either SP63-231 or 2TM-CD8, then the functional rescue of <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> mechanosensitivity improved in a Tmc-dose-dependent manner (S3 Fig). Since co-expression of Tmc2b-GFP can overcome the functional deficit in SP63-231 and 2TM-CD8, we propose that residues 44-62 and the second half of the 2TM are important but not absolutely essential to regulating Tmc bundle expression. This finding reinforces the significance of our findings with the constructs &#x0394;63-73, CD8-2TM, and &#x0394;97-113, which still fail to rescue Tmc2b-GFP levels even when Tmc2b-GFP is co-expressed.</p>
<p>Through a systematic <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of <italic>tmie</italic> via transgenic expression, we identified new functional domains of Tmie. We demonstrated a strong link between Tmie&#x2019;s function and Tmc1/2 expression in the bundle. Evidence continues to mount that the Tmcs are subunits of the MET channel, and our results implicate Tmie in promoting and maintaining the localization of Tmc subunits at the site of MET. The precise mechanism underlying Tmie&#x2019;s regulation of the Tmcs awaits further investigation.</p>

<p>To generate the <italic>tmie</italic> expression vectors, we used the Tol2/Gateway system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].

Responses were recorded in the dark inside a Zebrabox monitoring system (ViewPoint Life Sciences). Peaks represent pixel changes from larval movement. A response was considered positive if it occurred within two seconds after the stimulus and surpassed threshold to be considered evoked, not spontaneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>, green indicates movement detected, magenta indicates threshold surpassed).

Two glass fibers straddled the yolk to pin the larvae against a perpendicular cross-fiber. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass with filament, O.D.: 1.5 mm, O.D.:0. 86 mm, 10 cm length (Sutter, item # BF150-86-10, fire polished). Using the Sutter Puller (model P-97), we pulled the pipettes into a long shank with a resistance of 10-20M&#x03A9;. We then used a Sutter Beveler with impedance meter (model BV-10C) to bevel the edges of the recording pipettes to a resistance of 3-6 M&#x03A9;. We pulled a second pipette to a long shank and fire polished to a closed bulb, and then attached this rod to a piezo actuator (shielded with tin foil). The rod was then pressed to the front of the head behind the lower eye, level with the otoliths in the ear of interest, to hold the head in place while the recording pipette was advanced until it pierced the inner ear cover. Although it has been demonstrated that size of response is unchanged by entry point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], we maintained a consistent entry point dorsal to the anterior crista and lateral to the posterior crista (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). After the recording pipette was situated, the piezo pipette was then moved back to a position in light contact with the head. We drove the piezo with a High Power Amplifier (piezosystem jena, System ENT/ENV, serial # E18605), and recorded responses in current clamp mode with a patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA, EPC 10 usb double, serial # 550089). Each stimulus was of 20 ms duration, with 20 ms pre-and post-stimulus periods. We used either a sine wave or a voltage step and recorded at 20 kHz, collecting 200 traces per experiment. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1H</xref>, we used a 200 Hz sine wave at 10V, based on reports that 200 Hz elicited the strongest response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>].

Microphonic potential responses were amplified 1000x and filtered between 0.1-3000 Hz by the Brownlee Precision Instrumentation Amplifier (Model 440). We used Igor Pro for analysis. We averaged each set of 200 traces to generate one trace response per fish, then measured baseline-to-peak amplitude.

<p>We sorted 30 wild type and 30 <italic>t26171</italic> larvae by behavior (tap sensitivity and balance defect at 5 dpf) and extracted RNA using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Larvae were homogenized using a 1ml syringe. To generate the cDNA for the short isoform of Tmie (Tmie-short) and the t26171 allele, we performed RT-PCR on these RNA samples using the RNA to cDNA EcoDry Premix (Clontech, Cat # 639549). Primers are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Both transcripts were verified by DNA sequencing.</p>

<p><bold>S1 Fig. Tmie-GFP shows variable expression in stereocilia</bold>. Representative images of the lateral crista in a wild type larva at 6 dpf, generated using confocal microscopy. (A) The hair bundle region of hair cells expressing transgenic tmie-GFP driven by the myo6b promoter. The arrow and bracket show, respectively, the short kinocilium and stereocilia bundle of an immature hair cell. (B) A single hair bundle with &#x201C;bundle fill&#x201D; expression pattern produced by overexpression of Tmie-GFP. (C) A single bundle with Tmie-GFP concentrated along the beveled edge of the stereocilial staircase. (D) A single bundle with punctate expression of Tmie-GFP suggestive of localization at the site of MET. Scale bar in (A): 5&#x03BC;m, in (D): 2&#x03BC;m.</p>
<p><bold>S2 Fig. Differential effects on function with a genomic mutation and a transgene mimic</bold>.(A) Data for a novel mutant allele of tmie, <italic>t26171</italic>. DNA: Chromatographs of the DNA sequence of tmie in wild type (above) and <italic>tmie<sup>t26171</sup></italic> (below) showing the genomic region where the mutation occurs. An arginine is mutated to guanine in the splice acceptor (black box, above) of the final exon of tmie, exon 4. The dashed black box below indicates the mutated original splice acceptor site. Use of a cryptic splice acceptor (black box, below) 8 nucleotides downstream causes a frameshift and an early stop codon (&#x002A;). cDNA: Chromatograph of the DNA sequence from RT-PCR of <italic>tmie<sup>t26171</sup></italic> larvae bridging exons 3 and 4. Protein: The predicted protein products, shown here as a two-pass transmembrane protein. The wild type protein has many charged residues (positive in light gray, negative in dark gray) that are lost in <italic>tmie</italic><sup>t26171</sup>. Balance: Photos of wild type and <italic>tmie<sup>t26171</sup></italic> larvae, taken with a hand-held Canon camera. Arrow points to a larva that is upside-down, displaying a classic vestibular phenotype. (B) Top-down view of a representative neuromast after exposure to FM 4-64, imaged using confocal microscopy. The first panel is a single plane through the soma region while the second panel is a maximum projection of 7 panels through the soma region, beginning at the cuticular plate (as denoted by magenta bracket in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1G</xref>). (C) Same as (B) except that the first panel shows the bundle region so that 1-138-GFP can be visualized in bundles (as depicted by dashed green line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1G</xref>). The transgene is driven by the myo6b promoter. (D) Plot of the integrated density of FM fluorescence per cell as a percent of wild type siblings. Displayed wild type and <italic>tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic> data are from siblings of <italic>Tg(1-138-GFP); tmie<sup>ru1000</sup></italic>, while <italic>tmie<sup>t26171</sup></italic> data are from a separate experiment. Statistical significance determined by one-way ANOVA, &#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;p&#x003C;0.0001. Scale bar: 10&#x03BC;m.</p>
<p><bold>S3 Fig. Functional rescue of tmieru1000 by constructs SP63-231 and 2TM-CD8 is Tmc dose-dependent</bold>. (A) Mean amplitude of the response peak &#x00B1; SD as a function of the stimulus intensity of the driver voltage, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>. (B) XY plot of the amplitude of microphonic response vs the integrated density of Tmc2b-GFP fluorescence in the ROI. A 10V step stimulus was used to evoke microphonic potentials. The line is a linear regression, R<sup>2</sup>&#x003D; 0.5216. (C) Same as (A) for the 2TM-CD8 construct. (D) Same as (B) for the 2TM-CD8 construct, R<sup>2</sup>&#x003D; 0.7726. Measurements are from 4 dpf larvae.</p>
<p><bold>S4 Fig. In &#x0394;63-73, Tmc2b-GFP traffics to bundles but does not maintain high expression in mature cells</bold>. Confocal images of single hair bundles from cells expressing transgenic Tmc2b-GFP driven by the myo6b promoter. Brackets show the stereocilia bundle, which is shorter in immature hair cells (white brackets) and longer in mature ones (black brackets). Larvae are 4 dpf. Scale bar: 2&#x03BC;m.</p>
