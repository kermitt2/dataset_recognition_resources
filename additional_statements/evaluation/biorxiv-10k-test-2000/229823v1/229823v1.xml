<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>The melioidosis bacterium, <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic>, is increasingly being recognized as a pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We have recently catalogued genome-wide variation of paired, isogenic <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> isolates from seven Australasian CF cases, which were collected between four and 55 months apart. Here, we extend this investigation by documenting the transcriptomic changes in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in five cases. Following growth in an artificial CF sputum medium, four of the five paired isolates exhibited significant differential gene expression (DE) that affected between 32 and 792 genes. The greatest number of DE events was observed between patient CF9 strains, consistent with the hypermutator status of the latter strain, which is deficient in the DNA mismatch repair protein MutS. Two patient isolates harbored duplications that concomitantly increased expression of the &#x03B2;-lactamase gene <italic>penA</italic>, and a 35kb deletion in another abolished expression of 29 genes. Convergent expression profiles in the chronically-adapted isolates identified two significantly downregulated and 17 significantly upregulated loci, including the antibiotic resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump BpeEF-OprC, the quorum-sensing <italic>hhqABCDE</italic> operon, and a cyanide- and pyocyanin-insensitive cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> quinol oxidase. These convergent pathoadaptations lead to increased expression of pathways that may suppress competing bacterial and fungal pathogens and that enhance survival in oxygen-restricted environments, the latter of which may render conventional antibiotics less effective <italic>in vivo</italic>. Treating chronically-adapted <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infections with antibiotics designed to target anaerobic infections, such as the nitroimidazole class of antibiotics, may significantly improve pathogen eradication attempts by exploiting this Achilles heel.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The Gram-negative soil-dwelling bacterium <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> causes melioidosis, an opportunistic tropical infectious disease of humans and animals that has a high fatality rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wiersinga et al. 2012</xref>). <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> is found in many tropical and subtropical regions globally, and has been unmasked in temperate and even arid environments following unusually wet weather events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yip et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chapple et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sarovich et al. 2016</xref>). Infection occurs following percutaneous inoculation from contaminated soil or water, inhalation, or ingestion. Melioidosis symptoms vary widely due to the ability for <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> to infect almost any organ, with pneumonia being the most common presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Leelarasamee and Bovornkitti 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Currie et al. 2010</xref>). Individuals most at risk of contracting melioidosis include diabetics, those with hazardous alcohol consumption, and the immunosuppressed. There has been increasing recognition that people with chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) are also at a heightened risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Holland et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">O'Carroll et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>CF is a heritable disorder of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene, and defects in CFTR lead to exaggerated and ineffective airway inflammation, an imbalance in salt regulation in the lungs and pancreas, and a chronic overproduction of thick and sticky mucus in the airways and digestive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amaral 2015</xref>). Impaired immunity and mucus clearance encourage infection and subsequent persistence and adaptation of opportunistic bacterial pathogens in the CF lung, leading to the development of bronchiectasis with subsequent progressive pulmonary decline, and ultimately, loss of pulmonary function and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cohen and Prince 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The most common pathogens of the CF lung comprise <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, and less commonly, <italic>Achromobacter xylosoxidans</italic>, non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> and certain <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species, including <italic>B. cepacia</italic> complex species and <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coutinho et al. 2008</xref>). The most common and best-studied CF pathogen is <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which can adapt to the CF lung environment via various mechanisms. Convergent pathoadaptations in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> include the downregulation or loss of virulence factors and motility-encoding loci, emergence of hypermutators, enhanced antibiotic resistance and immune evasion facilitated by a switch to mucoidy and a biofilm-based lifestyle, and altered expression of other loci enhancing bacterial metabolism and survival within the nutrient-poor CF lung environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cohen and Prince 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Winstanley et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Improving life expectancy for those with CF has led to an increased risk of exposure to <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> following travel to melioidosis-endemic regions. Although uncommon, infection of the CF lung by <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> has now been documented in at least 25 cases worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Geake et al. 2015</xref>). Due to low total case numbers, comparatively little is understood about the pathogenic role of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in CF pulmonary disease. The most common clinical presentation is chronic carriage (76&#x0025;), which is associated with accelerated lung function decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Geake et al. 2015</xref>). This prevalence contrasts with melioidosis in non-CF patients, where chronic carriage is exceedingly rare, occurring in only 0.2&#x0025; of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Price et al. 2015</xref>). To better understand <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> pathoadaptation in the CF lung, we recently investigated the genome-wide evolution of isogenic <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> strains isolated from seven Australasian CF patients, which were collected between 4 and 55 months apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>s). Hallmarks of these infections included <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> persistence despite multiple eradication attempts, multidrug resistance, mutations in virulence, metabolism and cell wall components, and the first-documented case of hypermutation in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>. In all except one case, multiple single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and insertion-deletion (indel) mutations were identified, with a high rate of nonsynonymous mutations, many of which were predicted to affect protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>RNA-seq provides a detailed view of the transcriptional landscape in bacterial isolates grown under different conditions or niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sharma et al. 2010</xref>), and is now a well-established method for examining differential gene expression (DE) in bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Creecy and Conway 2015</xref>) . Here, we performed bacterial RNA-seq on five of the CF cases that we have recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>) to catalogue both within-host and convergent transcriptional evolution during long-term <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infection in the CF lung. Paired isolates representing the initial and the most recent cultures available from each patient were compared. <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> cultures were grown in an artificial sputum medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sriramulu et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fung et al. 2010</xref>) to mimic the conditions found in the CF lung environment.</p>

<title>Differential gene expression among CF isogenic pairs</title>
<p>DE was observed in four of the five CF pairs, with only the CF10 pair failing to yield significant transcriptional differences (i.e. no genes with a &#x2265;1.5 log<sub>2</sub>-fold change and a false discovery rate (FDR) of &#x2264;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We have previously shown that no genetic variants separate the CF10 strains, which had the shortest time between collection of only 10 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). This lack of significant transcriptional differences rules out epigenetic effects on gene expression between this pair, at least under the tested growth conditions, and illustrates that RNA-seq is a robust methodology that is not readily prone to false-positive results.</p>

Four of the five pairs exhibited DE; CF10, with the shortest time between isolates, exhibited no genetic or significant transcriptomic changes. CF6, CF8, CF9 and CF11 pairs were separated by 229, 32, 792 and 169 DE loci, respectively. The 32 DE loci in CF8 were all downregulated; DE genes in CF6, CF9 and CF11 were down- or up-regulated. Nineteen loci were DE between initial and latter isolates, of which 17 were upregulated. Blue, genes with no significant DE; red, genes with significant DE.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="229823_fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>Of the four pairs with significant DE, the CF8 pair had the least with 32 loci, followed by CF11, CF6 and CF9 with 169, 229 and 792 DE loci, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These paired isolates were collected 46, 14, 27 and 55 months apart, respectively. There was good correlation between the proportion of DE loci and the genome-wide mutations catalogued between these isolate pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>), with 12, 15, 24, and 112 mutational events (i.e. SNPs, indels, deletions or gene duplications) identified in CF8, CF11, CF6 and CF9, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The elevated number of mutations seen in CF9 is due to a <italic>mutS</italic> mutation in the latter strain, which confers a hypermutator phenotype, the first time hypermutation has been described in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>); this in turn contributes to a high number of DE genes. However, when comparing the ratio of DE genes to mutational events, CF11 had the highest proportion of DE genes (11.3), followed by CF6 (9.5), CF9 (7.1) and CF8 (2.7). There was a significant skew in DE towards genes located on chromosome II, which contains a lower proportion of housekeeping genes than chromosome I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holden et al. 2004</xref>). Despite encoding only 44&#x0025; of the genome by size and 41&#x0025; of coding sequences, chromosome II loci were significantly overrepresented in the non-hypermutator CF pairs (Pearson&#x2019;s X<sup>2</sup> test <italic>p</italic>&#x003C;0.001), with between 63 and 97&#x0025; of the DE genes residing on chromosome II. In CF9, there was a non-significant trend towards chromosome II loci, with 52&#x0025; of DE loci located on this chromosome, pointing to the more random nature of mutations in the CF9 hypermutator compared with the other cases (Table S1).</p>

<title>Many DE genes are absent in <italic>Burkholderia mallei</italic> and in chronic-carriage melioidosis Patient 314</title>
<p><italic>B. mallei</italic>, the causative agent of glanders, is an equine-adapted clone of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> that continues to undergo dramatic reductive evolution, having already shed &#x007E;1.3-1. 5Mbp of its genome since its divergence from <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holden et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al. 2013</xref>). As a consequence, this bacterium does not survive in the environment, although it remains highly pathogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dvorak and Spickler 2008</xref>). <italic>B. mallei</italic> therefore provides a useful comparison for examining DE in the CF <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> strains due to similar genome-wide patterns of locus loss and adaptation to a mammalian host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). We also compared the DE loci in the CF strains to those genes mutated in chronic-carriage melioidosis case P314. P314 has the longest <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infection ever documented, and despite multiple eradication attempts, continues to harbor this bacterium in her lungs since she was first diagnosed in 2000. The genome of a 139-month isolate from P314, MSHR6686, shows dramatic adaptation to the lung environment, including the loss of 285kb of chromosome II at four separate locations that collectively encompass 221 genes; &#x007E;50&#x0025; of these genes are also absent in <italic>B. mallei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>When compared with genes lost in 17 <italic>B. mallei</italic> strains (092700E 11, 2000031063, 2000031281, 2002721280, 6, A188, A193, ATCC10399, ATCC23344, BMQ, China5, China7, FMH23344, GB8horse4, JHU, and PRL-20), there was a 23, 27, 33 and 100&#x0025; overlap with DE genes in the latter isolates from CF9, CF6, CF11 and CF8, respectively, and when compared with genes lost in MSHR6686, there was a 9, 15, 20 and 97&#x0025; overlap, respectively (Table S1). The proportion of downregulated genes varied across this dataset, ranging from 13&#x0025; for CF11 to 100&#x0025; for CF8, demonstrating that the effect on gene expression at these loci is not unidirectional, with certain overlap loci in fact being upregulated in CF6, CF9 and CF11. Of note, all 29 genes (<italic>BPSS1131-BPSS1159</italic>) that were lost due to a large deletion in the latter CF8 isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>) were also absent in <italic>B. mallei</italic> and MSHR6686 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al. 2013</xref>), providing further evidence of their dispensability for long-term <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> survival in the mammalian host. As expected, DE showed dramatic downregulation of between 8- and 14- log2 fold (341 to 15,886x) of these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>DE of surface antigens in the CF6, CF9 and CF11 pairs</title>
<p><italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> produces four capsular polysaccharides (CPS-I to -IV) and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, only CPS-I (encoded by <italic>BPSL2786-BPSL2810</italic>) and LPS (encoded by <italic>BPSL1936</italic> and <italic>BPSL2672-BPSL2688</italic>) are associated with virulence in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Reckseidler-Zenteno et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stone et al. 2014</xref>). The remaining three capsule clusters are found in <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> but are not present or intact in <italic>B. mallei</italic>. Our previous genomic analysis of the CF pairs identified missense mutations affecting the LPS loci <italic>wzt</italic> (<italic>BPSL2681</italic>) and <italic>rmlA</italic> (<italic>BPSL2685</italic>) in CF6, a missense mutation affecting the putative LPS biosynthesis gene <italic>BPSL1119</italic> in CF11, and a CPS-I frameshift mutation affecting <italic>wcbA</italic> (<italic>BPSL2809</italic>) in CF11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). Consistent with being under heavy selection during chronic infection, we observed DE of several surface polysaccharide loci in the CF6, CF9 and CF11 pairs, the most dramatic of these being in CF9, with forty-six downregulated surface polysaccharide genes (Table S1).</p>
<p>The LPS loci <italic>wbiE</italic> (<italic>BPSL2676</italic>) and <italic>wbiD</italic> (<italic>BPSL2677</italic>) were downregulated by &#x007E;1.8-fold (3x) in the latter CF9 isolate. In addition, the poorly characterized LPS biosynthesis-related membrane protein loci <italic>BPSS1683-BPSS1685</italic> were downregulated by &#x007E;5.9-fold (60x). This isolate also exhibited downregulation of all CPS-I loci (except <italic>wcbC</italic>) by between 1.7- and 3.1-fold (3 to 8x). In contrast, the latter isolate from CF11 showed upregulation of the CPS-I loci <italic>BPSL2793-BPSL2797</italic> (<italic>wcbN-wcbM-gmhA-wcbL-wcbK</italic>) when compared with its initial isolate, with increases ranging from 2.7 to 6.1-fold (7 to 69x). However, when compared with initial isolates from CF6, CF8, CF9 and CF10, expression of <italic>BPSL2793</italic>-<italic>BPSL2797</italic> in the latter CF11 strain was in fact downregulated (3.4 to 4.5-fold; 11 to 23x). This observation was confirmed as significant downregulation of these loci in the initial CF11 strain (by between 6.1- and 10.1-fold; 69 to 1,098x) when compared with all other initial strains, rather than significant upregulation of these CPS-I loci in the latter CF11 strain.</p>
<p>Unlike CPS-I, expression of the CPS-II cluster (<italic>BPSS0417-BPSS0429</italic>) is induced when grown in water, suggesting that this polysaccharide plays a role in environmental survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">ReckseidlerZenteno et al. 2010</xref>). One locus involved in CPS-II biosynthesis, <italic>BPSS0425</italic>, was downregulated (1.8-fold; 4x) in CF6, and the entire cluster was downregulated in CF9 (range: 2.5- to 5.2-fold; 6 to 37x). Conversely, <italic>BPSS0417</italic> and <italic>BPSS0418</italic> were upregulated in CF11 (1.6- and 1.7-fold; 3x), respectively.

The genes encoding CPS-III (<italic>BPSS1825-BPSS1835</italic>) were significantly downregulated in the latter isolates from CF6 (2.4- to 3.1-fold; 5 to 9x) and CF9 (5.6- to 7.5-fold; 50 to 178x). Finally, two genes within the CPS-IV cluster (<italic>BPSL2769-BPSL2785</italic>) were downregulated in CF9 (<italic>BPSL2782</italic> and <italic>BPSL2785;</italic> 1.8- to 2.8- fold; 3 to 7x) but 11/17 loci from this cluster were upregulated in CF11 by 1.7- to 5.9-fold (<italic>BPSL2769, BPSL2775-BPSL2784</italic>). However, unlike CPS-I and CPS-II, this pattern of upregulation in both CF11 isolates was maintained for CPS-IV loci <italic>BPSL2769</italic> and <italic>BPSL2775-BPSL2781</italic> even when compared with the initial CF6, CF8, CF9 and CF10 isolates (2.0- to 4.0- fold; 4 to 16x).</p>

<title>DE of other virulence-associated loci</title>
<p>In addition to CPS-I and LPS, <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> encodes for several other virulence factors that enhance organism survival and replication upon infection or that subvert or disarm host defenses. These factors include adhesins, flagella, fimbriae, pili, specialized secretion systems, actin motility proteins, secreted factors and secondary metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stone et al. 2014</xref>). Although virulence factors are often critically important during the acute stages of infection, they can become disadvantageous for long-term survival, presumably due their immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Winstanley et al. 2016</xref>). Consistent with loss-of-virulence as a pathoadaptive mechanism in chronic <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infections, we have previously documented missense mutations affecting the Type 3 secretion system 3 (T3SS-S) gene <italic>bsaW</italic> in CF6, and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> biofilm factor A <italic>bbfA</italic> and fimbrial protein BPSL1628 in CF9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). When examining RNA-seq profiles, other virulence genes lacking genetic mutations were found to be significantly downregulated in the latter CF isolates. These loci included three Type IV pilus 7 (TFP7) loci (<italic>pilR, pilG</italic> and <italic>pilN</italic>; 1.7-fold; 3x), the lysozyme inhibitor <italic>BPSL1057</italic> (3.4-fold; 11x), Burkholderia lethal factor 1 (3.2-fold; 10x), four T3SS-3 loci (<italic>bsaS, bsaP, bsaO</italic> and <italic>bsaN</italic>), and 16 flagellum loci in CF9 (average 2.5-fold; 6x), and a trimeric autotransporter adhesin (<italic>bpaC; BPSL1631</italic>) in CF11 (1.6-fold; 3x).

<title>Several regulators with decreased transcription in the CF isolates are absent in <italic>B. mallei</italic></title>
<p>We hypothesized that downregulation of transcriptional regulators, particularly those absent in <italic>B. mallei</italic>, would be identified in the latter CF isolates due to niche adaptation. As predicted, two of the four pairs exhibited significant downregulation of transcriptional regulators. The first of these, the Fis family regulatory protein YfhA (encoded by <italic>BPSL0350</italic>), was downregulated by &#x007E;2.7-fold (&#x007E;7x) in both CF6 and CF9.

Thus, the downregulation of Fis in CF6 and CF9 may be responsible for concomitant downregulation of CPS-II and CPS-III loci in these two patients, among other loci. Additional regulators downregulated in CF9 that are absent in <italic>B. mallei</italic> include the transmembrane regulator PrtR (<italic>BPSL0069;</italic> 2.7-fold), two LysrR-family transcriptional regulators (<italic>BPSS0438</italic> and <italic>BPSS2207;</italic> both 1.7-fold) and the metal-related two-component system response regulator IrlR2 (<italic>BPSS1994;</italic> 2.7-fold).</p>

<title>High-level TMP/SMX resistance in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> involves <italic>bpeEF-oprC</italic> upregulation</title>
<p>The combination antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), the antibiotic of choice in the eradication phase of melioidosis treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lipsitz et al. 2012</xref>), was administered to CF6, CF9 and CF11 during their <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> eradication attempts. Acquired resistance towards this antibiotic emerged in the latter isolates from CF6 and CF11, and in midpoint isolates from CF9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). The resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) efflux pump, BpeEF-OprC, is responsible for widespread TMP resistance in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> and has been implicated in TMP/SMX resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Podnecky et al. 2017</xref>). BpeEF-OprC (<italic>BPSS0292-BPSS0294</italic>) expression is under the control of two LysR-type regulators, BpeT (BPSS0290) and BpeS (BPSL0731). We therefore expected to observe upregulation of <italic>bpeEF-oprC</italic> in CF strains with elevated TMP/SMX MICs, consistent with defective <italic>bpeT</italic> or <italic>bpeS</italic> loci.</p>
<p>The latter isolate from CF6, which encodes a T314fs mutation in <italic>bpeT</italic> and is highly resistant towards TMP/SMX (MIC &#x2265;32 &#x03BC;g/mL), showed 5.2 to 6.8-fold upregulation of <italic>bpeEF-oprC</italic> (38 to 111x; Table S1).

Both strains isolated from CF11 are also highly resistant to TMP/SMX (MIC &#x2265;32 &#x03BC;g/mL) and encode the BpeS missense variants V40I and R247L (K96243 annotation) when compared with wild-type <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>).

Because both CF11 strains are TMP/SMX-resistant, DE was determined by comparison with TMP/SMX-sensitive isolates in our dataset. Using this approach, significant upregulation was observed for BpeEF-OprC (5.3 to 6.9-fold; 40 to 121x).

<title>Ceftazidime resistance can occur by upregulation of <italic>penA</italic></title>
<p>Ceftazidime (CAZ) is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is the most commonly recommended therapy for the primary phase of melioidosis treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Currie 2015</xref>). In addition to TMP/SMX, the latter isolate from CF6 is highly resistant to CAZ (MIC &#x2265;256 &#x03BC;g/mL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). High-level CAZ resistance is often conferred by a C94Y substitution (C69Y using Ambler&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ambler et al. 1991</xref>) numbering scheme) in PenA &#x03B2;-lactamase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sam et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rholl et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sarovich et al. 2012</xref>).

Consistent with this duplication event, <italic>penA</italic> (<italic>BPSS0946</italic>) expression increased by 4.5-fold (22x) in the latter CF6 strain. Six proximal genes (<italic>BPSS0945; BPSS0948-BPSS0952</italic>) were also upregulated by 3.1- to 4.7-fold (9 to 26x; Table S1). One of these, <italic>BPSS0945</italic>, is a peptidase and a putative virulence factor that may play a role in multinucleated giant cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Singh et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>A gene duplication event encompassing <italic>penA</italic> has also been documented in the CF11 isolates.

As expected, <italic>penA</italic> was downregulated by 2.1-fold (4x) in the latter isolate due to five times fewer copies of this gene.

<title>Increased doxycycline MICs in CF11 are due to <italic>amrAB-oprA</italic> upregulation and <italic>BPSL3085</italic> mutation</title>

<title>Evidence of convergent DE between early and latter CF isolates</title>
<p>Finally, we performed a comparison of expression profiles from all CF cases to identify a signal of convergent gene expression (pathoadaptation) across early vs latter isolates. To yield the most robust and relevant analysis, we excluded the latter isolate from CF10 due to a lack of DE in this strain, and the initial isolate from CF11, which was retrieved &#x003E;3 years after infection and had already undergone substantial genetic and transcriptional modifications. Exclusion of both strains was supported by a lack of convergent signal when they were included in the analysis (data not shown). Using these parameters, 17 genes were found to be significantly upregulated, and two were significantly downregulated (Table S2). Five (26&#x0025;) loci encode for hypothetical proteins with no known function, of which four were upregulated. Among the convergently upregulated genes with known function was the RND efflux pump BpeEF-OprC (4.8- to 6.1-fold; 28 to 69x), the CydAB cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> quinol oxidase (5.5- to 5.9-fold; 45 to 60x), and the quorum sensing <italic>hhqABCDEFG (BPSS0481-BPSS0487</italic>) operon (3.4- to 4.1-fold; 11 to 17x).

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The causative agent of the tropical disease melioidosis, <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, is an uncommon pathogen in CF, with fewer than 30 cases documented worldwide to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Geake et al. 2015</xref>). We have recently performed comparative genomic analysis of isogenic strains collected between 4 and 55 months apart from the airways of seven of these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). Here, we sought to further characterize these chronic cases by examining the transcriptomes of five paired <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> isolates retrieved between 10 and 55 months apart. Isolates were cultured in an artificial CF sputum medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fung et al. 2010</xref>) to mimic their original <italic>in vivo</italic> environment.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, DE was detected in four of the five cases and ranged from 32 to 792 genes, with the hypermutator strain from CF9 contributing the greatest number of DE loci (Table S1). Interestingly, when compared with the number of genetic changes occurring in each isolate pair, the latter isolate from CF11 had a higher proportion of DE loci to mutations (11.3) than CF9 (7.1), demonstrating that hypermutation does not necessarily lead to a similarly high number of transcriptional differences. The one case with no DE, CF10, exhibited no genetic changes (i.e. SNPs, small indels, copy-number variants, or large deletions) and had the shortest time between isolate collection at 10 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). All other cases encoded genetic differences between pairs. The DE genes fell into several functional categories (Table S1), reflecting the diversity and versatility of pathoadaptive pathways in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>. Our RNA-seq analysis revealed that many of the DE genes were absent in the chronic P314 strain (range: 9-97&#x0025;) or in <italic>B. mallei</italic> (range: 23-100&#x0025;), providing further evidence that these loci are not required for long-term survival in the human airways. Perhaps most striking was the observation that nearly one-third (32&#x0025;) of DE genes lack a known function, highlighting the relative paucity of functional studies into this important yet under-recognized pathogen.</p>
<p><italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> has a &#x007E;7.3Mbp genome that is encoded on two replicons; a &#x007E;4.1Mbp &#x2018;housekeeping&#x2019; chromosome I, and a &#x007E;3.2Mbp &#x2018;accessory&#x2019; chromosome II. The genome of archetypal strain K96243 consists of 3,460 and 2,395 coding sequences on chromosomes I and II, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holden et al. 2004</xref>). There was a greater proportion of DE genes (between 52 and 97&#x0025;) on chromosome II in all cases, despite its smaller size and fewer coding sequences. This bias towards DE on the accessory chromosome contrasts with a 2009 study of a CF-derived <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic> isolate, which displayed a greater proportion of DE genes on chromosome I compared with chromosomes II and III when the isolate was grown in an artificial sputum medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yoder-Himes et al. 2009</xref>). However, the study by Yoder-Himes and colleagues compared DE of a single isolate grown in sputum versus a soil medium, rather than between longitudinal clinical isolates, which may explain the discordance between studies. We have previously shown that a greater proportion of mutational events affect chromosome II of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in a long-term chronic-carriage isolate from P314 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al. 2013</xref>), and in the mammalian-adapted <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> clone <italic>B. mallei</italic>, a greater proportion of genes have been lost from chromosome II than chromosome I, with chromosome II representing 44&#x0025; of the <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> K96243 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holden et al. 2004</xref>) but only 40&#x0025; of the ATCC 23344 <italic>B. mallei</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nierman et al. 2004</xref>). The skew towards DE loci on chromosome II in chronic <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> isolates points towards a lesser role for chromosome II loci in bacterial survival and persistence within the human host, which is reflected by the greater degree of reductive evolution affecting this replicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). In their study of the transcriptional landscape of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, Ooi and co-workers found that only &#x007E;28&#x0025; of chromosome II genes were expressed under a single condition, compared with &#x007E;72&#x0025; of chromosome I genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ooi et al. 2013</xref>). Taken together, these results confirm the &#x2018;accessory&#x2019; role of the chromosome II replicon in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>.</p>
<p>Attenuation of immunogenic surface antigens and other virulence factors are hallmarks of chronically persistent infections across many pathogenic bacterial species, including <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). Encoded by the 34.5kb <italic>wcb</italic> operon <italic>BPSL2786-BPSL2810</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Reckseidler et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Reckseidler-Zenteno et al. 2005</xref>), the <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> CPS-I is a potent virulence determinant that imparts high-level serum resistance and facilitates phagocytic evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Reckseidler-Zenteno et al. 2005</xref>). This capsule is also intact in <italic>B. mallei</italic> and has been shown to be essential for its virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">DeShazer et al. 2001</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atkins et al. 2002</xref>). Our prior genomic analysis identified only a single CF pair with mutated CPS-I in CF11. This frameshift mutation in <italic>wcbA</italic> results in a truncated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>) that would likely cause reduced, although not abolished, CPS-I production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cuccui et al. 2012</xref>). The DE analysis provides further evidence of CPS-I inactivation in the CF pairs, with downregulation of all but one of the CPS-I loci in the latter CF9 isolate, and downregulation of <italic>wcbN-wcbM-gmhA-wcbL-wcbK</italic> in both CF11 isolates. In both cases, it is likely that CPS-I production was either substantially reduced or abolished. Although CPS-III is not required for virulence, it is noteworthy that this locus was also downregulated in CF9 and CF11, as it has been previously shown that CPS-III expression is tied to that of CPS-I genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ooi et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Like CPS-I, the <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> LPS is required for capsule biosynthesis, virulence and serum resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">DeShazer et al. 1998</xref>). Its immunogenic outer membrane component is readily recognized by the host innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tuanyok et al. 2012</xref>), which makes LPS a target for inactivation in chronic bacterial infections. We have previously uncovered missense mutations in the LPS <italic>wzt</italic> and <italic>rmlA</italic> loci of CF6, and a missense mutation affecting <italic>BPSL1119</italic> in CF11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). DE analysis identified additional evidence for reduced or abolished LPS production in a third CF case, CF9, due to the significant downregulation of <italic>wbiD, wbiE</italic>, and <italic>BPSS1683-BPSS1685</italic>. The convergent evolution of the chronic strains to attenuate CPS-I and LPS loci demonstrates the dispensable, and probably highly unfavourable, nature of these surface antigens for long-term survival of this pathogen in the CF airways. Prior work has suggested that CPS-I and LPS may be disadvantageous for <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> persistence due to their virulence potential and immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al. 2013</xref>). By examining both genomic and transcriptomic modifications over time, it is now clear that these capsule clusters, in their wildtype form, pose a major issue for successful long-term <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> persistence in the CF lung, with the bacterium either mutating or downregulating key genes in CPS-I and LPS pathways. We also observed genetic mutation or transcriptional downregulation of other virulence genes in latter CF strains including TFP7 loci, Burkholderia lethal factor 1, T3SS-3 loci and flagellum loci, suggesting that these loci are similarly detrimental to long-term <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> survival in the human host. Importantly, the RNA-seq data identified additional cases of surface antigen and virulence factor abrogation that were not observable with only genomic data. This finding underscores the importance of using both genomic and transcriptomic approaches to identify the functional consequences of within-host evolution of chronic bacterial infections.</p>
<p>TMP/SMX is used during the eradication phase of melioidosis treatment and is recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peacock et al. 2008</xref>). We have previously shown that the latter isolate from CF6, and both isolates from CF11, had developed high-level (&#x2265;32 &#x03BC;g/mL) TMP/SMX resistance over the course of treatment. These elevated MICs were proposed to be due to mutations within BpeEF-OprC efflux pump regulators (BpeT T314fs in CF6, and BpeS V40I and R247L in CF11) alongside mutations affecting the R20 residue of Ptr1/FolM (R20fs in CF6; R20-A22 duplication in CF11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). Here, we have demonstrated that the efflux pump regulatory mutations cause a dramatic upregulation of <italic>bpeEF-oprC</italic> in these strains of between 5.2- and 6.9-fold (38 to 121x), mirroring expression levels in <italic>bpeS</italic> and <italic>bpeT</italic> labgenerated mutants with high-level TMP/SMX resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Podnecky et al. 2017</xref>). Our results confirm those of Podnecky and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Podnecky et al. 2017</xref>) showing that upregulation of <italic>bpeEF-oprC</italic> via BpeS or BpeT dysregulation, together with Ptr1/FolM alteration, leads to a significant increase in TMP/SMX MICs that would render this antibiotic ineffective <italic>in vivo</italic>. RNA-seq is thus a useful tool for confirming the functional consequences of regulatory mutations that control RND efflux pump expression.</p>
<p>In addition to TMP/SMX resistance, the initial isolate from CF11 is resistant to CAZ (12 &#x03BC;g/mL) and the latter isolate from CF6 is highly resistant to CAZ (&#x2265;256 &#x03BC;g/mL). Our prior genomic study showed that CAZ resistance in the initial CF11 strain was due to a 10x duplication of a 36.7kb region encompassing the &#x03B2;-lactamase gene, <italic>penA</italic>, the first time that gene duplication has been shown to confer CAZ resistance in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). In contrast, a 2x duplication of this region in the latter strain did not raise the CAZ MIC above wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). Similarly, the latter strain from CF6 exhibited a 30x duplication of a 7.5kb region encompassing <italic>penA;</italic> however, all 30 copies encoded a C69Y missense mutation, which by itself causes high-level (&#x2265;256 &#x03BC;g/mL) CAZ MICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sam et al. 2009</xref>). As anticipated, RNA-seq provided confirmation of the effects of gene duplications affecting <italic>penA</italic>, with the 30x duplication event in the latter CF6 strain resulting in a 4.5-fold (22x) corresponding increase in DE of this gene. Similarly, a 2.1-fold (4x) downregulation of <italic>penA</italic> in the latter strain from CF11 was linked to a 5x greater copy number of this gene in the early strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). Thus, RNA-seq provided excellent correlation with gene copy number variation determined from whole-genome sequence coverage data. Taken together, the combined genetic and transcriptional changes affecting antibiotic resistance genes in the CF airways-adapted <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> strains illustrates both the intractability of eradicating chronic bacterial infections and the unintended consequences of prolonged antibiotic use in CF treatment.</p>
<p>Although determining within-host transcriptional differences in longitudinal isolates yields valuable insights into the infection dynamics within individual patients, identifying convergent transcriptional changes provides a potential means to predict pathogen behavior and evolution across multiple CF cases in a relatively straightforward manner. Such predictability could conceivably be exploited to improve the diagnosis or treatment of intractable CF infections, or ideally, to prevent them from progressing in the first place. Therefore, a major objective of this study was to identify evidence of convergence in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> gene expression during its transition to a chronic infection. Despite the small number of CF melioidosis patients available for this study, a signal of convergent pathoadaptation was identified between the initial and latter isolates, with 19 significantly DE loci identified, 17 of which were upregulated (Table S2). This convergence is noteworthy given the large size of the <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> genome and the many redundant pathways that could lead to similar adaptive phenotypes, a phenomenon that is well-recognized in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marvig et al. 2015</xref>). One advantage of identifying convergence using transcriptomics rather than genomic data is that it can reveal the transcriptional consequence of multiple genetic mutations; for example, we have observed that multiple missense mutations in the RND efflux pump regulator AmrR lead to the same transcriptional outcome of <italic>amrAB-oprA</italic> upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sarovich et al. 2017</xref>). As such, RNA-seq data can simplify the identification of convergently expressed loci that are under the influence of several genetic variants.</p>
<p>The development of antibiotic resistance is a recurring theme in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolated from the CF airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Winstanley et al. 2016</xref>), and we have recently shown that the same adaptive phenomenon can be observed in the genome of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in response to prolonged, high-dose antibiotic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). It was therefore not surprising to identify the convergent upregulation of <italic>bpeEF-oprC</italic> (4.8- to 6.1-fold; 28 to 69x), which was significantly upregulated in two of the four patients with DE (CF6 and CF11), and which led to TMP/SMX resistance as discussed above. The second convergently upregulated locus was the <italic>cydAB</italic> operon (<italic>BPSL0501</italic> and <italic>BPSL0502</italic>), which encodes for cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> quinol oxidase (5.5- to 5.9-fold; 45 to 60x); this locus was significantly DE in CF6 and CF9. CydAB is an aerobic terminal oxidase that oxidizes ubiquinol-8 and reduces oxygen to water under oxygen-limiting conditions. This enzyme is better able to scavenge oxygen under microaerobic conditions compared with cytochrome <italic>o</italic> oxidase, which otherwise predominates as the terminal respiratory enzyme in electron transport-associated energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cotter et al. 1997</xref>). Voggu and colleagues demonstrated that the <italic>cydAB</italic> loci encoded by non-pathogenic <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species were better able to resist <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> antagonism in the CF lung compared with the <italic>cydAB</italic> loci encoded by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This resistance was imparted by an insensitivity of the non-pathogenic staphylococci cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> quinol oxidases to the presence of the small respiratory inhibitors hydrogen cyanide and pyocyanin, which are commonly secreted by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the CF lung. In contrast, Voggu <italic>et al</italic>. showed that <italic>S. aureus</italic> was exquisitely sensitive to the co-presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> due to their less resistant <italic>cydB</italic> locus, which is inhibited by these small respiratory inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Voggu et al. 2006</xref>). Thus, it is feasible that the convergent upregulation of <italic>cydAB</italic> loci represents a defense mechanism employed by <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> to counteract the toxic effects of small respiratory inhibitors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the CF lung. In support of this hypothesis, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was co-isolated in all five CF cases examined in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). Alternatively, <italic>cydAB</italic> upregulation may simply represent a physiological response to the oxygen-limited environment of the CF airways, as its expression is known to be induced in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hamad et al. 2011</xref>). Under such conditions, many pathogens including <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> become less susceptible to conventional antibiotics, which are typically more effective under aerobic conditions, but more susceptible to antibiotics that target anaerobic infections, such as the nitroimidazole class of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hamad et al. 2011</xref>). This phenomenon may explain the difficulty of chronic <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> eradication using conventional antibiotics like CAZ and TMP/SMX, and raises the exciting but not yet tested possibility that nitroimidazoles may be a highly effective therapeutic option for chronic, hypoxia-adapted <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infections such as those adapted to the CF airways.</p>
<p>A third convergently upregulated locus, the quorum sensing operon <italic>hhqABCDEFG</italic> (3.4- to 4.1-fold; 11x to 17x), is homologous to the <italic>B. cepacia</italic> complex <italic>hmqABCDEFG</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chapalain et al. 2017</xref>). This operon synthesizes a class of compounds known as 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-alkylquinolines (HMAQs), the methylated counterparts of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones (AHQs; also known as HAQs). AHQs were first recognized in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and are produced by the signaling system <italic>pqsABCDE</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Diggle et al. 2006</xref>). This cluster produces over 50 different AHQs, and these compounds exhibit diverse biological activities that enable cell-to-cell communication within and between bacterial species and the regulation of various functions including secondary metabolism, virulence, antibacterial activity and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Diggle et al. 2006</xref>). In contrast, little is currently known about the role of HMAQs and AHQs in <italic>Burkholderia</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chapalain et al. 2017</xref>). The AHQ precursor molecule 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone (HHQ) that is produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> actively suppresses the host innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al. 2010</xref>), a role that could be shared by <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> HHQ. A second possibility is that these compounds impart a competitive advantage in the CF lung environment as HMAQs produced by <italic>B. cepacia</italic> exhibit antifungal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kilani-Feki et al. 2011</xref>), so it is feasible that the <italic>hmqABCDEFG</italic> operon of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> produces similarly potent compounds that can inhibit fungal species from establishing residence in the CF lung. The convergent upregulation of <italic>hhqA-G</italic> in the <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> CF isolates points to a putative role for AHQ-based compounds in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> signaling, immune evasion or competition in the CF lung. More work is needed to elucidate the myriad functions of AHQ compounds in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, and particularly their role in promoting bacterial persistence in the CF airways.</p>
<p>Of the two convergently downregulated loci, only one, <italic>BPSS0351</italic>, has an assigned function, although little is known about the role of this gene and its product in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>. This gene encodes CueR (3.4-fold; 11x), a MerR family copper response regulator that is highly sensitive to the presence of copper (Cu) and which regulates the transcription of genes that protect against toxic metal ion concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Singh et al. 2004</xref>). Cu has a long history as an effective antimicrobial agent due its ability to generate reactive oxygen species, with Cu accumulation in the mammalian host purported to act as an innate immune defense mechanism to restrict pathogen growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Samanovic et al. 2012</xref>). Thus, downregulation of <italic>cueR</italic> in the latter CF isolates may represent a mechanism for mitigating Cu toxicity in the host, similarly to <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Singh et al. 2004</xref>). However, there are contradictory reports as to whether Cu levels are elevated in CF sputa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gray et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Smith et al. 2014</xref>), and the artificial sputum growth medium does not appear to contain elevated Cu levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fung et al. 2010</xref>). CueR regulates the Cu/silver ATPase CopA and the multicopper oxidase CueO enzymes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which correspond to <italic>BPSS0224</italic> and <italic>BPSL0897</italic> in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> K96243, respectively; however, neither of these genes were DE in any of the patient pairs. The absence of concomitant increased expression of <italic>cueO</italic>, which converts periplasmic Cu&#x002B; to less toxic Cu2&#x002B; <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Singh et al. 2013</xref>), suggests that other enigmatic pressures are responsible for decreasing <italic>cueR</italic> expression in latter CF isolates. The biological role of these other factors requires further exploration.</p>
<p>We recognize that there are limitations to our study. Growth conditions are known to be an important consideration for mRNA-based investigations due to the alteration of the transcriptome when isolates are grown under different environments or media components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yoder-Himes et al. 2009</xref>). Although our <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions do not completely mimic the conditions seen in the CF lung, the artificial sputum medium is designed to reflect the nutrient conditions of this environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fung et al. 2010</xref>), and our shaking parameters provided a robust way of measuring cellular growth over time while avoiding non-uniform cellular growth, which ensured harvest of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> cultures at the same growth phase (Figure S1). Additionally, the use of isogenic strain pairs with genomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>) enabled us to comprehensively assess the effects of transcriptional adaptation to the CF lung compared with their underlying genetic variants. Our conditions provided transcriptomic data that was consistent with expected expression differences based on genome-wide alterations. Other studies have used artificial sputum media and additional mechanical methods to mimic the CF lung conditions. A rotating wall vessel has been developed to simulate the low fluid shear conditions encountered in CF mucus due to pathological effects of <italic>CFTR</italic> dysfunction on mucociliary clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Crabb&#x00E9; et al. 2008</xref>), with CF-derived <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates demonstrating transcriptional differences depending on shear conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dingemans et al. 2016</xref>) . The culturing methods for bacterial RNA-seq are a critical consideration in experimental design as they can affect transcriptomic profiles, and the impact of conditions should be considered when comparing transcriptional differences between studies. Another shortcoming is that we only examined five patient pairs due to the relative paucity of melioidosis CF cases worldwide, and only two isolates from each patient due to limited bacterial colony selection and storage at the time of sputum collection and processing. Deeper sampling efforts across a greater number of melioidosis CF patients would be needed to provide greater confidence in our convergent adaptation findings and would allow a more advanced and detailed understanding of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> population dynamics and diversity to be attained. Nevertheless, the findings from our study provide important new insights into <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> evolution in the CF airways, with many, although not complete, parallels with the common CF pathogens, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>B. cepacia</italic> complex species.</p>

<title>Artificial sputum medium</title>
<p>This medium was made as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sriramulu et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fung et al. 2010</xref>), with modifications detailed here. Antibiotics were not used to maintain media sterility due to concerns that their addition would alter expression profiles. Due to impracticality in its filtration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dingemans et al. 2016</xref>), 1 g porcine stomach mucin (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) dissolved in 40 mL ultrapure water was autoclaved prior to use. All other solutions were sterilized using a 0.22 &#x03BC;M vacuum filter, apart from the UV-irradiated egg yolk emulsion (Oxoid, Thebarton, SA, Australia), which was treated aseptically. A stock solution of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was made by dissolving 59.5 mg into 5 mL of very basic water (pH&#x003D;14). CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added at a final concentration of 0.22 g/L (J. Manos, pers. comm.). Final concentrations of the components were: 10 g/L mucin, 1.39 g/L salmon sperm DNA (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 g/L NaCl, 2.2 g/L KCl, 0.22 g/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 g/L casein acid hydrosylate (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 g/L bovine serum albumin (Roche Diagnostics, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia), 0.005&#x0025; diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and 0.5&#x0025; of egg yolk emulsion. Each batch was tested for sterility prior to use by plating 100 &#x03BC;L onto Luria Bertani (LB) agar (Oxoid) and incubating aerobically for 24 h. pH was tested using an aliquot of the medium to ensure it was within the desired range (pH &#x007E;6.5-7). The medium was stored at 4 <sup>o</sup>C for no longer than four weeks prior to use.</p>

<title>Viability counts</title>
<p>Two sets of viability counts were performed for this study. The first was conducted to determine the number of colony-forming units (cfu) at OD<sub>590</sub>, which enabled us to standardize the starting number of cells inoculated into the artificial sputum medium. The second was conducted to verify the final concentration of cells across all CF isolates, which enabled us to determine the number of cells for nucleic acid extraction to ensure that approximately equal cell amounts were processed for each pair. The CF isolates were subcultured from glycerol stocks onto LB agar at 37 &#x00B0;C for 24 h. Cells were suspended into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by spectrophotometric measurement at OD<sub>590</sub>&#x003D;1.0 in a WPA CO 8000 cell density meter (Biochrom Ltd, Blackburn, VIC, Australia). Tenfold dilutions and plating of cultures onto LB agar was carried out, followed by enumeration at 24 h. Viable counts demonstrated that all CF isolates exhibited similar cell density when normalized to an OD<sub>590</sub>&#x003D;1.0 (range 1.3&#x00D7;10<sup>8</sup> to 4.9&#x00D7;10<sup>8</sup>). Based on these counts, the starting amount of culture for the CF isolates was standardized to 10<sup>5</sup> cfu for all subsequent experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Growth curves in the artificial sputum medium</title>
<p>To minimize laboratory passage, each culture was again subcultured from the original glycerol stocks onto LB agar at 37 &#x00B0;C for 24 h, followed by a replication of OD<sub>590</sub> measurements as determined previously. Based on the viability count data, samples were then diluted to 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/mL in PBS. One hundred &#x03BC;L of this suspension (&#x007E;10<sup>5</sup> cfu) was used to inoculate 1.9 mL of the sputum medium, which was aliquoted into 14 mL Nunc round-bottom culture tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scoresby, VIC, Australia). Due to biosafety concerns, cells were grown in closed-capped tubes, and were incubated at 37 &#x00B0;C by shaking in an orbital incubator shaker (model BL8500; Bioline, Eveleigh, NSW, Australia) at 50, 200 or 230 rpm for 44 h. Growth curves were obtained by measuring OD<sub>590</sub> at regular intervals over this period using un-inoculated sputum medium as the control blank. Shaking at 50 rpm was initially performed to mimic the low-oxygen conditions of the CF lung; however, this speed caused heavy sedimentation of cells and media components, and biofilm formation at the aerobic interface, both of which led to a decrease in OD values over time and unpredictable, non-uniform growth. Similarly, shaking at 230 rpm was too vigorous for the cells, as observed by inconsistent, non-reproducible viable counts. When shaking at 200 rpm, highly reproducible OD values that correlated with viability counts were obtained (Figure S1), and the medium did not readily sediment. We therefore used this speed for subsequent experiments, including for RNA harvest. Viability counts were performed at the time of harvest to ensure uniformity of cell concentrations across all isolates.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>RNA extraction from isolates grown in the artificial sputum medium</title>
<p>The CF strains were grown in duplicate at 200 rpm as detailed above. Based on the growth curve analysis, nucleic acids for all cultures were extracted at late log phase (17 h). At the point of harvest, the OD<sub>590</sub> of each replicate was measured to ensure that consistent cell density had been obtained prior to combining replicates; final viability counts were also performed. Due to the highly labile nature of bacterial mRNA, two 100 &#x03BC;L aliquots for each strain were immediately placed into 200 &#x03BC;L of RNAprotect (Qiagen, Doncaster, VIC, Australia) and incubated for 5 min to preserve their transcription profiles. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatant discarded. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini Kit (Qiagen). <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> cells were lysed following the protocol for genomic DNA extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Currie et al. 2007</xref>), with an extended incubation time in Proteinase K to 1.5 h. Lysates were loaded onto the RNeasy mini columns and extractions were carried out according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions, including the recommended on-column DNase I digestion. In our hands, we found this DNase I treatment to be insufficient for removing all contaminating DNA. Extractions for RNA-seq were therefore further treated with TURBO DNA-<italic>free</italic> kit (Ambion, Scoresby, VIC, Australia). For each sample, 35 &#x03BC;L of extracted RNA was incubated with 6 U TURBO DNase at 37 &#x00B0;C for 32 min. The remaining RNA was not treated with this second round of DNase; instead, this sample was used as template for PCR contamination screening, as described below. All samples were transferred to clean RNase/DNase-free tubes for downstream processing.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>RNA quality control</title>
<p>To verify the removal of DNA from the total RNA extractions, two contamination screens were performed. The first was used to determine the removal of salmon sperm DNA, and the second was to determine the removal of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> DNA. Both the pre- and post-treated RNA samples were used to test for contamination, in duplicate, with the former acting as the positive control. The RNA samples were diluted 1/10 into molecular-grade H2O (Fisher Biotech) prior to PCR. Identification of residual salmon sperm DNA was investigated by targeting the mitochondrial 12S rDNA region of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Humair et al. 2007</xref>). Primers 12S-6F (5&#x2019;- CAAACTGGGATTAGATACC) and B-12S-9R (5&#x2019;- AGAACAGGCTCCTCTAG) were used at a final concentration of 1 &#x03BC;M in a mix containing 1X PCR buffer (Qiagen), 1 U HotStarTaq, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 &#x03BC;L template and molecular-grade H2O in a 15 &#x03BC;L total reaction volume. Thermocycling conditions comprised 94 &#x00B0;C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 &#x00B0;C for 30 sec, 52 &#x00B0;C for 30 sec, and 72 &#x00B0;C for 30 sec, and a final extension at 72 &#x00B0;C for 2 min. Amplicons were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p>Real-time PCR was used to detect <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> DNA contamination. The <italic>mmsA</italic> (methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase) housekeeping gene was targeted using the primers Bp&#x005F;266152&#x005F;3012-F1-flap (5&#x2019;-AATAAATCATAAACGTGAGGCCGGAGATGT) and Bp&#x005F;266152&#x005F;3012-R1-flap (5&#x2019;-AATAAATCATAAGACCGACATCACGCACAGC) in combination with a <italic>B. pseudomallei-specific</italic> TaqMan MGB probe, 266152-T&#x005F;Bp (5&#x2019;-VIC-CGGTCTACACGCATGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Price et al. 2012</xref>), as previously described, with the following modifications: 0.2 &#x03BC;M probe and 0.4 &#x03BC;M each primer was used, reactions were carried out in a 5 &#x03BC;L total reaction volume, and cycling was performed to 50 cycles.</p>

<title>RNA storage, shipment and RNA-seq</title>
<p>For each sample, 20 &#x03BC;L of total RNA was added to an RNAstable tube (Biomatrica, San Diego, CA, USA), gently mixed with the preservation agent and left to air-dry in a biosafety cabinet for 48 h. Samples were shipped at ambient temperature to Macrogen Inc. (Geumcheon-gu, Seoul, Rep. of Korea) for RNA-seq. Ribosomal RNA was removed by treatment with the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit for Bacteria (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA), followed by 100 bp paired-end, stranded library construction using the TruSeq rapid SBS Kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries were sequenced on either the HiSeq2000 or HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina Inc.). All samples were extracted from two separate experiments to account for biological variation, except for MSHR8442, which was extracted thrice. Between 36 and 80 million reads were generated for each sequence, corresponding to between 3.6 and 8.1 billion base pairs each.</p>

<title>RNA-seq analysis</title>
<p>Illumina read filtering was first performed with Trimmomatic v0.33 using the following parameters: TruSeq2-PE adapter removal, leading&#x003D;3, trailing&#x003D;3, sliding window&#x003D;4:15, and minimum length&#x003D;36. Reads were mapped to the prototypic <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> K96243 reference genome (RefSeq IDs NC&#x005F;006350 and NC&#x005F;006351 for chromosomes 1 and 2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holden et al. 2004</xref>)) using Bowtie 2 v2.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Langmead and Salzberg 2012</xref>). Transcript quantification was performed with HTSeq (v0.6.1p1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anders et al. 2015</xref>) using the intersection non-empty mode and --stranded&#x003D;reverse parameters. DE analysis was carried out using the glmFit function of edgeR v3.18.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Robinson et al. 2010</xref>), implemented in the online Degust 3.1.0 tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vicbioinformatics.com/degust/index.html">http://www.vicbioinformatics.com/degust/index.html</ext-link>). DE loci were visualized using the volcano plot function within Degust. Several different groups were compared to determine DE. The first analyses compared initial and latter isolates within CF patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) without summing technical replicates (i.e. the RNA-seq data from each independent experiment of a single strain) to identify DE within each patient. To determine convergent DE loci, we summed the reads for each technical replicate prior to analysis and then compared all initial CF isolates vs. all latter CF isolates, with the latter CF10 isolate excluded due to a lack of DE in this strain and the initial CF11 isolate excluded due to &#x003E;3 years of infection prior to its isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Viberg et al. 2017</xref>). For all analyses, DE was defined as a log2 fold change of &#x2265;1.5 and a false discovery rate of &#x2264;0.01. To improve visualization of DE loci in the volcano plot of the initial and latter comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), highly expressed DE loci in only a single strain were omitted.</p>
