<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD) develops silently over decades. We cannot easily access and analyse pre-symptomatic brains, so the earliest molecular changes that initiate AD remain unclear. Previously, we demonstrated that the genes mutated in early-onset, dominantly-inherited familial forms of AD (fAD) are evolving particularly rapidly in mice and rats. Fortunately, some non-mammalian vertebrates such as the zebrafish preserve fAD-relevant transcript isoforms of the <italic>PRESENILIN (PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2)</italic> genes that these rodents have lost. Zebrafish are powerful vertebrate genetic models for many human diseases, but no genetic model of fAD in zebrafish currently exists. We edited the zebrafish genome to model the unique, protein-truncating fAD mutation of human <italic>PSEN2</italic>, K115fs. Analysing the brain transcriptome and proteome of young (6-month-old) and aged, infertile (24-month-old) wild type and heterozygous fAD-like mutant female sibling zebrafish supports accelerated brain aging and increased glucocorticoid signalling in young fAD-like fish, leading to a transcriptional &#x2018;inversion&#x2019; into glucocorticoid resistance and vast changes in biological pathways in aged, infertile fAD-like fish. Notably, one of these changes involving microglia-associated immune responses regulated by the ETS transcription factor family is preserved between our zebrafish fAD model and human early-onset AD. Importantly, these changes occur before obvious histopathology and likely in the absence of A&#x03B2;. Our results support the contributions of early metabolic and oxidative stresses to immune and stress responses favouring AD pathogenesis and highlight the value of our fAD-like zebrafish genetic model for elucidating early changes in the brain that promote AD pathogenesis. The success of our approach has important implications for future modelling of AD.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, a condition characterised by the progressive decline of memory and cognition. Like other neurodegenerative diseases, AD affects diverse cellular processes in the brain, including mitochondrial function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, metal ion homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and protein folding and trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Dysregulation of these processes eventually results in severe atrophy of several brain regions (reviewed by Braak and Braak <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and Masters et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>). Consequently, late stages of AD are likely to be much more difficult to treat than earlier stages of AD, contributing to our failure to discover ameliorative drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The pathological processes that result in AD are likely to initiate decades before clinical symptoms arise. Increased levels of soluble amyloid beta (A&#x03B2;) peptides in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma is one of the earliest markers of both sporadic and familial forms of AD, preceding disease onset by 20&#x2013;30 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, while vascular changes are likely to occur even earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Additionally, individuals possessing highly penetrant, dominant mutations in genes linked to the familial form of AD (fAD) such as <italic>PSEN1</italic> show structural and functional changes in their brains as early as 9 years of age, despite being cognitively normal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Similar findings are evident in young adults carrying the &#x03B5;4 allele of <italic>APOE</italic>, the major risk gene for the sporadic form of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. To prevent AD, we must identify the stresses underlying these early pathological changes. However, detailed molecular analysis of the brains of asymptomatic young adult fAD mutation carriers is currently impossible.</p>
<p>Analysing high-throughput &#x2018;omics data (e.g. transcriptomic, proteomic) is a comprehensive and relatively unbiased approach for studying complex diseases like AD. Over the past decade, numerous post-mortem AD brains have been profiled using microarray and RNA-seq technologies, exposing an incredibly complex and interconnected network of cellular processes implicated in the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, analysing post-mortem AD brains does not discern which cellular processes are responsible for initiating the cascade of events leading to AD.</p>
<p>Animal models can assist exploration of the early molecular changes that promote AD. However, early &#x201C;knock-in&#x201D; mouse models that attempted to model the genetic state of human fAD showed no obvious histopathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Modern &#x2018;omics technologies provide molecular-level descriptions of disease states, but these technologies were not available when the early knock-in models were made. Subsequent transgenic models of AD constructed with multiple genes and/or mutations have displayed (what are assumed to be) AD-related histopathologies and these have also been analysed by &#x2018;omics methods. However recent analysis of brain transcriptomes from five different transgenic AD models showed little concordance with human, late onset, sporadic AD brain transcriptomes. Worse still, none of the models were concordant with each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there has not yet been a detailed molecular investigation of the young adult brains of any animal model closely imitating the human fAD genetic state&#x2013;i.e. heterozygous for a fAD-like mutation in a single, endogenous gene. Previously, we used zebrafish to analyse the unique, frameshifting fAD mutation of human <italic>PRESENILIN2</italic> (<italic>PSEN2</italic>), K115fs, that inappropriately mimics expression of a hypoxia-induced truncated isoform of PSEN2 protein, PS2V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Mice and rats have lost the ability to express PS2V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (and the fAD genes of these rodents are evolving more rapidly than in many other mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>), but in zebrafish, this isoform is expressed from the animal&#x2019;s <italic>psen1</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Consequently, to model and explore early changes in the brain driving AD pathogenesis, we have now used gene-editing technology to introduce a K115fs-equivalent mutation into the zebrafish <italic>psen1</italic> gene, K97fs. In this paper, we analyse RNA-seq and mass spectrometry data collected from young adult (6-month-old) and aged, infertile (24-month-old) adult mutantand wild type zebrafish brains to comprehensively assess gene and protein expression changes in the brain due to aging and this fAD-like genetic state. At the molecular level, we find that the young fAD-model brains show elements of accelerated aging while aged fAD-like brains appear to &#x2018;invert&#x2019; into a distinct and presumably pathological state. Our results emphasise the difficulty of understanding the early molecular progression of AD by examining overtly diseased brains and highlight the importance of accurate genetic models of fAD for elucidating mechanisms of AD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Gene editing in zebrafish to produce the <italic>psen1</italic> K97fs mutation is described in the <bold>Materials and Methods</bold> section and in <bold>Supplementary Methods 1</bold>. To determine whether the K97fs mutation in the zebrafish <italic>psen1</italic> gene induces gene and protein expression changes, we removed whole-brains of <italic>psen1</italic><sup>K97fs/&#x002B;</sup> (mutant) and <italic>psen1</italic><sup>&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> (wild type) adult zebrafish for total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and label-free tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) when zebrafish were 6 months (young) and 24 months (aged) old. We used three biological replicates to represent each of the four experimental conditions (young wild type, young mutant, aged wild type, aged mutant), and performed pairwise comparisons between experimental conditions to determine differentially expressed (DE) genes and differentially abundant (DA) proteins (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></bold>). Full lists of DE genes and DA proteins are provided in <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>.</p>

In this analysis, 200 permutations were used. <italic>Z-</italic>summary scores less than 2 indicate no preservation, while scores between 2 and 10 indicate weak-to-moderate evidence of preservation. The top functional enrichment and cell type marker enrichment terms are used to give insight into possible biological functions represented within each module. Cell type marker enrichment gene sets are from MSigDB, while functional enrichment terms are from Gene Ontology and MSigDB gene sets.

<title>A familial AD-like mutation in zebrafish induces age-dependent gene expression changes</title>

<title>Early gene expression changes</title>
<p>The brains of children or young adults carrying fAD mutations display morphological and functional differences compared to age-matched individuals without these mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Because of this, we hypothesised that gene expression in the brains of young adult (6-month-old) zebrafish carrying a fAD-like mutation would also be altered when compared to wild type zebrafish siblings. Overall, we find supporting evidence for 105 genes that are differentially expressed in young mutant brains relative to wild type brains (65 up-regulated, 40 down-regulated; FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05) (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1</bold>). Of these 105 genes, 65 have an log<sub>2</sub> fold change greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5 in the &#x2018;young mutant vs. young wild type&#x2019; comparison (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). By examining the expression of these genes in the other three comparisons described in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></bold>, we observe two important phenomena:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold>Accelerated aging genes are associated with increased immune response:</bold> 62&#x0025; (65/105) of the genes that are DE in 6-month-old mutant brains (&#x2018;young mutant vs. young wild type&#x2019;) show the same direction of expression change during normal aging (&#x2018;aged wild type vs. young wild type&#x2019;). However, far more genes are DE during normal aging (1,795 compared to 105). This suggests that the 6-month-old mutant brains may demonstrate accelerated aging for a subset of cellular functions. As an initial step to uncover these altered cellular functions, we applied functional enrichment analysis on these 65 genes and discovered significant enrichment in an MSigDB gene set relating to immune response genes that are up-regulated following lipopolysaccharide treatment &#x201C;GSE9988 LPS VS VEHICLE TREATED MONOCYTE UP&#x201D; (Bonferroni adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value 0.000948) (<bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>).</p></list-item>

We call this expression pattern an age-dependent &#x2018;inversion&#x2019; between mutant and wild type brains. We explore the biological relevance of the genes involved in this inversion pattern in the transcriptome later.</p></list-item>

<title>Late gene expression changes</title>
<p>By comparing gene expression in 24-month-old mutant and wild type zebrafish brains, we can gain insight into a putatively pathological transcriptomic state present in the brains of aged zebrafish carrying a fAD-like mutation. We find supporting evidence for 177 genes that are differentially expressed in mutant brains relative to wild type brains (139 down-regulated, 38 up-regulated, FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 1</bold>). Note that not all of these genes are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref></bold>, which only includes genes with log<sub>2</sub> fold change values greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5. To allow for easier interpretation of these 177 genes, we used hierarchical clustering to separate them into groups with distinct expression patterns based on all four brain-types:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Inverted (63 genes)</bold>: Defined as genes showing opposite fold-changes in young mutant brains (&#x2018;young mutant vs. young wild type&#x2019;) compared to aged mutant brains (&#x2018;aged mutant vs. aged wild type&#x2019;). To be included in this group, genes were required to have an FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05 in either the &#x2018;young mutant vs. young wild type&#x2019; or &#x2018;aged mutant vs. aged wild type&#x2019; comparison and an unadjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05 in the other comparison.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Inappropriately down-regulated (57 genes)</bold>: Defined as genes that are down-regulated in the &#x2018;aged mutant vs. young mutant&#x2019; and &#x2018;aged mutant vs. aged wild type&#x2019; comparisons (FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05 in both).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Failure to up-regulate (94 genes)</bold>: Defined as genes that are up-regulated during normal aging (FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05 in the &#x2018;aged wild type vs. young wild type&#x2019; comparison) but not up-regulated in the &#x2018;aged mutant vs. aged wild type&#x2019; comparison.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Failure to down-regulate (26 genes)</bold>: Defined as genes that are down-regulated during normal aging (FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05 in the &#x2018;aged wild type vs. young wild type&#x2019; comparison) but not down-regulated in the &#x2018;aged mutant vs. aged wild type&#x2019; comparison.</p></list-item></list>
To determine whether these different component groups of the gene expression patterns are biologically relevant, we assessed each group&#x2019;s functional enrichment using Gene Ontology terms, MSigDB gene sets, and Reactome and Interpro pathways (summarised in <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>; full results in <bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>). Overall, we find statistically significant enrichment (Bonferroni adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05) for all groups except for the &#x2018;failure to down-regulate group.

<title>Gene expression changes due to brain aging</title>
<p>By comparing gene expression in 24-month-old and 6-month-old brains, it is possible to identify genes that show altered expression during normal aging and the aberrant molecular aging of the fAD-like mutant fish. 1,795 genes show altered expression levels with normal brain aging in zebrafish (&#x2018;aged wild type vs. young wild type&#x2019;), while 1,072 genes show altered expression in mutant brains as they age (&#x2018;aged mutant vs. young mutant&#x2019;) (FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05). 525 genes overlap in these two sets, and can be considered an &#x2018;aging signature&#x2019; showing statistically significant fold changes in the same direction during both wild type and mutant brain aging. These genes are enriched in gene ontology terms related to immune function (<bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>) indicating that some immune responses that are associated with normal brain aging are still preserved in mutant zebrafish.</p>

<title>The gene expression changes observed are likely not due to changes in the proportions of brain cell types</title>
<p>It is possible that changes in the proportions of different cell types in the brain could result in genes being falsely interpreted as differentially expressed. To ensure that our observations of differential gene expression are not an artefact of changes in the proportions of the major brain cell types (e.g. astrocytes, microglia, neurons, oligodendrocytes), we checked that the average expression for sets of marker genes representing each of the major brain cell types was approximately constant across the samples in each biological condition (young wild type, young mutant, aged wild type, aged mutant). Representative marker genes for microglia were obtained from Oosterhof et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> while gene markers for astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes were obtained from Lein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> The number of genes used to calculate the average gene expression (in logCPM) was 41 (astrocyte), 99 (microglia), 77 (neuron) and 78 (oligodendrocyte). Overall, the average expression of gene markers for the major neural cell types is approximately constant in each of the biological conditions, and no obvious outlier samples are evident (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3</bold>).</p>

<title>Regulation of gene expression changes in fAD-like mutant zebrafish brains differs from normal brain aging</title>
<p>A transcription factor can regulate (activate or repress) gene expression by binding to a specific DNA motif in the promoter region of a gene. We hypothesised that changes in gene expression during normal aging or differences in gene expression between mutant and wild type brains would be driven by differences in transcription factor activity. To test this, we examined gene promoter regions for enriched motifs corresponding to known transcription factor binding sites (summarised in <bold>Supplementary Table 5</bold>; full results in <bold>Supplementary Table 6</bold>). Overall, we find:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold>Numerous known transcription factors likely drive the gene expression changes that occur during normal zebrafish brain aging</bold>. As wild type brains age, the genes which are differentially expressed are significantly enriched in many known motifs. These motifs correspond to binding sites for interferon regulatory factors (e.g. IRF1, IRF2, IRF8); a binding site for the the PU.1-IRF8 complex; an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE); and binding sites for various transcription factors important for essential cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Atf3, Fra2, Ets-distal, AP-1, Fra1, JunB, BATF, and ZNF264). This supports the idea that numerous transcription factors contribute to the coordinated gene expression changes observed during aging.</p></list-item>

Interestingly, the subset of genes showing inappropriate downregulation (down-regulated in the &#x2018;aged mutant vs. young mutant&#x2019; and &#x2018;aged mutant vs. aged wild type&#x2019; comparisons) is even more enriched in the GRE motif (Bonferroni <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0001), suggesting that genes that are normally activated by glucocorticoid signalling during aging may not be activated in aged mutant brains. This altered glucocorticoid signalling appears to be present even in young zebrafish brains, as genes showing inverted behaviour (opposite direction of differential expression in &#x2018;young mutant vs. young wild type&#x2019; and &#x2018;aged mutant vs. aged wild type&#x2019; comparisons) are also enriched in the GRE motif (Bonferroni <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0047). Because these inverted genes tend to show high expression in young mutant brains (i.e. up-regulated in the &#x2018;young mutant vs. young wild type&#x2019; comparison) and low expression in aged mutant brains (i.e. down-regulated in the &#x2018;aged mutant vs. aged wild type&#x2019; comparison), this suggests that young mutant zebrafish brains may initially exhibit abnormally increased glucocorticoid signalling, while aged mutant brains later exhibit abnormally decreased glucocorticoid signalling.

<title>Evidence of increased stress long preceding AD</title>
<p>We identified a subset of &#x2018;inverted&#x2019; genes that are up-regulated in young mutant brains, but down-regulated in aged mutant brains. Although this pattern might be initially overlooked, similar patterns have also been observed in human cases. At the structural-level, the brains of asymptomatic children with <italic>PSEN1</italic> mutations display greater functional connectivity and increased grey matter volumes of several brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Interestingly, adult <italic>PSEN1</italic> mutation carriers who are still asymptomatic retain these increased brain structure sizes, but upon developing AD symptoms, the affected brain structures rapidly decrease in size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. These changes are likely to be mirrored at the molecular level in the brain. Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, pre-clinical AD, or Down Syndrome (who often develop AD in adulthood) initially display increased expression of particular genes, which decreases when AD symptoms become more severe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Collectively, results from these studies and our fAD-like mutant zebrafish suggest that early increases in brain activity likely precede AD symptoms in both <italic>PSEN1</italic>-mutation carriers and more general cases of AD. Evidently, to find strategies for preventing AD progression while patients are still asymptomatic, it is important to understand the causes of this increased brain activity.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that stress responses are likely to contribute to early increases in brain activity for fAD mutation carriers. In mutant zebrafish, the inverted gene expression pattern seems to arise partially from altered glucocorticoid signalling. In humans, chronically increased glucocorticoid signalling in the brain can lead to glucocorticoid resistance, whereby the brain is unable to increase glucocorticoid signalling even during stressful conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. We did not confirm whether glucocorticoid signalling and cortisol levels were altered in zebrafish brains <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, many of the inverted genes possess glucocorticoid receptor elements in their promoters, and one particular inverted gene (<italic>fkbp5)</italic> encodes a protein which is known to bind directly to the glucocorticoid receptor to negatively regulate its activity. Previous studies in humans demonstrate that <italic>fkbp5</italic> levels are highly responsive to chronic stress and stress-related diseases (e.g. bipolar disorder; depression in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>), implying that <italic>fkbp5</italic> expression is a sensitive marker of glucocorticoid signalling. Our analysis supports this, with <italic>fkbp5</italic> mRNAs showing a significant difference in expression between mutant and wild type brains (logFC = 2.1, FDR-adjusted <italic>p-</italic>value = 1.77e-06 in young mutant vs wild type; logFC = -3.9, FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value <italic>=</italic> 3.16e-08 in aged mutant vs wild type). Aside from altered glucocorticoid signalling, we also linked altered gene expression to a range of biological processes that are altered in mutant zebrafish brains. If we assume that these mutant zebrafish accurately model the genetics underlying human AD, then these alterations may offer insight into early changes in the brains of human fAD-mutation carriers and, potentially, other individuals predisposed to AD. The brains of young mutant zebrafish exhibit changes to developmental signalling pathways (Wnt/&#x03B2; -catenin signalling, hedgehog signalling, TGF-b signalling), stress and immune responses (DNA repair, IL2-STAT5 signalling, complement system, IFN-&#x03B3; response, inflammatory response), hormonal changes (early and late estrogen responses, androgen response), and energy metabolism (glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation). Evidently, appropriate regulation of these biological processes is critical for brain function, so it is unsurprising that disruption of these processes in the brain has been linked previously to various pathological states, including early stages of neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. It is difficult to infer how a single heterozygous fAD mutation could alter such diverse processes in the brain. It is unsurprising that cellular processes and pathways where Presenilin1 proteins are directly involved (e.g. Wnt/&#x03B2;-catenin signalling, Notch signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>) are altered in the fAD-like mutant zebrafish brains. However, the mechanisms directly linking the fAD-like mutation to other processes (e.g. immune and stress responses) cannot be inferred directly from our results. In future, it would be useful to include zebrafish younger than 6 months of age and additional age groups between 6 and 24 months to further elucidate the sequential progression of brain transcriptome changes in zebrafish carrying a fAD-like mutation.</p>
<p>Quantifying protein abundance in young mutant zebrafish brains revealed additional sources of early-life stress. In the young mutant zebrafish brains, proteins associated with oxidative stress responses and energy metabolism in mitochondria already displayed altered abundance. Overall, stress responses were increased, consistent with the RNA-seq data, and decreased abundance of metabolic and antioxidant proteins indicated potential impairment to mitochondrial function. Both increased oxidative stress and altered energy metabolism appear to be early events in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> and it is possible that these events may induce early stress responses in the brain. Unfortunately, although we intended to integrate transcriptome and proteome information more thoroughly in this study, we were only able to reliably quantify 323 proteins across all samples, with most of these being biased towards higher-abundance proteins in the zebrafish brain. Using more sophisticated mass spectrometry technology should provide higher-resolution detection of lower abundance proteins and metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Comparison of our elucidation of brain co-expression networks with similar studies</title>
<p>We find that several gene modules are altered in mutant zebrafish brains and in human early-onset AD brains. The most significantly preserved module in the zebrafish and human brain co-expression networks analysed is enriched in immune responses and genes expressed by type 1 and 2 microglia. Remarkably, two independent studies involving co-expression analysis of AD brains by Miller et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and Zhang et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> also found a prominent immune-microglia module.</p>
<p>By comparing the zebrafish and human brain co-expression networks, we found several modules of genes which were altered in both mutant zebrafish brains and early-onset AD human brains. We found that the most significantly preserved module across the zebrafish and human brain co-expression networks was enriched in immune responses and genes expressed by type 1 and 2 microglia. Miller et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> used 18 human datasets and 20 mouse datasets representing various brain regions, diseases and Affymetrix platforms to construct consensus co-expression networks (aggregated from multiple datasets) for the human and mouse brain. Similarly, the study by Zhang et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> used over 1,647 post-mortem brain tissue samples from patients with late-onset AD to construct a consensus co-expression network for the human brain. Compared to our analysis, the large-scale analyses by Miller et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and Zhang et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> used many more samples, had broader representation of brain tissue types, included more general cases of sporadic and late-onset AD, and constructed consensus networks to increase the robustness of the co-expression network. Nevertheless, both studies independently identified a module associated with AD which is significantly enriched in immune processes and microglial genes. Collectively, the results from these studies and our analysis here suggest that immune responses and microglial cells are strongly implicated in both early-onset fAD and sporadic late-onset forms of AD. This is reasonable, given that microglia are essential cells in the brain&#x2019;s innate immune response, and neuroinflammation is a prominent feature of AD. Our results also support the idea that these responses are highly conserved across species.</p>
<p>Our analysis reveals additional key insights that may help explain why the immune-microglia module is involved in AD. First, promoter enrichment analysis of genes in the immune-microglia module indicates statistically significant enrichment in several known motifs. Intriguingly, all of these motifs are binding sites for transcription factors from either the ETS (SpiB, ELF3, ELF5, PU.1, EHF) or IRF (IRF3, IRF8, IRF1) families. This finding is important, because 1) ETS and IRF transcription factor motifs are also enriched in the promoters of genes that are up-regulated with brain aging in wild type zebrafish, but not in genes that are up-regulated with brain aging in mutant zebrafish. This suggests that the genes they regulate are important during normal brain aging and that their dysregulation may contribute to pathology. 2) ETS and IRF transcription factors are known to mediate critical biological functions. The ETS family regulates cellular differentiation, proliferation, cell-cycle control, apoptosis, migration and mesenchymal-epithelial interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, while the IRF family regulates immune and other stress responses. Our results are consistent with those in a previous study by Gjoneska et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> that analysed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) data from mouse and human brain tissues, which found that immune response genes were up-regulated in both the CK-p25 mouse model and in human sporadic AD, that these genes were enriched in ChIP-seq peaks corresponding to ETS and IRF transcription factor motifs, and that microglia-specific activation was likely responsible for these gene expression changes.</p>
<p>Although revealing valuable insights, our comparison of zebrafish and human brain co-expression networks is limited for several reasons. First, the zebrafish dataset is RNA-seq data while the human dataset is microarray-based data. Differences in the correlation in noise inherent to either technology have been shown previously to affect connectivity within network modules, although functional enrichment of modules tends to be highly preserved between microarray and RNA-seq co-expression networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. This means that our current analysis is likely unable to accurately detect most highly-connected genes within modules that are preserved between the zebrafish and human co-expression networks, which makes it difficult to find key genes that might drive changes in the co-expression network. Second, while entire zebrafish brains were used in our analyses, the analysed human brain tissues were derived only from the posterior cingulate region. Although a previous analysis identified similar co-expression networks across different brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, it is likely that differences in the properties of networks constructed from different regions could confound our ability to fully detect similarities and differences between the co-expression networks of zebrafish and human brains.</p>

<title>AD-like transcriptome and proteome changes can occur without amyloid plaques typically associated with AD</title>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, the gene and protein expression changes observed in our aged fAD-like mutation model zebrafish were not reflected in an obvious histopathology. However, this is consistent with an attempt to model neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in adult zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and with observations from heterozygous fAD mutation knock-in models in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (although in general, mouse single heterozygous mutation brain histology phenotypes have not been reported). It is important to realise that differences in scale between the mass of a human brain and the brains of mice and zebrafish, (&#x007E;1,000-fold and &#x007E;70,000 fold respectively) mean that any metabolic or other stresses in the small brains of the genetic models are likely exacerbated in the huge human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Human brains also lack the regenerative ability of zebrafish, while mice and zebrafish both show sequence divergences in the Ab regions of their APP orthologous genes greater than seen in most mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the heterozygous fAD-like mutation models of mice and (with this paper) zebrafish are probably the closest one can come to modelling AD in these organisms without subjectively imposing an opinion of what AD is by addition of further mutations, transgenes etc. We speculate that the transcriptional state of 2-year-old fAD-like mutant zebrafish brains may represent, at the molecular level, the zebrafish equivalent of AD.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the pathological role in AD of A&#x03B2;, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles is still debated and that around one quarter of people clinically diagnosed with AD are, upon post-mortem examination, seen to lack typical amyloid pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. By the current definition, these people do not have AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> although this restrictive definition has been questioned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. Many people also have brains containing high levels of Ab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup> or Braak stage III to VI neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> without obvious dementia. Thus, the connection between amyloid pathology, histopathological neurodegeneration and Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease dementia is unclear. Our data indicate that the AD cellular pathologies may occur subsequent to cryptic but dramatic changes in the brain&#x2019;s molecular state (gene and protein expression) that are the underlying drivers of AD.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also important to acknowledge that the specific fAD mutation (K115fs) modelled in this study is an uncommon fAD mutation that causes frameshifting and truncation of the human PSEN2 protein, and it is unclear how gene expression alterations caused by this mutation may differ from the far more common frame-preserving fAD mutations. Our laboratory is currently developing additional mutant zebrafish modelling different fAD-causing mutations, and future analysis incorporating these zebrafish to produce a consensus co-expression network should help to identify and refine a &#x201C;signature&#x201D; of the gene and protein expression changes that cause fAD.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall, our study highlights the importance of studying gene expression changes in animals closely modelling the genetic state of human fAD in order to elucidate the early molecular-level brain changes driving AD pathogenesis. In particular, zebrafish heterozygous for single, endogenous fAD-like mutations may be useful for exploring several AD-related changes in the brain, including increased brain activity preceding AD symptoms, the role of glucocorticoid-mediated stress responses in the development of AD, and the roles of ETS and IRF transcription factors in regulating microglia-associated genes in AD.</p>

We retained default parameters with the <italic>HOMER</italic> findMotifs.pl program with the following modifications: the 18,296 ENSEMBL genes used in the differential gene expression analysis were specified as the background genes, and promoter regions were defined as 1500 bp upstream and 200 bp downstream of the transcription start site of each gene. We defined motifs as being significantly enriched in a set of genes if the Bonferroni-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value was less than 0.05.</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS Data Processing</title>
<p>Raw MS/MS spectra were analysed using <italic>MaxQuant</italic> (V. 1.5.3.17). A False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 0.01 for peptides and a minimum peptide length of 7 amino acids was specified. MS/MS spectra were searched against the zebrafish UniProt database. <italic>MaxQuant</italic> output files for the 6-month-old and 24-month-old samples were processed in separate batches with the <italic>MSStats</italic> R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup> due to an unresolvable batch effect in the data caused by generation of spectra on different days by different operators. Briefly, peptide intensities were log<sub>2</sub>-transformed and quantile normalised, followed by using an accelerated failure time model to impute censored peptides. Peptide-level intensities were summarised to protein-level intensities using a Tukey&#x2019;s median polish method. This resulted in 2,814 peptides (summarised to 534 proteins) for the 6-month-old data and 3,378 peptides (summarised to 582 proteins) for the 24-month-old data. After <italic>MSStats</italic> data processing, the 6-month-old and 24-month-old protein log<sub>2</sub>-intensities were combined, quantile normalised using the normaliseBetweenArrays function from the <italic>limma</italic> R package, and filtered to only retain the 323 proteins that were detected across all samples.</p>

<title>Differential Protein Analysis</title>
<p>Differential protein abundance analysis was performed using <italic>limma</italic> which has been shown to be highly applicable to proteomics data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>. A linear model was fitted to each protein and moderated <italic>t</italic>-test performed to test for differential abundance between samples. Proteins were identified as being differentially abundant if their FDR-adjusted p-values were below 0.05. Over-representation analysis using the goana and kegga functions from <italic>limma</italic> were used to test for enriched gene ontology terms and KEGG pathways respectively.</p>

<title>Network construction</title>
<p>Network construction and analysis used functions from the <italic>WGCNA</italic> R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> applied to the same filtered set of gene counts from the earlier differential expression analysis. We additionally downloaded processed human microarray data from ArrayExpress under the E-GEOD-39420 accession number (raw dataset at GEO with accession number GSE39420). This data set contains gene expression profiles derived from the posterior cingulate tissue of 21 adult brains (7 <italic>PSEN1</italic> mutation carriers with early-onset AD; 7 early-onset AD cases without <italic>PSEN1</italic> mutations; 7 controls). Mutations represented in the <italic>PSEN1</italic> mutation carriers include E120 G, V89 L, and M139 T. The mean age was 53.9 years (s.d = 6.5 years) for the <italic>PSEN1</italic> mutation carriers with early-onset AD, 63.3 years (s.d = 4.3 years) for the early-onset AD lacking <italic>PSEN1</italic> mutations, and 49.7 years (s.d = 4.5 years) for the control group. Principal component analysis revealed no association between having AD and either sex or <italic>APOE</italic> genotype of individuals. The microarray data was already background adjusted, normalised and summarised by Antonell et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We then applied the collapseRows function with default parameters to retain only one gene per probe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>. Using the <italic>BioMart</italic> package, we retrieved zebrafish &#x2018;one-to-one&#x2019; homologous genes for human genes. We matched zebrafish genes to human homologous genes via common Ensembl gene identifiers and retained only genes that were expressed in both the human and zebrafish datasets, leaving 13,110 genes for network construction. To further reduce noise during network construction, we calculated connectivities for each gene in each dataset and retained only the 7,118 genes with connectivities above the 10th percentile of all connectivities. To construct approximately scale-free weighted networks, the Pearson correlation was calculated between each pair of genes, and the resulting correlation matrix was raised to the soft-thresholding power of 14 to produce a signed adjacency matrix for each dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Next, we applied a transformation to obtain a measure of topological overlap for each pair of genes. Lastly, we hierarchically clustered genes in each dataset based on their topological overlap (using the measure 1 &#x2013; Topological Overlap) to form a dendrogram where branches represented distinct modules of genes showing similar expression patterns across all samples. To identify modules of co-expressed genes, we used the Hybrid Tree Cut method from the <italic>dynamicTreeCut</italic> package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup>. We used default parameters except for the following modifications to define modules in the zebrafish network: minimum module size set at 40 genes, 0.90 as the maximum distance to assign previously unassigned genes to modules during PAM (Partioning Around Medoids) stage, and the deepSplit parameter to 1 for the zebrafish data set and 2 for the human data set.</p>

<sec id="s5l2">
<title>Network Analysis</title>
<p>We assessed the functional enrichment of each module using default settings in the <italic>anRichment</italic> R package. To calculate the correlation between modules and phenotypic traits, we calculated the hybrid-robust correlation between the first principal component of each module and four binary variables defining the experimental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup>. We evaluated the preservation of zebrafish modules in the human network and vice versa using the &#x201C;modulePreservation&#x201D; function from <italic>WGCNA</italic>, which uses a permutation-based approach to determine whether module properties (e.g. density, connectivity) are preserved in another network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. We also used the Sankey diagram functionality in the <italic>networkD3</italic> package to visualise overlap between zebrafish and human modules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s5l3">
<title>Network visualisation</title>
<p>To visualise zebrafish and human networks, we imported edges and nodes into <italic>Gephi</italic> and applied the OpenOrd algorithm with default settings, which is suitable for visualising weighted, undirected networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>. We coloured the nodes (genes) based on their assigned modules from <italic>WGCNA</italic>.</p>
