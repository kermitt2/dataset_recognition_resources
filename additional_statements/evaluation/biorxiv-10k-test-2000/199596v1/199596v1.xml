<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Dimorphic fungal pathogens cause a significant human disease burden and unlike most fungal pathogens affect immunocompetent hosts. Most dimorphic fungi are found in the family Ajellomycetaceae, including the genera <italic>Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Paracoccidioides</italic>, and the recently described <italic>Emergomyces</italic>. To examine the origin of virulence and host adaptation in these fungal pathogens, we compared the gene content of classic systemic, opportunistic, and non-pathogenic species, including new genomes for <italic>Emmonsia</italic> species and two closely non-pathogenic species, <italic>Helicocarpus griseus</italic> and <italic>Polytolypa hystricis.</italic> We examined differences in gene content between pathogens and environmental fungi, and found that gene families related to plant degradation, synthesis of secondary metabolites, and amino acid and lipid metabolism are retained in <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic>. Genes of central importance in dimorphic pathogenic fungi such as heat shock response proteins, morphological switch related proteins are conserved in non-pathogenic species. However, we found that changes in the copy number of proteases, phosphotransferases and transcription factors in systemic dimorphic relative to non-dimorphic species may have aided the evolution of specialized gene regulatory programs to rapidly adapt to higher temperatures and new nutritional environments. Notably, we found that both of the basal branching, non-pathogenic species appear homothallic, with both mating type locus idiomorphs fused at a single locus, whereas all related pathogenic species are heterothallic. These differences revealed that independent changes in nutrient acquisition capacity but similar host/substrate shift from plants to animals have occurred in the Onygenaceae and Ajellomycetaceae, and highlighted how the dimorphic pathogens from Ajellomycetaceae have adapted to the host immune response and decreased their capacity for life stages in environmental niches.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Among millions of ubiquitous fungal species that pose no threat to humans, a small number of species cause devastating diseases in immunocompetent individuals. Notably, many human pathogenic species are ascomycetes in the order Onygenales, which comprises dermatophytes (e.g. <italic>Trichophyton</italic> spp.), the spherule-forming dimorphic pathogen <italic>Coccidioides</italic>, and yeast-forming dimorphic pathogens <italic>Histoplasma, Paracoccidioides</italic>, and <italic>Blastomyces</italic>. Dimorphism is a specialized morphogenetic adaptation allowing both growth in the environment and colonization of a host and is critical for the lifecycle of dimorphic fungal pathogens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In yeast-forming pathogens, dimorphism has been broadly defined as the ability to generate both yeast (e.g. blastoconidia) in the host or at 37&#x00B0;C, and mycelia (e.g. conidia-producing or other hyphae) in the environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. During fungal evolution, dimorphism has arisen independently multiple times in saprophytic fungi, as is manifested in the wide distribution of dimorphic species across the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota phyla <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, the dimorphic fungi in the order Onygenales are primary pathogens causing systemic mycosis in healthy humans, and collectively cause over 650,000 new infections a year in the United States alone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Dimorphic fungi can persist as latent infections in tens of millions of people worldwide and may reactivate when the host becomes immune-deficient <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The largest cluster of thermally dimorphic human pathogenic fungi belongs to the Onygenales family Ajellomycetaceae, which includes <italic>Histoplasma, Paracoccidioides</italic>, and <italic>Blastomyces</italic>. In addition to these medically important genera, the Ajellomycetaceae family also includes more rarely observed opportunistic pathogenic species including <italic>Emmonsia parva</italic> and <italic>Emmonsia crescens</italic>, which undergo a thermal dimorphic transition to produce adiaconidia rather than yeast and cause adiospiromycosis sporadically in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This group also includes <italic>Lacazia loboi</italic>, the yeast-like etiological agent of lobomycosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Of public health concern, recent reports have documented the worldwide emergence of yeast-forming Ajellomycetaceae that cause systemic mycoses predominantly in immunocompromised patients, often with high case-fatality rates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Morphological and phylogenetic analyses were combined to demarcate species boundaries within the Ajellomycetaceae with clinical significance, which led to the description of the novel dimorphic species <italic>Emergomyces africanus, E. pasteurianus</italic>, and <italic>Blastomyces percursus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Non-dimorphic species have also been documented as early diverging Ajellomycetaceae, including <italic>Helicocarpus griseus</italic> and <italic>Polytolypa hystricis</italic>, neither of which has been associated with disease in mammals. These species are found in environmental samples and do not appear to undergo a thermally regulated dimorphic transition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that such phenotypic differences within the Ajellomycetaceae could be associated with gene family expansions or contractions, as a consequence of gene duplication and gene loss events, and that species comparison might reveal evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation in the systemic dimorphic fungi. Previous comparative and population genomic studies within Ajellomycetaceae had found evidence of gene family contractions and expansions associated with virulence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Other Onygenales genera outside the Ajellomycetaceae represented by published genome sequences include <italic>Coccidioides</italic> and the non-pathogenic related species <italic>Uncinocarpus reesii</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, as well as diverse dermatophytes including species that cause skin infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Recently, the genomes of four non-pathogenic Onygenaceae species closely related to <italic>Coccidioides</italic> were described, providing additional resolution into changes in gene content between pathogenic and non-pathogenic Onygenales <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Together these studies helped establish how gene content is related to the life cycle of different dimorphic pathogenic fungi and dermatophytes; for example, gene family contractions in cellulases and other plant metabolism genes, and gene family expansions in proteases, keratinases and other animal tissue metabolism genes, indicated that dimorphic fungi switched from a nutrition system based on plants to one system based on animals, though mostly relative to relative to outgroups to the Onygenales such as <italic>Aspergillus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In the Onygenales, this hypothesis was tested experimentally; comparing growth on a wide variety of compounds revealed that in <italic>Uncinocarpus reesii</italic> hyphal growth was restricted on carbohydrates and considerably improved on proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To examine key transition points in evolution of virulence and host adaptation in the dimorphic fungi, we increased the phylogenetic density within the Ajellomycetaceae by sequencing the genomes of non-pathogenic and emerging species and then performed comparative genomic analyses of the systemic, opportunistic, and non-pathogenic species. Although representative genomes for most of the described pathogenic Onygenales genera have been sequenced, the only strictly non-pathogenic species that have been sequenced are closely related to <italic>Coccidioides</italic> in the family Onygenaceae. Here, we have sequenced four additional Onygenales species from the family Ajellomycetaceae; this includes <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic>, neither of which has been associated with disease in mammals, and two additional adiaspore-forming strains of <italic>E. parva</italic> and <italic>E. crescens</italic> with distinct phenotypic properties. Leveraging our previous genomic studies and these additional genome sequences, we have characterized the extent of gene family expansions and contractions to provide a better understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation in systemic dimorphic fungi in the Ajellomycetaceae.</p>

<title>Genome comparisons of <italic>Ajellomycetaceae</italic>, the largest group of dimorphic human pathogenic fungi</title>
<p>Building on previous genomic analyses of the members from the Ajellomycetaceae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, we sequenced using Illumina technology the genomes of four species within Ajellomycetaceae with demarcated phenotypic differences. In addition to <italic>Emmonsia parva</italic> UAMH139 and <italic>Emmonsia crescens</italic> UAMH3008, we sequenced the genomes of one strain of <italic>Emmonsia parva</italic> UAMH130 (type strain) and one additional strain of <italic>E. crescens</italic> UAMH4076. <italic>E. parva</italic> UAMH130 is from lungs of a rodent in USA, and <italic>E. crescens</italic> UAMH4076 is from a greenhouse source in Canada <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We also sequenced two species that live in soil, where they are found in animal excrement but not associated with disease; neither species appears to undergo a thermal dimorphic switch to a parasitic phase, as there is no observation of a yeast-like form <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. This includes one strain of <italic>Helicocarpus griseus</italic>, UAMH5409 (Type strain; synonym <italic>Spiromastix grisea</italic>), isolated from gazelle dung in Algeria, and one strain of <italic>Polytolypa hystricis</italic>, UAMH7299, isolated from porcupine dung in Canada.</p>
<p>The <italic>de novo</italic> genome assemblies of these four species have similar sizes to those of other genera within the Ajellomycetaceae including <italic>Histoplasma, Emergomyces</italic> and <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and have high representation of conserved eukaryotic genes (<bold>Figure S1, S2</bold>). The assembly sizes were 27.8 Mb in <italic>E. parva</italic> UAMH130, 33.8 Mb in <italic>E. crescens</italic> UAMH4076, 32.0 Mb in <italic>P. hystricis</italic>, and 34.7 Mb in <italic>H. griseus</italic> (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). In addition, using both the CEGMA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and BUSCO <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> conserved eukaryotic gene sets, we found that the predicted genes for each sequenced species are nearly complete; all of these genomes include 96-98&#x0025; of the core genes (<bold>Figure S2</bold>). The total numbers of predicted genes in <italic>E. parva</italic> UAMH130 (<italic>n</italic> = 8,202), and <italic>E. crescens</italic> UAMH4076 (<italic>n</italic> = 8,909) were similar to those found in annotated genome assemblies of other Ajellomycetaceae (<italic>n</italic> = 9,041 on average); however, relative to other Ajellomycetaceae <italic>P. hystricis</italic>, and <italic>H. griseus</italic> have a modest increase in gene content (<italic>n</italic> = 9,935 and <italic>n</italic> = 10,225, respectively; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>; <bold>Figure S1</bold>).</p>

<p>Examining the guanine-cytosine (GC) content in the genomes <italic>E. parva</italic> UAMH130, <italic>E. crescens</italic> UAMH4076, <italic>H. griseus</italic> UAMH5409 and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> UAMH7299 revealed that none of these genome assemblies showed evidence of the pronounced bimodality of GC-content observed in <italic>B. gilchristii</italic> and <italic>B. dermatitidis</italic> (<bold>Figure S3</bold>; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>). This highlights that the acquisition of repetitive elements contributing to bimodal GC distribution was a unique phenomena during the evolution of the <italic>B. gilchristii</italic> and <italic>B. dermatitidis</italic> within the Onygenales. In addition, UAMH139 showed a small peak of low GC that is largely absent in UAHM130 (44.4 &#x0025; and 47.5 &#x0025; GC, respectively; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), which is consistent with the phylogenetic divergence between these two strains, and highlights an independent gain of repetitive sequences (10.4 &#x0025; and 2.6 &#x0025; repetitive bases in UAMH139 and UAMH130, respectively; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Similarly, <italic>E. crescens</italic> UAMH3008 and UAHM4076 have demarcated differences in GC and repetitive content; UAHM4076 has a higher peak of low GC sequences (42.9 &#x0025;GC, 15.0 &#x0025; repetitive bases in UAMH4076; 45.2 &#x0025;GC, 5.1 &#x0025; repetitive bases in UAMH3008; <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Additionally, the more basal strain more basal <italic>P. hystricis</italic> UAMH7299 has a representation of low GC sequences (45.6 &#x0025;GC, 12.8 &#x0025; repeat), but in <italic>H. griseus</italic> UAMH5409 they are almost absent (48.0 &#x0025;GC, 1.8 &#x0025; repeats; <bold>Figure S3</bold>). These results highlight the dynamic and independent expansion of repetitive elements during Ajellomycetaceae evolution.</p>

<p>We estimated a strongly supported phylogeny of the newly sequenced <italic>E. parva</italic> UAMH130, <italic>E. crescens</italic> UAMH4075, <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> strains relative to other dimorphic fungi using maximum likelihood and 2,505 single copy core genes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). Branch length and topology supported the placement and relationships of <italic>P. hystricis</italic> and <italic>H. griseus</italic> within the Ajellomycetaceae as basally branching. The two <italic>E. parva</italic> isolates (UAMH130 and UAMH139) do not form a single well-defined clade, confirming that <italic>E. parva</italic> may not be a single species. In addition to longer branch lengths suggesting higher divergence of these isolates, the average genome-wide identity between UAMH130 and UAMH139 is much lower even comparing across groups that represent recently subdivided species, for example, within <italic>B. gilchristii</italic> and <italic>B. dermatitidis</italic> or <italic>P. lutzii</italic> and <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic>, with an average identity of 88.6&#x0025; versus 95.8&#x0025; and 91.1 respectively (<bold>Figure S4</bold>). <italic>E. parva</italic> (UAMH130-Type) is the most basal member of the clade including <italic>E. parva</italic> UAMH139 and <italic>Blastomyces</italic> species <italic>B. percursus, B. gilchristii, and B. dermatitidis</italic>. Previous molecular approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and recent multi-locus approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> also support the polyphyletic nature of <italic>E. parva</italic> isolates. Although both isolates of <italic>E. crescens</italic> (UAMH3008 and UAMH4076) form a single clade, the genetic variation between them is also greater than that observed within other species from the same genus in the Ajellomycetaceae, with long branch lengths and slightly lower average genome identity (91.8&#x0025;) between these isolates than seen in other intraspecies comparisons within the family (<bold>Figure S4</bold>).

<p>The intercalated clades of primary pathogens (e.g. <italic>H. capsulatum, P. brasiliensis</italic> and <italic>B. dermatitidis</italic>), opportunistic pathogens (e.g. <italic>E. pasteurianus, E. africanus</italic>) producing a parasitic yeast phase, and non-pathogens producing adiaconidia-type cells rather than yeast cells (e.g. <italic>E. parva</italic> and <italic>E. crescens</italic>) suggests that the dimorphic fungi in the Ajellomycetaceae have undergone numerous evolutionary transitions allowing adaptation, infection and virulence to humans and other mammals, and that interactions with other eukaryotes in the environment may help maintain the capacity for pathogenic growth in a mammalian host (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). The non-thermally-dimorphic species <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> are highly supported as early diverging lineages of Ajellomycetaceae as previously suggested <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>; genomic analysis strongly supports <italic>P. hystricis</italic> as the earliest diverging lineage within the sequenced Ajellomycetaceae, and large genetic variation between these early saprophytes. The basal position of both <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> in the family Ajellomycetaceae and the large divergence between them suggests that the history of this family could involve evolution from saprophytic non-thermotolerant and non-yeast-forming ancestral species to dimorphic human pathogenic species after the divergence with <italic>H. griseus</italic>, including the adaptation to higher temperatures and the appearance of a dimorphic switch and a yeast parasitic phase (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Substantial gene family contractions underlie the shift from growth on plant to animals</title>
<p>By comparing the gene conservation and functional annotation of primary and opportunistic dimorphic pathogens with their saprophytic relatives <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis,</italic> we identified significant decreases in gene family size (PFAM domain and GO-term counts, corrected p-value &#x003C; 0.05) associated with a host/substrate shift from plants to animals in the pathogenic Ajellomycetaceae (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>).

These gene family changes suggest that dimorphic fungi from Ajellomycetaceae are not typical soil fungi in that they might maintain a close association with living mammals or other organisms such as protozoa or insects.

Our analysis also recapitulates previous reports comparing smaller numbers of genomes from the order Onygenales <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> that showed that genes coding for enzymes involved in the deconstruction of plant cell walls were absent from all the human pathogens (e.g. <italic>Paracoccidioides, Blastomyces, Histoplasma, Coccidioides</italic>) and non-pathogenic Onygenaceae (e.g. <italic>Uncinocarpus reesii, Byssoonygena ceratinophila, Amauroascus mutatus, Amauroascus niger, Chrysosporium queenslandicum</italic>) whereas these enzymes were commonly conserved in the non-pathogens outside the order Onygenales (including <italic>Aspergillus, Fusarium, Neurospora</italic>; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; Table S2</bold>). Notably,increasing the phylogenetic density within the order Onygenales in this study revealed that the loss of plant cell wall degradative enzymes occurred independently in two families within the Onygenales, and this highlights transitions between saprophytic and pathogenic species, where <italic>Helicocarpus</italic> and <italic>Polytolypa</italic> are have retained enzymes required to live on plant material in the soil, whereas non-pathogenic species from the Onygenaceae, which are not adapted to survive in mammals, have also lost capacity to degrade plant material.</p>

We identified predicted biosynthetic clusters using the program antiSMASH (antibiotics and Secondary Metabolism Analysis Shell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>). Overall, dimorphic pathogenic fungi from Ajellomycetaceae have fewer polyketide synthase (PKs) gene clusters than the saprophytic <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> (<bold>Table S3; Figure S5</bold>). Dimorphic pathogens had lost essential genes or complete clusters of the type 1 and type 3 PKs, and terpene clusters (<bold>Table S3</bold>). Type 3 PKs are not common in fungi, and were not previously reported in the Ajellomycetaceae. Furthermore, <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> but not dimorphic fungi have genes related to those involved in antibiotic biosynthetic pathways (ko01055; <bold>Table S2</bold>). Previous studies had shown that <italic>P. hystricis</italic> secretes a pentacyclic triterpenoid exhibiting antifungal and antibiotic activity, denominated Polytolypin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, suggesting this terpene cluster is intact and may produce this molecule. Loss of such secondary metabolic pathways may weaken responses to other microbes in the environment. In addition to secondary metabolite biosynthesis, Ajellomycetaceae dimorphic fungi showed significant decreases in pathways related with the production of sphingolipids, chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation, linoleic acid metabolism, and bisphenol degradation (KEGG-EC counts, corrected p-value &#x003C; 0.05; <bold>Table S2</bold>). Loss of degradative pathways for bisphenol and chloralkanes in particular likely reflect encountering these molecules in the environment but not during pathogenic growth. Altogether, these shifts in gene content highlight how the Ajellomycetaceae dimorphic pathogenic fungi became less adapted to survive in the soil than the more basally diverging saprophytic species <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic>.</p>

<title>Transition among carbohydrate metabolism and protein catabolism</title>
<p>We found that the evolution of carbohydrate metabolism and protein catabolism also occurred independently within the Ajellomycetaceae. We annotated carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy) and peptidases (MEROPS; <bold>Methods</bold>), and using enrichment analysis found substantial shifts in the relative proportion of these groups among dimorphic and saprophytic species. Notably, the pathogenic Ajellomycetaceae species, but not the saprophytic species <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic>, showed a dramatic reduction of carbohydrate active enzymes, including 44 categories that were totally absent and 29 that were significantly depleted; these included glycoside hydrolases, glycosyltransferases, carbohydrate esterases, and polysaccharide lyases (corrected p &#x003C; 0.05; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). The fact that these enzymes are reduced in dimorphic pathogenic Ajellomycetaceae but not in <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> confirms that reduced carbohydrate metabolism occurred independently Ajellomycetaceae from the reduction in the Onygenaceae, originally noted in the spherule-dimorphic pathogen <italic>Coccidioides</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast to carbohydrate active enzymes, we found that the total number of peptidases is relatively similar in dimorphic and saprophytic species within the Ajellomycetaceae. Significant expansions were found in specific families in <italic>Blastomyces, Histoplasma</italic> and Onygenaceae and Arthrodermataceae species relative to <italic>P. hystricis</italic> and <italic>H. griseus</italic>, including the A11, S12, and S08A peptidases (corrected p &#x003C; 0.05; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). The peptidase family A11 contains endopeptidases involved in the processing of polyproteins encoded by retrotransposons, and the increase in copy number is correlated with the genome expansion due to the proliferation of repetitive elements in <italic>Blastomyces</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The peptidase family S12 contains serine-type D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidases, and S8 contains the serine endopeptidase subtilisin. Two families of fungal metalloendopeptidases (S8 and M35) were previously reported to be expanded in <italic>Coccidioides</italic> relative to saprophytic species outside the order Onygenales <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, it has been reported that the Ajellomycetaceae includes fewer copies of multiple classes of peptidases (M36, M43, S8) as well as an associated inhibitor (I9, inhibitor of S8 protease) relative to other Onygenales <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Comparing across all the Onygenales, we found that all pathogenic Onygenales, as well as saprophytes related to <italic>Coccidioides</italic> such as <italic>U. reesii</italic>, had a higher ratio of proteases to carbohydrate active enzymes than the saprophytic Ajellomycetaceae <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). This strengthens the evidence that the adaptation and specialization of dimorphic Ajellomycetaceae occurred independently and that non-pathogenic Onygenaceae may represent an intermediate state in showing gene content changes associated with pathogens, which allowed these fungi to use proteins as a main source of energy in nutrient-limited environments.</p>

<title>Loss of transporters in Ajellomycetaceae dimorphic fungi</title>
<p>In addition to major shifts in enzymes that support nutrient acquisition, the dimorphic Ajellomycetaceae have undergone losses of families of transporters. These include the large classes of major facilitator superfamily transporters (PF07690) and sugar transporters (PF00083) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>)</bold>.

<title>Pathogenesis-related genes are conserved in both saprophytic and pathogenic lifestyles</title>

Some of these genes such as the <italic>RYP</italic>1-3 transcriptional regulators and the dimorphism-regulating histidine kinase <italic>DRK1</italic> have been connected with morphogenetic adaptation in response to environmental stimuli, and with key determinants of the mycelia to yeast transition in dimorphic human pathogenic fungi in the Ajellomycetaceae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.

The fact that genes of central importance for high-temperature growth and dimorphic switch are conserved in <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> suggests that these saprophytes may sense different gradations of temperature, or that the mechanism that triggers a rapid response to the adaptation may not be rapid enough to enable these fungi to grow at 37&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>Dimorphic Ajellomycetaceae may have evolved specialized mechanisms to regulate their transcriptional responses; these include expansion of proteins related to the regulation of transcription, and protein kinase activity (GO term enrichment analysis; <italic>q</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05; <bold>Table S2</bold>), which are all expanded in dimorphic pathogens relative to <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic>. Thus, the gain of transcription factors, transcriptional regulators and phosphotransferases suggests that rapid evolution of transcriptional mechanisms may underlie the adaptation to both high temperature and the dimorphic transition. As one of the largest categories enriched in dimorphic Ajellomycetaceae but not in saprophytic species was the protein kinase activity (<bold>Table S2</bold>), we further classified protein kinases using Kinannote <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, including the divergent fungal-specific protein kinase (<italic>FunK1</italic>; ref; <bold>Methods</bold>).

The shift in these families was previously observed in both <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> within this group and in the related <italic>Coccidioides</italic>&#x2013;<italic>Uncinocarpus</italic> clade (Desjardins et al. 2011; Sharpton et al. 2009); more recently the comparison with non-pathogenic Onygenaceae species supported previous reports of the contraction of gene families involved in digesting plant cell walls throughout the Onygenales, and of the expansion of gene families involved in digesting animal protein (Whiston et al., 2016). Whereas the studies on contraction of gene families involved in digesting plant cell walls addressed other fungi outside the order Onygenales, our analysis shows that <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> did not experience such a contraction, which suggests that contractions in gene families involved in digesting plant cell walls throughout the Onygenales have occurred multiple times independently and more recently in Onygenaceae and Ajellomycetaceae families.</p>
<p>Since many virulence factors and dimorphic switch related proteins were also conserved in the non-dimorphic Ajellomycetaceae species, this suggests that these proteins could be needed not only for survival in the host, and that presence of virulence factors alone does not specify pathogenicity. In dimorphic Ajellomycetaceae other mechanisms such as gene regulation or selection may play a role in how these genes respond during distinct stimuli. In addition, it is possible that those virulence factors in mammals were also needed for the survival in the soil, for example to survive interaction with amoebae or in insects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. However, there are some virulence factors that are needed for virulence in mammals that are not necessary for virulence in other eukaryotes. For example, the alpha mating factor locus in <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> contributes to virulence in mice, but no difference was observed in the interaction of congenic <italic>MAT</italic>&#x03B1; and <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> strains with amoebae (Nielsen et al. 2005). While the human host is a very different habitat in comparison with soil or excrements of animals that are the most common natural niche for this group of fungi, interactions with other eukaryotes in the environment likely selected for some properties that also predisposed species to become pathogenic to humans.</p>
<p>Selection pressures in the environment are responsible for the emergence and maintenance of traits that confer upon some soil microbes the capacity for survival in animal hosts. This is important to understand the evolution and emergence of novel pathogens. For example, <italic>Emergomyces africanus</italic> has recently emerged and numerous cases of novel yeast-forming species have been reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. However, <italic>Emergomyces</italic> species have not been found in other mammals like rodents or in the soil. In addition, <italic>E. africanus</italic> has a very restricted geographic distribution. Across the Onygenales, nearly all species have a high lower ratio of proteases to carbohydrate active enzymes; the exceptions are the two saprophytes <italic>P. hystricis</italic> and <italic>H. griseus</italic>, but not the saprophytes related to <italic>Coccidioides</italic> such as <italic>Uncinocarpus reesii</italic>. This genomic profile matches the results of growth assays for the non-pathogenic species <italic>U. reesii</italic>; this species can grow on a wide range of proteinaceous substrates but only a very limited range of carbohydrates, namely cellulose and its component glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Together, these findings suggest that fungi in the Onygenales transitioned from saprophytes that digest plant materials to saprophytes that digest more limited plant materials and a wide range of animal proteins, and finally those that are major animal pathogens.</p>
<p>We found many of the genes with roles in the dimorphic transition and virulence are conserved in the saprophytic species <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic>, and we did not find larger patterns of gain of functional classes in pathogenic species. However, we found smaller changes in gene content related to the regulation of gene expression and signaling that may account for the ability to grow at high temperature, species specific morphological transitions, and therefore their differences in virulence, since rapid thermo-tolerance and morphological adaptation is essential for pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Overall, we found significant expansions of the number of the protein kinase <italic>FunK1</italic> family, transcription factors and other genes associated with the regulation of gene expression in yeast-forming Ajellomycetaceae relative to adiaspore-forming and saprophytic species. Our comparison with saprophytic Ajellomycetaceae highlights dramatic decreases and complete absences of several classes of gene families that are important for survival and growth in a soil environment.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, we found that both more basal non-pathogenic Ajellomycetaceae species <italic>H. griseus</italic> and <italic>P. hystricis</italic> appear homothallic, in striking contrast to all the previously described largely pathogenic species in this group that are all heterothallic. <italic>P. hystricis</italic> has a fused mating type locus, with both idiomorphs, <italic>HMG</italic> box (<italic>MAT 1-2</italic>) and alpha box (<italic>MAT1-1</italic>), fused at a single locus, and the same is likely true of <italic>H. griseus</italic>, as genes are located at the ends of two scaffolds in this assembly. In addition, we found that this is also true in the non-pathogenic Onygenaceae species <italic>Amauroascus mutatus</italic> and <italic>Byssoonygena ceratinophila</italic> have both mating type idiomorphs. <italic>A. mutatus</italic> also has both mating type idiomorphs located on the same scaffold; however, these are separated by a much larger distance than is typically observed. This suggests that this locus has been subject to novel recombination events either to bring the two idiomorphs nearby on the same scaffold or alternatively in rearranging a fused locus. While it has been previously suggested that the ancestor of the Onygenales very likely was heterothallic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, the placement of multiple lineages of homothallic species in this group raises the possibility of a heterothallic ancestor, with more recent transitions in pathogenic species to be homothallic and rearrangements of the mating locus in others such as <italic>P. hystricis</italic> and <italic>A. mutatus</italic>. Loss of the capacity for homothallic self-mating could increase the frequency of out-crossing and this may be beneficial to some species under pressure from their environment or host <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> such as the pathogenic species in this group. Examining the mating type loci of additional non-pathogenic species in the Onygenales would further reveal the if there are novel configurations of homothallic or heterothallic loci, which may help infer the mating ability of ancestral species and the timing of transitions in pathogens and non-pathogens.</p>
<p>Our phylogenomic analysis revealed that dimorphic pathogens in the Onygenales have undergone multiple evolutionary transitions that enabled infection of humans and other mammals. Some such as the loss of plant cell wall degrading enzymes are convergent for pathogens in the two families of Onygenales. Our comparisons also revealed major differences in non-pathogenic species between these two families, which suggested that some species appear intermediate between saprophytes and pathogens in terms of having a shift in metabolic capacity without associated pathogenic growth. Targeting additional non-pathogenic species within the Ajellomycetaceae (e.g. <italic>Emmonsiellopsis</italic>) for genome sequencing and comparison would help further refine the picture of the overall evolution of this important group of fungi.</p>

<title>Gene family and protein domain analysis</title>
<p>To identify gene content changes that could play a role in the evolution of the dimorphism and pathogenesis within Ajellomycetaceae, we searched for expansions or contractions in functionally classified genes compared to the other fungi from the order Onygenales. Genes were functionally annotated by assigning PFAM domains, GO terms, and KEGG classification. HMMER3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> was used to identify PFAM domains using release 27. GO terms were assigned using Blast2GO <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, with a minimum e-value of 1x10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Protein kinases were identified using Kinannote <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and divergent FunK1 kinases were further identified using HMMER3. We further annotated carbohydrate active enzymes, peptidases, and transporter families using the CAZY version 07-15-2016 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, MEROPS version 9.12 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and TCDB version 01-05-2017 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> databases, respectively. Proteins were searched against their corresponding databases using BLAST, with minimum e-values of 1&#x00D7;10<sup>-80</sup> for CAZY, 1&#x00D7;10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> for MEROPS, and 1&#x00D7;10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> for TCDB.</p>
<p>To identify functional enrichments in the compared genomes, we used four gene classifications: OrthoMCL similarity clusters, PFAM domains, KEGG pathways, and Gene Ontology (GO), including different hierarchy levels, MEROPS and CAZY categories, and transporter families. Using a matrix of gene class counts for each classification type, we identified enrichment comparing two subsets of queried genomes using Fisher&#x2019;s exact test. Fisher&#x2019;s exact test was used to detect enrichment of PFAM, KEGG, GO terms, CAZY, MEROPS, and transporter families between groups of interest, and p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Significant (corrected p-value &#x003C; 0.05) gene class expansions or depletions were examined for different comparisons.</p>
