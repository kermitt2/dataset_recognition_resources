<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Acute inflammation in humans or mice enhances the analgesic properties of opioids. However, the inflammatory transducers that prime opioid receptor signaling in nociceptors are unknown. We found that TRPV1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice are insensitive to peripheral opioid analgesia in an inflammatory pain model. We report that TRPV1 channel activation drives a MAPK signaling pathway accompanied by the shuttling of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to the nucleus. This shuttling in turn prevents: &#x03B2;-arrestin2-receptor recruitment, subsequent internalization of agonist-bound mu opioid receptor (MOR), and suppression of DAMGO-induced inhibition of N-type calcium current observed upon desensitization. Consequently, inflammation-induced activation of TRPV1 preserves opioid analgesic potency in a mouse model of opioid receptor desensitization. Overall, our work reveals a TRPV1-mediated signaling mechanism, involving &#x03B2;-arrestin2 nuclear translocation, that underlies the peripheral opioid control of inflammatory pain. Our data single out TRPV1 channels as modulators of opioid analgesia.</p>

<sec>
<p>Pain modulation and inflammation are two integrated biological responses that function in cooperation following injury. Particularly known for their analgesic properties, opioids target receptors expressed throughout the afferent pain pathway, including central and peripheral nerve terminals of primary afferent neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Indeed, local endogenously produced opioids, &#x03B2;-endorphin, enkephalins, and dynorphins exert efficient inhibitory control of pain at both spinal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and peripheral sites following inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. At inflammatory sites, immune-derived opioids are released to counteract pain effectively and facilitate healing. Moreover, alteration in the endogenous opioid system in the spinal cord was recently proposed to prevent the transition from acute inflammatory to chronic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, particularly through tonic &#x03BC;-opioid receptor (MOR) activity that suppresses hyperalgesia following resolution of inflammation. Thus, both endogenous and xenobiotic opioids are most effective immediately after tissue injury, suggesting that the early phases of inflammation primes opioid receptor signaling in primary afferent neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Alterations in this priming might contribute to a decrease in the therapeutic window of opioids, requiring increased analgesic doses that can lead to side effects.</p><p>At sites of acute local inflammation in humans or mice, the analgesic effect of opioids is enhanced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, whereas in contrast, the application of opioids to a human peripheral nerve plexus does not elicit analgesia in non-inflamed tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. At these sites, TRPV1 is the main endpoint target of inflammatory mediators, including reactive-oxygen species, metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids, inflammatory acidosis or toxins released by pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, both the activity and trafficking of the channel are sensitized by GPCR-targeted mediators (BK, PGE2, proteases)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, which in turn causes hyperalgesia during tissue inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and in many immune-associated diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Along these lines, recent findings suggest that MORs expressed in TRPV1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> nociceptors are essential contributors to analgesic tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological regulations remain unknown. We set out to test whether the TRPV1 channel, a central integrator of inflammatory signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, could prime opioid receptor signaling or modulate opioid analgesia during inflammation. Here, using the complete Freund&#x2019;s adjuvant (CFA) inflammatory pain model, we show that TRPV1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice exhibit alterations in both endogenous and exogenous opioid analgesia. We reveal further that, upon TRPV1 activation, &#x03B2;-arrestin2, a critical regulator of opioid signaling, is routed to the nucleus through a calcium-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. As a result of this exclusion of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 from the cytosol, activated MORs are unable to recruit &#x03B2;-arrestin2 and internalize during agonist-induced desensitization. This reduced MOR desensitization has major implications for opioid-induced analgesia and &#x03B2;-arrestin2 biased signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Overall, our data uncover a mechanism by which inflammation-mediated activation of TRPV1 channels minimizes opioid receptor opioid receptor desensitization to optimize analgesia. This TRPV1-opioid receptor interaction could be pharmacologically targeted in clinical settings to improve pain management by opioids.</p>

<title>TRPV1 regulates endogenous opioid-mediated analgesia during inflammation</title>
<p>To determine the molecular link between inflammation and opioid analgesia we asked if, as a central integrator of inflammatory signals, TRPV1 channel could modulate intrinsic opioid receptor function during peripheral inflammation. Therefore, we assessed inflammation-induced endogenous opioid antinociception in TRPV1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice. TRPV1 is likely the best characterized sensory transducer that contributes to thermal hyperalgesia in acute models of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, although the channel is expressed in polymodal C fibers that process both thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia during long-lasting inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Using the CFA model of chronic inflammatory pain, we evaluated peripheral immune-derived endogenous opioid analgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> by measuring paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) during the later phase of inflammation. In WT animals, PWT was decreased by 50&#x0025; at day 4 after intraplantar injection of CFA, and animals started to recover at day 6. Treatment with naloxone-methiodide (Nal-M), a peripherally restricted non-selective and competitive opioid receptor antagonist, delayed the recovery time as attested by the increased PWT from day 6 to day 10 in both male (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref></bold>) and female mice (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1a and b)</bold>. In TRPV1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, we found that PWT was decreased by 40&#x0025; at day 4, and then recovered gradually until day 14. Strikingly, treatment with Nal-M in both TRPV1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> male (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref></bold>) and female mice (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1a and b</bold>), had no effect on PWT at any time of the treatment. This absence of endogenous opioid analgesia in TRPV1-/- mice was due neither to a difference in inflammation (edema was similar between WT and KO mice), nor the capacity of pain-modulating immune cells to produce endogenous opioids and infiltrate the inflamed paw at day 8 of CFA (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2a-c</bold>). Thus, as previously reported, local opioid signaling is fine-tuned by inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and our results indicate that TRPV1 is a central contributor to this process.</p>

<title>TRPV1 activation disrupts MOR-&#x03B2;-arrestin2 interaction</title>
<p>To delineate how opioid modulation is impaired in TRPV1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, we focused on &#x03B2;-arrestin2, a central hub signaling protein that modulates both opioid receptor desensitization and recycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. A crosstalk between &#x03B2;-arrestin2 and the TRPV1 channel has recently emerged, particularly in the context of opioid receptor sequestration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. To determine whether activation of TRPV1 redirects &#x03B2;-arrestin2 away from the agonist-bound MOR, we tested the effect of capsaicin using a BRET assay that monitored interaction between MOR-Rluc8 and &#x03B2;-arrestin2-Venus. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>, DAMGO-mediated activation of MOR induces the recruitment of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to MOR, indicated by the increase in BRET signals over time. In the absence of TRPV1, treatment with capsaicin does not induce a BRET response or affect the DAMGO-induced recruitment of &#x03B2;-arrestin-2 to MOR. However, in TRPV1 expressing cells, capsaicin co-treatment along with DAMGO completely blocks the interaction between MOR and &#x03B2;-arrestin2 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">c</xref></bold>), at low and even saturating concentrations of DAMGO (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>), while capsaicin alone had no effect. Use of the reversed pair of BRET biosensors (&#x03B2;ARR2-Rluc &#x002B; MOR-YFP) yielded to similar results (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3</bold>), thus confirming the inhibitory effect of TRPV1 activation on MOR/&#x03B2;-arrestin2 interaction. Interestingly, As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>, co-immunoprecipitation of MOR with TRPV1 indicates the formation of a receptor-channel signaling complex at steady state (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>), and the saturating BRET signals obtained for MOR and TRPV1 co-expression suggests a direct interaction between MOR and TRPV1 in HEK cells, with or without DAMGO (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref></bold>). Therefore, our findings suggest that proximity of the TRPV1 channel to MOR, may alter the &#x03B2;-arrestin2-biased agonism of MOR by redirecting &#x03B2;-arrestin2 or preventing its recruitment to the receptor. Interestingly, we also found that this mechanism applies to other neuronal GPCRs, as the Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), which like the MOR is involved in inflammatory pain, showed impaired &#x03B2;-arrestin2 recruitment following capsaicin co-treatment. Given that &#x03B2;-arrestin2 is an essential modulator of MOR desensitization and recycling, we next tested the functional outcome of TRPV1 activation on receptor internalization. Using confocal microscopy we found that, as extensively reported, exposure to DAMGO for 20 min promoted significant MOR internalization in HEK cells transfected with MOR-YFP and TRPV1-mCherry. In contrast, cells co-stimulated with DAMGO and capsaicin (or RTX, not shown), had significantly less internalized receptor <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">b</xref></bold>). Importantly, deletion of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 using a CRISPR &#x03B2;-arrestin2 knockout cell line <bold>(Supplementary Fig. 4</bold>), eliminated DAMGO-evoked internalization, and thus mimicked the DAMGO&#x002B;capsaicin condition in &#x03B2;-arrestin2 WT cells. <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">d</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>TRPV1 activation induces both &#x03B2;-arrestin2 nuclear localization and ERK activation</title>
<p>As Por et al. reported that &#x03B2;-arrestin2 could interact with TRPV1 upon channel stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, we asked whether channel activation could, through competitive interaction, prevent the recruitment of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to MOR. Using our BRET assay, we found no evidence for an interaction between &#x03B2;arr2-YFP and TRPV1-Rluc (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">b</xref></bold>) either at steady state, or upon channel activation by the potent TRPV1 ligand RTX. In contrast, BRET signals indicate a strong interaction between the Rluc-TRPV1 and YFP-TRPV1, confirming the functional assembly of tagged-subunits into oligomeric channels. As &#x03B2;-arrestin-2 does not interact with either MOR or TRPV1 upon capsaicin exposure, we examined the fate of &#x03B2;-arrestin2-YFP using spinning disk confocal microscopy on TRPV1 transfected cells. We made the striking observation that channel activation promotes a rapid translocation of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to the nucleus (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>). Quantification of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 nuclear localization indicates that &#x003E;70&#x0025; of TRPV1mCherry-expressing cells display nuclear translocation of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 at 15 min. after RTX application (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref></bold>). This effect was slowly reversed upon RTX wash out and did not occur in absence of the channel (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 5a and b</bold>). Nuclear Hoechst blue staining confirmed the sequestration of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 into the nucleus after RTX challenge (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref></bold>), an effect that could also be observed with capsaicin, using confocal imaging (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref></bold>), or assessed by bystander BRET with the renilla GFP fused to the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) PKKKRKVEDPKS targeting the nucleus (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref></bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In contrast, activation of TRPA1, another calcium-permeant member of the TRP channel family, did not trigger &#x03B2;-arrestin2 translocation <bold>(Supplementary Fig. 5c</bold>). As for the activation of TRPA1, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations using the ionophore, ionomycin, also failed to stimulate the nuclear translocation of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 (not shown). Importantly, immunostaining of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 in TRPV1-expressing neurons identified using a TRPV1-YFP reporter mouse indicated similar results (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref></bold>). Thus, activation of TRPV1 rapidly relocates &#x03B2;-arrestin2 into the nucleus both in expression systems and in native sensory neurons. As a consequence, &#x03B2;-arrestin2 that normally colocalizes with internalizing MOR-containing vesicles, is now sequestered within the nucleus upon channel stimulation. This sequestration prevents agonist-induced internalization of the MOR <bold>(Supplementary Fig. 6</bold>).</p>

<p>As arrestins are important scaffolds for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, we tested the effect of TRPV1 stimulation on extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2). In TRPV1 transfected cells, RTX induces a transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at 5 min. post-stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref></bold>). ERK1/2 activation is blocked by chelating extracellular calcium with EGTA (10 mM) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref></bold>), as is the &#x03B2;-arrestin2 nuclear translocation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref></bold>), confirming that calcium influx through activated TRPV1 channels mediates both ERK1/2 activation and &#x03B2;-arrestin2 translocation. Several kinases have been implicated upstream of ERK1/2 activation, including Src and different isoforms of PKC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. We found that pharmacological inhibition of PKC&#x03B2;II by CGP53353 blocks ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas selective inhibition of the &#x03B1; or &#x03B2;I isoforms with the GF109203X compound did not (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 e</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">f</xref></bold>). Accordingly, TRPV1 activation by RTX directly activates PKC&#x03B2;II (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref></bold>). Finally, to confirm that &#x03B2;-arrestin2 was a central chaperone in the ERK signaling cascade engaged by TRPV1 stimulation, we tested the effect of knocking out &#x03B2;-arrestin2 in capsaicin-stimulated TRPV1 cells. Western blot analysis indicated an absence of ERK1/2 activation at 5 min. of TRPV1 stimulation on cells treated with &#x03B2;-arrestin2 but not scrambled siRNA (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref></bold>). Altogether, these findings indicate that activation of the TRPV1 channel engages a signaling cascade involving both a Ca2<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and PKC&#x03B2;II-dependent ERK1/2 activation, which coincides with the translocation of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 into the nucleus.</p>

<title>TRPV1 activation prevents MOR desensitization</title>
<p>To assess the functional consequence of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 nuclear translocation on MOR function and desensitization, we measured N-type (Cav2.2) voltage-gated calcium channel inhibition, as a surrogate of MOR-induced G protein coupling, following prolonged exposure to agonist. In control conditions, activation of MOR by DAMGO (1 &#x00B5;M) induces a rapid and robust inhibition of Cav2.2 N-type current in both transiently transfected HEK cells (47.23 &#x00B1; 5.21 &#x0025;, n=15) and native DRG neurons (55.57 &#x00B1; 4.38 &#x0025;, n=8) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). In contrast, absence of MOR or activation of TRPV1 alone does not promote calcium current inhibition (<bold>Supplementary <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref></bold>), confirming that agonist-bound receptors mediate the current inhibition. Following DAMGO pre-incubation for an hour, desensitized MOR does not modulate Cav2.2 currents, in both HEK (4.86 &#x00B1; 2.83 &#x0025; (n=9) and neurons (5.72 &#x00B1; 2.42 &#x0025; (n=7)) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>), an effect relieved by a 60 min. wash out allowing recycling of internalized MOR (<bold>Supplementary <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref></bold>).

<p>To determine whether TRPV1 contributes to the increased efficacy of exogenous opioids in inflammatory conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, we used an <italic>in vivo</italic> protocol of acute opioid receptor desensitization in which mice were treated with 10mg/kg of morphine i.p. twice daily for three days. This protocol causes a decrease in morphine efficiency measured with the tail flick latency test over the three day course of treatment in WT non-inflamed mice (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7 a</xref>, blue bar graphs</bold>), and TRPV1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> non inflamed mice (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7 b</xref>, blue bar graphs</bold>). We then assessed analgesia in morphine-desensitized WT and TRPV1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice subjected to CFA injection. Under these conditions, morphine analgesia was maintained in WT mice even after 3 days of repetitive morphine treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7 a</xref>, red bar graphs</bold>). This effect was dependent on the presence of TRPV1, as TRPV1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice show a decreased morphine analgesia in inflammatory conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7 b</xref>, red bar graphs</bold>). These results suggested that TRPV1 is responsible for maintaining opioid receptor signaling efficacy in inflammatory conditions. To address whether this facilitatory process occurs centrally or at the periphery, we assessed the dose-response of morphine analgesia after intrathecal or local injection, in CFA-inflamed mice, treated or not with morphine for three days <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>)</bold>. Specifically, we compared morphine antinociceptive response in mice that were never exposed to morphine with mice that received 3 days of morphine injections. To determine morphine potency (ED50), these mice were given escalating doses of morphine via intrathecal (central) or local (peripheral) injection into the inflamed paw (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref></bold>). When administered intrathecally in morphine-na&#x00EF;ve mice, morphine dose-dependently attenuated CFA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity: the ED50 was comparable in WT and TRPV1-/- mice, suggesting that TRPV1 did not alter morphine antinociceptive potency in mice without previous exposure to morphine (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">c</xref></bold>). In other words, acute morphine antinociception is not impacted by the absence of TRPV1. By contrast, following repeated morphine treatment, there was a notable reduction in morphine anti-nociceptive potency (i.e. increased ED50) <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">c</xref>)</bold>, suggesting decreased capacity of MOR to respond to morphine. When administered locally in the inflamed paw of saline treated CFA-inflamed mice, morphine dose-dependently reduced mechanical hypersensitivity <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d</xref>)</bold>, thus confirming previous work that peripheral opioid receptors mitigate inflammatory pain under basal conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.

This result indicates that local inflammation prevents peripheral MOR desensitization upon chronic morphine treatment. Strikingly, this effect is dependent on the presence of TRPV1, as TRPV1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice exhibit a decrease in peripheral morphine potency (&#x003E; ED50) as observed for centrally administered morphine <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8d</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">e</xref>)</bold>.

<p>Overall, our results suggest a model wherein activation of TRPV1 during an inflammatory insult translocates &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to the nucleus, which in turn prevents opioid-induced recruitment of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to MOR and ensuing receptor desensitization, thus increasing opioid potency at peripheral nociceptors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While opioids have been the gold standard of pain relief for decades, the current opioid crisis points to a lack of understanding of opioid receptor regulation in pathological conditions, particularly in the setting of peripheral inflammation. Earlier studies have proposed a positive modulation of opioid analgesia in inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> whereas maladaptive processes occurring during resolution, combined with genetic and emotional predisposition, precipitate the transition to opioid insensitive chronic pain. Our findings shed light on the functional interplay between inflammation and opioid analgesia, along with the mechanisms that lead to acute and/or persistent receptor desensitization.</p>
<p>The main finding of our work is that activation of TRPV1 channels acutely results in the trafficking of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 from the cytosol to the nucleus. This channel-induced translocation attenuates the ability of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to mediate MOR desensitization, thereby maintaining the sensitivity of MOR expressing nociceptors to the action of endogenously produced or exogenously administered opioids. Importantly, this mechanism of receptor regulation might be shared among other nociceptor-expressed GPCRs, like PAR2, localized in TRPV1-enriched membrane microdomains.</p>
<p>Of relevance to our new observations, a number of studies have highlighted TRPV1 as a key effector of MOR, supported by the fact that both are expressed in small unmyelinated DRG neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, on one hand, acute morphine administration can decrease capsaicin-induced TRPV1 current<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and reduce insertion of functional TRPV1 channels at the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and, on the other hand, sustained morphine treatment may cause tolerance through the regulation of TRPV1 channel expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Here, our work reveals a reciprocal regulation of MOR by the TRPV1 channel and identifies the molecular underpinnings of this process involving the TRPV1-triggered translocation of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to the nucleus. We found that TRPV1-/- mice are insensitive to endogenous opioid analgesia during resolution of inflammation. We then show that TRPV1 channel signaling overrides desensitization and maintains peripheral opioid receptor function, when using an <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> opioid receptor desensitization paradigm.</p>
<p>Agonists of the TRPV1 channel, including capsaicin containing cream have been extensively used as local analgesics. While Ca2<sup>&#x002B;</sup> dependent TRPV1 channel desensitization, inhibition of ion channels and nerve degeneration have been suggested to contribute to the analgesic effects of capsaicin, these mechanisms remain poorly defined, are reversible, and thus do not explain the long lasting pain relieving effects of capsaicin that last for weeks after treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Previous work from Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> determined that RTX-induced ablation of TRPV1-expressing afferent neurons prolonged opioid analgesia despite a reduction in MOR expression. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that even when keeping the integrity of the neurons, TRPV1 channel activity regulates &#x03B2;-arrestin2 mobilization to fine-tune opioid receptor function when it&#x2019;s most needed. Additional work has described a direct inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels by capsaicin in DRG neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> which could contribute to decrease excitatory neurotransmission in the afferent pain pathway. We did not observe such effect in our hands when preincubating HEK cells or DRG neurons with DAMGO&#x002B;capsaicin before wash out and recording N-type current inhibition. Furthermore, our BRET analysis suggests a shift in MOR signaling likely caused by an absence of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 interaction upon channel activation. Our electrophysiology data indeed indicate that G&#x03B2;&#x0263; modulation of N-type is restored by TRPV1 activation, yet a direct assessment of Gi/o coupling to MOR will ascertain that G protein biased signaling is favored upon TRPV1 channel stimulation. The main target of opioids used in the treatment of acute and chronic pain is represented by MOR and their effect is mediated partly by inhibition of high voltage gated N-type channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Sustained agonist activation of MOR, however, produces cellular opioid tolerance shown to be caused by &#x03B2;-arrestin2&#x2013;dependent internalization of MOR which are trafficked to the endosomal compartments (for a review see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>). It is well established that receptor desensitization and internalization are two processes that participate, among other mechanisms (resensitization, downregulation or de novo receptor synthesis) to opioid tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Therefore, further work will test this TRPV1-MOR paradigm in mouse models of opioid tolerance.</p>
<p>Finally our findings that &#x03B2;-arrestin2 translocates to the nucleus following channel activation will raise some new lines of research on the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of pain modulation by this TRPV1-&#x03B2;-arrestin2 pathway. In contrast to previous studies showing physical association of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 with TRPV1, we could not find evidence of direct interaction between TRPV1 and &#x03B2;-arrestin2 using a BRET assay, or co-immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown), and observation by confocal microscopy denotes distinct subcellular localization of the two proteins. Known as a central chaperone implicated in receptor signaling and trafficking, &#x03B2;-arrestin2 was already reported to shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic compartment, yet the presence of a NES in the 390&#x2013;400 residues of the C-terminal domain excludes &#x03B2;-arrestin2 from the nucleus. Mutations of this motif or pharmacological inhibition of nuclear export were shown to promote translocation of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 into the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Several potential roles of &#x03B2;-arrestin in the nucleus have been proposed, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair or Histone acetylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. The rapid and reversible trafficking of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to the nucleus does not argue for apoptotic pathways to be engaged by the channel. However, we believe that transcriptional regulation mediated by TRPV1-&#x03B2;-arrestin2 signaling could contribute to the analgesic effect of topical capsaicin formulations used for pain management. Future proteomic and transcriptional studies may advance our knowledge of the factors interacting with &#x03B2;-arrestin2 as well as the genes regulated by TRPV1 signaling. It is likely that &#x03B2;-arrestin2 has an important function in the plasticity of nociceptive circuits post-inflammation.</p>
<p>Our new data emphasize information that appeared upon completion of our study, showing that TRPV1 activation blocks the opioid-dependent phosphorylation of the MOR by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Thus, not only would TRPV1 activation attenuate the GRK-mediated recruitment of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to trigger MOR internalization-desensitization, but the TRPV1-mediated translocation of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 out of the cytosol would also diminish its impact on MOR and likely other GPCRs present in nociceptors. Taken together, our work, along with the data of Scherer and coworkers, support a new concept that TRPV1 can bias MOR signaling via a dual mechanism involving the inhibition of receptor phosphorylation and the shuttling of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 to the nucleus.</p>
<p>Of note, we found that, although preventing calcium influx via TRPV1 blocks &#x03B2;-arrestin2 translocation, raising intracellular calcium by activating the calcium-permeant TRPA1 channel, or by using the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, did not stimulate the nuclear trafficking of &#x03B2;-arrestin2. Therefore, the dynamics of these events will have to be investigated further to understand the spatial and temporal requirements for the calcium signaling to trigger &#x03B2;-arrestin2 translocation, and to determine if there is co-trafficking of other signaling constituents (e.g. GRK5) along with &#x03B2;-arrestin2. To sum up, the rapid dual effect of TRPV1 activation to block GRK5 phosphorylation and to stimulate &#x03B2;-arrestin2 translocation can work together to leave the MOR in a sensitized state.</p>
<p>Overall, our work has unraveled a TRPV1-MOR interplay that governs opioid analgesia during inflammation. These results establish a novel framework for understanding the regulation of opioid receptor function in response to inflammation and the maladaptive processes that could lead to pathological pain during tissue healing. While clinical observations suggest that opioids are effective analgesics following acute injury, prolonged treatment for chronic pain conditions is often accompanied by side effects that may relate to MOR desensitization and the subsequent requirement of higher opioid doses to achieve the same analgesic effect. Our proposed model points to the TRPV1 as a molecular target, which could tailor strategies to enhance opioid efficacy early on while reducing tolerance. Therefore, if used in conjunction, TRPV1 agonists could improve the management of chronic and severe morphine resistant pain by high jacking endogenous mechanisms of receptor desensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, potentiating opioid analgesia and thus limiting dose escalation.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>Six-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). TRPV1-/- mice (strain B6.129X1-Trpv1tm1Jul/J) were originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at the University of Calgary Animal Resource Center (RJ. Thompson). All mice were genotyped with the following primers: WT: cctgctcaacatgctcattg (984 bp); heterozygotes: tcctcatgcacttcaggaaa (450 and 984 bp); TRPV1-/-: tggatgtggaatgtgtgcgag (450 bp) (Jackson Laboratories). Transgenic Ai32/TRPV1-cre mice were bred in the University of Calgary Animal Resource Center (GW. Zamponi) by crossing mice homozygous for the Rosa-CAG-LSL-ChR2 (H134R)-EYFP-WPRE conditional allele (loxP-flanked STOP cassette) [strain B6;129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm32(CAG-COP4&#x002A;H134R/EYFP)Hze/J; hereafter Ai32] with mice expressing cre recombinase in TRPV1 cells [strain B6.129-Trpv1tm1(cre)Bbm/J; hereafter TRPV1-cre] (both from Jackson Laboratories). All mice were housed under standard conditions with drinking water and food available ad libitum. All experiments were conducted on age-matched animals, under protocols approved by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee and in accordance with the international guidelines for the ethical use of animals in research and guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.</p>

<title>CFA model of inflammatory pain</title>
<p>6-week old C57BL/6 male mice were obtained from Jackson lab and were acclimated to the dynamic plantar aesthesiometer testing chamber for 2 days prior to starting the experiments. Mice were housed with free access to food and water, with a 12/12 light dark cycle. All experiments were conducted on age-matched animals, under protocols approved by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee and in accordance with the international guidelines for the ethical use of animals in research and guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.</p>
<p>CFA was administered by intraplantar injection. All animals received 20 &#x00B5;L of CFA (1mg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), or 20 &#x03BC;L of saline as control, in the right paw. The animals were assessed daily on days 4-14 after CFA injections. Prior to nociception testing, mice were habituated to the behavior room for 1 hour. Mechanical threshold was assessed daily using the dynamic plantar test. Thermal sensitivity was measured using paw withdrawal latency to a radiant heat (Hargreaves apparatus from Ugo Basile). Briefly, mice on glass plates were subjected to targeted infrared heat under the ipsilateral or contralateral paw and the paw withdrawal latency was determined by motion-sensing software. Each time point was done in triplicate. Data are presented as mean values for each group &#x00B1; SEM. Paw edema was measured throughout the experiment with a plethysmometer (Hugo Basile)</p>

<p>At day 0, mice were injected with CFA, or 20 &#x03BC;L of saline as control, in the morning. Morphine (10mg/kg, PCCA, London, ON) or saline (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) as control was injected intraperitoneally one hour after CFA, and then again in the afternoon. Twice daily morphine injections were repeated for two more consecutive days (day 1 and day 2). Tail flick latency to 46&#x00B0;C water bath was recorded before the CFA injection and on each day before and 30 minutes after the second injection of morphine. On day 3, mechanical nociceptive threshold were determined by the simplified up and down method using Von Frey filament in mice receiving increasing doses of Morphine injected either intrathecally (IT, 0;1;2,5;5;10;15 &#x00B5;g dose) or locally (in the ankle, 0;2,5;5;10;25;30;40 &#x00B5;g dose) in the inflamed paw.</p>

<p><bold>Supplementary Fig. 1. Peripheral endogenous control of inflammatory pain is also absent in female TRPV1 deficient mice.</bold></p>
<p>(a) CFA (30&#x03BC;l; 1mg/ml) was injected into the plantar surface of the right hind paw of WT (left graph) or TRPV1 -/- mice (right graph). Mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed by measuring paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) using a dynamic plantar aesthesiometer. Mice were injected with either 10&#x00B5;l PBS (blue circle; n=6 for WT for and n=4 for TRPV1-/-) or Nal-M (2mg/ml, red square; n=6 for WT and n=4 for TRPV1-/-) in the ankle from day 4 to day 14, 30 minutes before mechanical pain assessment. Data are expressed as the mean &#x00B1;SEM of PWT measured in the inflamed (CFA) ipsilateral paw (color) and contralateral saline-injected paw (grey) normalized to baseline. (&#x002A; p &#x003C; 0.05; two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test). Area under the curve between day 6 and 10 were calculated and expressed as &#x0025; of vehicle-treated animals for each genotype. Data are expressed as the mean min-max (&#x002A; p &#x003C; 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test) (b)</p>

<p><bold>Supplementary Fig 4. Generation of &#x03B2;-arrestin2 KO HEK cell line</bold></p>
<p>HEK cells were transfected with gRNA sequences cloned in the lentiCRISPR V2 vector, alone and together. &#x03B2;-arrestin2 deletion was assessed by western blot on whole cell lysate. GAPDH was used as loading control. Subsequent experiments were performed with the cells containing both gRNAs as the deletion was more complete.</p>
<p><bold>Supplementary Fig. 5. &#x03B2;-arrestin2 nuclear translocation is transient and induced by the specific activation of TRPV1 channel but not TRPA1</bold></p>
<p>(a) Nuclear localization of &#x03B2;-arrestin-2 following stimulation of TRPV1. HEK cells cotransfected with TRPV1 and &#x03B2;-arrestin-2-YFP were stimulated with 1&#x00B5;M capsaicin for 15 min, washed and fixed at the indicated time points. Percentage of cells in which &#x03B2;-arrestin2 was predominantly localized to the nucleus was quantified in each condition. Nuclear &#x03B2;-arrestin-2 in stimulated cells was significantly higher than that of unstimulated cells at the 15 and 30 min. timepoints (unstimulated, 2.7&#x0025; &#x00B1; 1.9; 15 mins, 48.8&#x0025; &#x00B1; 10.0, q=5.704; 30 mins, 33.4&#x0025; &#x00B1; 4.5, q=3.803, p&#x003C;0.05, one-way ANOVA). b) Representative confocal image of HEK transfected with &#x03B2;-arrestin-2-YFP only and treated with RTX.
