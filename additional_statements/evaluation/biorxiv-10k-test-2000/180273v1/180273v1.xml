<abstract>
<p>We introduce cytoNet, a method to characterize multicellular topology from microscopy images. Accessible over the web, cytoNet quantifies the spatial relationships in cell communities using principles of graph theory, and evaluates the effect of cell-cell interactions on individual cell phenotypes. We demonstrate cytoNet&#x2019;s capabilities in two applications relevant to regenerative medicine: quantifying the morphological response of endothelial cells to neurotrophic factors present in the brain after injury, and characterizing cell cycle dynamics of differentiating neural progenitor cells. The framework introduced here can be used to study complex cell communities in a quantitative manner, leading to a deeper understanding of environmental effects on cellular behavior.</p>

<sec id="s1">
<p>A cell&#x2019;s place in its environment influences a large part of its behavior. Advances in the field of phenotypic screening have yielded automated image analysis software that provide detailed phenotypic information at the single-cell level (such as morphology, stain texture and stain intensity) from microscopy images in a high-throughput manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, current image analysis pipelines often do not account for spatial and density-dependent effects on cell phenotype. Various types of cell-cell interactions including juxtacrine and paracrine signaling are an integral part of biological processes that affect the behavior of individual cells. The recent emergence of technologies for multiparametric mapping of protein and RNA expression in individual cells while preserving the spatial structure of the tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> has further highlighted the need to study single-cell behavior in the context of cell communities.</p>
<p>For these reasons, a robust method to quantify the spatial organization of cell communities and its influence on the behavior of individual cells adds an important, missing component to currently existing image analysis tools. Such a method can be used to enhance image-based biological discovery through phenotypic screens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> by supplying multicellular metrics, provide a non-invasive means to standardize cell manufacturing for therapeutic purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and develop a quantitative framework for the analysis of spatially-detailed human cell atlas data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Prior reports have accounted for population context in image-based screens by using features such as local cell density or a cell&#x2019;s position on an islet edge, that describe local cell crowding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Mathematical graphs, structures that are used to model pairwise relationships between objects, are uniquely suited to cell community analysis. Among image-based methods that employ graph theory to analyze spatial relationships among cells, the cell-graph technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> has been employed to great effect in analyzing structure-function relationships in tissue sections. However, coupling single cell data to network structure has been elusive: there remains a need for a broadly applicable, user-friendly tool that enables spatial analysis of various different cell types, integrated with metrics describing the phenotype of individual cells.</p>
<p>Here we introduce an image analysis method called cytoNet for quantification of multicellular spatial organization using a graph theoretic approach. cytoNet is available as a web-based interface, providing significant ease of use compared with other programs that require downloading software. Taking fluorescence microscope images as input, the cytoNet image analysis pipeline identifies cells, creates spatial network representations tailored to the type of image and cell type, and calculates a set of metrics derived from graph theory that describe the network structure of the local multicellular neighborhood of a cell of interest. We define this multicellular neighborhood as a cell&#x2019;s community. Cell community metrics are then integrated with descriptors of cell phenotype, such as morphology and protein expression, to provide a comprehensive description of single- and multiple-cell phenotype states.</p>
<p>The cytoNet pipeline begins with microscope images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Appropriate segmentation algorithms are implemented to detect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">2</xref>). Upon detection of cells, the next step is to evaluate spatial proximity of cells. We do this in one of two ways &#x2013; by evaluating the overlap of adjacent cell boundaries (type I graphs), or by evaluating the proximity of cells in relation to a threshold distance (type II graphs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The former approach is useful when detailed information of cell boundaries and morphology is available, such as in the case of membrane stains or cells stained for certain cytoskeletal proteins. The latter approach is useful when dealing with images of cell nuclei, where detection of exact cell boundaries is not possible. In both approaches, cells deemed adjacent to each other are connected through edges, resulting in a network representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). This connectivity is denoted mathematically using an adjacency matrix, <italic>A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>), where <italic><bold>A</bold><sub>i,j</sub></italic> &#x003D; <bold>1</bold> if there exists an edge between cells <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, and <bold>0</bold> otherwise. Finally, the extracted metrics are used to visualize and analyze local neighborhood effects on individual cell phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>

<p>First, we demonstrate the utility of cytoNet in analyzing cell cycle dynamics in communities of differentiating neural progenitor cells. Neural progenitor cells are multipotent cells that can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Cell cycle regulation in neural progenitor cells is of interest as it has implications for the genetic basis of brain size in different species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and aberrant regulation can cause diseases like microcephaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Studies in the ventricular zone of the embryonic mouse neocortex have shown that clusters of clonally-related neural progenitor cells go through the cell cycle together<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, it is unclear whether this community effect is a ubiquitous feature of neural progenitor cells. To this end, we employed the cytoNet workflow to determine whether cell cycle synchronization is a feature of differentiating neural progenitor cells cultured in vitro.</p>
<p>For this investigation, ReNcell VM human neural progenitor cells were stably transfected with the FUCCI cell cycle reporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> to generate Geminin-Venus/Cdt1-mCherry/H2B-Cerulean (FUCCI-ReN) cells. We captured time-lapse movies of FUCCI-ReN cells after withdrawing growth factors to induce differentiation, and built network representations from nucleus images. Adjacency was determined by comparing centroid-centroid distance to a threshold (type II graphs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to evaluate spatiotemporal synchronization in cell cycle, for each individual cell in a frame, we evaluated the average fraction of neighboring cells in a similar phase of the cell cycle (G1 phase &#x2013; mCherry&#x002B; and S/G2/M phases &#x2013; Venus&#x002B;), normalized by total fraction of that cell type in the population. We called the average value of this fraction across all cells in an image the neighborhood similarity score, (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Results for medium and low-density cultures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref> respectively. Frames from corresponding time-lapse movies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref> (see also <bold>Supplementary Videos 1-4</bold>). We observed that groups of cells in the low-density culture moved through the cell cycle in unison, which was reflected in periodically high values of the neighborhood similarity score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Video 1-2</bold>). In contrast, the composition of cell clusters in the medium density culture was relatively heterogeneous, resulting in relatively low values of the neighborhood similarity score over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Video 3-4</bold>). Neighboring cells in very low-density cultures are likely to be derived from the same clonal lineage, which explains the high level of synchronization in these cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This example highlights how cytoNet can be used to derive insight into the role of cell-cell interactions on dynamic cell behavior.</p>

<p>Next, we used cytoNet to evaluate the relative influence of local neighborhood density and growth factor perturbations on endothelial cell morphology. From a regenerative medicine perspective, studying the morphological response of endothelial cells to neurotrophic stimuli can help assess the cells&#x2019; potential angiogenic response following brain injuries that induce growth factor secretion, like ischemic stroke or transient hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Common high-throughput angiogenic assays focus on migration and proliferation as the main cell processes defining angiogenesis, or the growth of new capillaries from existing ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Distinct morphology and cytoskeletal organization of endothelial cells indicate the cell&#x2019;s migratory or proliferative nature, and hence their angiogenic contribution within a sprouting capillary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Reproducibly quantifying the morphological response of endothelial cells to neurotrophic factors would enable more targeted approaches to enhancing brain angiogenesis.</p>
<p>We took an image-based approach to this problem, building a library of immunofluorescence images of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stained for cytoskeletal structural proteins (actin, <italic>&#x03B1;</italic>-tubulin) and nuclei, in response to various combinations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) treatment. Cell morphology was annotated using 21 metrics described in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), which included cell shape metrics like circularity and elongation, and texture metrics for cytoskeletal stains such as Actin polarity, smoothness etc. Cluster analysis on this dataset revealed dominant morphological phenotypes as a function of treatment conditions (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3</bold>).</p>
<p>We then used the cytoNet workflow to quantify density-dependent effects on endothelial cell morphology in control cultures (without any growth factor perturbation). Network representations were designated based on shared cell pixels (type I graphs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and local network properties were described using seven metrics, including degree (number of neighbors) and centrality measures (indicating relative location of cells within colonies) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Our analysis showed correlations between cell morphological features and local network properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Some of these relationships were expected, for instance the positive correlation between shared cell border and cell size. Other relationships, such as the negative correlation between cell circularity and closeness centrality, capture intuitive notions of the influence of cell packing on morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d-f</xref>). The closeness centrality of a cell (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) describes its relative position in a colony &#x2013; cells in the middle of a colony will have higher centrality values than cells at the edge of a colony or isolated cells. The negative relationship between circularity and closeness centrality implies that isolated cells and cells located at the edge of colonies are more likely to have a circular morphology, while more densely packed cells tend to be less circular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e-f</xref>). Thus, our analysis revealed that local network properties have a quantifiable effect on cell morphology.</p>
<p>Next, we developed a workflow to analyze the effect of growth factor treatments on cell morphology, while correcting for the effect of local network properties. We applied a quantile multidimensional binning approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> to calculate the variance in morphology metrics that could be individually explained by all local network metrics and growth factor treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2g</xref>). We then calculated the values for each morphology metric after correcting for the effect of local network metrics (see <bold>Methods</bold>). The raw and network-corrected values for two metrics, cell size and mean actin intensity, are shown as box plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2h-i</xref>. The influence of network properties can be clearly seen on cell size, where at 6 hours, large cell sizes are seen in the uncorrected but not corrected plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2h</xref>). The effect of growth factor treatment can be clearly seen in network-corrected mean actin intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2i</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), where VEGF and BDNF treatment have dose-dependent effects on mean actin intensity. Thus, cytoNet detects the independent effects of local neighborhood properties and growth factor perturbations on endothelial cell morphology.</p>
<p>The examples described above illustrate how cytoNet can be used to enhance image informatics for phenotypic screens as well as basic discovery in biology. From the image informatics perspective, cytoNet adds crucial information on local cell density to the suite of metrics that are currently used to characterize individual cells. We illustrated how local network metrics can be used to infer independent effects of cell density and chemical perturbations. This workflow can be used to more comprehensively characterize the response of cells to chemical perturbations, which can aid in drug discovery.</p>
<p>The cytoNet workflow can also be used to quantitatively study biological pathways involved in cell-cell communication. The combination of visualizing dynamic cell behavior through time-lapse movies and quantifying local cell-cell interactions is particularly powerful. This paradigm can be of great benefit in stem cell biology to evaluate environmental effects on cell fate decisions. More broadly, the principle behind cytoNet &#x2013; treating cell communities as complex ecosystems &#x2013; will help transition from characterizing cells as independent &#x2018;silos&#x2019; to a more holistic approach, where due importance is given to the environment surrounding cells.</p>

<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, Lonza) were cultured in EBM-2 medium (Lonza) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (Fisher Scientific) and EGM-2 SingleQuot bullet kit (Lonza). For imaging experiments, cells were cultured for different periods (6, 12 or 24 hours) in different combinations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, human recombinant; Millipore) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, human recombinant, Sigma-Aldrich). Concentrations used were in the range 50-100ng/mL. Controls were the same culture period without growth factor treatments.</p>
<p>Immortalized human neural progenitor cells derived from the ventral midbrain (ReNCell VM) were obtained from Millipore. Cells were expanded on laminin-coated tissue culture flasks, in media containing DMEM/F12 supplemented with B27 (both Life Technologies), 2&#x00B5;g/ml Heparin (STEMCELL Technologies), 20ng/ml bFGF (Millipore), 20ng/ml EGF (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin. For differentiation experiments, cells were cultured in medium lacking bFGF and EGF.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>FUCCI Reporter Lines</title>
<p>Stable reporter cell lines (FUCCI-ReN) were generated by sequentially nucleofecting ReNcell VM neural progenitor cells with an ePiggyBac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> construct encoding mCherry-Cdt, Venus-Geminin, or Cerulean-H2B. Each construct introduced to the cells was driven by a CAG promoter containing a blasticidin (ePB-B-CAG-mCherry-Cdt1), puromycin (ePB-P-Venus-Geminin), or neomycin (ePB-N-Cerulean-H2B) resistance gene. Following each round of nucleofection, cells were cultured in the presence of appropriate antibiotics (2 &#x00B5;g/ml blasticidin, 0.1 &#x00B5;g/ml puromycin and 100 &#x00B5;g/ml neomycin).</p>

<title>HUVEC Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>For imaging experiments, HUVECs were cultured on glass dishes coated with fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich). After appropriate growth factor treatments, cultures were fixed with 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde, free aldehyde groups were quenched using 1mg/mL sodium borohydride, and membranes were permeabilized with 0.2&#x0025; Triton-X-100 solution in PBS. Actin fibers were visualized using an Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin antibody (1:40, Molecular Probes) and microtubules were visualized using a mouse monoclonal anti-a-Tubulin antibody (1:250, Sigma-Aldrich) followed by a goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained using Hoescht (Molecular Probes). 16-bit composite immunofluorescence images were acquired through a 20X objective (N.A. = 0.75) on a Nikon Ti-E epifluorescence microscope. Physical pixel size was 0.32&#x00B5;m.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Time-lapse Microscopy</title>
<p>FUCCI-ReN cells were plated at different densities on chambered cover glasses (Fisher Scientific) coated with laminin. Cells were imaged after switching to differentiation medium containing phenol red-free DMEM/F12. Time-lapse imaging was performed using a Nikon Ti-E microscope equipped with a motorized stage, a cage incubator for environmental control (Okolab), a 20X objective lens (N.A. = 0.75), SOLA SE Light Engine for LED-based fluorescence excitation (Lumencor), appropriate filters for visualizing mCherry, Venus and Cerulean fluorescent proteins and a Zyla 5.5 sCMOS camera (ANDOR). 16-bit composite fluorescence images were acquired at 10 minute intervals for a total duration of 57.5 hours.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Image Processing of HUVEC Immunofluorescence Images</title>
<p>Fluorescence images were processed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Briefly, the following steps were used.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Contrast was enhanced using histogram equalization.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Images were smoothed using a 2D Gaussian lowpass filter.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Initial binarization was performed using Otsu&#x2019;s method.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The binary image was dilated to fill in individual cell areas.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All objects &#x003C;1&#x0025; of the total image area were removed. This was called the final binary image.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A binary representation of the nuclear and microtubule image layers was generated using a high input threshold value. This was called the marker image.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Another binary image was created with values of 0 where either the final binary image (step 5) or the marker image (step 6) had a value of 1.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Watershed markers were generated by imposing the minimum of the complement of images obtained in steps 2 and 7. This image had black markers contained within cells to serve as basins for flooding, while cell areas themselves were represented by lighter pixels that served as the rising contours of the basins.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The watershed algorithm was implemented using Matlab&#x2019;s built-in function to generate cell boundaries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Masks generated in step 9 were refined by using composite images of microtubules and actin as the marker image (step 6).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In order to automate the threshold generation, the area of cell masks obtained from segmentation were compared to those obtained through thresholding with a high threshold. The entire process was then iterated until an acceptable area ratio was achieved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Image Processing of FUCCI-ReN Time-Lapse Images</title>
<p>Grayscale images for each channel (H2B-Cerulean, Geminin-Venus and Cdt1-mCherry) were binarized using locally adaptive thresholding. Seeds for the watershed transform were generated using the regional minimas from the distance transform of the grayscale images. Next, the watershed algorithm was applied to detect boundaries between overlapping cell nuclei. Finally, information from different channels were used to correct undersegmented nuclei.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Generation of Network Representation</title>
<p>Type I graphs were generated as follows. Mask boundaries were expanded by 2 pixels and overlap of expanded masks was used to assign edges and build an adjacency matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Cells touching the image border were included in calculations of local network properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) for cells not touching the boundary, but were excluded for the construction of the adjacency matrix.</p>
<p>Type II graphs were generated as follows: For each pair of objects (nuclei), a threshold distance for proximity was defined as the average of the two object diameters, multiplied by a scaling factor (S). If the Euclidean distance between the object centroids was lower than the threshold distance computed, then the pair of objects was connected with an edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We chose a default scaling factor S = 2 for all our analysis, through visual inspection of cell adjacency.</p>

<sec id="s2i">
<title>Network Metric Computation</title>
<p>All the network metrics described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> were computed using custom-written code, building upon the routines provided in Bounova et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s2j">
<title>Correction of morphology metrics for effects of local network properties and treatment conditions</title>
<p>We performed quantile multidimensional binning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> of cells for all 7 network metrics (5 bins per metric). The mean of each morphology metric was calculated for each multidimensional bin, and this mean was subtracted from the raw measurements to generate the network-corrected measurements for each cell. Treatment-corrected measurements were generated similarly by calculating the mean of each morphology metric under each treatment condition and then subtracting it from the raw measurements.</p>

K-means clustering was performed across all cells for all conditions, with the optimal number of four clusters identified by Silhouette scores, using Euclidean distance as the similarity metric. Morphological features within each phenotype captured quantitatively what has been observed qualitatively during coordinated cell processes of angiogenesis. As an example, phenotype 4, a multi-nucleated cell showing nuclear asymmetry, indicates a proliferative state. Elongated cells with asymmetrical actin distribution and relatively large nuclei show both migratory and proliferative properties (e.g., phenotype 1) <bold>(b)</bold> Cluster membership of cells after stimulation by VEGF and BDNF for 6, 12 and 24 hrs is displayed, corresponding to clusters from (a). Cells in each condition change their cluster assignment over time as a function of stimuli. Shading indicates &#x0025; of cells in that cluster (darker = higher &#x0025;). <bold>(c)</bold> Example feature metrics of endothelial cell phenotypes resulting from BDNF and VEGF stimulation. Cell size, the minor axis length of the nucleus, and actin polarity were among features that contributed the most variance in the endothelial dataset. Each point in the plot represents metric values for the average cell for all time-points for each of the five growth factor conditions. Cell order (x-axis) is arbitrary, while relative values (y-axis) are normalized to the maximum value per metric across all cells.

Let <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub> be the area of two objects with centroids <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>c</italic><sub>2</sub> respectively. For each object, compute its effective radius: <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="180273_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. A graph edge is placed between two objects (vertices) whenever the distance between their centroids is within the adjusted sum of their effective radii: <italic>distance</italic>(<italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>c</italic><sub>2</sub>) &#x2264; <italic>S</italic> &#x00B7; (<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x002B; <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub>) where is the user defined adjacency threshold parameter.</p>

<p>Results are formatted as follows. Global metrics are tabulated in a file called &#x2018;GlobalMetrics.csv&#x2019; for all images in the input folder. Local metrics, computed on a per-cell basis are tabulated in a separate file for each image called &#x2018;LocalMetrics_filename.csv&#x2019;, where filename is the original file name. Also, basic morphology metrics (size, elongation, circularity and stain intensity) are tabulated in a separate file for each image called SingleCellMetrics_filename.csv, where filename is the original file name. Processed images are also created for each image in the input folder, called &#x2018;filename_processed.tif&#x2019; where the original image is overlaid with cell indices, object outlines (red) and spatial proximity edges (yellow). Cell indices displayed in the processed images are used in the first column of local metrics and single cell metric files.</p>
