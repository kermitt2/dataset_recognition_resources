<abstract>
<p>Human influenza virus rapidly accumulates mutations in its major surface protein hemagglutinin (HA). The evolutionary success of influenza virus lineages depends on how these mutations affect HA&#x2019;s functionality and antigenicity. Here we experimentally measure the effects on viral growth in cell culture of all single amino-acid mutations to the HA from a recent human H3N2 influenza virus strain. We show that mutations that are measured to be more favorable for viral growth are enriched in evolutionarily successful H3N2 viral lineages relative to mutations that are measured to be less favorable for viral growth. Therefore, despite the well-known caveats about cell-culture measurements of viral fitness, such measurements can still be informative for understanding evolution in nature. We also compare our measurements for H3 HA to similar data previously generated for a distantly related H1 HA, and find substantial differences in which amino acids are preferred at many sites. For instance, the H3 HA has less disparity in mutational tolerance between the head and stalk domains than the H1 HA. Overall, our work suggests that experimental measurements of mutational effects can be leveraged to help understand the evolutionary fates of viral lineages in nature &#x2014; but only when the measurements are made on a viral strain similar to the ones being studied in nature.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>A key goal in the study of influenza virus evolution is to forecast which viral strains will persist and which ones will die out. Here we experimentally measure the effects of all amino-acid mutations to the hemagglutinin protein from a human H3N2 influenza strain on viral growth in cell culture. We show that these measurements have utility for distinguishing among viral strains that do and do not succeed in nature. Overall, our work suggests that new high-throughput experimental approaches may be useful for understanding virus evolution in nature.</p>

<p>Seasonal H3N2 influenza virus evolves rapidly, fixing 3 to 4 amino-acid mutations per year in its hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Many of these mutations contribute to the rapid antigenic drift that necessitates frequent updates to the annual influenza vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). This evolution is further characterized by competition and turnover among groups of strains called clades bearing different complements of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Clades vary widely in their evolutionary success, with some dying out soon after emergence and others going on to take over the virus population. Several lines of evidence indicate that successful clades have higher fitness than clades that remain at low frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). A key goal in the study of H3N2 evolution is to identify the features that enable certain clades to succeed as others die out.</p>
<p>Two main characteristics distinguish evolutionarily successful clades from their competitors: greater antigenic change, and efficient viral growth and transmission. In principle, experiments could be informative for identifying how mutations affect these features. Most work on influenza evolution to date has utilized experimental data to assess the antigenicity of circulating strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). However, the non-antigenic effects of mutations also play an important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Specifically, due to influenza virus&#x2019;s high mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) and lack of intra-segment recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), deleterious mutations become linked to beneficial ones. The resulting accumulation of deleterious mutations can affect non-antigenic properties central to viral fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). However, there are no large-scale quantitative characterizations of how mutations to H3N2 HA affect viral growth.</p>
<p>It is now possible to use deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) to measure the functional effects of all single amino-acid mutations to viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). However, the only HA for which such large-scale measurements have previously been madewhich the experimental is from the highly lab-adapted A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Here, we measure the effects on viral growth in cell culture of all mutations to the HA of a recent human H3N2 strain. We show that these experimental measurements can help discriminate evolutionarily successful mutations from those found in strains that quickly die out. However, the utility of the experiments for understanding natural evolution depends on the similarity between the experimental and natural strains: measurements made on an H1 HA are not useful for understanding the evolutionary fate of H3 viral strains.</p>

<title>Deep mutational scanning of HA from a recent strain of human H3N2 influenza virus</title>
<p>We performed a deep mutational scan to measure the effects of all amino-acid mutations to HA from the A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) strain on viral growth in cell culture. This strain was the H3N2 component of the influenza vaccine from 2010-2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Relative to the consensus sequence for this HA in Genbank, we used a variant with two mutations that enhanced viral growth in cell culture, G78D and T212I (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref> and Dataset S1). The G78D mutation occurs at low frequency in natural H3N2 sequences, and T212 is a site where a mutation to Ala rose to fixation in human influenza in &#x007E;2011.</p>
<p>We mutagenized the entire HA coding sequence at the codon level to create mutant plasmid libraries harboring an average of &#x007E;1.4 codon mutations per clone (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). We then generated mutant virus libraries from the mutant plasmids using a helper-virus system that enables efficient generation of complex influenza virus libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These mutant viruses derived all their non-HA genes from the lab-adapted A/WSN/1933 strain. Using WSN/1933 for the non-HA genes reduces biosafety concerns, and also helped increase viral titers. To further increase viral titers, we used MDCK-SIAT1 cells that we had engineered to constitutively express the TMPRSS2 protease, which cleaves the HA precursor to activate it for membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>

<p>After generating the mutant virus libraries, we passaged them at low MOI in cell culture to create a genotype-phenotype link and select for functional HA variants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). All experiments were completed in full biological triplicate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We also passaged and deep sequenced library 3 in duplicate (library 3-1 and 3-2) to gauge experimental noise <italic>within</italic> a single biological replicate. As a control to measure sequencing and mutational errors, we used the unmutated HA gene to generate and passage viruses carrying wildtype HA.</p>
<p>Deep sequencing of the initial plasmid mutant libraries and the passaged mutant viruses revealed selection for functional HA mutants. Specifically, stop codons were purged to 20-45&#x0025; of their initial frequencies after correcting for error rates estimated by sequencing the wildtype controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The incomplete purging of stop codons is likely because genetic complementation due to co-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) enabled the persistence of some virions with nonfunctional HAs. We also observed selection against many nonsynonymous mutations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), with their frequencies falling to 30-40&#x0025; of their initial values after error correction.</p>
<p>We next quantified the reproducibility of our deep mutational scanning across biological and technical replicates. We first used the deep sequencing data for each replicate to estimate the preference of each site in HA for all 20 amino acids as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Because there are 566 residues in HA, there are 566 x 19 &#x003D; 10, 754 distinct measurements (the 20 preferences at each site sum to one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>)). The correlations of the amino-acid preferences between pairs of replicates are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>. The biological replicates were well-correlated, with Pearson&#x2019;s <italic>R</italic> ranging from 0.69 to 0.78. Replicate 1 exhibited the weakest correlation with other replicates; this replicate also showed the weakest selection against stop and nonsynonymous mutations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), perhaps indicating more experimental noise. The two technical replicates 3-1 and 3-2 were only slightly more correlated than pairs of biological replicates, suggesting that bottlenecking of library diversity during viral passage contributes most of the experimental noise.</p>

<title>Our measurements are consistent with existing knowledge about HA&#x2019;s evolution and function</title>
<p>How do the HA amino-acid preferences measured in our experiments relate to the evolution of H3N2 influenza virus in nature? This question can be addressed by evaluating how well an experimentally informed codon substitution model (ExpCM) using our measurements describes H3N2 evolution compared to standard substitution models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that the ExpCM using the across-replicate average of our measurements greatly outperforms conventional substitution models. This result indicates that our experiments authentically capture some of the constraints on HA evolution. The relative rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS or &#x03C9;) is &#x003C;&#x003C;1 for conventional substitution models (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, the relative rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions after accounting for the amino-acid preferences measured in our experiments (&#x03C9; for the ExpCM) is close to one (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), indicating that most purifying selection against nonsynonymous substitutions is accounted for in the deep mutational scanning. The ExpCM stringency parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) is 2.47 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), indicating that natural selection favors the same amino acids as the experiments but with greater stringency. Throughout the rest of this paper, we use the amino-acid preferences rescaled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) by this stringency parameter. These re-scaled preferences are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Examination of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> reveals that the experimentally measured amino-acid preferences generally agree with existing knowledge about HA&#x2019;s structure and function. For instance, sites that form structurally important disulfide bridges (sites 52 &#x0026; 277, 64 &#x0026; 76, 97 &#x0026; 139, 281 &#x0026; 305, 14 &#x0026; 137-HA2, 144-HA2 &#x0026; 148-HA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) strongly prefer cysteine. At residues involved in receptor binding, there are strong preferences for the amino acids that are known to be involved in binding sialic acid, such as Y98, D190, W153, and S228 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). A positively charged amino acid at site 329 is important for cleavage of the HA0 precursor into the mature form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), and this site strongly prefers arginine. However, a notable exception occurs at the start codon at position &#x2212;16, which does not show a strong preference for methionine. This codon is part of the signal peptide and is cleaved from the mature HA protein. One possible reason that our experiments do not show a strong preference for methionine at this site could be alternative translation-initiation at a downstream or upstream start site, as has been described for other HAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s1c">
<title>There is less difference in mutational tolerance between the HA head and stalk domains for H3 than for H1</title>
<p>Our experiments measure which amino acids are tolerated at each HA site under selection for viral growth. We can therefore use our experimentally measured amino-acid preferences to calculate the inherent mutational tolerance of each site, which we quantify as the Shannon entropy of the re-scaled preferences. In prior mutational studies of H1 HAs, the stalk domain was found to be substantially less mutationally tolerant than the globular head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed a similar analysis using our new data for the Perth/2009 H3 HA. Surprisingly, the head domain of the H3 HA is <italic>not</italic> more mutationally tolerant than the stalk domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, whereas solvent-exposed residues in the head domain are substantially more mutationally tolerant than those in the stalk domain for the WSN/1933 H1 HA, the trend is actually reversed for the Perth/2009 H3 HA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This difference between the relative mutational tolerances of the H1 and H3 HAs is robust to the cutoff used to define surface residues (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). For instance, for the H3 HA, the short helix A in the stalk domain is as mutationally tolerant as many surface-exposed residues in the head domain&#x2014;something that is not the case for the H1 HA. Helix A forms part of the epitope of many broadly neutralizing anti-stalk antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), and interestingly, there are more reports of readily selecting escape mutants from such anti-stalk antibodies in H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) than in H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) HAs.</p>

Different color scales are used because measurements are comparable among sites within the same HA, but not necessarily across HAs. Both trimers are shown in the same orientation. For each HA, the structure at left shows a surface representation of the full trimer, while the structure at right side shows a ribbon representation of just one monomer. The sialic acid receptor is shown in red sticks. (B) The mutational tolerance of solvent-exposed residues in the head and stalk domains of the Perth/2009 H3 HA (purple) and WSN/1933 H1 HA (gold). Residues falling in between the two cysteines at sites 52 and 277 were defined as belonging to the head domain, while all other residues were defined as the stalk domain. A residue was classified as solvent exposed if its relative solvent accessibility was &#x2264; 0.2; <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref> shows that the results are robust to the choice of solvent accessibility cutoff.

<p>We also see high mutational tolerance in many of the known antigenic regions of H3 HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). For instance, antigenic region B is an immunodominant area, and many recent major antigenic drift mutations have occurred in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). We find that the most distal portion of the globular head near the 190-helix, which is part of antigenic region B, is highly tolerant of mutations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Antigenic region C is also notably mutationally tolerant.</p>
<p>Many residues inside HA&#x2019;s receptor binding pocket are known to be highly functionally constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), and our data indicates that these sites are relatively mutationally intolerant in both H3 and H1 HAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, the residues surrounding the receptor binding pocket are fairly mutationally tolerant, which may contribute to the rapidity of influenza&#x2018;s antigenic evolution, since mutations at these sites can have large effects on antigenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>).</p>

<title>Our measurements can help distinguish between mutations that reach low and high frequencies in nature</title>
<p>Mutations occurring in the H3N2 virus population experience widely varying evolutionary fates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Some mutations appear, spread and fix in the population, while others briefly circulate before disappearing. We take the maximum frequency reached by a mutation as a coarse indicator of its effect on fitness, since favorable mutations generally reach higher frequency than unfavorable ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Here, we follow the population genetic definition of <italic>mutation</italic> and track the outcome of each individual mutation event, e.g. although R142G occurs multiple times on the phylogeny we track each of these mutations occurring on different backgrounds separately. As such, each mutation is shown as a separate circle on a separate branch in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. However, because multiple mutations on the same phylogeny branch cannot be disentangled, when multiple mutations occurred on a single branch, we assigned a single mutational effect based on the sum of effects of each mutation.</p>

</fig>
<p>After annotating mutations and their frequencies on the phylogeny in this way (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), it is visually obvious that there are relatively few circulating mutations that we measure to be strongly deleterious&#x2014;and that such deleterious mutations rarely reach high frequency when they do occur. Mutations that reach high frequencies generally have neutral or beneficial effects according to our experimental measurements.</p>
<p>We next sought to quantify the correlation between a mutation&#x2019;s experimentally measured effect and the maximum frequency it attained during natural evoluton. To minimize effects related to the genetic background of the strain used in the experiment, we excluded mutations closely related to the experimental strain itself and partitioned the remaining mutations into 1,022 mutations pre-dating and 299 mutations post-dating the Perth/2009 strain (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>). We additionally excluded mutations from the post-Perth partition that were sampled in 2014 or after that have not had enough time for their evolutionary fates to be fully resolved. We used these pre-Perth and post-Perth partitions to test the utility of our measurements for both post-hoc and prospective analyses, respectively. We quantified the relationship between mutational effects and maximum mutation frequencies in the H3N2 phylogeny via Spearman rank correlation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In both pre-Perth and post-Perth time periods, we found a modest, but statistically significant relationship between mutational effect and maximum mutation frequency (pre-Perth <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.17, post-Perth <italic>p &#x003D;</italic> 0.14). The similar effect sizes for both partitions shows that our experimental measurements can help explain the evolutionary fates of mutations in strains that post-date the experimentally studied strain, as well as to retrospectively analyze mutations that precede the experimental strain.</p>

<p>The trends in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> are most strongly driven by the behavior of substantially deleterious mutations. We investigated this further by partitioning mutations into those that reach low, medium and high frequencies, and those that fix in the population (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The mutations that reach higher frequency have a more favorable mean effect. Mutations measured to be substantially deleterious almost never reach high frequency. Overall, these results demonstrate that measurements of how mutations affect viral growth in cell culture are informative for understanding the fates of these mutations in nature: in particular, if a mutation is measurably deleterious to viral growth, that mutation is unlikely to prosper in nature.</p>

<title>There are large differences between H3 and H1 HAs in the amino-acid preferences of many sites</title>
<p>An obvious hypothesis for why the H1 deep mutational scanning is not useful for understanding the evolution of H3N2 influenza viruses is that the effect of the same mutation is often different between these two HA subtypes. To determine if this is the case, we examined how much the amino-acid preferences of homologous sites have shifted between H3 and H1 HAs. Prior experiments have found only modest shifts in amino-acid preferences between two variants of influenza nucleoprotein with 94&#x0025; amino-acid identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) and variants of HIV envelope (Env) with 86&#x0025; amino-acid identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). However, the H1 and H3 HAs are far more diverged, with only 42&#x0025; amino-acid identity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). One simple way to investigate the extent of shifts in amino-acid preferences is to correlate measurements from independent deep mutational scanning replicates on H1 and H3 HAs. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> shows that replicate measurements on the same HA variant are more correlated than those on different HA variants.</p>

Although some sites have small shifts near zero, many sites have large shifts. These shifts between H3 and H1 are much larger than expected from the null distribution that would be observed purely from ex-perimental noise. They are also much larger than the shifts previously observed between two HIV Envs with 86&#x0025; aminoacid identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). However, the typical shift between H3 and H1 is still smaller than that observed when comparing HA to the non-homologous HIV Env protein. Therefore, there are very substantial shifts in mutational effects between highly diverged HA homologs, although the effects of mutations remain more similar than for non-homologous proteins.</p>

<title>Properties associated with the shifts in amino-acid prefer-ences between H3 and H1 HAs</title>
<p>What features distinguish the sites with shifted amino-acid preferences between H3 and H1 HAs? The sites of large shifts do not obviously localize to one specific region of HA&#x2019;s structure (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). However, at the domain level, sites in HA&#x2019;s stalk tend to have smaller shifts than sites in HA&#x2019;s globular head (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). The HA stalk domain is also more conserved in sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), suggesting that conservation of amino-acid sequence is correlated with conservation of amino-acid preferences. Consistent with this idea, sites that are absolutely conserved across all 18 HA subtypes are significantly less shifted than sites that are variable across HA subtypes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Presumably these sites are under consistent functional constraint across all HAs.</p>
<p>Despite their high sequence divergence, H1 and H3 adopt very similar protein folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). However, there are differences in the rotation and upward translation of the globular head subdomains relative to the central stalk domain among different HA subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Previous work has defined clades of structurally related HA subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). One such clade includes H1, H2, H5, and H6, whereas another clade includes H3, H4, and H14 HAs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Sites that are conserved at different amino-acid identities in these two clades tend to have exceptionally large shifts in amino acid preferences (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). The clade containing H1 has an upward translation of the globular head relative to the clade containing H3. This structural shift has been attributed largely to the interaction between sites 107 and 75(HA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Specifically, the clade containing H1 has a taller turn in the interhelical loop connecting helix A and helix B in the stalk domain, and this tall turn is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Glu-107 and Lys-75(HA2) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). In deep mutational scanning of the H1 HA, site 107 has a high preference for Glu and 75(HA2) strongly prefers positively charged Lys and Arg. In contrast, the interhelical loop in H3 HA makes a sharper and shorter turn which is facilitated by a Gly at 75(HA2). In the deep mutational scanning of the Perth/2009 H3 HA, site 75(HA2) prefers Gly and to a lesser extent Val, while site 107 is fairly tolerant of mutations. Therefore, some of the shifts in HA amino-acid preferences can be rationalized in terms of changes in HA structure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have measured the effects of all possible single aminoacid mutations to the Perth/2009 H3 HA on viral growth in cell culture and demonstrated that these measurements have some value for understanding the evolutionary fate of these mutations in nature. Specifically, mutations measured to be more beneficial for viral growth tend to reach higher frequencies in nature than mutations measured to be more deleterious for viral growth. The fact that our experiments can help identify evolutionary successful mutations suggests that they might inform evolutionary forecasting. In their landmark paper introducing predictive viral fitness models that accounted for both antigenic and non-antigenic mutations, &#x0141;uksza and L&#x00E4;ssig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) noted that the models could in principle be improved by integrating &#x201C;diverse genotypic and phenotypic data&#x201D; that more realistically represented the effects of specific mutations. Our work suggests that deep mutational scanning may be able to provide such data.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that measurements of viral growth in cell culture do <italic>not</italic> represent true fitness in nature.</p>
<p>Indeed, a vast amount of work in virology has chronicled the ways in which experiments can select for lab artifacts or fail to capture important pressures that are relevant in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Mutations in viral genes other than HA are also important in determining strain success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). Given these caveats, it might seem surprising that measuring viral growth in cell culture can be informative about the success of viral strains in nature. Yet, prior to our work, there were no comprehensive studies of the functional effects of mutations to H3 HA on any property that even resembled viral fitness in nature, and modeling work has either omitted the non-antigenic effects of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) or assumed that all non-epitope mutations had equivalent deleterious effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The strength of our measurements are not that they perfectly capture fitness in nature, but that they are systematic and quantitative&#x2014;and so represent an improvement over no information at all. We suspect that performing similar experiments using more realistic and complex selections (e.g., ferrets or primary human airway cultures) might further improve their utility.</p>
<p>We measured the effects of all single amino-acid mutations to a specific HA, and then generalized these measurements to other H3N2 HAs from a 50-year timespan. These generalizations will only be valid to the extent that the effects of mutations are conserved during HA&#x2019;s evolution. Extensive prior work has shown that epistasis can shift the effects of mutations as proteins evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). Our work suggests that measurements on a HA from single human H3N2 viral strain can be usefully generalized to at least some extent across the entire evolutionary history of human H3N2 HA. On the other hand, when we compared our measurements for an H3 HA to prior measurements on H1 HA, we found substantial shifts at many sites&#x2014;much greater than those observed in prior protein-wide comparisons of more closely related homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Further investigation of how mutational effects shift as proteins diverge will be important for determining how broadly any given experiment can be generalized when attempting to make evolutionary forecasts.</p>
<p>Our work did not characterize the antigenic effects of mutations, which also play an important role in determining strain success in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). However, our basic selection and deep-sequencing approach can be harnessed to completely map how mutations affect antibody recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). But so far, experiments using this approach have not examined antibodies or sera that are relevant to driving the evolution of H3N2 influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>), or have used relevant sera but examined a non-comprehensive set of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Future experiments that completely map how HA mutations affect recognition by human sera seem likely to be especially fruitful for informing viral forecasting.</p>

We used the lentiviral vector to transduce MDCK-SIAT1 cells, and sorted an intermediate mCherry-positive population by flow cytometry. We refer to the sorted bulk population as MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells. There is no selectable marker for the TMPRSS2; however, we maintain the cells at low passage number, and have seen no indication that they lose their ability to support the growth of viruses with H3 HAs in the absence of exogenous trypsin.</p>

This viral supernatant was blind passaged in MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 a total of six additional times. We isolated viral RNA from these passaged viruses and sequenced the HA gene. The passaged HA had two mutations, G78D and T212I, which enhanced viral growth as shown in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>.

For all subsequent experiments, we used viruses with the HA containing these two mutations to improve titers and viral genetic stability, and this is the HA that we refer to as Perth/2009 in the manuscript text.

Briefly, we transfected 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells in suspension with 937.5 ng each of four protein expression plasmids encoding the ribonucleoprotein complex (HDM-Nan95-PA, HDM-Nan95-PB1, HDM-Nan95-PB2, and HDM-Aichi68-NP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>), and 1250 ng of one of the three pICR2-mutant-HA libraries (or the wild-type control) using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher L3000008). We allowed the transfected cells to adhere in 6-well plates and four hours later changed the media to D10 media. Eighteen hours after transfection, we infected the cells with the WSN/1933 HA-deficient helper virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) by preparing an inoculum of 500 TCID50 per <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>L of helper virus (as computed on HA-expressing cells) in IGM, aspirating the D10 media from the cells, and adding 2 mL of the helper-virus inoculum to each well. After three hours, we changed the media to fresh IGM. At 24 hours after helper-virus infection, we harvested the viral supernatants for each replicate, froze aliquots at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C, and titered in MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells. The titers were 92, 536, 536, and 734 TCID50 per <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>L for the three library replicates and the wildtype control, respectively.</p>
<p>We passaged 9 x 10<sup>5</sup> TCID50 of the transfection supernatants at an MOI of 0.0035 TCID50 per cell. To do this, we plated 4.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells per dish in 15-cm dishes in D10 media, and allowed the cells to grow for 24 hours, at which time they were at &#x007E;1.7 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells per dish. We replaced the media in each dish with 25 mL of an inoculum of 2.5 TCID50 of virus per <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>L in IGM. We collected viral supernatant for sequencing 48 hours post-infection.</p>

<title>Barcoded subamplicon sequencing</title>
<p>To extract viral RNA from the three replicate HA virus libraries and the wildtype HA virus, we ultracentrifuged 24 mL of supernatant at 22,000 rpm for 1.5 h at 4<sup>&#x00B0;</sup> C in a Beckman Coulter SW28 rotor, and extracted RNA using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit by resuspending the viral pellet in 400 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>L of buffer RLT supplemented with <italic>&#x03B2;</italic>-mercaptoethanol, pipetting 30 times, transferring the liquid to a microcentrifuge tube, adding 600 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>L 70&#x0025; ethanol, and proceeding according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The HA gene was reverse-transcribed with AccuScript Reverse Transcriptase (Agilent 200820) using primers P09-HA-For (5&#x2019;-AGCAAAAGCAGGGGATAATTCTATTAATC-3&#x2019;) and P09-HA-Rev (5&#x2019;-AGTAGAAACAAGGGTGTTTTTAATTACTAATACAC-3&#x2019;).</p>
<p>We generated the HA PCR amplicons for the three plasmid libraries, the three virus libraries, the wildtype plasmid control, and the wildtype virus control using KOD Hot Start Master Mix (EMD Millipore 71842) using the PCR reaction mixture and cycling conditions described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>) and the P09-HA-For and P09-HA-Rev primers. We prepared the sequencing libraries using a barcoded-subamplicon strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) to increase the accuracy from deep sequencing. The exact details of this approach are described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) (also see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/bcsubamp.html">https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/bcsubamp.html</ext-link>). The primers used to generate the subamplicons are in Dataset S2. We performed deep sequencing on a lane of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using 2 x 250 bp paired-end reads in rapid-run mode.</p>

<title>Analysis of deep sequencing data</title>
<p>We used the dms_tools2 software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jbloomlab/dms_tools2">https://github.com/jbloomlab/dms_tools2</ext-link>, version 2.2.0) to analyze the deep sequencing data.

<title>Inference of human H3N2 phylogenetic tree and calculation of maximum mutation frequencies</title>
<p>To generate the tree shown in <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>, we applied Nextstrain&#x2019;saugur pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</ext-link><underline>nextstrain/augur;</underline> commit 006896d) to publicly available H3N2 HA sequences from GISAID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>) (see Dataset S4), sampling six viruses per month over the time interval of January 1, 1968 to February 1, 2018. We aligned the resulting 2,189 HA sequences with MAFFT v7.310 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>) and constructed a maximum likelihood phylogeny from this alignment with RAxML 8.2.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). Ancestral state reconstruction and branch length timing were performed with TreeTime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>).

<p>The frequency trajectory of each individual mutation on the phylogeny is estimated following Nextstrain&#x2019;s augur pipeline and as first implemented in Nextflu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>). Herein, mutation frequency dynamics are modeled according to a Brownian motion diffusion process discretized to one-month intervals. Relative to a simple Brownian motion, the expectation includes an &#x201C;inertia&#x201D; term <italic>&#x03B5;</italic> that adds velocity to the diffusion and the variance includes a term <italic>x</italic>(1 &#x2014; <italic>x)</italic> to scale variance according to frequency following a Wright-Fisher population genetic process. This results in the following diffusion process with

with &#x2018;volatility&#x2019; parameter <italic>&#x03C3;</italic><sup>2</sup>. The term dx is the increment in the previous timestep, so that d<italic>x</italic> &#x003D; <italic>x(t) &#x2014; x(t &#x2014; dt).</italic> We used <italic>&#x03B5;</italic> &#x003D; 0.7 and <italic>&#x03c3;<sup>2</sup></italic> &#x003D; 0.05 to maximize fit to empirical trajectory behavior.</p>
<p>We also include an Bernoulli observation model for mutation presence / absence among sampled viruses at timestep <italic>t</italic>. This observation model follows

<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="298364_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives>

where <italic>v</italic> &#x2208; <italic>V</italic> represents the set of viruses that have the mutation and <italic>v &#x2209; V</italic> represents the set of viruses that do not have the mutation. Each frequency trajectory is estimated by simultaneously maximizing the likelihood of the process model and the likelihood of the observation model via adjusting frequency trajectory <italic>x</italic> &#x003D; (x<sub>1</sub>,&#x2026;,x<sub>n</sub>).</p>

<title>Analysis of mutational shifts</title>
<p>To compare the Perth/2009 H3 and WSN/1933 H1 HA preferences, we first aligned the wildtype HA sequences using MAFFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). To quantify the shifts in preference for every alignable site while accounting for experimental noise, we used the approach described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) and used the RMSDcorrected values as our quantification of the extent of each shift.</p>
<p>For the plots shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, any residues falling between Cys-52 and Cys-277 were defined as the head domain, and all other residues were defined as the stalk domain. We used the multiple sequence alignment of the HA subtype sequences from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) to identify sites that are absolutely conserved across all subtypes, or in the different clades described in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>.</p>

<caption><title>Characterization of the G78D-T212I Perth/2009 HA variant.</title>
<p>(A) The G78D-T212I Perth/2009 HA variant supports better viral growth than the wildtype Perth/2009 HA. Viruses were generated in duplicate by reverse genetics with the Perth/2009 NA and WSN internal genes, and passaged once at MOI &#x003D; 0.01 in MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells. The rescue and passage viral supernatants were collected at 72 hours post-transfection and 44 hours post-infection, respectively, and titered in MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells. The points mark each duplicate and the bar marks the mean. (B) The D78 variant remained at a low frequency in natural human H3N2 sequences over the past &#x007E;10 years. The A212variant rose to fixation in &#x007E;2011, replacing the T212 variant.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Sanger sequencing of 31 randomly chosen clones from the mutant plasmid libraries.</title>
<p>(A) There were an average of &#x007E;1.4 codon mutations per clone across the three plasmid mutant libraries. (B) A mixture of one-, two-, and three-nucleotide mutations were present, with slightly fewer triple-nucleotide changes than expected. (C) Nucleotide frequencies were uniform in the codon mutations. (D) The mutations were distributed relatively evenly across the length of the HA coding sequence. (E) We calculated the pairwise distances between mutations for clones carrying more than one mutation. The cumulative distribution of these distances is shown in the red line. The blue line indicates the expected distribution if mutations in multiply mutated genes are randomly dispersed along the sequence.</p></caption>

<caption><title>A phylogenetic tree of all HA sequences used in our analysis of mutation frequencies.</title>
<p>HA sequences were sampled at a rate of six viruses per month from January 1, 1968 through February 1,2018. The Perth/2009 strain used in our experiments is indicated. The rest of the tree is partitioned into nodes that preceded the split of the Perth/2009 strain from the trunk of the tree (blue) and nodes that branched off the trunk after the clade containing Perth/2009 (orange). In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, these two partitions of the tree are analyzed separately. Nodes in the clade containing the Perth/2009 strain and nodes sampled in 2014 or after were excluded from our analyses. The Perth/2009 strain was excluded to avoid artifacts related to mutations that occurred on the branches leading to the HA sequence used in the experiment. The post-2014 nodes were excluded because the evolutionary fates of many sequences after this date are not yet full resolved.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Mutational tolerances of the head and stalk domains at various relative solvent accessibility cutoffs.</title>
<p>The mutational tolerances of the head and stalk domains show less disparity for the Perth/2009 H3 HA compared to those for the WSN/1933 H1 HA. We used relative solvent accessibility (RSA) cutoffs of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 to define solvent-exposed residues and plotted the mutational tolerances (Shannon entropy of re-scaled preferences) of these residues in the head and stalk domains for the Perth/2009 H3 HA (purple) and the WSN/1933 H1 HA (brown). Residues falling in between the two cysteines at sites 52 and 277 were defined as belonging to the head domain, while all other residues were defined as the stalk domain. The HA structures color the residues that are defined as solvent exposed at a given RSA cutoff. One monomer is shown in surface representation and another monomer shown in ribbon representation. Residues in lighter shades of purple or brown are in the head domain, while residues in darker shades are in the stalk domain. Note that the mutational tolerance values are not comparable between the two HAs.</p></caption>
