<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Multiple regulatory regions bound by the same transcription factor have been shown to simultaneously control a single gene&#x2019;s expression. However, it remains unclear how these regulatory regions combine to regulate transcription. Here we test the sufficiency of promoter-distal estrogen receptor &#x03B1; (ER)-binding sites (ERBS) for activating gene expression by recruiting synthetic activators in the absence of estrogens. Targeting either dCas9-VP16(10x) or dCas9-p300(core) to ERBS induces H3K27ac and activates nearby expression in a manner similar to an estrogen induction, with dCas9-VP16(10x) acting as a stronger activator. The sufficiency of individual ERBS is highly correlated with their necessity, indicating an inherent activation potential. By targeting ERBS combinations, we found that ERBS work independently to control gene expression. The sufficiency results contrast necessity assays that show synergy between these ERBS, suggesting that synergy occurs between ERBS in terms of activator recruitment, whereas directly recruiting activators leads to independent effects on gene expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene expression enhancers are genomic loci that act in <italic>cis</italic> to control a distal gene&#x2019;s expression level. There are two orders of magnitude more predicted enhancers in the human genome compared to gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that many mammalian genes are regulated by multiple enhancers. Analysis of 3D genome architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) and the expression of enhancer RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andersson et al., 2014</xref>) corroborate the idea that the average human gene is regulated by the combined action of many enhancers. Functional studies into enhancer combinations have found that enhancers can work together in an additive/independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bender et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fujioka et al., 1999</xref>), synergistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Torbey et al., 2018</xref>), or redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>) manner, indicating that enhancers can combine to regulate gene expression in complex and diverse ways.</p>
<p>Most studies of enhancer function and combinatorics involve genetic deletion of the region(s) of interest. Genetic deletion, along with CRISPR interference-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fulco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Korkmaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Thakore et al., 2015</xref>), test the necessity of a genomic region or combination of genomic regions for regulatory activity. Testing necessity involves inhibiting many different activities of an enhancer, including transcription factor recruitment, histone modification, and interactions with target genes, which doesn&#x2019;t provide direct insight into how an enhancer activates gene expression. Testing the sufficiency of an enhancer in a particular manner can provide insight into the requirements of enhancer activation and if the enhancer has the innate capability to affect transcription. However, testing the sufficiency of genomic regulatory regions in their native context is less commonly undertaken than necessity.</p>
<p>Reporter assays, in which a plasmid containing a potential enhancer sequence controls the expression of a reporter gene, are one way of testing enhancer sufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Catarino and Stark, 2018</xref>). However, this technique does not analyze an enhancer within its native chromatin context and is likely missing information that might be critical for the ability of an enhancer to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cunningham et al., 2018</xref>). Recently developed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), which involves the fusion of a catalytically dead Cas9 protein (dCas9) to an activation domain. Different activation domains can be fused to dCas9, including the transcriptional activation domain of VP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>)and the core domain of P300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hilton et al., 2015</xref>). VP16 is a herpes simplex virus transcription factor which recruits a variety of host factors, including general transcription factors, mediator, and histone acetyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hirai et al., 2010</xref>). P300(core) is a histone acetyltransferase linked with activation of many genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Delvecchio et al., 2013</xref>). CRISPRa provides a strategy for turning on specific genes when targeted to promoter regions with guide RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chavez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Perez-Pinera et al., 2013</xref>). CRISPRa can also be targeted to distal regulatory regions in order to test their sufficiency in promoting gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hilton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Thormann et al., 2018</xref>); however, very few distal regulatory regions have been interrogated in this manner and it is unclear how targeting CRISPRa to combinations of enhancers will impact gene expression.</p>
<p>Many enhancers are controlled by the activity of inducible transcription factors. Estrogen receptor &#x03B1; (ER) is a steroid hormone receptor which only has gene regulatory activity when it is bound by estrogens. ER acts mostly as an activating transcription factor, binding to thousands of genomic loci and regulating hundreds of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gertz et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">2013</xref>). The majority of genes that are up-regulated by estrogen have multiple ER bound sites nearby and we previously found evidence of collaboration between ER bound sites in regulating the gene expression response to estrogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>). Using a CRISPRi-based approach, enhancer interference (Enhancer-i), we found synergistic and hierarchical relationships involving ER bound sites. These relationships were discovered by measuring the necessity of each ER bound site individually and in combination. It is unclear whether ERBS collaboration is dependent on ER or a property of the ER binding sites (ERBS), necessitating an investigation of ERBS sufficiency in the genomic context.</p>
<p>Here, we use CRISPRa to target regulatory regions that are normally bound by ER. By targeting these regions in the absence of estrogens, we sought to determine if CRISPRa synthetic activators could recreate the transcriptional response to estrogens. We find that dCas9-VP16(10x) fusion can recreate most of the estrogen response at the four genes tested, while a dCas9-P300 was not as effective. Targeting CRISPRa to individual regulatory regions and combinations of loci uncovered an additive/independent relationship between sites, in contrast to our previous necessity findings. Our results indicate that ER binding to neighboring enhancers works in a synergistic fashion, but synthetic activators directly recruited to loci normally bound by ER work independently to regulate gene expression.</p>

<title>Targeting CRISPRa to loci normally bound by ER can mimic transcriptional response to estrogens</title>
<p>In order to determine if synthetic activators are sufficient to drive an estrogen-like transcriptional response, we evaluated two CRISPRa fusion proteins: dCas9-VP16(10x) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>), which is commonly used at promoters, and dCas9-P300(core) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hilton et al., 2015</xref>), which can activate gene expression from enhancers. Each fusion was expressed from identical expression vectors (see Methods, Figure S1A) in order to directly compare their ability to activate gene expression from distal regulatory regions normally bound by ER. We first targeted dCas9-VP16(10x) and dCas9-p300(core) to the <italic>IL1RN</italic> promoter, a gene which can be highly activated by CRISPRa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hilton et al., 2015</xref>; Perez-Pinera et al., 2013), and observed a similar level of activation for <italic>IL1RN</italic> with both dCas9 fusion constructs in Ishikawa cells, an endometrial cancer cell line (Figure S1B).</p>
<p>The dCas9 fusions were targeted to a pool of ER binding sites (ERBS) to determine if the estrogen response could be recapitulated with CRISPRa. We chose a set of 12 ERBS that were within 100 kilobase pairs (kb) of 4 genes that are normally responsive to estrogen. <italic>MMP17</italic> has two upstream and one downstream ERBS, <italic>CISH</italic> has three downstream ERBS, and <italic>FHL2</italic> and <italic>HES2</italic> both have three upstream ERBS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We targeted the CRISPRa fusions to the 12 ERBS simultaneously and measured gene expression of the target genes in the absence of estrogens and therefore the absence of ER binding. We observed significant gene expression activation by dCas9-VP16(10x) at all 4 genes tested, while activation by dCas9-P300 was only significant at 2 genes (<italic>CISH</italic> and <italic>HES2</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). dCas9-VP16(10x) was consistently a stronger activator than dCas9-p300(core). The level of gene expression driven by dCas9-VP16(10x) was well correlated with the fold change in gene expression seen with a 17&#x03B2; estradiol (E2) induction (r &#x003D; 0.8) (Figure S1C). These results demonstrate that an E2 transcriptional response may be mimicked by CRISPRa when targeted to ERBS and that the activation potential of the ERBS surrounding a target gene is captured by synthetic activators.</p>

<p>To determine if the activation potential is specific to ERBS, we targeted dCas9-VP16(10x) to a total of 6 regions that are at most 6 kb away from ERBS discussed above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Regions with low DNase I hypersensitivity signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gertz et al., 2013</xref>) were chosen, in order to limit the probability that the region was an active regulatory region controlled by other transcription factors. When targetings the ERBS adjacent sites, we did not observe significant activation over the control of targeting the <italic>IL1RN</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The inability of ERBS adjacent regions to regulate gene expression with synthetic activators indicates specificity when testing sufficiency of regulatory regions with CRISPRa and differences in activation potential between ERBS and nearby non-ERBS.</p>

<title>dCas9 activator fusions can target precise genomic loci and induce histone acetylation</title>
<p>To test whether CRISPRa is successfully targeted to the intended genomic regions surrounding our genes of interest, we conducted a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiment using an antibody that recognizes an HA epitope tag on dCas9. CRISPRa was targeted to 19 loci, consisting of 12 ERBS, 6 ERBS-adjacent regions and the <italic>IL1RN</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). At all of these loci we observed a distinct HA (dCas9) signal at the targeted site when compared to non-targeted controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and S2A,B,C). Successful targeting of dCas9 to ERBS-adjacent regions indicates the lack of activation from these regions is a result of native properties of the adjacent regions and not a result of the targeting efficiency.</p>

<p>Histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) is a histone modification found at active regulatory regions and is directly deposited by p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Raisner et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore performed ChIP-seq with an antibody that recognizes H3K27ac to determine if the CRISPRa fusions were able to cause H3K27ac at targeted sites. For all 19 targeted loci, we saw significantly increased H3K27ac. For ERBS, the patterns of acetylation look similar to E2 induced H3K27ac (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C,D</xref> and S2D,E). We observed similar fold changes in H3K27ac when using dCas9-VP16(10x) and when using dCas9-p300(core) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and S2G; p-value &#x003D; 0.806, paired t-test). This result is in contrast to the greater gene activation induced by dCas9-VP16(10x), indicating that histone acetylation of a distal regulatory element is not fully predictive of target gene activation. Consistent with the idea that H3K27ac by itself is not sufficient to drive maximal expression, we observed H3K27ac at the adjacent regions even though they were unable to induce gene expression (Figure S2F).</p>

<title>dCas9-VP16(10x) activates gene expression from individual ER binding sites</title>
<p>Since targeting dCas9-VP16(10x) to all ERBS simultaneously resulted in gene activation of all genes, we next sought to determine if targeting individual ERBS with dCas9-VP16(10x) is sufficient to increase gene expression. At the <bold><italic>MMP17</italic></bold> locus, all three ERBS activated gene expression above the control level when targeted individually (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Targeting MMP17-1 resulted in the highest induced expression, MMP17-2 exhibited the weakest activation and MMP17-3 led to an intermediate change in <bold><italic>MMP17</italic></bold> expression. When targeting the ERBS surrounding <italic>CISH</italic>, CISH-1 and CISH-2 induced a similar level of activation, while CISH-3 did not result in activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The <italic>FHL2</italic> gene was induced strongest by FHL2-1. <italic>FHL2</italic> was also activated by FHL2-2 and FHL2-3, but to a lower level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). At <italic>HES2</italic>, we observed a high level of activation from HES2-1 and slight activation from HES2-2 and HES2-3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>To ensure that the activation observed from individual sites is specific to the targeted site, we tried to activate expression in previously derived Ishikawa lines with homozygous deletion of the targeted ERBS for the <bold><italic>MMP17</italic></bold> and <italic>CISH</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>). In each case, no detectable gene activation was observed in the deletion lines indicating specificity in targeting individual ERBS (Figure S3A,B). We theorized the observed differences in activation at individual sites may be due to biases in dCas9 targeting or preferential H3K27ac. However, we found no significant correlation between expression activation and HA ChIP-seq signal or H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal (Figure S3C,D). The ability to activate gene expression from several individual enhancers adds to a growing body of literature showing that a gene&#x2019;s expression can be controlled by multiple regulatory regions. Furthermore, the unique level of activation that results from targeting individual enhancers suggests that enhancers do not contribute equally to gene activation, even when bound by a synthetic activator.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Enhancers bound by synthetic activators work independently to regulate transcription</title>
<p>Based on the observation that multiple ERBS nearby each gene were capable of activating gene expression when targeted individually by dCas9-VP16(10x), we investigated how synthetic activator bound enhancers collaborate to control gene expression by targeting pairs of ERBS. In general, ERBS appeared to combine independently when simultaneously targeted. For example, CISH-1 and CISH-2 are the two strongest individual activators of <italic>CISH</italic> and each increase gene expression to approximately 40&#x0025; of maximum observed activation while the combination of CISH-1 and CISH-2 increases gene expression to 80&#x0025; (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). A similar pattern was observed for <bold><italic>MMP17</italic></bold> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), while <bold><italic>FHL2</italic></bold> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and <bold><italic>HES2</italic></bold> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) exhibit sub-additive effects that may represent saturation.</p>
<p>In order to quantitatively understand the interactions between ERBS when bound by a synthetic activator, we created a thermodynamic model of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment (as a surrogate for transcription) by ERBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Buchler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shea and Ackers, 1985</xref>). To describe the differences in gene expression seen from our combinatorial activation studies, we fit relative energy parameters to an abstracted model of combinatorial synthetic activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The model included 4 sets of interactions: (1) Interactions between dCas9-VP16(10x) and targeted ERBS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, red), (2) interactions between ERBS-bound synthetic activators (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, green), (3) interactions between ERBS-bound synthetic activators and RNAPII (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, blue), and (4) interactions between RNAPII and a gene&#x2019;s promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, purple). This model makes the assumption that the probability of RNAPII binding is proportional to a gene&#x2019;s expression and we used this correlation to fit model parameters. We ran the parameter optimization with many random starts, then selected the 500 most optimal parameter sets (see Methods). We consequently observed a range of parameters that were locally optimal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-E</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="479709v1_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In this model, the activation observed from targeting individual loci is largely captured by the interaction terms between RNAPII and synthetic activators (parameter ranges shown in blue in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), where more favorable (more negative) interactions are indicative of more gene activation. For example, at <bold><italic>FHL2</italic></bold>, site FHL2-1 has the largest impact on expression and the most favorable interaction with RNAPII, while FHL2-2 and FHL2-3 have modest effects on expression and slightly favorable RNAPII-synthetic activator interactions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In these models, the interaction between synthetic activators and RNAPII can be balanced by differential recruitment of the synthetic activators to the ERBS (shown in red in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). For example, CISH-1 and CISH-2 both activate gene expression to similar levels, but CISH-1 is modeled with the synthetic activator more strongly recruiting RNAPII while CISH-2 is modeled as binding the synthetic activator with more efficiency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The relationship between ERBS in the sufficiency experiments is best captured by the interaction terms between synthetic activators bound to ERBS (parameter ranges shown in green in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). For all studied genes, we do not see strong cooperativity between ERBS. For <bold><italic>MMP17</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>CISH</italic></bold>, we observed relatively neutral interactions between ERBS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>). The best fits for <bold><italic>FHL2</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>HES2</italic></bold> were mostly competitive models where certain ERBS inhibit others (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref>). This may result from a limit in how much gene activation can be driven by the synthetic activators. For example, CRISPRa at HES2-1 is similar to targeting all ERBS surrounding HES2 simultaneously. Even though targeting of HES2-2 or HES2-3 has some activity in isolation, they are unable to increase expression beyond HES2-1 targeting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This is captured in the model as unfavorable interactions between HES2-1 and the other ERBS. In general, the lack of cooperativity in these models supports the conclusion that these sites work independently to activate gene expression when targeted with dCas9-VP16(10x).</p>

<title>Comparison between necessity and sufficiency of ERBS</title>
<p>We previously assessed the necessity of the nine ERBS nearby <bold><italic>CISH</italic></bold>, <bold><italic>MMP17</italic></bold>, and <italic>FHL2</italic> in producing a transcriptional response to estrogen using Enhancer-i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>). At these three genes, we found the predominant ERBS for activating gene expression when testing sufficiency was the same as when testing necessity (e.g. MMP17-1 and FHL2-1). In order to normalize the relative impact of targeting individual ERBS for each gene, we calculated the z-score of relative expression when targeting an individual ERBS compared to targeting the other individual ERBS for that gene. We observed a strong correlation between the relative necessity, as measured by Enhancer-i (and validated by genetic deletion), and sufficiency, as measured by dCas9-VP16(10x) targeting (r &#x003D; 0.840, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The consistent importance of individual ERBS, in terms of sufficiency and necessity, suggests that each ERBS has a native activation potential that is unique to the site.</p>

<p>While the necessity and sufficiency of individual ERBS was consistent, combinations of ERBS behaved differently when comparing necessity and sufficiency. We previously reported synergy between ERBS when testing necessity. To quantitatively compare ERBS interactions between CRISPRa and Enhancer-i, we thermodynamically modelled the Enhancer-i data using the same model as activation with the difference being a site was defined as &#x201C;active&#x201D; if it was not blocked (i.e. untargeted by SID-dCas9-KRAB). In contrast to the models based on CRISPRa, we observed the expected cooperative interactions between pairs of ERBS: MMP17-1 and MMP17-2; CISH-1 and CISH-2; and FHL2-1 and FHL2-2 (Figure S4A,B,C). When comparing parameters between the Enhancer-i and CRISPRa derived models, it is clear that most parameter estimates are consistent, except ERBS interaction terms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B,C</xref> and S4D). These results are consistent with synergy in gene regulation occurring between ERBS when ER is binding to the enhancers, but ERBS that are instead bound by synthetic activators act independently on gene expression. Therefore, synergy likely occurs in the recruitment of ER and potentially cofactors to an ERBS, while targeting an activator directly to an ERBS does not require synergy with neighboring ERBS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CRISPR-based gene activation is a unique platform for interrogating the sufficiency of gene expression enhancers within the native genomic context. In this study, we applied variations of the approach to distal regulatory elements normally bound by ER, using cells that were not exposed to estrogens and therefore had negligible ER activity. Targeting dCas9, fused to either the core of P300 or 10 copies of VP16, to 12 ERBS surrounding 4 genes simultaneously activated transcription to levels which mimicked an E2 transcriptional response. We also observed H3K27ac deposition at all sites targeted, in a pattern similar to that caused by E2 treatment. Regions adjacent to ERBS do not activate gene expression when targeted, suggesting that certain loci have the potential to impact gene expression when locally activated and others do not.</p>
<p>In agreement with the idea of inherent activation potential of an enhancer, we also found that the sufficiency of an ERBS, as measured by dCas9-VP16(10x) gene activation from the site, is correlated with the necessity of the site, as measured by SID(4x)-dCas9-KRAB interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>). This observation supports the notion that inducible enhancers have an intrinsic ability to activate gene expression to a certain magnitude. The amount of gene expression that an enhancer can drive is likely influenced by properties of the enhancer such as the battery of transcription factors and cofactors which interact with the enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Reiter et al., 2017</xref>), distance to the target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>), probability of looping interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gu et al., 2018</xref>), as well as the plasticity of the enhancer&#x2019;s chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Flavahan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Peters et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>We tested two dCas9 fusions and found that dCas9-VP16(10x) activates genes to a higher level than dCas9-p300(core). The fusions caused similar levels of H3K27ac to be deposited at targeted loci, suggesting that histone acetylation is not the only event that impacts transcription and that VP16 is likely contributing to gene activation in other ways. This could be because VP16 recruits a host of cofactors, including basal transcription factors and mediator, in addition to histone acetyl transferases (HATs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hirai et al., 2010</xref>). These interactions allow VP16 to more directly assemble the transcriptional machinery while p300-induced acetylation may be limited by other methods of transcriptional control, such as protein recruitment. The superior performance of dCas9-VP16(10x) may also be specific to the ERBS that we targeted, as dCas9-p300(core) has been shown to be more effective than VP16(4x) at other loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hilton et al., 2015</xref>), or it could be explained by the extra copies of VP16 in the 10x fusion.</p>
<p>While the necessity and sufficiency of individual ERBS was well correlated, the manner in which they combine to regulate gene expression was very different when tested with Enhancer-i and CRISPRa. In necessity experiments, pairs of ERBS showed synergistic behavior. For example, <italic>CISH</italic> was not estrogen responsive unless both CISH-1 and CISH-2 were active. In the sufficiency experiments, ERBS combined in a mostly independent/additive fashion, although some combinations appear sub-additive and may approach a saturating level of activation for the gene. The contrast in how ERBS combine to regulate transcription in the two experimental approaches suggests that the synergy between ERBS likely occurs in <italic>cis</italic>, where the recruitment of ER and its cofactors, such as HATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hanstein et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shang et al., 2000</xref>), is synergistic between ERBS. However, if the cofactors are directly recruited to the ERBS, as is the case with CRISPRa, then synergy no longer occurs. In this model, synergy occurs when ERBS influence one another prior to regulating a gene and once they are ready to regulate gene expression, ERBS communicate with the target gene independently.</p>

<title>ChIP-seq</title>
<p>Cells were grown in hormone depleted media for 5-7 days then plated in 15cm dishes at 8.5 million cells per dish. Cells were transfected 1 day after plating as described above with 42.75 &#x00B5;g total plasmid. Approximately 40 hours after transfection, media was changed to fresh hormone depleted media containing 1 &#x00B5;g/mL puromycin and 300 &#x00B5;g/mL G418 to select for cells transfected with both plasmids. Chromatin was harvested 72 hours post-transfection. ChIP was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Reddy et al., 2009</xref>). The antibodies used were HA (Biolegend 16B12) and H3K27ac (Active Motif pAb Cat #39133). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 as single-end 50 base pair reads and aligned to hg19 using bowtie with parameters - m 1 &#x2013;t &#x2013;best -q -S -l 32 -e 80 -n 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>).

<title>Gene expression analysis</title>
<p>Prior to gene expression analysis using qPCR, Ishikawa cell lines were grown in hormone depleted media for 5-8 days before being plated in 24 well plates at 60,000-100,000 cells per well. Cells were transfected 1 day after plating with 550ng total DNA per well. Approximately 40 hours after transfection, media was changed to hormone depleted media containing 1 &#x00B5;g/mL puromycin and 300 &#x00B5;g/mL G418 to select for successfully transfected cells. E2 inductions were performed by adding 10 nM E2 to media 64 hours post-transfection. 72 hours post-transfection, cells were lysed using Buffer RLT Plus (Qiagen) with 1&#x0025; beta-marcaptoethanol (Sigma). RNA was isolated using the ZR-96-well Quick-RNA kit (Zymo Research) and quantified using either RiboGreen (Life Technologies) with an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer) or with a Qubit 2.0 (Life Technologies).</p>
<p>qPCR was conducted using the Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Life Technologies). 50 ng of starting material was mixed into a 20 &#x00B5;L reaction volume. A CFX Connect light cycler (BioRad) was used to perform a 30-minute cDNA synthesis at 48&#x00B0;C followed by a 10-minute enzyme activation at 95&#x00B0;C and 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95&#x00B0;C and 1 minute at 60&#x00B0;C. qPCR primers were added at a final concentration of 0.5 nM. Primer sequences are listed in Table S3. Primer specificity was confirmed using melt-curve analysis. Biorad CFX Manager 3.1 was used to calculate cycle threshold values using baseline subtracted curve fit and an auto-calculated single threshold. Final results were calculated using the &#x2206;&#x2206;Ct method with <italic>CTCF</italic> expression as the control for normalization.

<title>Thermodynamic modelling</title>
<p>We used a modified version of the statistical thermodynamic model implemented in Gertz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gertz et al., 2009</xref>), originating from the Shea-Ackers formalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shea and Ackers, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>For a system state s, the relative energy of that state is:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="479709v1_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where N is the number of ERBS plus 1 for the promoter, M is the number of possible synthetic activator-synthetic activator interactions (or ER-ER interactions for the necessity data) and synthetic activator-RNAPII interactions, &#x03C3; is a binary variable that denotes whether an ERBS or promoter is bound (0 for unbound and 1 for bound), q values represent protein:DNA interactions, and &#x03C9; values represent protein-protein interactions.</p>
<p>We then calculate a thermodynamic weight for each state s as:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="479709v1_ueqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where R is the gas constant and T is temperature set at 37&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>We define an experimental state, conditional on which enhancers are being targeted, which can be thought of as the union of possible states. For example, if sites 1 and 2 are being targeted, possible system states include: site 1 is bound, site 2 is bound, both are bound or none are bound; however, states with site 3 bound are considered highly unlikely and not considered.</p>
<p>Therefore, the probability of RNAPII being in a certain experimental state e is given by the partition
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="479709v1_ueqn3.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where &#x03B4;(RNAPII) is a delta function which is equal to 1 when RNAPII is bound in a given system state and 0 otherwise. &#x03B4;(exper) is a delta function corresponding to whether a system state is possible given which regulatory regions are being targeted in the experimental state. 2<sup>N</sup> is the number of possible experimental states given N regulatory regions.</p>
<p>Gene expression was assumed to be correlated to the probability of RNAPII being bound to the promoter. When fitting our parameters, we maximized the value of the following correlation:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="479709v1_ueqn4.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where cor is the Pearson correlation across all experimental states tested.</p>
<p>Random starts were chosen as a set of 10 random numbers between the limits of &#x2212;5 and 5 using the runif function in R. In order to limit algorithmic bias from one fitting algorithm, parameters were fit using both the L-BFGS-B algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Byrd et al., 1995</xref>) and the Hooke and Jeeves Pattern Search Optimization method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hooke and Jeeves, 1961</xref>). An interface to these algorithms was implemented in R by John C Nash in the optimr package. Using both algorithms, 1000 iterations were run, resulting in 2000 parameter fits. The 500 optimum parameter sets were chosen for plotting and analysis. If more than 500 fits reached the same optimum correlation, a random sample of 500 best fits were selected.</p>
<p>Inhibition by SID(4x)-dCas9-KRAB was modeled in the same way with the exception that sites not targeted were defined as &#x201C;active.&#x201D; We therefore assume that if a site is targeted with SID(4x)- dCas9-KRAB it is completely inactive. The model is again fit on correlation between RNAPII occupancy and previously measured qPCR data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carleton et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
