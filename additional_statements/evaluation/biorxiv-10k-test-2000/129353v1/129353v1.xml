<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Quantitative resistance is likely to be more durable than major gene resistance for controlling Septoria tritici blotch (STB) on wheat. Earlier studies hypothesized that resistance affecting the degree of host damage, as measured by the percentage of leaf area covered by STB lesions, is distinct from resistance that affects pathogen reproduction, as measured by the density of pycnidia produced within lesions. We tested this hypothesis using a collection of 335 elite European winter wheat cultivars that was naturally infected by a diverse population of <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> in a replicated eld experiment. We used automated analysis of 21214 scanned wheat leaves to obtain quantitative measures of STB conditional severity that were precise, objective, and reproducible. These measures allowed us to explicitly separate resistance affecting host damage from resistance affecting pathogen reproduction, enabling us to confirm that these resistance traits are largely independent. The cultivar rankings based on host damage were different from the rankings based on pathogen reproduction, indicating that the two forms of resistance should be considered separately in breeding programs aiming to increase STB resistance. We hypothesize that these different forms of resistance are under separate genetic control, enabling them to be recombined to form new cultivars that are highly resistant to STB. We found a significant correlation between rankings based on automated image analysis and rankings based on traditional visual scoring, suggesting that image analysis can complement conventional measurements of STB resistance, based largely on host damage, while enabling a much more precise measure of pathogen reproduction. We showed that measures of pathogen reproduction early in the growing season were the best predictors of host damage late in the growing season, illustrating the importance of breeding for resistance that reduces pathogen reproduction in order to minimize yield losses caused by STB. These data can already be used by breeding programs aiming to increase STB resistance to choose wheat cultivars that are broadly resistant to naturally diverse <italic>Z. tritici</italic> populations according to the different classes of resistance.</p>

<p><italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> (Desm.) Quaedvlieg &#x0026; Crous (formerly <italic>Mycosphaerella graminicola</italic> (Fuckel) J. Schr&#x00F6;t. in Cohn) is a fungal pathogen that poses a major threat to wheat production globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jorgensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dean et al., 2012</xref>). It infects wheat leaves, causing the disease Septoria tritici blotch (STB). The yield loss posed by STB can be 5-10&#x0025;, even when resistant cultivars and fungicides are used in combination, and around 1.2 billion dollars are spent annually on fungicides targeted mainly towards STB control in Europe alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Torriani et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Z. tritici</italic> has a highly diverse and dynamic population that carries a high degree of fungicide resistance in Europe (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fones and Gurr, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Torriani et al., 2015</xref>). In several cases, fungicides repeatedly lost their efficacy only a few years after their introduction due to rapid emergence of fungicide-resistant strains of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Griffin and Fisher, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fraaije et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Torriani et al., 2009</xref>). Resistance to azoles, an important class of fungicides that is widely used to control STB, has been growing steadily over the last twenty years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cools and Fraaije, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhan et al., 2006</xref>) and appeared recently in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Estep et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, STB-resistant wheat cultivars have become an important breeding objective to enable more effective management of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">McDonald and Mundt, 2016</xref>). Major resistance genes such as STB6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brading et al., 2002</xref>) provide nearly complete resistance against a subset of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> strains carrying the wild type AvrStb6 allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>), but as found for fungicides, major resistance often breaks down a few years after it is introduced. Quantitative resistance may be conferred by a large number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with small and additive effects that can be combined to provide high levels of disease resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Poland et al., 2009</xref>; St. Clair, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kou and Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">McDonald and Linde, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mundt, 2014</xref>). Quantitative resistance is thought to be more durable and hence deserves more attention from breeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">McDonald and Linde, 2002</xref>; St. Clair, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mundt, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To enable breeding for quantitative resistance to STB, we need to comprehensively analyze the quantitative distribution of its associated phenotypes, which is much more difficult than phenotyping major gene resistance that typically shows a binomial distribution. This challenge was recognized more than forty years ago and a number of studies were conducted to evaluate quantitative resistance to STB under field conditions using artificial inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rosielle, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shaner and Finney, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eyal, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Miedaner et al., 2013</xref>) and natural infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rosielle, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shaner et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Miedaner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kollers et al., 2013<italic>b</italic></xref>). Resistance to STB was also investigated on detached leaves with artificial inoculations [e. g., by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chartrain et al. (2004)</xref>]. Several studies performed visual scoring of quantitative resistance only once during the growing season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rosielle, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shaner and Finney, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eyal, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Miedaner et al., 2013</xref>), while other studies included two or more time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shaner et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kollers et al., 2013<italic>b</italic></xref>). One of the most comprehensive early studies screened 7500 wheat varieties including 2000 durum wheat cultivars to select the 460 most resistant varieties for more detailed visual scoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rosielle, 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding the infection cycle of STB helps to distinguish and measure most important aspects of quantitative resistance to the disease. <italic>Z. tritici</italic> spores germinate on wheat leaves and penetrate the leaves through stomata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kema et al., 1996</xref>). After penetration, fungus grows for several days latently within leaves producing no visible symptoms. During the latent phase, <italic>Z. tritici</italic> grows in apoplast and invades host mesophyll around the position of initial penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duncan and Howard, 2000</xref>). After some ten days growth of fungus becomes necrotrophic, necrotic lesions appear in the invaded host tissue and asexual fruiting bodies, pycnidia, begin to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kema et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duncan and Howard, 2000</xref>). In dead host tissue the fungus grows saprotrophically and produces sexual fruiting bodies, pseudotechia, 25-30 days after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sanchez-Vallet et al., 2015</xref>). Whether <italic>Z. tritici</italic> is best referred to as a hemibiotroph or a latent necrotroph is ambiguous (S&#x00E1;nchez-Vallet et al., 2015). Asexual pycnidiospores are usually spread by rain splash and sexual ascospores are spread by wind. The pathogen typically undergoes up to 5-6 rounds of asexual and 1-2 rounds of sexual reproduction per growing season.</p>
<p>Incidence of STB depends on the number of spores that attempt to infect healthy leaves and the infection efficiency. Overall severity of infection depends on both of these factors and additionally on the ability of the pathogen to damage the host tissue once infected. Studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhan et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhan et al. (2000)</xref> indicate that <italic>&#x2248;</italic> 66&#x0025; of infections on flag leaves came from asexual spores, while <italic>&#x2248;</italic> 24&#x0025; came from ascospores originating from within the infected field and 10&#x0025; of infections were immigrants from surrounding fields. Pathogen asexual reproduction is thus the most important factor explaining infection on flag leaves. The amount of necrosis induced by STB on uppermost leaves determines yield losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brokenshire, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>Earlier studies of STB resitance (reviewed above) combined disease severity and incidence using visual assessments based on categorical scales. In studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rosielle (1972)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shaner et al. (1975)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eyal (1992)</xref> these scales included both the degree of lesion coverage and the density of pycnidia in lesions, but in studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brown et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chartrain et al. (2004)</xref> the disease scores were based on leaf coverage by lesions bearing pycnidia (i. e. using a presence/absence measurement of pycnidia). The accuracy of this method is limited by an inherent subjective bias and a small number of qualitative categories, which may impair success of breeding.</p>
<p>In several studies the importance of the resistance component that suppresses pathogen reproduction (production of pycnidia) was recognized based on qualitative observations of pycnidial coverage [e. g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rosielle, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shaner et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shaner and Finney, 1982</xref>)]. Manual counting of pycnidia is extremely labor-intensive, though, so it was only feasible to count pycnidia on a small scale [e. g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shaner et al., 1975</xref>)] because there was no technology available to automate this process.</p>
<p>Automated image analysis (AIA) has been used in the past for example for analysis of liver tissue (e. g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">O&#x2019;Gorman et al., 1985</xref>) and breast tissue (e. g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Phukpattaranont and Boonyaphiphat, 2007</xref>) and for analysis of land use (e. g. Dr&#x00E5;agut and Blaschke, 2006). AIA provides a promising tool for measuring quantitative disease resistance in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mahlein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Simko et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mutka and Bart (2015)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mahlein (2016)</xref> highlight importance of standardized imaging methods for reproducibility. We used a novel phenotyping method based on automated analysis of scanned leaf images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stewart and McDonald, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stewart et al., 2016</xref>) in a wheat panel planted to 335 European cultivars in a replicated field experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kirchgessner et al., 2017</xref>). The method benefits from well defined procedure of detaching leaves and scanning them in standardized conditions, thus leading to objective and reproducible results. Additionally, it enables generation of large amounts of reliable data at a relatively low cost.</p>
<p>Importantly, our method allowed us to separate quantitative resistance traits affecting host damage caused by the pathogen from resistance traits related to pathogen reproduction on a large scale and with a high accuracy. Pathogen reproduction was quantified by automatic counting of asexual fruiting bodies of the pathogen (pycnidia) on wheat leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stewart and McDonald, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stewart et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In this large-scale field experiment, leaves were infected naturally by a genetically diverse local <italic>Z. tritici</italic> population and the epidemic was allowed to develop naturally. Despite three fungicide treatments including five active ingredients that eliminated virtually all other diseases, the level of STB infection was widespread across the field experiment. This pervasive natural infection by a fungicide-resistant population allowed us to investigate quantitative resistance in a nearly pure culture of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> under field conditions. The combination of wet and cool weather conditions favoring development of STB, a large number of wheat cultivars planted in a single location, and utilization of a novel automated digital image analysis method enabled a multi-dimensional and comprehensive characterization of quantitative resistance that led to a clear ranking of STB resistance in a broad collection of European winter wheat cultivars.</p>
<p>We report separate rankings of wheat cultivars based on two different resistance components, one acting against host damage and the other acting against pathogen reproduction. We found that the two rankings are considerably different. We identified a phenotypic quantity that combines these two components and found that it correlates with the ranking based on traditional visual assesments. In this way, we identified new, broadly active sources of resistance to STB in existing European wheat cultivars. Our outcomes open several possibilities for further genetic studies of quantitative resistance to STB.</p>

<title>Plant materials and experimental design</title>
<p>A total of 335 elite European winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) varieties from the GABI-wheat panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kollers et al., 2013<italic>a</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23"><italic>b</italic></xref>) were evaluated in this experiment. Two replicates of the wheat panel were grown during the 2015&#x2013;2016 growing season in two complete blocks separated by 100 meters at the Field Phenotyping Platform site of the Eschikon Field Station of the ETH Zurich, Switzerland (coordinates 47.449683, 8.682461) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kirchgessner et al., 2017</xref>). The complete blocks represented two different lots in the FIP. Within each lot the genotypes were arranged in incomplete blocks in row and range direction and a check variety (CH Claro) was repeated at least once within each row and range. Cultivars were planted in a single 1.2m&#x00D7;1.7m plot within each lot except for cultivar CH Claro having 21 replicates within each lot. All cultivars were sown on 13 October 2015.</p>
<p>Standard agricultural practices were used including applications of fertilizers and pesticides. Fertilizers were applied five times during spring 2016, including boron with ammonium nitrate (nitrogen 52 kg/ha) on 4 March; P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> at 92 kg/ha on 7 March; K<sub>2</sub>O at 120 kg/ha on 10 March; magnesium with ammonium nitrate on 12 April (magnesium 15 kg/ha, nitrogen 72 kg/ha) and 20 May (magnesium 4 kg/ha, nitrogen 19 kg/ha). The pre-emergence herbicide Herold SC (Bayer) was applied on 29 October 2015 (dose 0.6 l/ha); stem shortener Moddus (Syngenta) was applied on 6 April 2016 [dose 0.4 l/ha, GS (growth stage) 31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zadoks et al., 1974</xref>)]. Insecticide Biscaya (Bayer) was applied on 25 May, 2016 (dose 0.3 l/ha, GS 51). Fungicides were applied three times: (i) 6 April, 2016, Input, Bayer (a mixture of the active ingredients spiroxamin at 300 g/l and prothioconazole at 150 g/l, dose 1.25 l/ha, GS 31); (ii) 25 May, Aviator Xpro, Bayer (a mixture of bixafen at 75 g/l and prothiconazole at 150 g/l, dose 1.25 l/ha, GS 51) and 6 June, Osiris, BASF (a mixture of epoxiconazole at 56.25 g/l and metconazole at 41.25g/l, dose 2.5 l/ha, GS 65). In total, the three fungicide applications included five active ingredients representing three modes of action.</p>

<title>STB inoculum and calculation of number of cycles of infection</title>
<p>All STB infection was natural, with the majority of primary inoculum likely originating from airborne ascospores coming from nearby wheat fields that surround the Eschikon field site. We estimated the number of asexual cycles of pathogen reproduction by using the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shaw (1990)</xref> showing the effect of temperature on latent period and local weather data coming from the nearby Lindau weather station (see Appendix A.1 for details of estimation).</p>

<title>Disease assessment based on automated image analysis</title>
<p>Leaves exhibiting obvious STB lesions were collected two times during the growing season. The first collection was made on 20 May 2016 (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>, approximately GS 41) and the second collection was made on 4 July 2016 (<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>, approximate GS are in the range 75-85). For both collections, 16 infected leaves were collected at random from each plot. At <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>, leaves were collected from the highest infected leaf layer, which was typically the third or fourth fully extended, but non-senescent leaf still visible when counting from the ground. At <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>, the leaf layer below the flag leaf (F-1) was sampled in each plot. The sampled leaves were placed in paper envelopes, kept on ice in the field, and stored at 4&#x00B0;C for two days before mounting on A4 paper with printed reference marks and sample names, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stewart et al., 2016</xref>). Absorbent paper was placed between each sheet of eight mounted leaves and sheets were pressed with approximately 5 kg at 4&#x00B0;C for two-three days prior to scanning at 1200 dpi with a Canon CanoScan LiDE 220 flatbed scanner. The resulting scans were saved as &#x201C;jpeg&#x201D; images.</p>
<p>Scanned images were analyzed with the software ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schindelin et al., 2015</xref>) using a specialized macro described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stewart and McDonald (2014)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stewart et al. (2016</xref>)(source code of the macro and a user manual are given in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stewart et al., 2016</xref>)). The parameters used for the macro are given in supplemental Table S1 and an explanation of their meaning is provided in the macro instructions in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stewart et al., 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the workflow associated with the macro. The maximum length of the scanned area for each leaf was 17 cm. When leaves were longer than 17 cm, bases of the leaves were placed within the scanned area, while the leaf tips extended outside the scanned area. For each leaf, the following quantities were automatically recorded from the scanned image: total leaf area, necrotic leaf area, number of pycnidia and their positions, size and gray value of each pycnidium. From these measurements, the percentage of leaf area covered by lesions (PLACL), the density of pycnidia per unit lesion area (<italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>), the density of pycnidia per unit leaf area (<italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>), the mean pycnidia gray value and the mean pycnidia sizes were calculated.</p>

<p>The three quantities PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>, and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> quantify different aspects of STB conditional severity in each plot, but did not provide overall measurements of STB incidence because only 16 leaves were measured. Although we aimed to collect only infected leaves, there were a few cases in plots with very little STB when the collected leaves did not have necrotic lesions or did not have pycnidia. These leaves were not considered when calculating the mean or median values used for ranking cultivars or assessing the magnitude of effects.</p>
<p>To confirm the outcomes of the automated image analysis, we visually examined about 1440 leaves (about 5 &#x0025; of all sampled leaves) to compare scanned leaf images with overlay images in which detected lesions and pycnidia are marked by the macro (examples of overlays are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). We included in this analysis about 1100 leaves from the 20 cultivars that exhibited the largest difference in their overall rankings with respect to PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> as well as about 140 leaves with outlier values for <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and mean pycnidial area.</p>
<p>For each leaf subjected to visual inspection, we determined whether the macro correctly detected lesions and pycnidia. In cases with errors, we determined the cause of the error. Errors that led to incorrect quantification of disease symptoms could be divided into four categories: defects on leaves, collector bias, scanning errors and deficiencies in the image analysis software (the macro). Leaf defects included insect damage, mechanical damage, insect bodies and frass, other fungi, uneven leaf surfaces creating shadows, and dust particles on leaves. We identified several cases of biased leaf collection at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>, where leaves were sampled from lower leaf layers in which most of the leaf surface exhibited natural senescence, leading to extensive chlorosis and some necrosis. (Data from 20 plots in collection <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> was removed due to strong collector bias during the initial quality control after collection). Scanning errors included shadows on leaf edges and folded leaves. Deficiencies of the macro consisted of recognizing green parts of leaves as lesions, dark spaces between light-colored leaf hairs and parts of dark borders around lesions as pycnidia. In total, 336 leaves were deemed to exhibit scoring errors and removed from the dataset as a result of this procedure.</p>
<p>We estimated the total proportion of scoring errors as <italic>p</italic><sub>tot</sub> = 0.15 <italic>&#x00B1;</italic> 0.05 by careful visual examination <italic>n</italic> = 200 leaves which were chosen randomly with replacement from the entire sample of 21551 leaves. The proportion of scoring errors due to collector bias was estimated as <italic>p</italic><sub>cb</sub> = 0.055 <italic>&#x00B1;</italic> 0.003. Here, the uncertainties are reported in the form of the 95 &#x0025; confidence intervals calculated according to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="129353_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <italic>p</italic> is the sample proportion and <italic>n</italic> is the sample size.</p>

<title>Disease assessment based on visual scoring</title>
<p>Visual assessments of STB were performed at three time points: 20 May (approximately GS 41), 21 June (approximately GS 75) and 29 June (approximately GS 80). STB level in each plot was scored on the three uppermost leaf layers on a 1-9 scale (1 means no disease, 9 means complete infection) based on both STB incidence and severity. The presence of pycnidia was used as an indicator of STB infection. The absence of pycnidia was interpreted as an absence of STB, even if necrotic lesions were visible. During visual scoring, the presence of other diseases (such as stripe rust, septoria nodorum bloth and fusarium head blight) was assessed qualitatively. All plots were scored with approximately equal time spent on each plot.</p>

<sec id="s1e">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We compared differences in STB resistance among cultivars for each dataset by pooling together the data points from individual leaves belonging to different replicates and sampling dates. The data from the automated image analysis consisted of <italic>&#x2248;</italic> 60 data points per cultivar representing the two time points and two biological replicates. The visual scoring data was based on three time points and two biological replicates generating <italic>&#x2248;</italic> 6 data points per cultivar. Cultivar CH Claro was an exception because it was replicated 42 times and thus had <italic>&#x2248;</italic> 1300 data points from leaf image analysis and 120 data points from visual scoring. The relative STB resistance of all wheat cultivars was ranked based on means of PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> over <italic>&#x2248;</italic> 60 individual leaf data points. We also calculated medians and standard errors of means for each cultivar.</p>
<p>For each cultivar the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated by taking averages of visual scores over the two replicates. It was assumed that infection started from zero at 14 days before the first assessment. To analyze differences between cultivars these scores were weighted with coefficients that depend on times of assessments such that each weighted score gives a proportional contribution to the total AUDPC and the average over scores from different replicates and time points gives the total AUDPC (see Appendix A.2 for details on calculation of AUDPC and weighting of scores). AUDPC was used to rank cultivars according to visual scoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>The significance of differences in resistance between cultivars was tested with the global Kruskal-Wallis test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sokal and Rohlf, 2012</xref>) using kruskal.test function in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">R Core Team, 2016</xref>) on each data set. For resistance measures showing global differences between cultivars, we determined significantly different groups of cultivars based on pairwise comparisons, so that any two cultivars in the same group are not significantly different from each other and any two cultivars from different groups are different. Pairwise differences were tested with multiple pairwise Kruskal-Wallis tests using the function kruskal in the package agricolae in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">de Mendiburu, 2016</xref>) using the false discovery rate (FDR) 0.05 for significance level correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>We determined correlations between cultivar rankings based on AUDPC and both means and medians of PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> for each cultivar. We also computed correlations with respect to means of PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> between <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> to determine the predictive power of these quantities. In this case, means were taken over about 16 leaves originating from the same plot. All correlations were calculated with the help of Spearman&#x2019;s correlation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sokal and Rohlf, 2012</xref>) using the open-source scipy package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scipy.org">http://www.scipy.org</ext-link>) written for the Python programming language (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>We analyzed differences between <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> in terms of PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> to identify cultivars whose resistance increased over time. For this purpose, we used the Wilcoxon rank sum test with the FDR correction for multiple comparisons (<italic>p &#x003C;</italic> 0.01).</p>

<title>Overall description of the STB epidemic</title>
<p>Despite three fungicide applications with five active ingredients and three modes of action, we observed widespread STB in nearly all of the experimental plots. There were obvious differences in overall levels of STB infection on different cultivars. Comparison of overall levels of STB disease with nearby untreated plots showed that the fungicides significantly suppressed STB development. STB was the dominating disease in the fungicide-treated plots; other leaf diseases were present at very low levels as a result of the fungicide treatments. Hence this experiment provided an unusual opportunity to assess quantitative STB resistance to a natural infection and under field conditions in the absence of competing wheat diseases.</p>
<p>According to weather data collected from the Lindau weather station located about 200 m away from the field site, the weather in spring-summer 2016 was cool and rainy, highly conducive to development of STB (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA_2">Fig. A2</xref> in Appendix A.1). Average daily temperature between 1 March and 27 July was 12.5<sup><italic>o</italic></sup> C and the total amount of rainfall was 1245 mm. Based on daily temperature and rainfall data, we estimated the number of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> asexual generations over the growing season as six. Between the two sampling dates <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>, we estimated two asexual generations (see Appendix A.1 for details of estimation).</p>

<title>An overview of the dataset</title>
<p>A total of 21214 leaves were included in the automated analysis pipeline, with an average of 30 leaves per plot. The total leaf area analyzed was 36.9 m<sup>2</sup> of which 11.2 m<sup>2</sup> was recognized as damaged by STB. The mean analyzed area of an individual leaf was 17 cm<sup>2</sup>. In total 5.1 million pycnidia were counted and analyzed for size and gray value. The mean number of pycnidia within a leaf was 243. A more detailed description of the overall dataset is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. The full dataset can be accessed from xxx. Correlations between the two biological replicates ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA_3">Fig. A3</xref>, see Appendix A.3 for more details).</p>

The distributions of PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> were non-normal and had outliers. All of these distributions were continuous, consistent with previous studies that hypothesized that the majority of STB resistance in wheat is quantitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stewart et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>For the visual assessments conducted across two replicates and three time points, the lowest score was 1 and the highest score was 4 (on a 1-9 scale). The lowest value of the AUDPC was 81, the highest value was 154 and the average AUDPC across all cultivars was 103.</p>
<p>The visual assessment found that yellow rust was present in about 1 &#x0025; of plots on 20 May and in about 2 &#x0025; of plots on 21 June, 2016; Septoria nodorum blotch was present in only a single plot on 21 June, 2016 (about 0.1 &#x0025; of plots); Fusarium head blight was present in about 2 &#x0025; of plots only on 21 June, 2016.</p>

<title>Host damage vs. pathogen reproduction</title>
<p>From the raw data obtained via automated analysis of scanned leaves, we derived three quantitative resistance measures: PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>. PLACL is defined as the necrotic leaf area divided by the total leaf area, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> is the total number of pycnidia divided by the necrotic leaf area and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> is the total number of pycnidia divided by the total leaf area. <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> can also be calculated from the first two factors as
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="129353_eqn1.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>PLACL characterizes host damage due to pathogen while <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> characterizes pathogen reproduction on the necrotic leaf tissue. <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> is the product of these two quantities, combining both host damage and pathogen reproduction. Independent identification of these three quantities from the raw leaf data allowed us to differentiate between host damage and pathogen reproduction, and also to combine these two factors into the most integrative measure of disease severity. In this way, we gained a comprehensive insight into different components of disease severity. Next, we rank wheat cultivars with respect to each of these three quantities.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Ranking of cultivars</title>
<p>Resistance ranking of the cultivars was based on the three measures obtained from automated image analysis (PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>) and the AUDPC calculated from visual scoring. For PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>, the distributions differed significantly between cultivars. For each of these three measures, the null hypothesis of identical distributions for all cultivars was rejected by a Kruskal-Wallis global comparison with <italic>p &#x003C;</italic> 2.2 10<sup><italic>-</italic>16</sup>. However, the global Kruskal-Wallis test did not reveal differences between distributions of the weighted visual scores (<italic>p</italic> = 1). Kruskal-Wallis multiple pairwise comparisons identified three significantly different groups of cultivars for both PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and four significantly different groups of cultivars for <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Supplemental File S3 shows that mean ranks are highly correlated with the means and medians, indicating that in the majority of cases significantly different cultivars also have different means and medians.</p>
<p>There were notable changes between resistance rankings based on PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> (black lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Several of the thirty least resistant cultivars based on host damage were ranked among the most resistant cultivars based on pathogen reproduction. Similarly, some of the most resistant cultivars based on host damage were among the least resistant cultivars based on pathogen reproduction. For example cultivar Vanilnoir showed high PLACL and low <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> whereas cultivar Rubens exhibited the opposite pattern. Visual examination of leaves belonging to cultivars that exhibited the largest difference in their ranking between PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> confirmed qualitatively the presence of the effect. We observed high degree of necrosis and low numbers of pycnidia in cultivars that ranked high in terms of PLACL and low in terms of <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>. We also confirmed that cultivars that ranked high in terms of <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and low in terms of PLACL had on average a low degree of necrosis and high numbers of pycnidia. These qualitative observations represent a general quantitative pattern, as indicated by relatively low correlations between PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> with respect to means (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = <italic>-</italic>0.1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.059, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>) and medians (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0007, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>) taken over leaves belonging to the same cultivar. On the contrary, the correlation between PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> was negative and highly significant when calculated based on individual leaf data pooled together (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.1, <italic>p</italic> = 1.9 10<sup><italic>-</italic>53</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2H</xref>).

<p>Automated measures of quantitative STB resistance correlate strongly with the traditional measurement based on AUDPC of visual scores.

Correlations between AUDPC and means were somewhat weaker but also significant. The strongest correlation was between the combined measure <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> and the AUDPC (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, means: <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0.6, medians: <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0.54).

<title>Novel aspects of the experimental design</title>
<p>Although fungicides suppressed STB development as compared to untreated plots, the most important benefit of the fungicide applications in the context of this experiment was to eliminate competing diseases (rusts, powdery mildews, tan spot) that usually co-exist with STB in naturally infected fields. This resulted in a nearly pure culture of STB across both replications. Virtually every disease lesion found on a leaf was shown to be the result of an infection by <italic>Z. tritici</italic>. The widespread STB infection found in this experiment could be explained by the weather during the 2015-2016 growing season that was highly conducive to development of STB (cool and wet) coupled with a significant amount of resistance to azoles in European populations of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brunner et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This experimental design provided an unusual opportunity to directly compare levels and development of STB infection and STB resistance across a broad cross-section of elite European winter wheat cultivars. Combined with the novel automated image analysis method, this allowed us to collect a large amount of high-quality data with a relatively low workload.</p>
<p>The measures of resistance that we characterized here, on average, represent &#x201C;general&#x201D; or &#x201C;field&#x201D; resistance because the experiment was conducted using natural infection in a year that was highly conducive to STB. Cultivars that were highly resistant under these conditions are likely to be broadly resistant to the typically genetically diverse <italic>Z. tritici</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Linde et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhan et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison between datasets obtained from automated image analysis and visual scoring</title>
<p>Conventional visual assessment typically quantifies leaf necrosis (host damage) caused by the pathogen by integrating disease severity (as PLACL) and incidence (as the proportion of leaves having necrotic lesions) into a single index. Pycnidia (an indicator of pathogen reproduction) are typically considered as a presence/absence qualitative trait that helps to separate STB from other leaf diseases. The conventional visual assessment is fast: only about nine hours in total were needed to assess more than 700 small plots three times during the season by a single person (i. e., about three hours at each measurement date).</p>
<p>Visual scoring benefits from a large sample size, as almost all leaves in a plot are considered compared to only 16 leaves used for image analysis. However, due to a subjective nature of the conventional scoring process, the sample size used is not clearly defined and we could not obtain statistically significant differences between cultivars based on visual scoring. Moreover, assessment of changes in traits between two timepoints is almost impossible. Uncertainty in detection of pycnidia in the conventional measurement may even lead to misestimation of resistance. Overestimation may result on cultivars that are susceptible to host damage (have high PLACL) but suppress pathogen reproduction (have low <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>), because failure to detect pycnidia may be interpreted as absence of the pathogen. On the other hand, if visual assessment finds pycnidia (scored as present or absent), the resistance of a cultivar may be underestimated if the degree of suppression of pycnidia production is not considered.</p>
<p>In contrast, automated analysis of individual leaves enables independent measurement of different forms of disease conditional severity, i.e. the degree to which infected leaves are affected by disease. The advantage of the automated method based on leaf images is that it accounts for both host damage and pathogen reproduction in a reproducible, quantitative way with a well-defined sample size. This alleviates the uncertainty in detecting pycnidia and also allowed us to find statistically significant differences between cultivars. But this method does not consider disease incidence and is more laborintensive than visual scoring. About 360 person-hours were needed to collect and process 21551 leaves and obtain raw data. Although this is an automated method, one needs to carefully determine its error rate at every use (as for example we described above in the &#x201C;Materials and Methods&#x201D; section), because errors may be cultivar-specific and also depend on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Manual generation of this large dataset that included more than five million pycnidia would not be practical. However, we demonstrated that combining cheap scanners with public domain software to conduct automatic image analysis makes it feasible to separate different components of quantitative host resistance.</p>

<title>Host damage vs. pathogen reproduction</title>
<p>Biologically, PLACL reflects the pathogen&#x2019;s ability to invade and damage (necrotize) the host leaf tissue, while <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> reflects the pathogen&#x2019;s ability to convert the damaged host tissue into reproductive structures and eventually into offspring. From the host&#x2019;s perspective, PLACL can be interpreted as the degree of susceptibility to damage caused by the pathogen itself (e. g., through secretion of phytotoxins) or by host defense reactions (e. g., the hypersensitive response) activated after detecting the pathogen. <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> can be interpreted as measuring the host&#x2019;s ability to suppress pathogen reproduction, a more susceptible host enables more pathogen reproduction per unit of infected leaf area. Automated image analysis enabled us to differentiate between host damage and pathogen reproduction and hence to measure these as separate components of STB resistance.</p>
<p>The phenotypic differences observed in our experiment may reflect different sets of resistance genes underlying these two traits. We hypothesize that PLACL reflects additive actions of toxin sensitivity genes carried by different wheat cultivars that interact with host-specific toxins produced by the pathogen, as shown for Parastagonospora nodorum on wheat (e. g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Friesen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Oliver et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesize that pycnidia density reflects additive actions of quantitative resistance genes that recognize pathogen effectors (e.g. AvrStb6 recognized by Stb6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhong et al. (2017</xref>, in press)) and activate plant defenses in a quantitative way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Krattinger et al., 2009</xref>). We anticipate testing these hypotheses by combining the phenotypic data reported here with wheat genome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marcussen et al., 2014</xref>) to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) aiming to identify chromosomal regions and candidate genes underlying both components of quantitative resistance.</p>
<p>The density of pycnidia per unit leaf area, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>, is a measure of infection that incorporates both host damage and pathogen reproduction, reflecting the pathogen&#x2019;s overall ability to convert healthy host tissue into reproductive units that can drive a new cycle of infection. The complex nature of quantitative host-pathogen interactions may lead to high PLACL combined with low <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> or low PLACL combined with high <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>. In both of these cases, the infection is less severe than when an interaction leads to a high <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>. Therefore, we believe that <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> better characterizes overall host resistance, pathogen fitness and STB severity than PLACL or <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>.</p>

<title>Ranking of cultivars</title>
<p>The overall differences among cultivars were relatively small, except for a small number of cultivars at each extreme. These small differences are reflected in the limited number of significantly different groups of cultivars. However, our analyses showed that ranking of cultivars differs considerably with respect to the two components of quantitative resistance: resistance to host damage and resistance to pathogen reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). More specifically, we identified cultivars that strongly exhibit one component, while the other component is virtually absent (points in upperleft and lower-right corners of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>). We expect that resistance that lowers pycnidia production will have greater overall impact on reducing damaging STB epidemics because it will reduce the rate of epidemic increase more than resistance to host damage. Conventional phenotyping technology based on visual assessment does not enable separation of these different components of resistance.</p>
<p>We expected that conventional visual assessment (based on AUDPC) would correlate best with the measurement of host damage (PLACL), as conventional assessment consists mainly of quantifying leaf necrosis, but uses pycnidia mainly qualitatively to confirm the presence of STB. Surprisingly, the measure that combines host damage and pathogen reproduction (<italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>) gave the best correlation with the conventional assessment (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE2_3">E2.3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE2_4">E2.4</xref>). A possible explanation for this high correlation is that the conventional assessment may actually quantify pycnidia, but in a subjective way. An alternative explanation is that because conventional assessment includes both disease severity and incidence, it captures the overall pathogen population size that depends on both host damage and pathogen reproduction.</p>
<p>Correlation between our combined measure (<italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>) and the conventional measure (AUDPC) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> indicates that breeding may have selected for cultivars that combine resistance to host damage and resistance to pathogen reproduction. This hypothesis is supported by the small but significant positive correlations between PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> in terms of both means and medians over individual cultivars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the same two quantities, PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> show a negative correlation when analyzed at the level of individual leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Comparisons of means/medians based on many leaves from the same cultivar shows the effect of the cultivar on the relationship between PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>. (See Appendix A.4 for discussion on the use of means vs. medians in the analysis). Comparisons based on individual leaves take into account both the cultivar effect and the pathogen effect on each leaf. The negative correlation in the individual leaf data may indicate a pathogen-level tradeoff between PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>. This tradeoff may have a genetic basis as an epistatic interaction between the two components of quantitative resistance described above. It may also reflect a resource allocation tradeoff between invasion of host tissue and production of pycnidia. <italic>Z. tritici</italic> isolates sampled from the two extremes of the hypothetical tradeoff could be used for phenotypic confirmation of strain specific PLACL-<italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>-relationship as well as for identification of the genetic basis of these traits. To detect strain-specific differences in PLACL between different pathogen strains in a greenhouse experiment, concentration of spores in the inoculum will need to be lower than typically used (to insure that PLACL is lower than 100 &#x0025;).</p>

<title>Predictors of epidemic development</title>
<p>PLACL on upper leaves is a key determinant of disease-induced yield loss (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brokenshire, 1976</xref>). Hence, the ability to predict PLACL on the upper leaves late in the growing season based on an early season measurement may improve disease control. Our results suggest this possibility: the measure that quantifies pathogen reproduction, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>, evaluated early in the season (at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>, approximately GS 41) predicts the late-season host damage (PLACL at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>, approximately GS 75-85) better than early-season PLACL or <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, compare panel B with panels A and C). We postulate that this finding could improve decision-making for fungicide application: one may decide to apply fungicides only if <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> exceeds a certain threshold early in the season.</p>

<title>Increase of resistance to STB between <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub></title>
<p>Negative changes with respect to quantities characterizing host susceptibility (PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>, and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>) suggest an increase in host resistance over time. We found that none of the cultivars exhibited this property in terms of both PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>. Accordingly, none of them showed a significant decrease only in the combined measure, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>, and not in any other measure. This may indicate that the genetic basis of the late-onset resistance differs between host damage and pathogen reproduction. These outcomes may help to reveal the genetic basis of &#x201C;late-onset&#x201D; resistance to STB (e.g. using GWAS or QTL mapping).</p>
<p>The degree of resistance or the intensity of a development can only be assessed from multiple, quantitative measurements at subsequent points in time. Such dynamically developing traits require an objective evaluation and cannot be assessed by visual grading. This is one of the most important advantages of imaging-based phenotyping methods compared to classical grading-based phenotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Walter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kirchgessner et al., 2017</xref>)</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We utilized a novel phenotyping technology based on automated analysis of digital leaf images to compare quantitative resistance to STB in 335 European wheat cultivars naturally infected by a highly variable local population of <italic>Z. tritici</italic>. This method allowed us to distinguish between resistance components affecting host damage (PLACL) and resistance components affecting pathogen reproduction (lesion pycnidia density and pycnidia size). Measurements of pycnidia density cannot be accomplished on such a large scale with traditional assessment methods and may provide a new and powerful tool for measuring quantitative resistance to STB.</p>
<p>To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive characterisation of the two components of resistance separately. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Simko et al. (2017)</xref>, digital phenotyping reduces subjectivity in trait quantification. Thus the present method may reveal small differences that wouldn&#x2019;t be observed without. Development of the method could involve adjustment of the analysis parameters to be suitable for each cultivar separately, machine learning for more precise detection of symptoms and combining it with incidence data gathered for example by image analysis of high-quality canopy images such as produced by the phenomobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Deery et al., 2014</xref>) or the ETH field phenotyping platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kirchgessner et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Outlook</title>
<p>Our approach can be readily applied to classical phenotype-based selection and breeding. Cultivars that show high resistance to both host damage and pathogen reproduction will be most likely to strongly suppress the pathogen population at the field level and result in less overall damage due to STB. Importantly, cultivars that show the highest resistance based on either host damage or pathogen reproduction can be used in breeding programs as independent sources of these two components of resistance. An important novelty of our approach is provide a powerful method to specifically breed wheat cultivars carrying resistance that suppresses pathogen reproduction.</p>
<p>While the ability to separate phenotypes associated with two different aspects of resistance provides new avenues for resistance breeding, our hypothesis that the two components of resistance are under separate genetic control remains to be confirmed by further research. We anticipate that future genetic studies (e.g. using GWAS) based on these phenotypic data will enable us to identify genetic markers that are linked to the different types of resistance. These markers could then enable joint selection of the different forms of resistance via marker-assisted breeding or in a genomic selection pipeline. If we can validate our hypothesis that toxin sensitivity genes underlie differences in PLACL among cultivars, the breeding objective would be to remove these sensitivity genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Friesen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Oliver et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Estimation of the number of pathogen generations</title>
<p>We estimated the number of asexual cycles of pathogen reproduction (number of generations) using data on the dependency of the latent period of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> on temperature [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shaw, 1990</xref>)]. We are interested in the overall relationship between the latent period and the temperature and would like to use the largest amount of data available. For this reason, we pooled together the data available for two cultivars, Avalon and Longbow, recorded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shaw (1990)</xref>. Next, we fitted the polynomial function
<disp-formula id="eqnA1">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="129353_eqnA1.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula>
to the resulting data. Here, &#x0394;<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> is the latent period, is the temperature, <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are fitting parameters. The outcome is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA_1">Fig. A1</xref>. Best-fit values of parameters are:

<p>Uncertainties in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA2">Eq. A.2</xref> represent the 95 &#x0025; confidence intervals calculated from standard errors. Goodness of fit: <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.7; standard error of regression <italic>s</italic> = 5.5&#x00D7;10<sup><italic>-</italic>3</sup>.</p>
<p>We then used average daily temperatures and amount of rainfall measured at the Lindau weather station located close to our experimental site to estimate the number of pathogen generations, <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>. We performed estimation of <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> per growing season (from March 1 until July 27) and between two sampling dates (from May 1 until July 4). First, we determined the average latent period from the daily temperature averaged over the growing season using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA1">Eq. A.1</xref> with the parameter values <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA2">Eq. A.2</xref>. This resulted in the value &#x0394;<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> = 21 days. After that we introduced a constraint on the number of pathogen generations using the rainfall data. According to our current understanding, rainfall is the most efficient way to release and disperse the asexual pycnidiospores. For this reason, we assumed that a cycle of asexual reproduction could only be completed after a day with at least 5 mm rainfall [similar to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhan et al., 2002</xref>)]. In this way we estimated an average of about six cycles of asexual reproduction during the growing season and about two cycles between the two sampling dates <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA_2">Fig. A2</xref>).</p>

<title>Calculation of AUDPC based on visual assessments</title>
<p>We denote the values of visual scores recorded on the first, <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>1</sub>, second, <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>2</sub> and third, <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>3</sub>, dates (20th of May, 21th of June and 29th of June, 2016) of visual assessments as <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>3</sub>. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated for each cultivar using the visual scores in the following manner:
<disp-formula id="eqnA3">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="129353_eqnA3.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>1</sub> = 14 days, <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>2</sub> = 44 days, <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>3</sub> = 52 days. Here, we assumed that disease started from zero 14 days before the first scoring, values of <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>3</sub> are taken as average scores over two replicate plots. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA3">Eq. A.3</xref> uses a trapezoidal function to interpolate between the time points in order to calculate the area under the curve. This assumes that score values are connected by linear segments. Values of AUPDC are shown for each cultivar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref> of the main text.</p>
<p>To analyze differences between cultivars, we weighted scores <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>3</sub> in the following manner: <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub> = 3<italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>/</italic>2, <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub> = 3(<italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>3</sub> <italic>-&#x03C4;</italic><sub>1</sub>)<italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>/</italic>2, <italic>a</italic><sub>3</sub> = 3(<italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>3</sub> <italic>-&#x03C4;</italic><sub>2</sub>)<italic>A</italic><sub>3</sub><italic>/</italic>2. The coefficients were chosen such that weighted scores <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>a</italic><sub>3</sub> give proportionate contribution to the AUDPC and the arithmetic average over them gives the AUDPC. The weighted scores from each replicate and each time point were given as a set of points corresponding to each cultivars (total of six measurement points per cultivar). One score was missing for one of the replicates in several cultivars. For these cultivars, we used only five measurement points for statistical analysis. We also calculated grand means over raw (not weighted) visual scores for each cultivar by taking arithmetic means over measurements in two replicates and three time points (six measurement points). Similarly to the case of weighted scores, when scores were missing in one of replicates at one of time points, we calculated arithmetic means over the five values that were present.</p>
<p>Statistical differences between cultivars based on visual scoring could, in principle, be tested with a similar manner as based on image analysis data. We tested differences between distributions based on weighted visual scores of cultivars. The global KruskalWallis test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">R Core Team, 2016</xref>) revealed no differences (Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 194.39, df = 335, <italic>p</italic> = 1). Surprisingly, when using unweighted visual scores there were differences between cultivars (Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 642.4, df = 335, <italic>p &#x003C;</italic> 2.2 10<sup><italic>-</italic>16</sup>). Pairwise multiple comparison with a false discovery rate p-value correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) found out that the 23 most susceptible cultivars were different from the most resistant and the 155 most resistant cultivars were different from the most susceptible. However, there were 158 cultivars that were not significantly different from either extreme. The slight but significant difference between unweighted and weighted data may arise from the short time interval between <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub>3</sub>. Thus cultivars cannot be distinguished by weighted scores, as the last scoring time, resulting likely in the greatest differences between visual scorings of cultivars, had the smallest effect on AUDPC and consequently differences arising from latest scores are suppressed.</p>
<p>Despite differences between statistical properties of unweighted and weighted data, the ranking based on them is pretty similar: Spearman&#x2019;s correlation between mean ranks of unweighted and weighted scores of cultivars is high (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0.97, <italic>p &#x003C;</italic> 2.2 10<sup><italic>-</italic>16</sup>). Also Spearman&#x2019;s correlations between AUDPC, mean rank of unweighted scores and arithmetic mean of unweighted scores are high (AUDPC vs. mean ranks: <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0.97; AUDPC vs. means: <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0.97; mean ranks vs means <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0.998; <italic>p &#x003C;</italic> 2.2 10<sup><italic>-</italic>16</sup> for each).</p>

<title>Correlation between replicates</title>
<p>Correlations between the biological replicates ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA_3">Fig. A3</xref>). The highest correlation between the two replicates was found in pycnidia grey value at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>. The lowest correlation was in PLACL at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>. PLACL showed the largest difference in correlation coefficients between replicates. The exceptionally low correlation between replicates at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> for PLACL and necrotic area may have arisen from making the collection at a critical point in the epidemic: if the last infection cycle had been just entering the necrotic phase (as suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA_2">Fig. A2</xref>), there could have been huge variation between replicates by chance due to the highly variable length of the latent period for STB infection.</p>
<p>Spearman&#x2019;s correlation describes linear relationship between rankings based on the two replicates. Moderate but highly significant correlations between replicates for each measure imply that resistance rankings based on these measures may differ considerably between replicates. We expect this to result from the shape of the quantitative resistance distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and 3 of the main text). For all three main measures of resistance, PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>, means of the measure are quite similar for all cultivars except a small number of cultivars at the phenotype extremes. Thus even a little variation in these measures between replicates may result in a large change in ranking of the cultivar for one replicate to other. This is also implied by the small statistical differences between cultivars in the middle of the distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and 3 of the main text).</p>

<title>The use of means vs. medians in the analysis of STB resistance</title>
<p>As our data was clearly non-normal, the central tendency of the data may be better described by medians than means. Comparing medians is also biologically reasonable: total yield is more likely determined by a large number of moderately damaged wheat plants, than by the few fully diseased or dead plants. We also found stronger correlation between AUDPC and medians of PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> than AUDPC and means of PLACL and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>. Nevertheless, when comparing AUDPC and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> we found stronger correlation between AUDPC and means of <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> than medians. This may indicate that mean values better describe the way breeders traditionally assessed diseases caused by necrotrophs. If this insight proves true, it may help us understand and counteract the subjective nature of visual assessment with its tendency to overweight fully diseased plants and overestimate the overall severity.</p>

<title>Predictors of epidemic development: separating effects of cultivar and pathogen</title>
<p>In the section &#x201C;Predictors of epidemic development&#x201D; of the main text, we presented correlations between two time points for PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> of the main text). These correlations were based on means over leaves belonging to each individual plot (with two plots per cultivar). Here, we disentangle two factors that may be responsible for the observed correlations. First is the effect of the host. In this case, the correlation is explained by differences between cultivars that remain constant over the two time points. For example, when cultivars that are susceptible early in the season (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>) remain susceptible late in the season (<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>). Second, is the effect of pathogen. In this case, correlations may arise due to the highly local progression of epidemics characteristic of splash-dispersed pathogens or other cultivar-independent factors. For example, plots that had more disease early in the season would also have more disease late in the season. In other words, when considering the effect of pathogen, we investigate how well differences between plots (of the same cultivar, but located in separate lots) early in the season correlate with differences late in the season. These differences between plots may arise due to different amount of local inoculum or due to different local microenvironmental conditions. We note that genotype-environment interactions may contribute to both of these effects, but for simplicity we will refer to the two effects as &#x201C;host effect&#x201D; and &#x201C;pathogen effect&#x201D;. To separate the two effects, we performed a more detailed analysis of the correlation.</p>
<p>To determine the effect of host, instead of using two values per cultivar that correspond to two replicate plots (as we did in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> of the main text), we used the average of these two values for each cultivar (by averaging over about 32 leaves belonging to each cultivar at each time point, with the exception of cultivar CH Claro that had about 670 leaves per time point). We then determined correlations between these average values in <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and in <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>. The resulting correlations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_1">Fig. E4.1</xref> and in columns &#x201C;cv&#x201D; of the Table E4.1. The highest correlation is observed between <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> The best predictor for late-season PLACL is <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>.</p>
<p>To determine the effect of pathogen, we normalized means over each plot in the following way. At each time point, we subtracted from each mean over plot (averaged over maximum 16 leaves) a grand mean over both plots (averaged over maximum 32 leaves) that belong to the same cultivar and time point. To balance the dominating effect of cultivar CH Claro, we used only two data points for it so that each point represents the difference between the mean over all 21 plots of CH Claro in one lot and the grand mean over 42 plots from both lots. The resulting correlations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_2">Fig. E4.2</xref> and in columns &#x201C;normed&#x201D; in Table E4.1. The highest correlation is observed between PLACL at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> The best predictor for late-season PLACL is <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>.</p>
<p>Correlations corresponding to the effect of host with respect to the same measure (PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub>, or <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>) reveal the degree to which cultivars keep their ranking according to this particular measure between <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> (see diagonal panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_1">Fig. E4.1</xref>). In these cases, correlation coefficients quantify the degree of consistency between <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> of host resistance to PLACL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_1">Fig. E4.1A</xref>), <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_1">Fig. E4.1E</xref>) and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_1">Fig. E4.1H</xref>). As we see from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_1">Fig. E4.1A</xref>, PLACL at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> has no significant correlation to PLACL at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>. Hence, we cannot predict differences in host damage between two cultivars late in the season based on differences in host damage early in the season. Such prediction is more likely to be achieved if we considered differences between one of the most susceptible and one of the most resistant cultivars. However, when we take into account all cultivars, on average there is no significant correlation. In contrast, the correlation between <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> is moderately strong and highly significant (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.4). We conclude that differences between cultivars according to <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> are more consistent than differences according to PLACL.</p>
<p>Correlations corresponding to the effect of pathogen reveal the degree to which plots of the same cultivar keep their ranking between <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>. In contrast to the &#x201C;host effect&#x201D; described above, PLACL at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> has a significant slightly negative correlation to PLACL at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> with respect to &#x201C;pathogen effect&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_2">Fig. E4.2A</xref>). <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> exhibit a moderate correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_2">Fig. E4.2I</xref>). Hence, differences between plots of the same cultivar are more consistent between <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> with respect to <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> than with respect to PLACL.</p>
<p>To determine their relative contributions to the overall correlations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> of the main text, we compare contributions of &#x201C;host effect&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_1">Fig. E4.1</xref>) and &#x201C;pathogen effect&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_2">Fig. E4.2</xref>). Correlation between PLACL at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> due to &#x201C;pathogen effect&#x201D; is positive and significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_2">Fig. E4.2D</xref>), while the same correlation due to cultivar effect is not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_1">Fig. E4.1D</xref>). Hence, we conclude that the overall positive relationship between PLACL <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref> of the main text) is caused mainly by &#x201C;pathogen effect&#x201D;. In contrast, there is no significant relationship between <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub> at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> due to pathogen effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_2">Fig. E4.2G</xref>), but there is a strong positive correlation due to &#x201C;host effect&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4_1">Fig. E4.1G</xref>). This indicates that the overall positive correlation arises due to &#x201C;host effect&#x201D;. Interestingly, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> exhibits a moderate positive correlation between <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> due to &#x201C;cultivar effect&#x201D; but a negative correlation due to &#x201C;pathogen effect&#x201D;. Reason for that phenomenon remains an open question.</p>
<p>Since cultivar CH Claro was replicated more than any other cultivar (a total of 42 plots), we analyzed it separately to see if the &#x201C;pathogen effect&#x201D; discussed above is visible in data from one cultivar. However, Spearman&#x2019;s correlation test did not show any significant correlation with respect to means over each of 42 plots between <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> for any combination of the three quantities (PLACL, <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>lesion</sub> and <italic>&#x03C1;</italic><sub>leaf</sub>).</p>
<p>Thus, separating the &#x201C;host effect&#x201D; and &#x201C;pathogen effect&#x201D; allowed us to gain insight into the source of the correlations over time between different measures of host resistance and to better assess their predictive power. Although this analysis did not reveal extremely strong correlations, we expect, that disease forecasting models could benefit from having pathogen reproduction, not only host damage, as an explanatory variable. Combine with incidence measurements, the method presented allows for detailed quantification of pathogen population and its reproductive potential.</p>
