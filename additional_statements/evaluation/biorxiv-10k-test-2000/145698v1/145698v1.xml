<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The visualization of endogenous proteins in living cells is a major challenge. A fundamental requirement for spatiotemporally precise imaging is a minimal disturbance of protein function at high signal-to-background ratio. Current approaches for visualization of native proteins in living cells are limited by dark emitting, bulky fluorescent proteins and uncontrollable expression levels. Here, we demonstrate the labeling of endogenous proteins using nanobodies with site-specifically engineered bright organic fluorophores, named fluorobodies. Their fast and fine-tuned intracellular transfer by microfluidic cell squeezing allowed for low background, low toxicity, and high-throughput. Multiplexed imaging of distinct cellular structures was facilitated by specific protein targeting, culminating in live-cell super-resolution imaging of protein networks. The high-throughput delivery of engineered nanobodies will open new avenues in visualizing native cellular structures with unprecedented accuracy in cell-based screens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The localization of endogenous proteins in native settings is fundamental for quantitative spatiotemporal understanding of cellular homeostasis and dysfunction. Here, live-cell imaging is highly desired to visualize timely-balanced protein networks, avoiding contingent artifacts by fixation or permeabilization procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> In this regard, genetic fusion of fluorescent proteins (FPs) enabled the visualization of proteins of interest (POIs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> However, the fusion to FPs or other bulky enzyme-based tags (<italic>e.g.</italic> SNAP<sub>f</sub> tag)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> can provoke protein misassembly, mistargeting, and overexpression artifacts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Alternatively, antibodies and recombinant binders are prominent tools to trace proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Yet, targeting with conventional antibodies is limited to fixed cells since their disulfide bonds are reduced in the cytosol. To overcome this downside, antibody fragments have been developed for protein targeting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> For in-cell labeling of endogenous proteins, the binder must fulfill several demands: high affinity and specificity to its target, long-term stability in the reducing milieu of the cytosol, and small size avoiding interference with the POI&#x2019;s function. In this light, the variable domains of heavy-chain only antibodies (V<sub>H</sub>Hs) of camelids, named nanobodies, are prime candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> They bind with nanomolar or even picomolar affinities to their targets, are very small in size (&#x007E; 13 kDa), exhibit great solubility, and can be functionally produced in the reducing cytosolic milieu of mammalian cells. Nanobodies fused to fluorescent proteins (chromobodies) have been used to trace various POIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Recently, a chromobody has been developed for actin labeling in the cytosol and nucleus of mammalian cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> surpassing common techniques such as LifeAct by minimizing interference with actin dynamics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Nonetheless, visualization of intracellular proteins is still impeded because fused FPs triple the size of the nanobody and FPs entail suboptimal photophysical properties for super-resolution microscopy. An additional drawback of chromobodies is that their expression level cannot be precisely controlled, evoking high background and deteriorated signal-to-background staining, which in turn makes the observation of low abundant proteins and in particular super-resolution microscopy very difficult or impossible. As recently demonstrated, nanobodies directed against FPs were equipped with quantum dots or organic dyes to trace kinesin by single-particle tracking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> However, both studies were limited by the expression of a genetically modified POI.</p>
<p>So far, methods visualizing endogenous proteins in live unmodified cells have not been accomplished. To overcome this limitation, we advanced nanobodies with bright, high-performance fluorescent probes, named fluorobodies. Combined with high-throughput cellular delivery by a vector-free microfluidic device,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> endogenous proteins were visualized by multi-color imaging at excellent signal-to-background ratios. Ultimately, the endogenous nuclear lamina was resolved at nanometer precision by live-cell super-resolution microscopy.</p>

<title>Specific protein labeling <italic>via</italic> fluorobodies</title>
<p>As a first showcase, we modified the established &#x03B1;-GFP nanobody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> by strategic positioning of small organic fluorescent probes. We engineered nanobodies with a single free cysteine either at the N or C terminus, or position 9, respectively. After expression and affinity purification, the nanobodies were labeled via maleimide coupling with high-quantum yield fluorophores of, <italic>e.g.</italic> sulfo-Cyanine 3 (sCy3), sCy5, or ATTO655 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref></bold>). To suppress transient exposure of inner scaffold cysteines by thermal breathing, covalent dye attachment was performed at 4 &#x00B0;C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Specific conjugation of the fluorophore was confirmed by SDS-PAGE in-gel fluorescence and fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography, with molar labeling ratios of &#x007E; 0.9 for &#x03B1;-GFP<sup>sCy3</sup> and &#x007E; 0.8 for &#x03B1;-GFP<sup>sCy5</sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure Supplement 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<caption><p>&#x0399; Specific binding of site-specifically labeled fluorobodies. (<bold>a</bold>) Size comparison of nanobodies labeled with a fluorescent protein (chromobody) or a synthetic dye (fluorobody). Bulky fluorescent proteins (&#x003E; 25 kDa) triple the size of the nanobody (&#x007E;13 kDa). In comparison, the minimal size of fluorophores (&#x003C; 1 kDa) is unlikely to disturb the nanobody and offer a higher quantum yield as well as photostability. mCherry (PDB 2H5Q) is shown exemplarily.

<p>As an initial screen, we evaluated specific binding of the &#x03B1;-GFP fluorobodies (Fbs) in fixed cells prior to live-cell applications. Different intracellular assemblies were selected as targets, <italic>e.g.</italic> the transporter associated with antigen processing TAP (TAP1-mVenus) in the ER membrane, histone 2B (H2B-EGFP) in the nucleus, and lamin A (mEGFP-Lamin A) as a component of the nuclear envelope. The respective POIs were expressed in human HeLa Kyoto cells, labeled with the &#x03B1;-GFP Fbs (50-200 nM) and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The Fbs retained high target specificity with negligible background staining (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure Supplement 2</xref></bold>). More important, an excellent co-localization was observed as depicted by Pearson&#x2019;s coefficients ranging from 0.948 to 0.986, independently of the attached synthetic dyes (sCy3 and sCy5; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure Supplement 2</xref></bold>). The Fb intensity distribution highly correlated with the POI expression level, reflecting specific and stoichiometric binding (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure Supplement 2</xref></bold> and <bold>3</bold>).</p>
<p>To avoid limitations typically entailed by overexpression of fusion proteins, we traced the endogenous nuclear envelope by an engineered &#x03B1;-Lamin Fb. As basic constituents of the nuclei, lamins are assembled in a filamentous meshwork, providing structural stability. Importantly, only after nanobody production in an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, engineered to promote disulfide bond formation in the cytosol, and application of an optimized coupling procedure, specific labeling of the endogenous nuclear lamina was facilitated with &#x03B1;-Lamin Fbs equipped with sCy5 or ATTO655 at labeling ratios of 0.8 to 1.0, respectively. Noteworthy, different procedures led to successful dye conjugation, but were accompanied with loss in specificity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure Supplement 4</xref></bold>). Similar results were obtained if lysine residues on the nanobody surface were stochastically modified via <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) Alexa647 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure Supplement 4a</xref></bold>). Contrary, the &#x03B1;-GFP Fb always retained high target specificity in fixed cells, independent of all described routes for production and labeling (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure Supplement 5</xref></bold>). Since the highest signal-to-background ratio was achieved after dye-conjugation to the N-terminal cysteine of the &#x03B1;-Lamin Fb (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f,g</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Video 1</bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure Supplement Fig. 4</xref></bold>), labeling at this position was employed for all further experiments.</p>

<title>Live-cell protein labeling at nanomolar fluorobody concentrations</title>
<p>Once the specificity in fixed cells was proven, we aimed at live-cell protein labeling. For the fast and efficient Fb transfer, we made use of high-throughput, microfluidic cell squeezing. Here, transient pore formation of the plasma membrane is induced by forcing cells through micrometer constrictions of microfluidic devices (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 2 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 1</xref></bold>). This approach has shown to bypass endosomal uptake and offered precise control of the transduced cargo concentration combined with high-throughput delivery (1,000,000 cells/s) and minimal cytotoxicity (&#x003C; 10&#x0025;).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Initially, &#x03B1;-GFP Fbs were delivered into HeLa Kyoto cells expressing the three selected FP-tagged proteins and the intracellular Fb distribution was analyzed 1 to 3 h after cell transfer. In all cases, the fluorescence of the &#x03B1;-GFP Fb showed a high degree of co-localization with FP-tagged H2B, TAP1, or lamin A, reflected by Pearson&#x2019;s coefficients ranging from 0.864 to 0.911 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 2 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 2a</xref></bold>). Exemplary, an excellent correlation between the fluorescence intensity profiles of TAP1-mVenus and the &#x03B1;-GFP<sup>sCy3</sup> Fb was observed (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref></bold>; Pearson&#x2019;s coefficient of 0.926). Notably, all transduced cells displayed a very low background staining and the intensity of the Fb reflected the variability in the POI expression level. We observed an increased Fb binding in cells with high levels of FP-tagged POIs, whereas cells expressing low amounts of the POIs displayed weaker fluorescence intensities (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure 2 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 3</xref></bold>). One explanation for this correlation is found in the release of unbound binders during membrane resealing as well as in the nanomolar concentration of Fbs in the squeezing buffer, both synergistically contributing to a high signal-to-background staining (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Indeed, untransfected cells indicated a very low level of uniformly intracellular distributed Fbs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure 2 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 4</xref></bold>). This is in line with the localization of the &#x03B1;-GFP-mCherry chromobody or mCherry expressed in HeLa Kyoto cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">Figure 2 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 5a,b</xref></bold>). In contrast, expression of &#x03B1;-GFP-mCherry chromobodies together with FP-tagged POIs often resulted in overabundance of the binder due to mismatched expression levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">Figure 2 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 5c-e</xref></bold>). Here, a high signal-to-background labeling is impaired in cells with high expression levels of chromobodies, while very low levels entail high sensitivity to photobleaching. These drawbacks were successfully abolished by microfluidic Fb transfer. To test the long-term stability and persistence of Fb labeling, cells were imaged 20 h after transduction. Remarkably, the POIs were still decorated by &#x03B1;-GFP Fbs, highlighting their long-term specificity and in-cell robustness (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 2 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 2</xref></bold>). Over time, however, cytosolic punctae and a higher background signal were detected, indicating incipient Fb degradation. Collectively, the adaptive, fine-tuned intracellular delivery of Fbs by cell squeezing promoted low-background labeling of genetically tagged proteins.</p>

<title>High signal-to-background tracing of endogenous proteins in live mammalian cells</title>
<p>We next focused on live-cell labeling of endogenous protein networks. With regard to their extenuated abundance, the utilization of high-performance fluorescent or fluorogenic probes is essential to enhance sensitivity. We selected two intermediate filaments as targets. Specifically, we used the engineered &#x03B1;-Lamin Fb to visualize the native lamin meshwork of the nuclear envelope and &#x03B1;-Vimentin<sup>ATTO488</sup> for tracing vimentin as a cytoskeletal component, crucial for organelle positioning. Target specificity of both Fbs was verified beforehand in fixed cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f,g</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">Figure 3 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 1</xref></bold>). In live HeLa Kyoto cells expressing &#x03B1;-Lamin-EGFP chromobody, decoration of the nuclear lamina was accompanied with high background staining and cytosolic punctae, presumably due to saturation of the targeting machinery (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS12">Figure 3 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 2</xref></bold>). Contrarily, specific decoration of endogenous lamin with a concomitant negligible background was visualized 3 h after cell squeezing utilizing the &#x03B1;-Lamin<sup>ATTO655</sup> Fb (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref></bold>). To the best of our knowledge this constitutes the first labeling of an endogenous protein inside living cells by Fbs. Notably, even 20 h after cell squeezing, labeling of the nuclear lamina was still persistent. Nevertheless, higher background, mainly as cytosolic punctae, was observed (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Figure 3 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 3</xref></bold>), in line with results obtained for the &#x03B1;-GFP Fb (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 2 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 2b</xref></bold>). Of note, specific targeting was unaffected by the utilized fluorophore (ATTO655 or sCy5; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Figure 3 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 3</xref></bold>). To further broaden the range of applications, &#x03B1;-Vimentin<sup>ATTO488</sup> was delivered into cells. The well-defined filamentous structure of endogenous vimentin was visualized with a high signal-to-background ratio 3 h as well 20 h after cell squeezing (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS14">Figure 3 &#x2013; Supplement Figure 4</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Multiplex and super-resolution analysis of native cellular protein networks</title>
<p>Encouraged by these results, we performed multi-color live-cell labeling by combining both binders. 3D mapping of cell topology via multiplexed imaging revealed simultaneous and specific decoration of the nuclear lamina (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref></bold>, red) and vimentin filaments (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref></bold>, green) at endogenous level, hardly realized by multiple knock-ins utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The spatial distinct distribution allowed discriminating between both structures by live-cell immunofluorescence imaging. In combination with their precisely adjusted delivery by cell squeezing, the small Fbs, site-specifically labeled with minimal and bright fluorescent dyes (&#x2264; 1 nm) provides an excellent showcase for live-cell super-resolution microscopy. Consequently, &#x03B1;-Lamin<sup>ATTO655</sup> Fb transduced cells were subjected to <italic>direct</italic> stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (<italic>d</italic>STORM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> We obtained images of the endogenous nuclear lamina in living cells with an average resolution of &#x007E; 55 nm (localization precision of 23.4 &#x00B1; 8.3 nm; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref></bold>) and significantly increased contrast compared to wide-field imaging (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In general, the much lower level of endogenous proteins makes their specific and low-background tracing very challenging. To circumvent this constrain, we established a method for live-cell visualization of endogenous proteins at nanometer resolution and with minimal disturbance and high reproducibility (n &#x2265; 3 for every POI). This robust and generic technique is versatile in the choice of the nanobody and bright organic fluorophore and allows for low-background tracing of high as well as low abundant native protein networks in living cells. In case of our selected target structures, Fb decoration was persistent for several hours after Fb transfer. However, increased background after 20 h suggests that long-term protein tracing can be affected. This obstacle is experimentally manageable, depending on the turnover rate of the POI as well as the rate of cell division. Alternative approaches to tag endogenous proteins such as the generation of stable cell lines utilizing <italic>e.g.</italic> CRISPR/Cas9 for low chromobody levels are highly promising, yet very labor-intensive and hardly realizable for multiple knock-ins.</p>
<p>Collectively, our devised strategy strikes a new path for the live-cell visualization of endogenous targets by high quantum yield fluorobodies to study their precise intracellular localization and trafficking. The simplicity and robustness of the methodology can be extended to deliver multiple probes simultaneously for multiplexed imaging and has tremendous potential for other types of microscopy (<italic>e.g.</italic> electron microscopy). Even the Fb targeting of endogenous proteins in embryonic stem cells or patient-derived primary immune cells is technically feasible via cell squeezing. Moreover, our method provides access of exogenously derived high-affinity binding scaffolds (<italic>e.g.</italic> fibronectin-based binding proteins or designed ankyrin repeat proteins) for 3D and multi-color super-resolution imaging in native cells and opens avenues to label cellular ultrastructures at endogenous level for correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM) or lattice light-sheet microscopy. Overall, the readily and feasible expansion of the methodology will pioneer the non-genetically encoded visualization of cellular networks and subcellular structures and hence provide complementary and unique information at unprecedented precision. Thus, fluorobody delivery by cell squeezing for in-cell tracing will likely find applications supporting routine imaging of multiple native cellular assemblies with advanced imaging techniques.</p>

Both <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were transformed with the vectors, coding for &#x03B1;-GFP and &#x03B1;-Lamin nanobodies with engineered cysteines. A single colony was inoculated in LB medium containing 100 &#x00B5;g/ml ampicillin and 2&#x0025; (w/v) glucose. After overnight incubation (37 &#x00B0;C for <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) and 30 &#x00B0;C for <italic>E. coli</italic> SHuffle T7 Express, 180 rpm), 1 l Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium with 100 &#x00B5;g/ml ampicillin was inoculated and protein expression was induced at A<sub>600</sub> of 0.7-0.8 by 1 mM isopropyl-&#x03B2;-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Sigma-Aldrich) and conducted for 5-20 h (30 &#x00B0;C, 180 rpm). After centrifugation (20 min, 4&#x00B0;C, 5,000x g), the cell pellets were directly used for protein purification or stored at -20 &#x00B0;C.</p>

<title>Protein purification</title>
<p>Two different protocols were used for purification. For &#x03B1;-GFP<sup>His6-Cys</sup> and &#x03B1;-Lamin<sup>His6-Cys</sup> expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3), cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5 mM &#x03B2;-mercaptoethanol (&#x03B2;-ME)), followed by sonication for cell lysis. Cell debris were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (100,000x g, 30 min, 4 &#x00B0;C). For metal affinity chromatography, the supernatant was incubated with 3 ml Ni-NTA Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) in the presence of imidazole (15 mM). Afterwards, the beads were washed in purification buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM &#x03B2;-ME). His-tagged proteins were eluted by 200 mM imidazole/purification buffer. Protein concentration was determined at A<sub>280</sub>. Buffer exchange to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5 mM &#x03B2;-ME by Zeba spin desalting columns (7K) was followed by concentration via Amicon Ultra Filters (3 K). &#x03B2;-ME was directly removed before labeling the nanobodies using Zeba spin desalting columns (7K). Alternatively, nanobodies expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> T7 Express were purified as described above, but at pH 7.5 and without &#x03B2;-ME.</p>

<title>Protein modification</title>
<p>Fluorescent dyes were either attached to the engineered cysteines or to lysines (only for &#x03B1;-Lamin<sup>His6-Cys</sup>). The engineered cysteines of nanobodies stored in PBS without &#x03B2;-ME were reduced by incubation with 15 mM TCEP for 10 min on ice and subsequent buffer exchange by Zeba spin desalting columns (7K). Cysteine labeling was conducted following two different protocols. On the one hand, nanobodies were incubated with sulfo-Cy5 (sCy5) or sulfo-Cy3 (sCy3) maleimide in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1.5 h at 4 &#x00B0;C. Labeling was conducted at a protein concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml with 1.2-fold molar excess of the dye. For the alternative labeling protocol, buffer was exchanged to maleimide labeling buffer after TCEP reduction (100 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 6.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose). Afterwards, the fluorophore was added in a 1.2- fold molar excess, immediately followed by neutralization to pH 7.5 using K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and 1.5 h incubation at 4 &#x00B0;C. For lysine labeling, nanobodies in PBS (pH 7.4) were mixed 1:20 with 0.1 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 9.0) to achieve pH 8.3 for labeling. Next, Alexa647 NHS ester was added with a 5-fold molar excess. Labeling was performed for 1 h at 20 &#x00B0;C before buffer exchange and removal of excess dye with Zeba spin desalting columns (7K, Thermo Scientific). Fluorescently labeled nanobodies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and in-gel fluorescence (Typhoon 9400 Imager; l<sub>ex/em</sub> 630/670 nm). Fbs were finally purified by size-exclusion chromatography in PBS using a KW404-4F column (Shodex; flow rate 0.3 ml/min). All labeled nanobodies were stored in PBS at 4 &#x00B0;C. The nanobody-to-fluorophore ratio was determined using absorption (A<sub>280</sub> for nanobodies, A<sub>550</sub> for sCy3, A<sub>663</sub> for ATTO655, A<sub>649</sub> for sCy5) and their respective extinction coefficient &#x03B5; (0.22&#x00B7;10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x00B7;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for &#x03B1;-Lamin Nb, 0.27&#x00B7;10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x00B7;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for &#x03B1;-GFP Nb, 1.36&#x00B7;10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x00B7;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for sCy3, 1.25&#x00B7;10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x00B7;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for ATTO655, and 2.50&#x00B7;10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x00B7;cm&#x002B;for sCy5).</p>

<title>Confocal laser scanning microscopy</title>
<p>Imaging was performed using the confocal laser scanning (LSM) microscope LSM880 (Zeiss) or TCS SP5 microscope (Leica) with Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC objectives. To avoid crosstalk between different fluorophores, images were acquired sequentially. The following laser lines were used for excitation: 405 nm for DAPI; 488 nm for EGFP, mEGFP, and mVenus; 565 nm for sCy3; 633 nm for sCy5 and ATTO655. Live-cell imaging of endogenous proteins (except for dual-color imaging with ATTO488 and ATTO655) was conducted with the Airy scan detector of the LSM880 in the SR-mode. For 3D reconstructions of labeled protein networks, z-stack were recorded with the Airy scan detector (distance between stacks &#x007E; 200 nm). For live-cell imaging, an incubation system was used to keep cells at 37 &#x00B0;C and supply them with 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> during imaging.

<title>Super-resolution microscopy</title>
<p>For super-resolution imaging of the &#x03B1;-Lamin<sup>ATTO655</sup> Fb in live cells, a custom-built microscope was used.

(<bold>c</bold>-<bold>e</bold>) HeLa Kyoto cells were transiently co-transfected with an &#x03B1;-GFP-mCherry chromobody (red) and a FP-tagged POI (TAP1-mVenus, mEGFP-Lamin A or H2B-EGFP; green). Increased chromobody expression levels resulted in a high background of unbound nanobody, distributed in the cytosol and nucleus (indicated by arrows). Before CLSM imaging, HeLa Kyoto cells were chemically arrested with 4&#x0025; formaldehyde and additionally stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars: 20 &#x00B5;m.</p></caption>
