<title>Introductory paragraph</title>
<p>Much of biology is associated with convergent traits, and it is challenging to determine the extent to which underlying molecular mechanisms are shared across phylogeny. By analyzing plants representing eighteen independent origins of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, we quantified the extent to which this convergent trait utilises identical molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that biochemical changes that characterise C<sub>4</sub> species are recovered by this process, and expand the paradigm by four metabolic pathways not previously associated with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that expression of many genes that distinguish C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species respond to low CO<sub>2</sub>, providing molecular evidence that reduction in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> was a driver for C<sub>4</sub> evolution. Thus the origin and architecture of complex traits can be derived from transcriptome comparisons across natural diversity.</p>

<title>Main text</title>
<p>The evolution of complex traits has produced great diversity in form and function across the living world. A large number of similar complex traits have evolved independently in multiple disparate lineages indicating that common responses to environmental selection can result in convergent phenotypes<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway, with at least 65 independent origins distributed across the angiosperms<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, is considered one of the most remarkable examples of evolutionary convergence in eukaryotes. Thus the C<sub>4</sub> pathway represents an attractive trait with which to determine whether phylogenetically diverse species can be examined to discover the shared molecular basis of complex convergent phenotypes.</p>
<p>Using a comparative approach, we analyzed gene expression of 30 C<sub>4</sub> and 17 C<sub>3</sub> species representing 18 independent evolutionary origins of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). This set of species includes representatives from all seven orders within the eudicotyledons known to have evolved C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,</xref> Supplemental File 1)<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. This sampling expands upon previous transcriptome studies with C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> eudicot plants in <italic>Cleomaceae, Asteraceae</italic> and <italic>Portulaceae</italic><sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>&#x2013;<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. RNA was isolated from leaves of all species, sequenced and subjected to <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly. Collectively these samples comprise 850 million reads that were assembled into 1.5 million contigs of which 1.1 million were assigned to orthogroups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,</xref> Supplemental File 1) using a machine learning approach<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Analysis of the correlation in mRNA abundance estimates between species revealed that species did not cluster according to their photosynthetic type but rather according to phylogenetic relationship (Supplemental File 2). That is, C<sub>4</sub> species of <italic>Flaveria</italic> are more similar to C<sub>3</sub> <italic>Flaveria</italic> than to C<sub>4</sub> species from other genera, and thus variation in gene expression underlying phenotypic convergence is not the primary determinant of differences in mRNA abundance between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species.</p>

</fig>
<p>Comparison of the transcriptomes from C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species identified 149 genes that showed altered transcript abundance between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species in all 18 lineages: 113 that were more abundant and 36 less abundant in all C<sub>4</sub> species (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1,</xref> Supplemental File 3, Supplemental File 4). This set includes many genes encoding components of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis that are known to change during evolution of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,</xref> Supplemental File 5, and Supplemental File 6). Four transcription factors were more abundant in all C<sub>4</sub> species (<italic>PAT1, ZML2, SHR</italic> and a <italic>bHLH</italic> transcription factor of unknown function). Both <italic>PAT1</italic> and <italic>ZML2</italic> act to induce the expression of genes encoding photosynthesis proteins downstream of phytochrome and cryptochrome signalling respectively<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> while <italic>SHR</italic> is a validated regulator of C<sub>4</sub> Kranz anatomy in <italic>Zea mays</italic><sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>-<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Thus three of the four transcription factors have previously been identified as playing a role in the regulation of photosynthesis gene expression or leaf anatomy, both of which are altered during the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The uncharacterised bHLH domain transcription factor has no known functional role, but has previously been described as being upregulated in the bundle sheath (BS) cells of the C<sub>3</sub> plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic><sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. It is therefore possible that this bHLH transcription factor plays an ancestral role in the BS of C<sub>3</sub> species that has become enhanced in all C<sub>4</sub> lineages. Wide sampling of natural diversity therefore indicates that there is convergence in the recruitment of key regulators of gene expression in independent lineages of C<sub>4</sub> species.</p>

<p>Transcripts encoding 16 proteins comprising four metabolic pathways that have not previously been associated with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis were detected as differentially abundant between C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,</xref> Supplemental File 7). These pathways described below encompass: a novel carbon concentrating pathway involving the GABA shunt; metabolism associated with regeneration of phospho<italic>enol</italic>pyruvate (PEP), the primary CO<sub>2</sub> acceptor in the C<sub>4</sub> pathway; modifications to pyruvate metabolism that prevent diversion of pyruvate from the C<sub>4</sub> cycle into non-photosynthetic pathways such as lipid and branched amino acid biosynthesis; and a photorespiratory pathway previously associated with chlorophyte algae (Supplemental File 7).</p>
<p>The abundance of transcripts encoding a key component of the &#x03B3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt was increased in all C<sub>4</sub> compared with C<sub>3</sub> species. In the conventional model for NAD-ME type C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, aspartate synthesised in mesophyll (M) cells is shuttled to mitochondria in the BS where it is transaminated to oxaloacetate by aspartate amino transferase (ASP1), reduced to malate by NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NAD-MDH), and then decarboxylated to pyruvate which can then return to the M (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Although <italic>ASP1</italic> transcripts were more abundant in all C<sub>4</sub> species that we studied, this was not the case for the later steps in the NAD-ME pathway (Supplemental File 7). Instead, we propose that oxaloacetate is used to feed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in BS cells. Here, 2-oxoglutarate synthesised by the TCA cycle can be converted to glutamate and decarboxylated by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD4) to GABA, resulting in release of CO<sub>2</sub> and return of carbon skeletons as succinate to the TCA cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2,</xref> Supplemental File 5, Supplemental File 7). This proposed pathway provides both a novel mechanism to transfer CO<sub>2</sub> to the BS using CO<sub>2</sub> that was fixed by phospho<italic>enol</italic>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in the M, and a source of ATP in the BS by using NADH generated by the running the TCA cycle for oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,</xref> Supplemental File 5, Supplemental File 6). Two orthogonal approaches provide evidence that this cycle functions to concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> in the C<sub>4</sub> BS. First, computational modelling revealed that the additional ATP this pathway provides to BS cells resulted in an increased CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate irrespective of C<sub>4</sub> subtype under low light conditions (Supplemental File 8). Moreover, when PEPCK is used for decarboxylation this increase in CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate was maintained under high light (Supplemental File 8). Second, biochemical evidence for this pathway has in fact been reported previously - after <sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>C labelled glutamate was fed to isolated BS strands in <italic>Zea mays</italic><sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, radiolabel is rapidly released and redistributed to other metabolites in a manner that is most parsimoniously explained by glutamate decarboxylase mediated decarboxylation followed by re-fixation of labelled CO<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> by RuBisCO. Thus, sampling the natural diversity of C4 species uncovered an adjunct CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating pathway that is supported by biochemical data and a metabolic model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>
<p>To maintain flux through the C<sub>4</sub> pathway, PEP supply is critical as it is the entry point of the cycle. Transcripts encoding a chloroplastic phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and an enolase (ENO) were more abundant in all C<sub>4</sub> compared with C<sub>3</sub> species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,</xref> Supplemental File 7). These proteins facilitate conversion of Calvin-Benson cycle intermediates to PEP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), providing an additional route for transfer of photo-assimilated carbon to the M, and consequently regeneration of the initial carbon acceptor. Transcripts encoding pyruvate kinase (PK), which catalyzes the reverse reaction, were less abundant in C<sub>4</sub> compared with C<sub>3</sub> species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). A reduction in the amount of the cognate protein would limit futile cycling between PEP and pyruvate during C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The third pathway detected in our analysis indicates pyruvate metabolism has been modified to prevent diversion of pyruvate from C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into non-photosynthetic pathways such as lipid and branched amino acid biosynthesis. Transcripts encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) were more abundant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), and aceto-lactate synthase (ALS) less abundant, in all C<sub>4</sub> compared with C<sub>3</sub> leaves (Supplemental File 7). As PDK deactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase by phosphorylation and ALS channels pyruvate into the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids, these alterations would support the core C<sub>4</sub> cycle by reducing loss of pyruvate from photosynthetic pools.</p>
<p>The fourth pathway that we propose is modified in all C<sub>4</sub> compared with C<sub>3</sub> species has been previously associated with algae rather than land plants. Chloroplasts of chlorophyte algae enclose their RuBisCO in structures called pyrenoids. These structures facilitate an increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration around RuBisCO resulting in reduced photorespiration<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. These algae also lack the peroxisome-based photorespiratory pathway that evolved in the common ancestor of embryophytes and charophyte algae<sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Although the ancestral chlorophyte photorespiratory pathway involving glycolate dehydrogenase (GlcDH) and an alanine:glyoxylate amino transferase (ALAAT2) is still active in C<sub>3</sub> plants, flux of glycolate through this pathway is low compared with the peroxisome-based pathway<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Our analysis indicates that in all 18 C<sub>4</sub> lineages there is a concerted increase in abundance of transcripts encoding key components of the chlorophyte algal pathway, specifically GlcDH and ALAAT2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,</xref> Supplemental File 7). Two scenarios may explain this change during C<sub>4</sub> evolution. First, the chlorophyte photorespiratory pathway plays a role in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Second, GlcDH plays a role in converting some dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) produced in the Calvin-Benson cycle of BS cells to pyruvate <italic>via</italic> the methylglyoxal pathway enabling the use of some DHAP to maintain the C<sub>4</sub> cycle (Supplemental File 9). In this latter scenario, ALAAT2 would still process photorespiratory glyoxylate that had been produced in the peroxisome by glycolate oxidase. Both proposed scenarios require a source of NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and in this context it is noteworthy that both transcripts encoding Complex I of the respiratory electron transfer chain and the plant uncoupling mitochondrial protein 1 (PUMP1) were upregulated in C<sub>4</sub> species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Together, these would increase regeneration of NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and de-couple some proton flux through Complex I from ATP synthesis. Moreover, this increase in NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> would also support photorespiratory glycine decarboxylase and utilise NADH from the TCA cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We also evaluated whether transcriptome sampling across a deep phylogeny could be used to clarify selective forces promoting C<sub>4</sub> evolution. Low atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has been proposed to be a key driver of C<sub>4</sub> evolution<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and analysis of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> identified genes responsive to low CO<sub>2</sub> in plants<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Thirty-one of the 113 genes that were more abundant in all C<sub>4</sub> species sampled showed increased expression in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> grown under low CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3,</xref> Supplemental File 10). As the probability of such an overlap is low (<italic>p</italic> = 4 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-9</sup>), these data indicate that there is a significant association between genes that are expressed highly in C<sub>4</sub> species and those that are more abundant in C<sub>3</sub> <italic>A. thaliana</italic> grown under low CO<sub>2</sub>. There is also a significant association between genes that are more abundant under low CO<sub>2</sub> and those that are less abundant in all C<sub>4</sub> plants (<italic>p</italic> = 1 &#x00D7; 10 <sup>-5</sup>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, nine of these twelve genes encode components of the photorespiratory pathway and the remaining three are unknown proteins predicted to localize to the chloroplast and are thus implicated in photorespiratory processes (Supplemental File 11). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that low atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration induced changes in gene expression that facilitated C<sub>4</sub> evolution. The molecular mechanisms that underpin this response remain to be identified. In the future it will be informative to investigate the extent to which other ecological drivers such as heat, drought and salinity alter gene expression and potentially target genes that are then recruited into this complex trait. In addition, the data also reveal that a set of genes that are more abundant in C<sub>4</sub> species are preferentially expressed in the BS cells of C<sub>3</sub> species and thus indicate that neofunctionalisation of BS cells utilized pathways already present in this cell type (Supplemental File 5, Supplemental File 12). Thus these data also provide molecular support for the hypothesis that expansion and specialization of the C<sub>3</sub> BS is an early and key step in the evolution of the C<sub>4</sub> phenotype<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="163097_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Finally, the data identify four metabolic pathways previously unknown to be important for C<sub>4</sub> function, and identify a role for the GABA shunt pathway in concentrating CO<sub>2</sub> and generating ATP in the BS of all C<sub>4</sub> species. The re-emergence in plants of the peroxisome-based photorespiratory pathway from algae is to our knowledge, the first documented example of an evolutionary reversion being a key component of the advent of complexity and convergence in eukaryotic biology. We envisage that this approach of comparative transcriptome sampling of non-model species will now be used to provide insight into molecular signatures associated with complex traits across the tree of life. The fact that we recapitulated previous knowledge of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, but also significantly extended the functional model of C<sub>4</sub> metabolism, implies there is much more to be discovered about this pathway.</p>

<title>List of Supplementary Materials</title>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 1:</bold> Summary of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species sampled in this study. Each species is classified by its photosynthetic pathway, its family and order. The number of sequenced reads, assembled contigs, annotated contigs, and assembly N50 for each species obtained are also listed.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 2:</bold> Phylogenetic position accounts for more variance in mRNA abundance than photosynthetic pathway. The heat map depicts the Spearman&#x2019;s ranked correlation coefficient (&#x03C1;) between each species pair computed from global mRNA abundance estimates. The hierarchical cluster (tree to the left of the heat map) was computed directly from the correlation coefficients by converting these correlation coefficients to distance estimates. The distance estimate between two species A and B is evaluated as 1 - &#x03C1;. i.e. <italic>d</italic>(A,B) = 1 - &#x03C1;. A tree is then inferred from these distance estimates using the minimum evolution principle. Names of C<sub>4</sub> species are shown in blue.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 3:</bold> Summary of genes showing differential expression between C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> leaves. The likelihood of differential expression is provided considering all species. Also provided is the proportion of resampling tests in which the gene was detected as consistently differentially regulated between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species. The mean and standard deviation of the expression estimate is provided for the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> cohort as well as the number of samples that were identified as outliers and masked prior to differential expression testing. The expected count for each gene for each species is also provided.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 4:</bold> The subset of genes from Supplemental File 3 that received 100&#x0025; support from computational occlusion and resampling.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 5:</bold> Additional information.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 6:</bold> Genes previously reported to be differentially expressed in C<sub>4</sub> compared with C<sub>3</sub> leaves.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 8:</bold> Four additional metabolic pathways identified in this study. In each case the relative expression is given for C<sub>3</sub> (grey bars) and C<sub>4</sub> (green bars) species. <sup>&#x002A;</sup> indicates a likelihood of differential expression &#x2265; 0.95 and 100&#x0025; support from computational occlusion and resampling. n.s. indicates a non-significant difference between the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> expression levels. (A) GABA shunt. (B) Phospho<italic>enol</italic>pyruvate regeneration. (C) First step of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis. (D) Chlorophyte photorespiratory pathway.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 8:</bold> Modelling the addition of the GABA shunt to the C4 photosynthesis.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 9:</bold> Schematic illustrating an alternative hypothesis for the function of the glycolate dehydrogenase gene that is potentially a lactate dehydrogenase. This pathway would convert dihydroxyacetone phosphate to pyruvate <italic>via</italic> methylglyoxal.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 10:</bold> Genes that were up-regulated in all C<sub>4</sub> species and also up-regulated in response to low atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in the C<sub>3</sub> plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 11</bold>: Genes that were down-regulated in all C<sub>4</sub> species and also up-regulated in response to low atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in the C<sub>3</sub> plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental file 12:</bold> The overlap between the genes differentially regulated in all C<sub>4</sub> species with other datasets. A) Comparison of transcripts upregulated in all C<sub>4</sub> species with those preferentially expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> bundlesheath cells. B) Comparison of genes identified as differentially abundant in all C<sub>4</sub> species compared to those identified as differentially abundant between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species of <italic>Flaveria</italic>. C) Analysis of the cell type specific expression in <italic>Zea mays</italic> and <italic>Setaria italica</italic> of the orthologues of the genes identified as up-regulated in all C<sub>4</sub> species in this study.</p>
<p><bold>Supplemental File 13:</bold> Genes that were up-regulated in all C<sub>4</sub> species and also up-regulated in in bundle sheath cells of the C<sub>3</sub> plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p>
