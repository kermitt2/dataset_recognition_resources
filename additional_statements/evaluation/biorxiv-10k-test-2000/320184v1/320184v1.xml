<abstract><title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>The mitochondrion of apicomplexan parasites is critical for parasite survival, although the full complement of proteins that localize to this organelle has not been defined. Here we undertake two independent approaches to elucidate the mitochondrial proteome of the apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. We identify 421 mitochondrial proteins, many of which lack homologs in the animals that these parasites infect, and most of which are important for parasite growth. We demonstrate that one such protein, termed <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25, is an important component of the parasite cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX) complex. We identify numerous other apicomplexan-specific components of COX, and conclude that apicomplexan COX, and apicomplexan mitochondria more generally, differ substantially in their protein composition from the hosts they infect. Our study highlights the diversity that exists in mitochondrial proteomes across the eukaryotic domain of life, and provides a foundation for defining unique aspects of mitochondrial biology in an important phylum of parasites.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Mitochondria were derived from &#x03B1;-proteobacteria in an endosymbiotic event, and were present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gray, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sagan, 1967</xref>). Mitochondria and related organelles are present in almost all extant eukaryotes. They function in the biosynthesis of molecules such as iron-sulfur clusters, lipids, coenzyme Q, heme and amino acids, the catabolism of molecules such as fatty acids, amino acids and monocarboxylates, the storage of ions and signalling molecules such as Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, the regulation of apoptosis, and the production of energy-carrying molecules such as ATP and NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McBride et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">van Dooren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zikova et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, the function of mitochondria and related organelles vary substantially between different eukaryotic lineages, reflective of the &#x003E;1,500 M years that separate these lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chernikova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zikova et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Apicomplexans are a phylum of intracellular parasites that impose a significant medical and economic burden on human populations around the world. Apicomplexans include the causative agents of malaria (<italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp.), cryptosporidiosis (<italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp.) and toxoplasmosis (<italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>)<italic>. T. gondii</italic> is an opportunistic parasite that chronically infects approximately one-third of the world&#x2019;s adult population. Symptoms of <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection in healthy individuals are typically mild. In immunocompromised individuals and unborn fetuses, however, <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection can cause severe neurological and developmental impairment, and, without treatment, can lead to death of the infected individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Montoya and Liesenfeld, 2004</xref>). The tractable genetics of <italic>T. gondii</italic> make it a versatile model for studying conserved aspects of apicomplexan biology.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are critical for the survival of apicomplexans, and several important drugs target proteins that function in this organelle, including atovaquone and endochin-like quinolones, both of which target cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase (complex III) of the electron transport chain, and DSM1, which targets dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a central enzyme in pyrimidine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Doggett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Phillips et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Srivastava et al., 1999</xref>). The functions of apicomplexan mitochondria are largely implied through comparative genomic approaches that have identified homologs of genes encoding known mitochondrial proteins from other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Seeber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">van Dooren et al., 2006</xref>). The genome of apicomplexans such as <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. encode homologs of proteins involved in core mitochondrial processes such as the electron transport chain, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the synthesis of molecules such as iron-sulfur clusters, heme and coenzyme Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Seeber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">van Dooren et al., 2006</xref>). The mitosome of <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> is highly reduced compared to that of other apicomplexans, lacking a TCA cycle, and harboring a minimal electron transport chain, but retaining the capacity for iron-sulfur cluster synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mogi and Kita, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Apicomplexans belong to a group of eukaryotes known as the myzozoans, that also include dinoflagellates and chromerids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cavalier-Smith and Chao, 2004</xref>). Chromerids are a phylum of free-living, photosynthetic eukaryotes, and are thought to be the closest extant relatives of apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Moore et al., 2008</xref>). All known myzozoans retain a mitochondrion or mitochondrion-derived organelle, the functions of which have numerous differences from well-studied eukaryotes such as yeast and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Danne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jacot et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to a limited gene content, the mitochondrial genomes of these organisms contain unusually fragmented ribosomal RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Feagin et al., 2012</xref>). Myzozoan mitochondria lack pyruvate dehydrogenase, the enzyme complex that decarboxylates pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Danne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Foth et al., 2005</xref>). Instead, these organisms have repurposed a branched-chain &#x03B1;-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) to catalyse this reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Oppenheim et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Myzozoans have a functional TCA cycle, but some enzymes of this pathway are phylogenetically distinct from equivalent enzymes in yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Danne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">MacRae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">MacRae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">van Dooren et al., 2006</xref>). These organisms also contain a mitochondrial ATP synthase that lacks clear homologs to many of the proteins that comprise the membrane-bound F<sub>0</sub> component of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balabaskaran Nina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sturm et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Elucidating the proteomes of mitochondria is key to understanding their functions. Organellar proteomics in intracellular parasites such as <italic>T. gondii</italic> is limited by available material and a lack of established organellar purification techniques. To overcome these obstacles, we adopted two complementary spatially-restricted biotin tagging approaches to define the proteome of the mitochondrial matrix of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. We identified over 400 putative mitochondrial matrix proteins, many of which have no ascribed function and no clear homology to proteins found in well-characterised eukaryotes such as yeast, and most of which are important for parasite growth and survival. We functionally characterise one protein that had no previously ascribed function, and demonstrate that this is a critical component of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX) complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in the parasite. We subsequently identify numerous apicomplexan-specific components of COX. These data reveal considerable divergence in the COX complex, and in mitochondria more generally, of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and related apicomplexans, compared to the animals they infect.</p>

<sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title>
<p><bold><italic>Spatially-restricted biotinylation of mitochondrial matrix proteins</italic>.</bold> A genetically modified plant ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) was recently developed as a tool for biotinylating proximal proteins in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>). This technique was used to define the proteome of the matrix and inter-membrane space of mammalian mitochondria. An alternative spatial biotinylation approach involves the use of a genetically modified, promiscuous biotin protein ligase (BirA&#x002A;), an approach that is typically utilised to elucidate protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). We sought to utilize APEX and BirA&#x002A; to map the mitochondrial matrix proteome of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>
<p>We generated parasite strains expressing APEX or BirA&#x002A; fused at their N-termini to the mitochondrial matrix-targeting sequence of <italic>Tg</italic>Hsp60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">van Dooren et al., 2009</xref>). Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that both mitochondrially-targeted APEX (mtAPEX) and mitochondrially-targeted BirA&#x002A; (mtBirA&#x002A;) co-localised with <italic>Tg</italic>Tom40, a marker for the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Dooren et al., 2016</xref>)). Western blots confirmed the presence of mtAPEX and mtBirA&#x002A; proteins of the expected mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether mtAPEX could label mitochondrial proteins, we treated parasites with biotin-phenol for 1 hr, initiated biotinylation by adding H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 min, then fixed and labelled parasites with Oregon green-conjugated avidin, a specific stain for biotinylated proteins. We observed mitochondrial labelling in treated parasites, and not in untreated parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), consistent with mtAPEX mediating the biotinylation of mitochondrial proteins. In untreated parasites, we observed labelling of endogenously biotinylated proteins in the apicoplast, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jelenska et al., 2001</xref>)).</p>
<p>To determine whether mtBirA&#x002A; could label mitochondrial proteins, we incubated mtBirA&#x002A;-expressing parasites in medium supplemented with 1 mM biotin for 1 day. We labelled parasites with Oregon green-conjugated avidin and observed labelling in the mitochondrion of biotin-supplemented parasites, but not in untreated parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>To observe the extent of protein biotinylation in the treated mtAPEX and mtBirA&#x002A; parasites, we extracted proteins from RH strain wild type (WT), mtAPEX or mtBirA&#x002A; parasites treated with either biotin-phenol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or with biotin. We separated these by SDS-PAGE and probed with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated neutravidin to label biotinylated proteins. In WT cells, we observed two major bands of the expected sizes of natively biotinylated proteins in these parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">van Dooren et al., 2008</xref>)). In the biotin-phenol treated mtAPEX parasites, we observed labelling of several additional proteins, whereas in biotin-supplemented mtBirA&#x002A; parasites, numerous proteins were labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These data indicate that mtAPEX- and mtBirA&#x002A;-mediated biotinylation is occurring in these parasites.</p>
<p>To determine the specificity of labelling, we extracted proteins from treated WT, mtAPEX and mtBirA&#x002A; parasites and subjected these to affinity purification using streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. We separated purified proteins by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies against <italic>Tg</italic>Hsp60 (mtHsp60), a mitochondrial matrix marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Toursel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Dooren et al., 2016</xref>), and against <italic>T. gondii</italic> cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (cyt <italic>c</italic>), a mitochondrial intermembrane space marker (E.T. and G.v.D., unpublished). We did not detect mtHsp60 or cyt <italic>c</italic> in the streptavidin bound fraction in WT parasites treated with biotin-phenol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or with biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We detected bound mtHsp60, but not bound cyt <italic>c</italic>, in proteins extracted from both biotin-phenol-treated mtAPEX and biotin-treated mtBirA&#x002A; parasites. This is consistent with the mitochondrial labelling that we observe being specific for the mitochondrial matrix.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Quantitative proteomics to elucidate the mitochondrial matrix proteome</italic>.</bold> Having established two independent approaches for specifically labelling mitochondrial matrix proteins, we next undertook a label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of biotinylated proteins in treated mtAPEX and mtBirA&#x002A; parasites. First, we generated 3 independent cell lysate pools of WT and mtAPEX cells treated with biotin-phenol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and WT and mtBirA&#x002A; cells treated with biotin. Biotinylated proteins were purified from these lysates using streptavidin beads, reduced, alkylated, and trypsin-digested before being identified using mass spectrometry (MS). Triplicate samples were then processed through our in-house quantitation pipeline to determine the relative abundance of each protein identified in the mtAPEX or mtBirA&#x002A; samples as compared to WT controls. These data are represented on a volcano plot as a fold-change (log<sub>2</sub> value) vs significance of the change (&#x2212;log<sub>10</sub> <italic>p</italic> value) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>). This revealed an enrichment of numerous proteins in the mtAPEX and mtBirA&#x002A; samples. Using cut-offs of <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001 and a WT:mtAPEX/mtBirA&#x002A; log<sub>2</sub> fold change of &#x003C;-2.5, 421 proteins were identified in total: 213 proteins in the APEX samples and 369 proteins in the mtBirA&#x002A; samples, with 161 proteins common to both proteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; Supplementary File 1). Hereafter, we refer to the list of 421 proteins as the mitochondrial proteome of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Bioinformatic characterisation of the mitochondrial proteome</italic>.</bold> To test the validity of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome, we undertook a series of <italic>in silico</italic> and experimental analyses. Proteins targeted to the mitochondrial matrix typically harbor an N-terminal amphipathic &#x03B1;-helix that facilitates import into the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Dooren et al., 2016</xref>). We examined the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome for proteins predicted to contain such an N-terminal targeting domain using the rules-based computational prediction tool MitoProt II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Claros and Vincens, 1996</xref>). Approximately 40&#x0025; of proteins in the proteome had a strongly predicted N-terminal targeting sequences (probability of mitochondrial import &#x003E;0.9), and a further &#x007E;20&#x0025; had a moderately predicted targeting sequence (probability of import 0.5 - 0.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2_1">Figure 2 &#x2013; figure supplement 1</xref>; Supplementary File 1). A further &#x007E;40&#x0025; had a low probability of mitochondrial import (probability of import &#x003C;0.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2_1">Figure 2 &#x2013; figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that either the mitochondrial proteome has many false positives, or that many <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteins lack N-terminal targeting sequences, or that mitochondrial prediction tools such as MitoProt II are not suitable for analysis of mitochondrial proteins from <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Notably in this regard, the dataset used to develop MitoProt II did not include <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Claros and Vincens, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we examined metabolic pathway enrichment of the mitochondrial proteome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://toxodb.org">http://toxodb.org</ext-link>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gajria et al., 2008</xref>); <italic>p</italic> value cutoff &#x003C;0.05; Supplementary File 2). We observed the greatest enrichment in proteins involved in the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and pyruvate metabolism, all processes predicted to occur in the mitochondrion. We observed enrichment of other processes predicted to occur in the mitochondrion, including ubiquinone biosynthesis, one carbon metabolism, and branched chain amino acid degradation. We also observed enrichment of some processes not expected to occur in the mitochondrion, such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, suggesting the presence of some false positives in our proteome.</p>
<p>To analyse the mitochondrial proteome in greater detail, we mapped proteins to previously constructed metabolic maps of apicomplexan mitochondria (Supplementary File 3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Seeber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">van Dooren et al., 2006</xref>)). This analysis identified all subunits of the BCKDH, all enzymes of the TCA cycle, all proteins predicted to function in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis, four of the seven enzymes predicted to function in coenzyme Q synthesis, and two of the three mitochondrial proteins involved in heme synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Additionally, we identified all five ubiquinone-reducing dehydrogenases of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and all currently predicted subunits of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase (Complex III) and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (Complex IV) that are encoded on the nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We were unable to identify cytochrome <italic>b</italic>, CoxI and CoxIII, proteins encoded on the mitochondrial genome apicomplexan parasites. As expected, we did not identify the two isoforms of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, both predicted to localize to the intermembrane space. We identified the &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;, &#x03B3; and &#x03B4; subunits of the F<sub>1</sub> component of ATP synthase, but not the &#x03B5; subunit.</p>
<p>We identified numerous other proteins shown previously to localise to the mitochondrion (Supplementary File 3), including components of the presequence translocase associated motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Dooren et al., 2016</xref>), the aforementioned <italic>Tg</italic>Hsp60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Toursel et al., 2000</xref>), components of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Dooren et al., 2016</xref>), a mitochondrial pyruvate kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saito et al., 2008</xref>), a component of the &#x03B3;&#x2013;aminobutyric acid shunt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">MacRae et al., 2012</xref>), an enzyme involved in phospholipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hartmann et al., 2014</xref>), and proteins associated with DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Garrison and Arrizabalaga, 2009</xref>) and antioxidant defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brydges and Carruthers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ding et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, we were unable to identify mitochondrially-localised enzymes involved in the 2-methylcitrate cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Limenitakis et al., 2013</xref>). We identified several conserved solute transporter proteins, and numerous proteins with housekeeping roles in the mitochondrion, including mitochondrial RNA polymerase, 18 ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>), ribosome maturation factors, and various translation elongation factors (Supplementary File 3). A recent genome-wide CRISPR-based screen to identify genes important for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of tachyzoite-stage <italic>T. gondii</italic> identified 15 so-called Indispensable Conserved Apicomplexan Proteins (ICAPs; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>)). Of these, 8 localised to the mitochondrion. We identified 6 of these mitochondrial ICAPs in the mitochondrial proteome. In total, our proteomics identified 96 out of 110 proteins that previously studies had experimentally localized, or predicted to localize, to the mitochondrion, suggesting a high level of coverage (87&#x0025;).</p>
<p>We examined the mitochondrial proteome for likely false positives. We identified 17 proteins that other studies have demonstrated do not localise to the mitochondrion (Supplementary File 3). Notably, 15 of these were identified only in the mtBirA&#x002A; proteome, while 2 were present in both the mtBirA&#x002A; and mtAPEX proteomes. In total, of the 421 proteins in the mitochondrial proteome, we identified 96 (23&#x0025;) that are known or expected to localise to the mitochondrion, and 17 (4&#x0025;) that are known to localise elsewhere.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Localisation of uncharacterized proteins from the mitochondrial proteome</italic>.</bold> Of the 421 putative mitochondrial proteins identified in the mitochondrial proteome, 150 (36&#x0025;) were annotated as &#x2018;hypothetical&#x2019; proteins, and a further 140 (33&#x0025;) had no previously defined role or experimentally determined localization in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (Supplementary File 1). We attempted to localize 37 proteins selected at random from this &#x2018;uncharacterized&#x2019; protein data set by introducing a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the 3&#x2019; end of the native locus of genes encoding these proteins. We then undertook immunofluorescence assays to determine the localization of the proteins, co-labelling with anti-<italic>Tg</italic>Tom40 as a marker for the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Dooren et al., 2016</xref>). We were successful in localizing 27 of the 37 selected proteins. Of these, 22 (81&#x0025;) localized to the mitochondrion, three to the cytosol, one to the endoplasmic reticulum and one to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). All 13 that were identified in both the mtAPEX and mtBirA&#x002A; proteomes localized to the mitochondrion, suggesting a high degree of confidence in the mitochondrial localization of proteins identified from both datasets. Five of the six proteins found solely in the mtAPEX proteome localized to the mitochondrion, while four of the eight proteins found only in the mtBirA&#x002A; proteome localized to the mitochondrion.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial proteome</italic>.</bold> We next examined the evolutionary history of proteins from the mitochondrial proteome. First, we undertook reciprocal Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches to identify homologs of proteins from the mitochondrial proteome in the apicomplexan parasites <italic>Plasmodium falciparum, Babesia bovis</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>, and the chromerid <italic>Vitrella brassicaformis</italic>. Using this approach, we identified homologs for 71&#x0025; of <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteins in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, 61&#x0025; in <italic>B. bovis</italic>, 28&#x0025; in <italic>C. parvum</italic>, and 83&#x0025; in <italic>V. brassicaformis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>We were next interested in the extent of novelty in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome when compared to non-apicomplexan eukaryotes. We examined conserved orthology groupings of the 421 proteins in the mitochondrial proteome and identified 418 proteins that clustered into 412 separate orthology groups (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orthomcl.org">http://orthomcl.org</ext-link>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2006</xref>)). We identified 86 proteins that were unique to <italic>T. gondii</italic> and closely related coccidians such as <italic>Neospora caninum</italic>, 243 proteins with orthologs in non-apicomplexan eukaryotes, and a set of 89 proteins that were found only in apicomplexans and/or chromerids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; Supplementary File 1).</p>
<p>Novel drug targets against apicomplexans are likely to emerge from proteins which lack homologs in animals. We therefore conducted an orthology analysis comparing the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome to other apicomplexans, chromerids and animals. We found that 51&#x0025; of the mitochondrial proteome lacked orthologs in animals, of which 56&#x0025; had orthologs in other apicomplexans and/or chromerids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The remainder were restricted to <italic>T. gondii</italic> and other coccidian parasites such as <italic>N. caninum</italic>.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Phenotype analyses of the mitochondrial proteome</italic>.</bold> Our data indicate substantial novelty in mitochondrial biology of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and related organisms. Often, such derived features are less important for an organism&#x2019;s survival than proteins that have been conserved across evolution. A recent genome-wide, CRISPR-based loss-of-function screen in <italic>T. gondii</italic> found that genes conserved in eukaryotes were, in general, more important for parasite fitness than genes with a more restricted phylogenetic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether the same was true for mitochondrial proteins, we analysed the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome using the Sidik et al data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). The Sidik et al study ascribed phenotype scores to each gene in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> nuclear genome, with more negative scores indicative of a greater importance for a gene&#x2019;s contribution to parasite fitness. The Sidik et al study found that most genes that were important for parasite growth had phenotype scores of below -2, and most dispensable genes had phenotype scores of greater than -2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). Based on this, we categorised proteins in the mitochondrial proteome as dispensable (phenotype score &#x003E;-2), important (-2 to -4), or critical (&#x003C;-4) for parasite growth. Notably, 35&#x0025; of proteins from the mitochondrial proteome were critical, and 39&#x0025; were important, for parasite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; Supplementary File 1). Of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteins with orthologs in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, &#x007E;75&#x0025; were important or critical, and similar values apply for those with orthologs in <italic>B. bovis, C. parvum</italic>, and <italic>V. brassicaformis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Of the proteins conserved between <italic>T. gondii</italic> and apicomplexans/chromerids, over 80&#x0025; were important or critical for parasite growth, while over 70&#x0025; of proteins collectively found in apicomplexans, chromerids and animals were important or critical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; Supplementary File 1).</p>
<p><bold><italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 is important for mitochondrial oxygen consumption in <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</bold> Having identified &#x007E;175 proteins in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome that have no clear orthologs outside the apicomplexan/chromerid lineage, and no predicted function, we embarked on a broad project to characterise the importance and role of these proteins. In the remainder of this manuscript, we focus on one such protein, annotated as TGGT1_264040, which (for reasons that will become apparent) we termed <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25. <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 belongs to an OrthoMCL ortholog grouping that is restricted to apicomplexans, contains no recognisable functional domains, and is important for parasite fitness. It has a predicted molecular mass of 25 kDa, and we confirmed its localisation to the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R</xref>). To establish the importance of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 for parasite growth, and to facilitate subsequent characterisation of its function, we replaced the native promoter of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 with an anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-regulated promoter using a CRISPR-based genome editing approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5_1">Figure 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 1A</xref>). We performed PCR screening analysis to identify clonal parasites that had integrated the ATc-regulated promoter into the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5_1">Figure 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). We termed the resultant ATc-regulated <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 strain &#x2018;r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25&#x2019;. We then introduced a HA tag at the 3&#x2019; end of the open reading frame of the r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 locus. We termed the resultant HA-tagged, ATc-regulated <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 strain &#x2018;r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA&#x2019;. To measure the extent of target protein knockdown upon the addition of ATc in the r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 strain, we cultured parasites in the absence of ATc, or in the presence of ATc for 1&#x2013;3 days, then undertook western blotting. This revealed substantial depletion of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA 2 days after ATc addition, with the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA protein barely detectable after 3 days in ATc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To determine the importance of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 on parasite growth we compared plaque sizes of parental wild type (WT) and r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites grown in the absence or presence of ATc for 9 days. This revealed that growth of r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25, but not WT, parasites was severely impaired in the presence of ATc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-C</xref>). Interestingly, r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites grew better in the absence of ATc than WT parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-C</xref>). To determine whether the growth phenotype observed upon <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown was specifically due to loss of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25, we complemented the r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 strain with a constitutive copy of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 (generating a strain we termed c<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA/r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25). The presence of the constitutive copy of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 restored growth of r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites in the presence of ATc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-C</xref>).</p>

<p>A major function of the mitochondrion is in oxidative phosphorylation, where the catabolism of organic molecules by the TCA cycle and other metabolic pathways contribute electrons to an electron transport chain on the inner membrane of the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">van Dooren et al., 2006</xref>). Electrons are ultimately used to reduce O<sub>2</sub>, with the electron transport chain simultaneously generating a proton gradient across the inner membrane. This proton gradient is then used to drive the F-type ATP synthase, a rotary motor that phosphorylates ADP to form ATP, the energy currency of cells. Defects in any of the processes involved in oxidative phosphorylation will lead to defects in mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub> consumption. To test whether <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 has a role in oxidative phosphorylation, we established an assay to measure O<sub>2</sub> consumption by the parasite using a Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer. We grew r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites in the absence of ATc, or presence of ATc for 1&#x2013;3 days then used the XFe96 analyzer to measure basal mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates (mOCR) in extracellular parasites. This revealed a significant, &#x007E;80&#x0025; depletion in basal mOCR upon <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), concomitant with knockdown of protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>Treatment with the protonophore FCCP uncouples OCR from ATP synthesis and enables the determination of maximal mOCR in parasites. We found that maximal mOCR was also depleted upon <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5_2">Figure 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>). In a concomitant study, we demonstrated that depletion of a component of <italic>T. gondii</italic> ATP synthase led to an increase in the spare capacity of mOCR (i.e. the difference between the basal and maximal mOCR; see accompanying manuscript by Huet et al). We did not observe an increase in spare capacity upon <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5_2">Figure 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 is not a component of ATP synthase. Basal and maximal mOCR in WT parasites were unaffected by the addition of ATc, although, curiously, the spare capacity in WT parasites was greater than in r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites grown in the absence of ATc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5_2">Figure 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>). This is perhaps reflective of changes in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 protein abundance or timing of expression upon replacing the native promoter with the ATc-regulated promoter.</p>
<p>We wondered whether the defect in mOCR upon <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown was the result of general defects in mitochondrial function or parasite viability. To address this, we first measured the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in WT and r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites grown in the absence or presence of ATc. ECAR is measured simultaneously with OCR by the XFe96 analyzer. In mammalian cells, ECAR is thought to depend on the extrusion of lactate, and is therefore a measure of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ferrick et al., 2008</xref>). The contribution of glycolysis and other processes that acidify the extracellular medium (e.g. activity of the plasma membrane proton pump of these parasites; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Moreno et al., 1998</xref>)) to ECAR in <italic>T. gondii</italic> are not yet understood. Nevertheless, we can use ECAR measurements as a general indication of parasite metabolic activity. ECAR levels in WT parasites was approximately 40 mpH/min/1.5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> parasites, and slightly less in r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasite grown the absence of ATc. Growth of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites for 2 or 3 days in ATc resulted in a slight increase in ECAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that parasites remained metabolically active upon <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown. As a control for non-metabolically active parasites, we treated WT parasites with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide for 24 hr, which would be expected to deplete key metabolic enzymes in the parasite. XFe96 measurements revealed that both mOCR and ECAR were depleted upon cycloheximde treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), consistent with a general loss of parasite metabolism leading to simultaneous defects in mOCR and ECAR. We conclude that parasites remain metabolically active in the absence of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25.</p>
<p>Next, we asked whether knockdown of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 led to general defects in mitochondrial morphology. We performed immunofluorescence assays labelling the mitochondrion in r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites grown in the absence or presence of ATc. This revealed no gross morphological defects in mitochondrial morphology upon the loss of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5_3">Figure 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 3A</xref>). Finally, we asked whether <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites remained viable upon knockdown of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25. We pre-incubated r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites in the presence of ATc for 3 days. We then set up plaque assays in the absence or presence of ATc, comparing parasite growth with parasites that had not been pre-incubated in ATc. As expected, parasites that were maintained in ATc for the duration of the plaque assay underwent minimal growth, regardless of whether they were pre-incubated in ATc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5_3">Figure 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 3B</xref>). Notably, plaque number and size were equivalent between pre-incubated and non-pre-incubated parasites when grown in the absence of ATc. This reveals that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown is reversible and, importantly, that r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites treated for 3 days on ATc have equivalent viability to r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 not grown on ATc.</p>
<p>The data presented here indicate that the defects we observed in mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub> consumption upon <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown are not due to general defects in parasite viability, metabolism or mitochondrial morphology. We conclude that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 has an important, specific role in oxidative phosphorylation in <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 is a component of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase.</bold> Our findings that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 is critical for mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub> consumption prompted us to investigate whether this protein is a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain that mediates O<sub>2</sub> consumption. The mitochondrial electron transport chain consists of several large protein complexes. To determine whether <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 exists in a protein complex, we extracted proteins from <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA parasites using 1&#x0025; (v/v) Triton X-100 detergent, and separated these proteins by blue native-PAGE, a technique that preserves the native conformation of proteins and protein complexes. Western blotting of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA extracts separated by blue native-PAGE and detected with anti-HA antibodies revealed that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA exists at a molecular mass of &#x007E;600 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, the monomeric form of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA, extracted from parasites and separated by SDS-PAGE, had a mass of approximately 25 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We conclude that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 is a component of a &#x007E;600 kDa protein complex in the parasite mitochondrion.</p>

<p>To elucidate the proteins that comprise the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-containing complex, we immunoprecipitated <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA and associated proteins with anti-HA-coupled agarose beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6_1">Figure 6 &#x2013; figure supplement 1A</xref>), then performed mass spectrometry to identify the proteins that were part of this complex. As a negative control, we immunopurified <italic>Tg</italic>Tom40-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6_1">Figure 6 &#x2013; figure supplement 1B</xref>), the central protein of the &#x007E;400 kDa translocon of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Dooren et al., 2016</xref>), and subjected these extracts to mass spectrometry-based protein identification. Using this approach, we identify 12 proteins, including <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25, that were enriched in the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA immunoprecipitation compared to the <italic>Tg</italic>Tom40-HA immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary File 5). Of these 12 proteins, three are annotated as being canonical components of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX, also known as Complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These proteins included <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2A (TGGT_226590) and <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2b (TGGT1_310470), split Cox2 homologs that are found in apicomplexans and which have previously been localised to the mitochondrion of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Funes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Morales-Sainz et al., 2008</xref>), as well as <italic>Tg</italic>Cox5b (TGGT1_209260). Profile hidden Markov model similarity searches revealed that 7 of the remaining 8 <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-associated proteins have homologs in other apicomplexans as well as in chromerids, whereas one (TGGT1_265370; <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox16) is restricted to <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). All of the proteins detected were identified in the mitochondrial proteome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary File 1), including TGGT1_297810 (<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox30), an HA-tagged version of which we previously confirmed localizes to the mitochondrion in immunofluorescence assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3X</xref>).

<p>As a direct test for whether <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 interacts with <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a, we introduced a FLAG epitope tag into the native locus of <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a in the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA background strain, generating a strain we termed <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a-FLAG/<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7_1">Figure 7 &#x2013; figure supplement 1A-B</xref>).

<p>To test whether <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 interacts with <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox30, we introduced a FLAG epitope tag into the native locus of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 in the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox30-HA background, generating a strain we termed <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-FLAG/<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox30-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7_1">Figure 7 &#x2013; figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Western blots of proteins separated by blue native-PAGE indicated that both <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-FLAG and <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox30-HA exist in a &#x007E;600 kDa protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox30 with anti-HA antibodies purified <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 but not <italic>Tg</italic>AtpB or <italic>Tg</italic>Tom40, and immunoprecipitation of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 with anti-FLAG antibodies co-purified <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox30 but not <italic>Tg</italic>AtpB or <italic>Tg</italic>Tom40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We conclude that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-FLAG and <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox30-HA exist in the same protein complex.</p>
<p>Combined with the observation that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 is important for mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub> consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), these data are consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 and <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox30 are components of the parasite COX complex, the terminal oxidase of the mitochondrial electron transport chain that facilitates the reduction of O<sub>2</sub>. To reflect their apparent phylogenetic restriction to apicomplexans and related organisms, we have termed the apicomplexan-specific components of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> COX complex as &#x201C;ApiCox&#x201D; proteins, with the numerical suffix indicating the predicted molecular mass of the protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether proteins from the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 complex might have structural similarity to known proteins, we queried each protein enriched in the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 immunoprecipitation against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using HHPRED, a profile hidden Markov model search tool that also incorporates secondary structure information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a, <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2b and <italic>Tg</italic>Cox5b had homology to equivalent cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase proteins from other eukaryotes (probability &#x003E; 99&#x0025;, e value &#x003C; 5.1 e<sup>&#x2212;16</sup> for each). Interestingly, <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 had predicted homology to cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase complex subunit 6A from <italic>Bos taurus</italic> (PDB annotation 5B1A_T; probability 90.9&#x0025;, e value 0.58) and <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox23 had predicted homology to cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase complex subunit 4 from <italic>Bos taurus</italic> (PDB annotation 5B1A_D; probability 95.57&#x0025;, e value 0.0057). None of the remaining ApiCox proteins were matched to proteins from PDB with any great confidence (probability of homology to the top &#x201C;hit&#x201D; &#x003C; 70&#x0025;, e value &#x003E; 5 for all).</p>
<p>To obtain insights into the role of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 in the parasite COX complex, we tested the effects of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown on complex integrity. We introduced a FLAG epitope tag into the <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a locus of the r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA parasite strain, generating a strain we term <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a-FLAG/r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7_1">Figure 7 &#x2013; figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). We grew parasites in the absence of ATc or the presence of ATc for 1&#x2013;3 days, then separated protein extracts by SDS-PAGE. As demonstrated previously, ATc treatment led to depletion of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 but not of a <italic>Tg</italic>Tom40 loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 also led to depletion of <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a-FLAG, although not to the same extent as <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). We solubilised proteins from the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA/<italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a-FLAG strain in 1&#x0025; (v/v) Triton X-100 and separated proteins by blue native PAGE. Knockdown of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 led to depletion of the &#x007E;600 kDa COX complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown resulted in the appearance of a &#x007E;400 kDa complex that contains <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Together, these observations are consistent with <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 having an important role COX complex integrity, stability and/or assembly.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this study, we utilised two spatially-restricted biotin tagging approaches to elucidate the proteome of the mitochondrial matrix of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. These complementary approaches identified 421 putative mitochondrial proteins. This number is slightly lower than the 495 proteins identified in the mtAPEX-derived proteome of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>), and is less than the 750 proteins identified in a yeast study using highly purified mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sickmann et al., 2003</xref>). Our proteome identified most of the proteins &#x2018;expected&#x2019; to localize to the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; Supplementary File 3), suggesting a high level of coverage. The lowered numbers of proteins in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome compared to the yeast mitochondrial proteome may represent reduced functions in the parasite organelle compared to that in a metabolically flexible organism such as yeast, although our subsequent analyses (discussed below) are consistent with the presence of a high degree divergent biology in apicomplexan mitochondria.</p>
<p>We experimentally localized 27 previously uncharacterised proteins from the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome, finding that 22 of these localised to the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). From this, we estimate that &#x007E;80&#x0025; of the &#x2018;uncharacterized&#x2019; proteins from the proteome localize to the mitochondrion. Our findings suggest a low false positive rate in the proteins identified from the APEX proteome alone (&#x007E;5&#x0025;), but a higher false positive rate in the mtBirA&#x002A; proteome (&#x007E;20&#x0025;). Based on these analyses, we consider the 213 proteins from the mtAPEX and shared mtAPEX/mtBirA&#x002A; proteomes to be &#x2018;likely&#x2019; mitochondrial proteins, and the 208 proteins found in the mtBirA&#x002A; proteome alone to be &#x2018;possible&#x2019; mitochondrial proteins.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, our study is the first time the APEX and BirA&#x002A; restricted biotinylation approaches have been directly compared in organellar proteomic approaches. Bioinformatic and localization analyses indicate a high level of overlap between the two approaches, but also indicate the presence of unique proteins in both data sets. This suggests that the two approaches provide complementary information that expands the organellar proteome, while at the same time providing confidence in the shared set of proteins that were identified. The mtBirA&#x002A;-derived proteome identified greater numbers of proteins, while also featuring greater numbers of false positives. Several recent studies have used BirA&#x002A; to identify novel proteins in apicomplexan organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kehrer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nadipuram et al., 2016</xref>). Our study is the first time APEX has been used for proteomic applications in apicomplexan parasites, and we suggest that this approach will prove useful in elucidating the proteomes of other apicomplexan organelles (e.g. the apicoplast) or organellar sub-compartments (e.g. the mitochondrial intermembrane space), either by itself or in combination with BirA&#x002A; approaches. Our study suggests that APEX and BirA&#x002A; are powerful tools in determining organellar proteomes in apicomplexans.</p>
<p>Our phylogenetic comparisons suggest that a large number of proteins in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrion have homologs in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; Supplementary File 1). This is consistent with the presence of similar mitochondrial processes and biochemical pathways in these organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Seeber et al., 2008</xref>). The lower value in <italic>C. parvum</italic> is consistent with the reduced function of the mitosome of this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mogi and Kita, 2010</xref>). The shared mitochondrial/mitosomal proteome of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>C. parvum</italic> likely consists of proteins involved in pathways shared between these organisms, such as Fe-S cluster synthesis. Notably, we identified homologs to 83&#x0025; of <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteins in the chromerid <italic>V. brassicaformis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; Supplementary File 1). This mirrors recent findings that several &#x2018;derived&#x2019; features of apicomplexan mitochondria, including the repurposing of the BCKDH, the loss of Complex I and the acquisition of novel TCA cycle enzymes, were already present in the free-living, autotrophic common ancestor of myzozoans (dinoflagellates, chromerids and apicomplexans; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Danne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jacot et al., 2015</xref>)). Notably, most of the ApiCox proteins we identified in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> COX complex had homologs in chromerids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that even conserved mitochondrial processes in this group of organisms have a considerable degree of novelty. Together, these data indicate that much of the mitochondrial biology in <italic>T. gondii</italic> was present in the free-living ancestor that they share with chromerids.</p>
<p>Many (&#x007E;40&#x2013;50&#x0025;) mitochondrial proteins in <italic>T. gondii</italic> lack apparent orthologs in animals and other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-C</xref>). Surprisingly, proteins found only in coccidians, or restricted to apicomplexans and chromerids, were just as likely to be important for parasite growth as proteins conserved across eukaryotic evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that many derived or unique features of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrion (and apicomplexan mitochondria more generally) are critical for parasite survival. This is in contrast to the general proteome of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, where proteins with a restricted phylogenetic distribution are typically less important for parasite survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand the functions of apicomplexan-specific mitochondrial proteins that are important for parasite growth, we have commenced a project to characterize these proteins. In this study, we describe the characterisation of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25, demonstrating that this is a component of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> COX complex. <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 is important for parasite growth and mitochondrial oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 also leads to defects in the integrity of the COX complex. In particular, <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown leads to a depletion of <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a abundance, and also results in the appearance of a smaller, &#x007E;400 kDa <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a-containing complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-F</xref>). These data imply an important role for <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 in the assembly and/or stability of the COX complex. It remains unclear whether loss of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 leads to loss of a &#x007E;200 kDa module from the complex, or whether <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown leads to defects in COX assembly, with the &#x007E;400 kDa complex representing an assembly intermediate. Regardless, loss of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 results in defects in the abundance and integrity of the parasite COX complex, which likely explains the defects in mOCR observed upon <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 knockdown. Future studies will examine the functional role of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 in the COX complex of the parasite.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the parasite COX complex revealed that it is approximately 600 kDa in mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref>), which is larger than the equivalent complex in yeast (200 kDa), mammals (200 kDa) and plants (220/300 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eubel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lenaz and Genova, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Marechal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schagger and Pfeiffer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tsukihara et al., 1996</xref>). It is conceivable that the <italic>T. gondii</italic> COX complex exists in a multimeric form (e.g. a homodimer or homotrimer), and/or that it contains subunits not present in the complex of these other organisms that inflate its mass. Another possibility is that <italic>T. gondii</italic> COX exists in a &#x2018;super-complex&#x2019; with other respiratory complexes, as has been observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eubel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schagger and Pfeiffer, 2000</xref>). Although we cannot rule out that respiratory chain supercomplexes exist in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, the 600 kDa complex is probably not a supercomplex, since we do not observe enrichment of canonical components of other respiratory chain proteins in our proteomic analysis of the complex, and the molecular masses of other respiratory chain complexes in <italic>T. gondii</italic> do not correspond in size to COX (GvD, unpublished observations).</p>
<p>We identified 12 proteins in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> COX complex. In addition to these, it is likely that the complex contains <italic>Tg</italic>CoxI and <italic>Tg</italic>CoxIII, proteins encoded on the mitochondrial genome of the parasite. Although excluded from our statistical analysis due to its absence from the control dataset, a CoxIII homolog was enriched in the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 immunoprecipitation (Supplementary File 5). 14 COX proteins in <italic>T. gondii</italic> is comparable in number to those found in the mammalian (13 proteins) and plant (10 or 12 proteins) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eubel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tsukihara et al., 1996</xref>). Surprisingly, only a few <italic>T. gondii</italic> COX proteins have obvious homologs in eukaryotes outside the myzozoan lineage. Of note, 8 of the 9 ApiCox proteins we identified have homologs in chromerids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), while none of these have clear homologs in ciliates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orthomcl.org">http://orthomcl.org</ext-link>), the eukaryotic lineage that is the sister taxon to myzozoans. This suggests either a high degree of novelty in the proteins that comprise the <italic>T. gondii</italic>/myzozoan COX complex, or that the sequences of ApiCox proteins have diverged to the extent that they are no longer easily recognisable by sequence comparisons. Notably, similarity searches that incorporate secondary structure information suggest that ApiCox25 and ApiCox23 may have homology to Cox6a and Cox4, respectively, from animals. A priority in the field is to establish the structure of the COX complex in myzozoans, which will reveal whether ApiCox proteins have structural equivalents in other eukaryotes. Regardless of their degree of novelty, our observations are consistent with other observations that suggest a considerable divergence in the mitochondrial biology of organisms in the myzozoan lineage compared to other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Danne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jacot et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study highlights the divergence of mitochondrial proteomes across the eukaryotic domain of life. Future studies will be aimed at elucidating the function of other <italic>T. gondii-</italic> and myzozoan-specific mitochondrial proteins, since these proteins will provide insights into unique functions of the organelle. Given their importance to parasite growth, and their absence (or divergence) from the host organisms that they infect, these <italic>T. gondii</italic> and apicomplexan-specific proteins are prime drug targets.</p>

<sec id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<p><bold>Parasite culture.</bold> <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites were passaged in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), and cultured in Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modified Eagle&#x2019;s Medium, supplemented with 1&#x0025; (v/v) fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.

To generate a <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain expressing a mitochondrial matrix-targeted BirA&#x002A;, we amplified the coding sequence of BirA&#x002A; using the primers 5&#x2019;-GATCAGATCTAAAATGCCTAGGGGTTCTGGCGGTGACAAGGACAACACCG and 5&#x2019;-GATCTCTAGACTTCTCTGCGCTTCTCAGGGAGA and the vector pBirA&#x002A;-3XHA-LIC-DHFR as template ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>); a gift from Peter Bradley, University of California Los Angeles). The resultant product was digested with <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Xba</italic>I and ligated into the <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Avr</italic>II sites of pgCM3 (GvD, unpublished). The BirA&#x002A;-3x c-myc cassette of the resultant vector was digested with <italic>Avr</italic>II and <italic>Not</italic>I and ligated into the equivalent sites of the Hsp60<sub>L</sub>-mDHFR in pBTM<sub>3</sub> vector. This fuses the mitochondrial targeting sequence of <italic>Tg</italic>Hsp60 to 3x c-myc-tagged BirA&#x002A;. The resultant vector was transfected into RH&#x0394;<italic>hxgprt</italic> strain <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites, and selected on phleomycin.</p>
<p>For localising candidate mitochondrial proteins from the proteome (including <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 and <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox30), we amplified the 3&#x2019; region of 27 target genes using the primers listed in Supplementary File 4. We digested resultant PCR products with enzymes suitable for subsequent ligation into the <italic>Spe</italic>I, <italic>Bgl</italic>II and/or <italic>Avr</italic>II sites of the vector pgCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rajendran et al., 2017</xref>), as outlined in Supplementary File 4. The resulting vector was linearized with an enzyme that cut once in the flanking sequence, transfected into TATi/&#x0394;<italic>ku80</italic> strain parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sheiner et al., 2011</xref>), and selected on chloramphenicol as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Striepen and Soldati, 2007</xref>). The resultant parasite strains have a 1xHA tag fused to the 3&#x2019; end of the open reading frame of the target gene, enabling subsequent localisation of the target protein by immunofluorescence assays.</p>
<p>To introduce an ATc-regulated promoter into the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 locus, we generated a vector expressing a sgRNA targeting the region around the start codon of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25. To do this, we modified the vector pSAG1::Cas9-U6::sgUPRT (Addgene plasmid &#x0023; 54467; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shen et al., 2014</xref>)) using Q5 site-directed mutagenesis (New England Biolabs) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). For site-directed mutagenesis, we used the primers 5&#x2019;-<underline>TCACGTGTAAACAGGGGAGT</underline>GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG (sgRNA region specific to the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 is underlined) and the universal reverse primer 5&#x2019;-AACTTGACATCCCCATTTAC. We also PCR amplified the ATc-regulated promoter plus a &#x2018;spacer&#x2019; region consisting of part of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> DHFR open reading frame and 3&#x2019; UTR using the pPR2-HA3 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Katris et al., 2014</xref>) as template and the primers 5&#x2019;-GCCTGGCATAAAATTCGGGGACTGATTTCTCCACGTCACGTGTAAACAGGGGTTGCA GGCTCCTTCTTCGG and 5&#x2019;-ACGATCGGCGCTCCGGCGAAGCGGAGTAGTAAAGATGTCCGCAACATCTTGGTTGA AGACAGACGAAAGCAGTTG, which each contain 50 bp of sequence specific for the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 locus. The sgRNA expressing vector, which also expressed GFP-tagged Cas9, was co-transfected into TATi/&#x0394;<italic>ku80</italic> strain parasites along with the ATc-regulatable promoter as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Striepen and Soldati, 2007</xref>). GFP-positive parasites were selected and cloned 3 days following transfection. Clones were screened for successful integration of the ATc-regulatable promoter using the primers <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 fwd (5&#x2019;-CGTAGGAAAACTGTTCCCAGAGC) and <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 rvs (5&#x2019;-GCACTTCTTCTGAAAGTTGATACG), or t7s4 fwd (5&#x2019;-ACGCAGTTCTCGGAAGACG) and <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 rvs.</p>
<p>To generate a vector that constitutively expressed <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 for complementing the r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 mutant, we PCR amplified the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 open reading frame with the primers 5&#x2019;-CATGGGATCCAAAATGTTGCGGACATCTTTACTACTCC and 5&#x2019;-CATGCCTAGGGTGAAAGTGAGGTGGCTCCAGTT. We digested the resulting PCR product with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Avr</italic>II and ligated this into the <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Avr</italic>II sites of the vector pUgCTH<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rajendran et al., 2017</xref>). The resulting vector was linearized with <italic>Mfe</italic>I, transfected into r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites, and selected on chloramphenicol as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Striepen and Soldati, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To FLAG tag the native locus of <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a, we generated a vector expressing a sgRNA targeting the region around the stop codon of <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a. To do this, we modified the pSAG1::Cas9-U6::sgUPRT vector using Q5 mutagenesis with the primer 5&#x2019;-<underline>CGAGTCGCCTGTTGACGACG</underline>GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG (gene-specific region of the sgRNA underlined) and the universal reverse primer (as described above). We also amplified a FLAG tag containing 50 bp of flanking sequence either side of the <italic>Tg</italic>Cox2a stop codon, using the primers 5&#x2019;-GACAGTGGTACTGGATCTACGAAGTCGAGTCGCCTGTTGACGACGAAGAGGGTGGAGGTAGCGGTGGTGGAAG and 5&#x2019;-CTGCCCATTCAACGCTCGGACAGCCGTCCTTTAGGAAACGCATAGGAAGCGCTTCTGTGGGCGGTTATCAGG, with FLAG template synthesized as a gBlock (IDT). The FLAG tag gBlock sequence was as follows: 5&#x2019;-GTGGAGGTAGCGGTGGTGGAAGTGACTACAAAGACCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGTAGTCCTGATAACCGCCCACAGA AGC. We co-transfected the plasmid and PCR product into <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA or r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA strain parasites, selected GFP positive parasites by flow cytometry 3 days post-transfection, then screened for successful integrants using the primers 5&#x2019;-CTCTTGTACATGCTCGACGAAG and 5&#x2019;-AACGACTGTGATTCCAAAACCT.</p>

<p><bold>Synthesis of biotin-phenol.</bold> Biotin phenol was synthesised as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>). 50 mg/ml biotin (Sigma) was slowly mixed with 1.1 equivalents of 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium (Sigma) and 3.0 equivalents of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Sigma). The mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature, then 1.0 equivalent of tyramine (Sigma) was added slowly. The resulting solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. The synthesised biotin-phenol was purified from the unreacted material with a Reveleris flash chromatography system (Grace, MD, USA) and a C18-WP 4g column, using an acetonitrile/water gradient. Eluting compounds were monitored with a UV detector (220 nm, 278 nm, and 350 nm) and an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) coupled to the flash chromatography system. The eluted biotin-phenol in acetonitrile/water mixture was freeze-dried and reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide at a final concentration of 200 mM. The purity of biotin-phenol was confirmed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC, Dionex).</p>
<p><bold>Biotinylation approaches.</bold> For biotin-phenol labelling, freshly egressed wild type or mtAPEX-expressing parasites were resuspended in parasite growth medium. Biotin-phenol was added to the parasites at final concentration of 1 mM, and parasites were incubated at 37&#x00B0;C for 1 hr. Biotinylation was initiated by the addition of 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 45 sec, and halted by centrifuging cells at 12,000g for 30 sec. The medium was removed, and parasite cells were washed three times in quenching solution (10mM sodium azide, 10mM sodium ascorbate, and 5mM Trolox in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), and once in PBS. Cell pellets were stored at -80&#x00B0;C until further processing.</p>
<p>For biotin-labelling, host cells were infected with wild type or mtBirA&#x002A;-expressing parasites. Biotin was added to infected host cells &#x007E;48 hours after infection, to a final concentration of 1 mM. Infected host cells were cultured for a further 24 hours, during which time they naturally egressed from host cells. Parasites were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 g and washed 3 times in PBS. Cell pellets were stored at -80&#x00B0;C until further processing.</p>
<p>Biotin treated parasite pellets were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1&#x0025; (w/v) SDS, 0.5&#x0025; (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1&#x0025; (v/v) Triton X-100, Complete protease cocktail (Roche)) for 30 min on ice. Biotin-phenol treated parasite pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer containing quenching agents (10 mM sodium azide, 10mM sodium ascorbate, and 5 mM Trolox). 3 independent lysate pools of WT parasites treated with biotin-phenol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, mtAPEX-expressing parasites treated with biotin-phenol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, WT parasites treated with biotin, and mtBirA&#x002A;-expressing parasites treated with biotin were generated, and protein concentration was quantified using Bradford reagent (Sigma).</p>
<p>For enrichment of biotinylated proteins with streptavidin beads, 8 mg of protein from each pool was diluted with RIPA buffer to reach 1.8 ml total volume. 223 &#x00B5;l of streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Thermo Scientific) per pool was dispensed in 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes. A magnabind magnet (Thermo Scientific) was used to separate beads from the buffer solution. Beads were washed three times in RIPA buffer, and incubated with the corresponding lysate pools for 1 hr at room temperature with gentle rotation. The beads were then washed three times in RIPA buffer, once with 2M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and a further three times in RIPA buffer. The resin-bound proteins were treated with reducing solution (10mM DTT in 100mM ammonium bicarbonate) for 30 min at 56&#x00B0;C. The reducing solution was removed, and replaced with alkylation solution (55 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate) and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 45 min. The alkylation solution was then removed, and the beads were washed in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min with gentle agitation. The ammonium bicarbonate solution was removed, and samples treated with 20 ng/&#x00B5;l sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) overnight (18 hrs) at 37&#x00B0;C. The next day, the supernatant was collected and beads were further treated with 10 &#x0025; (v/v) formic acid, and incubated for 15 min at 37&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>The volume of peptide filtrates was reduced to &#x007E;12 &#x00B5;l in a centrifugal evaporator. Zip tips containing 0.6 &#x00B5;l C18 resin (Millipore) were washed with 10 &#x00B5;l methanol, and 10 &#x00B5;l 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formic acid. The digested peptides were loaded onto the tips by pipetting the peptide solutions 10 times. The tips were then washed with 10 &#x00B5;l 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formic acid twice, and the peptides were eluted into Chromacol 03-FISV vials with conical 300 &#x00B5;l inserts using 50&#x0025; acetonitrile/0.1&#x0025; formic acid (v/v), and dried in a vacuum concentrator.</p>
<p>MS analysis was performed on a Q-Exactive Classic mass spectrometer as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Delconte et al., 2016</xref>). Raw files consisting of high-resolution MS/MS spectra were processed with MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8) for feature detection and protein identification using the Andromeda search engine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cox et al., 2011</xref>). Extracted peak lists were searched against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> ME49 (ToxoDB-12.0) databases and a separate reverse decoy database to empirically assess the false discovery rate (FDR) using strict trypsin specificity allowing up to 3 missed cleavages. The minimum required peptide length was set to 7 amino acids. <italic>Modifications:</italic> Carbamidomethylation of Cys was set as a fixed modification, while N-acetylation of proteins and oxidation of Met were set as variable modifications. The mass tolerance for precursor ions and fragment ions were 20 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. The &#x201C;match between runs&#x201D; option in MaxQuant was used to transfer identifications made between runs on the basis of matching precursors with high mass accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>). PSM and protein identifications were filtered using a target-decoy approach at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1&#x0025;.</p>
<p><bold>Quantitative proteomics pipeline.</bold> Statistically-relevant protein expression changes were identified using a custom pipeline as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Delconte et al., 2016</xref>). Probability values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini&#x2013;Hochberg method. Cut-off lines with the function y &#x003D; -log<sub>10</sub>(0.05)&#x002B;c/(x-x<sub>0</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Keilhauer et al., 2015</xref>) were introduced to identify significantly enriched proteins. c was set to 0.2 while x<sub>0</sub> was set to 1 representing proteins that are differentially expressed within 1 or 2 standard deviations.</p>
<p><bold>Bioinformatic analyses of data.</bold> Homologs of <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome proteins were identified in the apicomplexan parasites <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (strain 3D7), <italic>C. parvum</italic> and <italic>B. bovis</italic>, and the chromerid <italic>V. brassicaformis</italic>, through reciprocal Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches. <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome proteins were used as query sequences in initial searches using target protein databases from relevant EupathDB websites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://PlasmoDB.org">http://PlasmoDB.org</ext-link>&#x2013;<italic>P. falciparum</italic>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://PiroplasmaDB.org">http://PiroplasmaDB.org</ext-link> &#x2013; <italic>Babesia bovis</italic>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://CryptoDB.org">http://CryptoDB.org</ext-link> &#x2013; <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> and <italic>Vitrella brassicaformis</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aurrecoechea et al., 2013</xref>)). Hits from the initial BLAST search were queried in reciprocal BLAST searches against the <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://toxodb.org">http://toxodb.org</ext-link>), regardless of the score or E-value obtained. Hits that returned the corresponding <italic>T. gondii</italic> protein that was originally searched against were considered as a homolog. Expect (E) values obtained from the initial BLAST search and the reciprocal BLAST search were recorded (Supplementary File 1). Homologs of proteins identified in the purified ApiCox25 complex were identified using the profile hidden Markov model search tool HMMER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Ortholog grouping for each protein was obtained from ToxoDB. Each ortholog group was assessed for the presence of ortholog proteins in other eukaryotic organisms based on the phyletic information available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://OrthoMCL.org">http://OrthoMCL.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). Information of ortholog grouping for the entire genome of the chromerid <italic>V. brassicaformis</italic> were sourced from CryptoDB, and were subsequently compared to the ortholog groups identified for the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial proteome. HHPRED predictions were performed using the MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/&#x0023;/tools/hhpred">https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/&#x0023;/tools/hhpred</ext-link>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>)).</p>
<p>The presence of predicted mitochondrial targeting peptides was assessed using MitoProt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Claros and Vincens, 1996</xref>), with the probability of export into the mitochondria recorded (Supplementary File 1). Metabolic pathway enrichment was assessed using the Metabolic Pathway search tool on ToxoDB, using a <italic>p</italic> value cut-off of &#x003C;0.05.</p>
<p><bold>Immunofluorescence assays and microscopy.</bold> IFAs were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">van Dooren et al., 2008</xref>). Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-c-myc (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz clone 9E10), rat anti-HA (1:200 dilution; Sigma clone 3F10), and rabbit anti-Tom40 (1:2000 dilution; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Dooren et al., 2016</xref>)). Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500 dilution; Life Technologies), goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 (1:100 to 1:500 dilution; Life Technologies), goat anti-rat CF 488A (1:100 to 1:500 dilution; Sigma), and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546 (1:500 dilution; Life Technologies). Biotinylation was performed as outlined for the proteomics, except that mtAPEX samples were incubated in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 min. For visualising biotinylated proteins, we used Oregon Green-conjugated avidin (1:1,000 dilution; Life Technologies). Images were acquired on a DeltaVision Elite deconvolution microscope (GE Healthcare) fitted with a 100X UPlanSApo oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.40). Images were deconvolved and adjusted for contrast and brightness using SoftWoRx Suite 2.0 software, and subsequently processed using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p><bold>Immunoprecipitations.</bold> Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Dooren et al., 2016</xref>), except that parasite samples were solubilized in 1&#x0025; (v/v) Triton X-100. HA-tagged proteins were purified using anti-HA affinity matrix (Sigma; rat anti-HA clone 3F10 antibodies) and FLAG-tagged proteins were purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma; mouse anti-FLAG clone M2 antibodies). For mass spectrometry sample preparation, anti-HA beads bound with HA-tagged protein complexes were frozen at -80&#x00B0;C for 1 hr, then eluted at 37&#x00B0;C in 0.2 M glycine containing 1&#x0025; (v/v) Triton X-100 (pH 2.3). Samples were neutralized in ammonium bicarbonate, then extracted in chloroform:methanol as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pankow et al., 2016</xref>). After extraction, the pellets were dried and stored at -80&#x00B0;C before mass spectrometry analysis at the Mass Spectrometry Facility, La Trobe University Institute for Molecular Science. Peptides were searched against the UniProt TOXGV (<italic>T. gondii</italic>) database using strict trypsin specificity allowing up to 2 missed cleavages. <italic>Modifications:</italic> Carbamidomethylation of Cys was set as a fixed modification, and N-acetylation of proteins and oxidation of Met were set as variable modifications. The mass tolerance for fragment ions was 0.5 Da. Statistical validation of peptide spectra matches was performed using PeptideProphet.</p>
<p><bold>SDS-PAGE, Blue Native-PAGE and immuno/affinity-blotting.</bold> SDS-PAGE and protein blotting were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">van Dooren et al., 2008</xref>), except that membranes used for neutravidin blotting were blocked with 3 &#x0025; (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Blue native PAGE was performed using the NativePAGE system (Thermo Scientific) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">van Dooren et al., 2016</xref>). Blots were probed with antibodies against mouse anti-c-myc (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz clone 9E10), rabbit anti-Hsp60 (1:1000 dilution; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tonkin et al., 2004</xref>)), rabbit anti-<italic>T. gondii</italic> cyt <italic>c</italic> (1:500 dilution; E.T. and G.v.D., unpublished), rat anti-HA (1:500 to 1:1000 dilution; Sigma clone 3F10), mouse anti-FLAG (1:500 to 1:2000 dilution; Sigma clone M2), and rabbit anti-AtpB (1:500; Agrisera, catalog number AS05 085). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rat and anti-rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used at 1:5,000 dilution. For probing for mouse antibodies on immunoprecipitation western blots, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse TrueBlot ULTRA antibodies (eBioscience) were used at 1:5,000 dilution. Neutravidin-HRP (Life Technologies) was used to detect biotinylated proteins on membranes at 1:10,000 dilution.</p>
<p><bold>Seahorse XFe96 Extracellular flux analysis.</bold> Wild type (TATi/&#x0394;<italic>ku80</italic>) and r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 parasites were grown in the absence of ATc, in the presence of ATc for 1&#x2013;3 days, or with 100 &#x00B5;M cycloheximide for 1 day. Parasites were filtered through a 3 &#x00B5;m polycarbonate filter and washed twice in Seahorse XF base medium (Agilent Technologies), supplemented with 1 mM L-glutamine and 5 mM D-glucose (supplemented base medium), before resuspension to 1.5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in the supplemented base medium. 96-well Seahorse culture plates were coated with 3.5 &#x00B5;g/cm<sup>2</sup> of CellTak cell adhesive (Corning) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Briefly, 1mg/ml CellTak was diluted 1:50 in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate. 15 &#x00B5;l of CellTak solution was added to each well of a Seahorse cell culture plate and incubated at RT for 20 mins. The solution was removed and the plate washed twice in sterile water, before drying. 100 &#x00B5;l of the parasite suspensions (1.5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> parasites) were seeded into wells of the coated plate, and the plate was centrifuged at 50 g for 3 min. An additional 75 &#x00B5;L of supplemented base medium was added to each well following centrifugation. Parasites were kept at 37&#x00B0;C in a non-CO<sub>2</sub> incubator until the start of experiment. Parasite oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) were measured using an Agilent Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer at 3 minute intervals. To determine the maximal OCR, parasites were treated with 20 &#x00B5;M oligomycin A, B and C mix (Sigma) to inhibit ATP synthase, then subsequently treated with 1 &#x00B5;M carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; Sigma). To determine the non-mitochondrial OCR, parasites were treated with 10 &#x00B5;M antimycin A (Sigma) and 1 &#x00B5;M atovaquone (the minimal concentration that preliminary experiments indicated is sufficient to maximally inhibit mitochondrial OCR). The mitochondrial OCR (mOCR) was calculated by subtracting the non-mitochondrial OCR from the basal and maximal OCR values. A minimum of 4 wells were used for background correction in each assay plate, and 4&#x2013;5 technical replicates were used for each condition. Wells that yielded negative OCR values were excluded from the final analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Miscellaneous data analysis.</bold> XFe96 data were compiled using the Wave Desktop program. Analysis of parasite OCR and ECAR were performed using the R software environment (Source Code File 1). Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to the data, with error between plates and wells (i.e. between and within experiments) defined as the random effect, and the OCR and ECAR measurements in the different parasite strains (WT and r<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25) and the time since ATc-addition defined as the fixed effect. Data from the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25-HA and <italic>Tg</italic>Tom40-HA co-immunopreciptation proteomics were analysed in the R software environment using the EdgeR package (Source Code File 2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Robinson and Smyth, 2008</xref>)). Only proteins identified in both experimental conditions and each biological replicate were included in the final analysis. Graphing of the XFe96 and <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 proteomic data were performed in GraphPad Prism v. 7.0.</p>

To examine genes that are enriched in the mitochondrial matrix proteomes, select &#x201C;down-regulated&#x201D; (i.e. proteins that are less abundant in control samples than in the mito APEX/BirA&#x002A; samples). Next select the desired <bold>P value</bold>. For our analyses, we utilised a P value of &#x2264;0.001. Finally, select the desired <bold>fold difference</bold>. For our analyses, we utilised a log<sub>2</sub> fold change value of &#x2265; 2.5, which corresponds to a fold change of &#x2265; 5.657.</p>

<caption><p>Generating an ATc-regulated promoter replacement strain of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25. (A) Diagram depicting the promoter replacement strategy to generated ATc-regulated <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25. A single guide RNA (sgRNA) was designed to target the <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome near the start codon of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25, and mediate a double stranded break at the target site. A plasmid containing the sgRNA and GFP-tagged Cas9 endonuclease was co-transfected into <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites with a PCR product encoding the ATc regulated &#x2018;t7s4&#x2019; promoter, which contains 7 copies of the Tet operon and a Sag4 minimal promoter, flanked by 50 bp of sequence homologous to the regions immediately up- and down-stream of the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 start codon. The PCR product also contain a &#x2018;spacer&#x2019; region that separates the regulatable promoter from the native promoter of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 gene to enable sufficient regulation. The parasite&#x2019;s homologous repair pathway will mediate integration of the PCR product into the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 locus. The &#x2018;<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 fwd&#x2019;, &#x2018;<italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 rvs&#x2019; and &#x2018;t7s4 fwd&#x2019; primers were used in screening parasite clones for successful integration of the regulatable promoter at the target site. (B-C) PCR screening analysis using genomic DNA extracted from parasite clones to identify clones that had successfully integrated the promoter. (B) Screening using the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 fwd and rvs primers. This will amplify a product of 1,064 bp if the locus is unmodified, and a product of 2,991 bp if the ATc-regulatable promoter has integrated successfully. (C) Screening using the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiCox25 rvs and t7s4 fwd primers. This will amplify a product of 928 bp if the ATc-regulatable promoter has integrated successfully. The analyses in B and C revealed that clone 3 had successfully integrated the ATc-regulatable promoter.</p></caption>
