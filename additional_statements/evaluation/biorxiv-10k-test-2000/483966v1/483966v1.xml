<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>In light of sustainable development goals for 2030, an important priority for Africa is to have affordable, accessible and sustainable hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programmes, delivering screening and treatment for antenatal women and implementing timely administration of HBV vaccine for their babies. We developed a decision-analytic model simulating 10,000 singleton pregnancies to assess the cost-effectiveness of three possible strategies for deployment of tenofovir in pregnancy, in combination with routine infant vaccination: <bold>S1</bold>: no screening nor antiviral therapy; <bold>S2</bold>: screening and antiviral prophylaxis for all women who test HBsAg-positive; <bold>S3</bold>: screening for HBsAg, followed by HBeAg testing and antiviral prophylaxis for women who are HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive. Our outcome was cost per infant HBV infection avoided and the analysis followed a healthcare perspective. S1 predicts 45 infants would be HBV-infected at six months of age, compared to 21 and 28 infants in S2 and S3, respectively. Relative to S1, S2 had an incremental cost of &#x0024;3,940 per infection avoided. S3 led to more infections and higher costs. Given the long-term health burden for individuals and economic burden for society associated with chronic HBV infection, screening pregnant women and providing tenofovir for all who test HBsAg&#x002B; may be a cost-effective strategy for South Africa.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In order to meet targets set by International Sustainable Development Goals for the elimination of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection as a public health problem by the year 2030 (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), enhanced efforts are required to reduce the incidence of new cases. Strategies that set out to achieve this need to be carefully evaluated, both on the grounds of effect on individual and population health, and also based on value for money. HBV infection is highly endemic in many low/middle income settings (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), where economic evaluations are particularly important for informing the appropriate deployment of limited health care resources.</p>
<p>Prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) is a cornerstone of HBV elimination strategies. Reducing vertical transmission is crucial to population health, as up to 90&#x0025; of neonates who are exposed to HBV perinatally become chronic carriers, compared to only 5&#x0025; of those exposed as adults (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Current recommended practice includes screening antenatal women for infection using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and risk-stratification based on further laboratory tests for hepatitis B e-Antigen (HBeAg) and/or HBV DNA viral load (VL), which can be used to stratify the risk of vertical transmission. PMTCT guidelines suggest administering a three dose HBV vaccine to all infants with the first dose administered within 24 hours of birth and two other doses provided at 6 and 10 weeks respectively, as well as administering hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) to high risk babies in the first day of life (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Together, these strategies reduce the rate of vertical transmission by 85&#x0025;-95&#x0025; (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), representing a crucial component of efforts towards HBV elimination (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, breakthrough transmission can occur, especially among mothers with high HBV VL (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), in settings where the first dose of vaccine is delayed, and where HBIg is not available. The use of antivirals during pregnancy can therefore be included as an additional measure to decrease transmission risk (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has a track record of safety and efficacy in this setting (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and is included in some guidelines for HBV PMTCT (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
<p>HBV is endemic in Africa, with a prevalence of &#x003E;8&#x0025; in many populations (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The risk of MTCT in this continent is enhanced by lack of routine antenatal screening (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), deliveries taking place outside healthcare facilities, delayed first dose of HBV vaccine until age six weeks by many vaccine programmes, and limited access to TDF and HBIg (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). A meta-analysis of data from sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) demonstrated a perinatal transmission rate of 38&#x0025; among women who tested positive for HBsAg and HBeAg, in the absence of any PMTCT interventions (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). An important priority for Africa is to have affordable, accessible and sustainable PMTCT programmes that deliver screeningand treatment for antenatal mothers, and oversee timely administration of HBV birth vaccine for their babies (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Providing antiviral treatment for HBV PMTCT relies on HBV diagnosis, but currently there is not widespread access to laboratory-based assays for HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA viral load, and many antenatal programmes do not provide routine HBV screening.</p>
<p>In order to identify the most cost-effective approach to HBV PMTCT we have evaluated antenatal screening for HBV infection using standard laboratory assays for HBsAg and treating HBsAg-positive women with TDF, based on South Africa as a model situation. In recognising the important role that lateral flow assays can play in point of care testing (POCT) for HBsAg, we also assessed the cost effectiveness of this approach to diagnostic screening (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In South Africa, the majority of pregnant women are not routinely screened for HBV infection, vaccination begins at six weeks of age and HBIg is not available. Modelling the cost-effectiveness of HBV PMTCT interventions allows for a combined analysis of clinical outcomes and potential budget impact, which is fundamental to inform financial investment in HBV elimination programmes in sSA countries.</p>

<title>Cost-effectiveness of strategies for HBV PMTCT under base case assumptions</title>
<p>We modelled three different approaches to peri-partum TDF prophylaxis: <bold>S1</bold>: no screening or antiviral therapy; <bold>S2</bold>: screening and antiviral prophylaxis for all women who test HBsAg-positive; <bold>S3</bold>: screening for HBsAg, followed by HBeAg testing and antiviral prophylaxis for women who are HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1</xref>). Based on the simulated scenario of 10,000 singleton pregnancies in South Africa, with no antiviral therapy for HBV PMTCT (S1), and using a laboratory-based assay for HBsAg detection, our model predicts 45 infants would be infected with HBV at age six months (incidence 0.45&#x0025;). If antiviral prophylaxis interventions are employed based on S2 and S3, this would be reduced to 21 and 28 infants, (incidence 0.21&#x0025; and 0.28&#x0025;) respectively, at the cost of deploying the intervention for the whole population. Compared to S1, cost per infection avoided was &#x0024;3,940 for S2, lower than for S3 which would be more costly and avoid a lower number of infections (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Antenatal screening and treating of pregnant women for HBV is not routinely performed in many settings in sSA, despite the high population prevalence of HBV (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In resource-limited settings, screening and providing prophylactic TDF for all pregnant women who are HBsAg positive may be the most efficient strategy, especially when using a POCT. These results are derived from a theoretical model, and careful consideration is needed for application to different real world settings.</p>
<p>Based on existing data for South Africa, screening and treating women with TDF from 28 weeks of pregnancy to four weeks post-delivery reduces the number of infants with HBV at six months. Previous studies have also reported on the safety and effectiveness of TDF for HBV PMTCT (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). There is evidence for the cost-effectiveness of combining antiviral therapy during pregnancy with HBV immunoprophylaxis, as highlighted by a systematic review and meta-analysis carried out in China (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and a study conducted in North America (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study in Thailand conflicted with these findings by reporting no significant benefit of maternal TDF for PMTCT (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The lack of benefit from TDF in this case may be because all infants in the Thai study received birth dose of both HBIg and HBV vaccine, followed by four additional doses of HBV vaccine; this enhanced immunoprophylaxis probably accounts for the low rate of HBV transmission even among mothers who did not receive TDF. However, it is difficult to apply any of these findings to sSA, which differs in having limited (or no) access to HBIg, gaps in vaccine coverage, and delays in the first dose of HBV vaccine (frequently until age six weeks) (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we provide a head-to-head economic analysis of simulated screening for HBsAg alone vs. use of HBsAg in combination with risk stratification using HBeAg. Limited resources and infrastructure have impeded antenatal diagnosis and treatment of HBV (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and stratification of HBsAg-positive antenatal women with HBV DNA level and/or HBeAg to determine eligibility for TDF incurs further cost. Given that TDF is becoming more accessible for HBV treatment in Africa (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and has a well-established safety record as a result of antenatal use in HIV infection, treating all HBsAg positive women should be safe and practical, as well as cost-effective. As this option is simple to implement, it is therefore also most likely to be successful.</p>
<p>Given the high prevalence of HBV in Africa (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), POCT is an appealing route to increasing diagnosis and therefore access to treatment. Although POCT proves advantageous on cost grounds, it is less sensitive than laboratory assays. Furthermore, laboratory support remains key for monitoring response to treatment, identifying and monitoring drug resistance, and evaluating prognosis.</p>
<p>There is a potential risk that increasing population exposure to TDF may increase selection of resistance (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, the genetic barrier to TDF resistance is high, and more data are needed to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of putative drug resistance mutations. When accounting for an estimated background rate of HBV resistance to TDF, we show no change in the cost per infection avoided. While we recognise that TDF resistance is not currently a significant clinical concern, the modelling approach we have developed allows drug resistance to be factored in.</p>
<p>Despite the potential for increased risk of HBV MTCT in HIV/HBV coinfection (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), there is evidence to show that HIV has very little effect on HBV interventions (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Since HIV guidelines now recommend commencement of antiretroviral treatment as soon as HIV diagnosis is made (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), the impact of HIV on HBV PMTCT is further reduced.</p>
<p>We used a simple model with only a single outcome measure, thus overlooking other possible risks/benefits of antiviral therapy, including side-effects, drug interactions, and rebound hepatitis after treatment cessation. However, extensive experience has led to the inclusion of TDF in first-line regimens for HIV, including in pregnant women. Our base values were obtained from published literature, but there are limited data for HBV epidemiology and transmission for most African populations; we have acknowledged the lack of certainty around certain parameters by including confidence intervals. HBV DNA testing is the gold standard approach to HBV diagnosis, but is often not available in resource-limited settings; we therefore used HBeAg status as a surrogate marker to represent infectivity and high VL and assumed 100&#x0025; sensitivity for laboratory-based assays for HBsAg and HBeAg. This does not account for occult infection and other false negatives and may lead to an over-estimation of the cost-effectiveness of maternal TDF.</p>
<p>The assumption that the first dose of HBV vaccine is delayed until age six weeks is an over-simplification: if birth dose vaccine is given more widely or targeted for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, more new infections will be averted.</p>
<p>We used data for South Africa, but recognise that HBV prevalence is substantially higher in other sSA settings (frequently reported at &#x2265;8&#x0025;, the WHO threshold for high endemicity (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)) and this may influence the cost-effectiveness of proposed interventions. The low prevalence rate that we derived from South Africa may be a reflection that many antenatal women themselves received HBV vaccination as infants (if born after 1995). To facilitate cost-effectiveness simulations in other settings where antenatal HBV prevalence might be higher, we have provided an on-line interactive tool.</p>
<p>The findings of this study are applicable to settings where the cost of screening and treatment is publicly funded; in situations where individuals meet the cost of their own screening and treatment, our results cannot be applied to informing public health strategy. Our analysis did not consider the need for healthcare and laboratory infrastructure to support our proposed interventions, costs of monitoring pregnant women during TDF treatment, costs for clinical visits and counselling formothers testing HBsAg positive, leading to an underestimation of the total costs included in providing robust PMTCT. However, this is offset by the potentially very substantial lifelong costs of chronic HBV infection, both to individuals and to society, arising from morbidity and mortality typically affecting young and middle-aged adults. This is difficult to quantify but leads to a substantial burden of chronic disease with economic consequences for the health-care system, as well as imposing financial consequences on families and society (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have developed a simple, theoretical model that allows us to estimate the impact of providing TDF to antenatal women in a lower/middle income country setting, either based on HBsAg status alone, or incorporating risk-stratification with HBeAg. These strategies reflect safe, practical interventions that could reasonably be deployed in many settings. There remains an urgent need for more data to underpin the relevant epidemiology, risks of MTCT, and relative benefits of different interventions in settings across sSA. In order to drive progress towards 2030 elimination targets, sustained investment is required to drive improvements in clinical services, provide universal access to antenatal screening, improve education of the public and health-care workers, and underpin robust deployment of PMTCT interventions including vaccination and TDF therapy.</p>

<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s6a">
<title>Target population and study perspective</title>
<p>We used a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 pregnant South African women to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three different strategies for antiviral therapy with TDF:</p>
<sec id="s6b1">
<title>Strategy 1 (S1): No TDF prophylaxis</title>
<p>No pregnant woman is screened for HBsAg and therefore no HBV treatment is given perinatally. To date, this is the situation in many resource-limited settings in sSA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6b2">
<title>Strategy 2 (S2): Screening and TDF prophylaxis for all women who test HBsAg positive</title>
<p>All pregnant women are screened for HBsAg; those who test positive are treated with TDF from 28 weeks&#x2019; gestation to four weeks post-partum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6b3">
<title>Strategy 3 (S3): Screening and TDF prophylaxis for women who are both HBsAg positive and HBeAg positive</title>
<p>All pregnant women are screened for HBsAg; those who test positive are then screened for HBeAg. Only those who are HBeAg positive are treated with TDF from 28 weeks&#x2019; gestation to four weeks post-partum.</p>
<p>We populated our model with data using a healthcare system perspective and therefore only considered costs that would be directly incurred by the Department of Health (DOH). These costs relate to screening and treatment of HBV infection during pregnancy. Individual patient information was not included in this analysis. Ethics approval was not required for this study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s6b">
<title>Assumptions</title>
<p>For the purposes of this analysis, we made a number of modelling assumptions:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>All pregnancies are singleton and result in the delivery of a live infant;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All infants receive HBV vaccine at 6, 10 and 14 weeks, as per current standard practice in South Africa (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Even for babies born to mothers who are HBsAg&#x002B;, birth dose vaccination is not offered within 24 hours (due to lack of maternal screening);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HBV screening uptake is 100&#x0025; among antenatal women;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HBsAg and HBeAg are tested using laboratory assays which are 100&#x0025; sensitive and specific;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Infants born to mothers who were HBsAg negative were assumed also to be HBsAg negative;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We made assumptions around our point estimates due to lack of data.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="s6c">
<title>Theoretic modelling approach</title>
<p>A decision tree providing a framework for comparison of the three strategies is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. The decision tree considers the period covering weeks 28 through 40 of gestation up to six months postpartum. Model structure was the same for all strategies. HBsAg-positive mothers had a defined probability of being HBeAg positive or negative; these probabilities were the same for all strategies. Children whose mothers were HBsAg positive had a probability of being HBsAg positive themselves (i.e. a case of MTCT). This probability depended on whether the mother was also HBeAg positive and whether antiviral prophylaxis was received by the mother during pregnancy, which varied between strategies.</p>

<title>Measurement of effectiveness</title>
<p><xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows parameters used for input in our model. We searched the published literature, and identified four studies from within the last six years that reported the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women in South Africa (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). To calculate prevalence of HBV infection, we combined the total number of women from each study who tested HBsAg-positive and divided these by the total number of individuals included in these cohorts. From these pooled data, the overall prevalence of HBsAg among pregnant women was 3.6&#x0025; (129/3614). HBeAg status was reported for 126 of these 129; the prevalence of HBeAg among HBsAg&#x002B; women was 29/126 (23&#x0025;).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="483966v1_tbl3.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>We derived point estimates for perinatal transmission with and without antiviral therapy during pregnancy from a published systematic review and a meta-analysis (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the absence of intervention (HBV vaccination, HBIg and/or antiviral therapy), the perinatal transmission rate for HBsAg&#x002B;/HBeAg&#x002B; mothers in sSA was estimated at 38&#x0025;, and for HBsAg&#x002B;/HBeAg-mothers was 4.8&#x0025; (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Due to lack of data, we used these estimates in our model, although we assumed that infants were vaccinated starting at the age of six weeks.</p>
<p>There is only one randomised control trial that examines the efficacy of TDF on HBV PMTCT, in which perinatal TDF reduced the risk of infant HBsAg seropositivity by 71&#x0025; (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, data from a systematic review and meta-analysis estimate this figure as 77&#x0025; (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We therefore reduced the perinatal transmission rate for women receiving no TDF by 71&#x0025; to obtain a point estimate for perinatal transmission rate for those receiving TDF peripartum prophylaxis; these were estimated at 11.1&#x0025; for HBeAg-positive women and 1.4&#x0025; for HBeAg-negative women. We accounted for uncertainty around point estimates, as the original study was conducted in China and with a different protocol (combining TDF during pregnancy in combination with birth dose vaccine and HBIg).</p>
<p>Due to lack of data on HBV antiviral adherence rates among pregnant women in sSA, we used HIV antiretroviral adherence rate among women during and after pregnancy, obtained from a published systematic literature review which included studies from low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>); this is estimated at 73.5&#x0025;. We incorporated an expected adherence of 73.5&#x0025; into the model, assuming that those mothers who didn&#x2019;t adhere would incur the full cost of treatment but would have the same probability of transmission as un-treated women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6e">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Our outcome was the cost per HBV infection avoided among infants at the age of six months. This outcome was selected because it is quantifiable, clinically relevant and could be easily compared between strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6f">
<title>Estimating costs</title>
<p>We derived costs for laboratory assays for HBsAg and HBeAg, and POCT, from a 2015 price list produced by National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) and DOH, South Africa. We used the cost of TDF from International Medical products price guide for year 2015 (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We converted the price of HBsAg laboratory assay (R 108.86), HBsAg POCT (R18), HBeAg laboratory assay (R108.86) and HBV DNA test (R1173.32) from South African Rand to USD; 1 Rand = 0.083 USD as at 1<sup>st</sup> May 2015. HBsAgscreening cost applied to all women in S2 and S3; HBeAg screening costs applied to women who tested positive for HBsAg in S3. TDF costs applied to all women who tested positive for HBsAg in S2, and women who tested positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg in S3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6g">
<title>Scenario analysis</title>
<p>We assessed the impact of three additional scenarios, estimating the number of MTCT cases, costs and incremental cost per infection avoided in each case:</p>
<sec id="s6g1">
<title>(i) Antenatal screening for HBV infection using a rapid point of care test (POCT)</title>
<p>We estimated the cost-effectiveness of using a POCT for HBsAg screening, based on a POCT sensitivity of 97.6&#x0025; and specificity of 100&#x0025;, compared to laboratory ELISA HBsAg testing as the gold standard (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We incorporated this into the model by reassigning the proportion of women expected to test falsely HBsAg-using a POCT into the untreated group and removing the cost of TDF treatment for these individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6g2">
<title>(ii) Recommended PMTCT guidelines: Universal birth dose vaccination and HBIg</title>
<p>To assess the cost-effectiveness of antenatal screening and treating of HBsAg-positive women with TDF in combination with universal birth dose vaccine and HBIg, we estimated that perinatal transmission rate will be reduced by 90&#x0025; (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). To incorporate the impact of TDF in our cohort, we therefore reduced the perinatal transmission rate by 90&#x0025;; MTCT rates were thus estimated for HBsAg&#x002B; women who are HBeAg&#x002B; and HBeAg-at 3.8&#x0025; and 0.48&#x0025; respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6g3">
<title>(iii) HBV resistance to TDF</title>
<p>In order to consider the possible impact of drug resistance on the PMTCT strategies outlined here, we estimated the prevalence of TDF resistance based on HBV sequences retrieved from the HBV database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hbvdb.ibcp.fr/HBVdb/">https://hbvdb.ibcp.fr/HBVdb/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) accessed on the 18<sup>th</sup> April 2018. The numerator was the total number of sequences with mutations associated with reduced sensitivity/resistance to TDF (rtA194T, rtN236T, rtS78T),(<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and the denominator was the total number of sequences available in the database (49/6287, 0.8&#x0025;). This prevalence was incorporated into the model by re-assigning 0.8&#x0025; of those receiving TDF into the untreated category (as although they receive the drug, resistance would render this functionally equivalent to no treatment).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s6h">
<title>Analytic methods and definitions</title>
<p>We used the following definitions:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A strategy was &#x2018;dominated&#x2019; if it had a higher expected cost and more predicted cases of HBV MTCT compared to an alternative strategy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The incremental cost per HBV infection avoided was determined by dividing the difference in cost between two strategies over the difference in number of infections (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We compared the strategies by first applying decision rules to eliminate any strategies which were dominated by others, and then estimated the incremental cost per infection avoided for the remaining strategies.</p>
<p>The combined effect of uncertainty in probability estimates was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis, with 1000 Monte Carlo simulations run. We used triangular distributions to approximate Beta distributions for probabilities. Triangular distributions required a lower and upper bound, with the peak taken as the expected (mean) value. The impact of uncertainty is shown on a cost-effectiveness plane, where sets of incremental costs and number of infections avoided are plotted for S2 and S3, relative to S1.</p>
