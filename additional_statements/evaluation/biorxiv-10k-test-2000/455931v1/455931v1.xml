<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mangrove forests are important habitats for fish. However, their utilisation by fish, and the specific values they confer, are still not fully understood. This study details how fish use mangrove forests in an Indo-Pacific mangrove-coral reef seascape. Sampling was conducted using underwater video cameras (UVCs) to describe spatial and temporal variations in fish assemblages across a small-scale (&#x007E; 2.5 km<sup>2</sup>) system, and over the tidal and lunar cycle. UVCs were deployed in the two main component habitats of mangrove forests: at the mangrove forest edge, and inside the forest (5 m from the forest edge). The patterns of utilisation of fish were established across the tidal and lunar cycle. Proximity to coral reefs had a strong influence on the mangrove fish community, as most fish recorded were reef-associated. Juveniles of 12 reef species were observed, including two species classified as vulnerable on the IUCN list and one endemic species. Fish assemblages on the mangrove edge differed substantially from those inside the forest. Most fish utilised the forest edge with few species making regular use of in- forest habitats, supporting the contention that most fish species remain on the edge and potentially retreat into the forest for opportunistic feeding, or when threatened by larger predators. Species-specific patterns of utilisation varied across the tidal and lunar cycle. Small differences in depth profiles and substrate across the small-scale system had a substantial effect on fish assemblages, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity in these factors. These data provide important information for managers to implement adequate conservation strategies that includes broader interconnected habitat mosaics.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mangrove forests are a fundamental component habitat of mangrove systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], and confer many of the attributes that attract juvenile fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. However, recent work in mesotidal Australia suggests that few fish there penetrate beyond the forest boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. This brings into question the specific ways in which mangrove forests are utilised and indicates the need for studies to characterise fish assemblages at locations with different tidal ranges and contexts, and to investigate how widespread such patterns of utilisation of mangrove forests are.</p>
<p>At a broader scale, studies have found that some mangrove forests, especially in the Indo-Pacific, seem to be used less intensively as nursery or feeding grounds by reef fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] than in the Caribbean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. These observations suggest that not all mangrove forests provide equivalent functions and services. This dissimilarity has been attributed to differences in the settings in which mangrove forests occur (coastal, estuarine, island, embayment), different tidal ranges (micro-, meso- or macrotidal), proximity of other high value habitats such as seagrass beds and coral reefs, or climatic zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Comparing fish assemblages between the Indo-Pacific and the Caribbean in mangrove habitats with similar micro-tidal settings would provide crucial information on how those factors influence the value and functioning of mangrove habitats.</p>
<p>Intertidal mangrove forests are challenging environments, most notably because they are only available to most aquatic organisms while they are flooded at high tide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. In many parts of the Indo-Pacific, the tidal range is greater than in the Caribbean, where mangrove forests are usually continually available to fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The intermittent availability of mangrove forests may explain the low use by fish in the Indo-Pacific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Tidal variation (extent, duration and frequency of flooding) generates a range of constraints for fish utilising mangrove forests. Most obvious is the decrease in water depth and eventual drainage of the forest as the tide ebbs. Several studies have demonstrated that fish undertake regular migrations in tidally driven mangrove systems, with different patterns of mangrove use according to fish species, lunar cycle (neap vs spring tide) and tidal phase (flooding vs ebbing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Migration of fish in response to tidal movements results in substantial connectivity between the three major tropical coastal habitats: coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove forests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], giving rise to the idea that mangrove forests are part of a wider interconnected habitat mosaic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Therefore, investigating tidal and spatial variations in fish assemblages in mangrove forests is a crucial step towards fully appreciating the value and functioning of the whole tropical coastal ecosystem.</p>
<p>The difficulty of sampling these habitats goes a long way to explaining the paucity of information available on fish assemblages inside mangrove forests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. The use of conventional techniques such as underwater visual censuses or netting techniques is restricted across much of the Australasian region where saltwater crocodiles (<italic>Crocodylus porosus</italic>) are common, and where dense mangrove forests reduce the efficiency of most net-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Recently, underwater video has been successfully applied to study in-forest fish assemblages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], most notably because it overcomes a lot of sampling issues, substantially reduces field labour intensity, and allows for high -temporal and -spatial resolution data collection simultaneously in different habitats, such as the edge and the inside of a mangrove forest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>We used underwater cameras on the edge and inside a mangrove forest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], coupled with high frequency depth loggers, to examine how fish use mangrove forests in a micro-tidal Indo-Pacific mangrove-coral reef seascape. In particularly we assessed the fish species that used the mangrove forest, how their utilisation changed between the forest edge and in-forest habitats, and how fish assemblages changed across the tidal cycle.</p>

<sec id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="s2a"><title>Study site</title>
<p>Our study focused on a relatively pristine mangrove forest in Bourak&#x00E9;, South Province of New Caledonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). New Caledonia experiences a semi-arid to tropical climate with annual total rainfall of 1,000 mm, and a mixed semi-diurnal mircrotidal regime (maximum 1.8 m tidal range). Bourak&#x00E9; receives little freshwater inflow with no defined drainage.</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig 1.</label><caption><title>Map and picture of the study system in Bourak&#x00E9;, South Province, New Caledonia.</title><p>The nine study sites in the mangrove channel sampled from the 21 February to 1 March 2017 are represented by their respective number. Light grey areas represent mangrove forest, dark grey areas represent mainland, and white areas represent water.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="455931_fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The area comprises approximately 2.5 km<sup>2</sup> of mangrove forest dominated by <italic>Rhizophora stylosa</italic> on the seaward edge and <italic>Avicennia officinalis</italic> on the landward margin, with a large semi-enclosed central lagoon (1.2 km long, 60 m wide, 1-2 m depth). A channel (20-70 m wide, 2-6 m depth, 700 m long) connects the main lagoon to the coastal waters of Pritzbuer Bay (&#x007E; 20 km<sup>2</sup>). The channel comprises two sheltered inlets (approximately 0.01 km<sup>2</sup> each), and a shallow (1-2 m depth) coral reef platform that extends from the middle of the channel to the edge of the mangrove forest. Coral reefs occur up to a first few meters into the forest in some places (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). We chose a mangrove-coral reef seascape, a setting comparable to the one in which mangrove forests occur in the Caribbean, so we could relate our findings to this other ecoregion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] where many studies have been conducted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>The fish community using the mangrove forest was examined at nine sites on an inland/offshore gradient along the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). To assess differences in fish assemblage composition between edge and inside the forest, sites 1 to 8 comprised 4 paired sites where each odd site number was located on the mangrove forest edge, and even site numbers were located approximately 5 m inside the mangrove forest. Site 9 (considered an edge site in the analyses) was located on the reef platform of the innermost bay, at the edge of scattered mangrove trees slightly away from the main forest. The substrate at sites 1 and 9 consisted of dead corals, small live coral boulders and sand, while on other edge sites it comprised mainly dead corals and small and larger live coral boulders. The substrate was homogeneous and consisted of silt material at in-forest sites.</p>
<p>Fish assemblages were sampled using underwater video cameras (UVCs; Model ATC9K Oregon Scientific) to investigate tidal variations in fish assemblages simultaneously on the edge and inside the forest. Unbaited UVCs mounted on stable bases were deployed at each site during neap (21 to 23 February 2017) and spring tides (28 February to 1 March 2017). A sampling day consisted of cameras first deployed at sites early in the morning (first light), continuing until the battery was fully discharged, and again deployed mid-afternoon at all sites until the battery was again fully discharged (recording lasted between 2h and 2.5h). A total of four sampling days were completed (two during neap tides and two during spring tides). Cameras were positioned around 7 cm above the substrate, facing towards the channel. A marker mounted on a flexible rod (3 mm diameter, 0.5 m long) was placed 0.5 m in front of the camera lens as a visibility indicator to ensure a minimum visibility of 0.5 m was achieved in all videos. Visibility was very good during the sampling period, and fish could be identified confidently up to approximately 2 m from the UVCs in all videos. As depth is one of the main limiting factors to mangrove accessibility, tidal variations in water depth (cm) were measured every 15 minutes at each site with depth loggers (In-Situ Inc. Rugged Troll 100 model).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c"><title>Data analyses</title>
<p>While UVCs allow large amounts of data to be gathered quickly in the field, considerable time is required to process these videos. Therefore, we subsampled the acquired video footage. From the two neap tide sampling days, one day was randomly selected and videos at all sites were processed for that day. For the remaining sampling day, all videos were processed from five sites; being the reef platform (site 9) and two pairs of in-forest and forest edge sites (sites 5-8). The same selection was applied to the two sampling days conducted during spring tides.</p>
<p>Once sediments had settled after camera deployment (typically 2-3 min), videos were viewed using VLC media player (VideoLAN, 2001) and subdivided in 5-min intervals to follow tidal variations in fish assemblages. The occurrence of each fish taxon in each 5-min interval was recorded. Only presence/absence data were recorded to avoid biases induced by count data when using UVCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Fish were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Features useful in discriminating species within some genera or families such as <italic>Plectorhinchus</italic> spp., Mugilidae spp., or Gobiidae spp. were difficult to distinguish in videos, therefore these taxa were identified to genus or family level only. Where possible, juvenile fish were identified based on colour patterns and body shape. Any activity such as feeding, hiding, cruising or escaping was also noted. All fish identifications were validated by two additional experts.</p>
<p>The frequency of occurrence of each taxon was calculated per site (the total number of 5-min intervals in which a taxon was observed at a site was divided by the total number of 5-min intervals recorded at this site). Only taxa with a frequency of occurrence &#x2265; 0.05 at one or more sites were retained for analyses (referred to as &#x201C;common taxa&#x201D;). Taxa with a frequency of occurrence &#x003C; 0.05 (referred to as &#x201C;rare taxa&#x201D;) were excluded from analyses.</p>
<p>Frequency of occurrence of each common taxon in-forest and on the edge was calculated and plotted using horizontal bar plots to investigate differences graphically. The same methodology was followed to investigate differences in frequency of occurrence of fish between neap and spring tides. As fewer fish were observed during spring tides, a logistic regression was performed in R using the presence of any common taxa for each 5-min interval as the dependent variable (1 if any common taxa were observed in the 5-min interval, or 0 if no common taxa were observed), and &#x201C;Lunar phase&#x201D; (neap vs spring) as the independent variable, to determine whether &#x201C;Lunar phase&#x201D; had a significant effect on the presence/absence of taxa.</p>
<p>Depth cumulative time curves were plotted for each site to highlight differences in temporal dynamics. Patterns of mangrove habitat use over flooding and ebbing tide on the edge and in-forest were investigated graphically for each common taxon. Each 5-min interval was allocated to a class of water depth of 10 cm (from 10-20 cm to 120-130 cm) according to the water depth value recorded. The mean frequency of occurrence of each common taxon was then calculated per class of water depth during flooding and ebbing tide. Boxplots were used to represent the average square root transformed frequency of occurrence for each common taxon at each depth interval, and a LOESS curve was used to analyse the general pattern of habitat use. To avoid false absence recordings, only taxa recorded in the habitat of interest were considered. Frequencies of occurrence were square root transformed to reduce the impact of extreme values.</p>
<p>Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) was used to compare fish assemblages among sites during spring and neap tides. The frequency of occurrence of each common taxon was calculated per site per lunar phase. Data were square root transformed to decrease the impact of extreme values, and an nMDS analysis based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, the most appropriate distance measure when using abundance data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], was performed using the package &#x201C;vegan&#x201D; in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Groupings within the nMDS were determined using similarity profile tests (SIMPROF) based on hierarchical clustering at a significance level of 95 &#x0025;.</p>

<p>Fifty-six video deployments were processed (totalling more than 118h of video). Seventy-two taxa from 29 families were recorded, with 36 common taxa (frequency of occurrence &#x2265; 0.05) retained for further statistical analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Most species recorded were marine and reef-associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] including fish of families Scaridae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Siganidae, Acanthuridae, Lutjanidae, or Labridae.</p>

<p>Taxonomic richness was lower at in-forest sites compared to edge sites (21 and 34 common taxa recorded respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2a</xref>). <italic>Fibramia lateralis,</italic> and all the common taxa belonging to the Gobiidae family, except <italic>Cryptocentrus leptocephalus and Asterropteryx</italic> spp., were frequently observed at in-forest sites compared to edge sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2a</xref>). <italic>Lutjanus fulviflamma</italic> was the only common taxon recorded evenly in-forest and edge sites. All the other common taxa were more frequently observed at edge sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2a</xref>).</p>

<p>Lunar phase had a significant impact on presence of common taxa and frequencies of occurrence. Twenty-five of the 36 common taxa had higher frequency of occurrence during neap compared to spring tides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2b</xref>). Moreover, the logistic regression highlighted a significant relationship between lunar phase and fish presence (p&#x003C;0.001), with fish observed less frequently during spring than neap tides.</p>
<p>Average depth was substantially shallower at in-forest than edge sites (neap tides (mean &#x00B1; SE): 34 &#x00B1; 0.57 and 55 &#x00B1; 0.66 cm respectively; spring tides: 48 &#x00B1; 1.11 and 71 &#x00B1; 1.23 cm respectively) as was maximum depth (95 cm and 133 cm respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>). Moreover, in-forest sites were exposed (i.e. not flooded) for 4-5 h per day during neap tides, and 2-3 h per day during spring tides, while sites on the edge were always submerged. Sites could be classified into three groups according to depth profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>): deep edge sites (sites 3, 5, 7; maximum depth 133 cm); shallow edge sites (sites 1 and 9; maximum depth: 107 cm); in-forest sites (sites 2, 4, 6, 8; maximum depth: 95 cm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig 3.</label><caption><title>Site-specific cumulative time curves for depth.</title><p>Each colour represents a paired edge and in-forest site, and edge sites are represented by dashed lines and in-forest sites by solid lines. The dashed dark line indicates the mean cumulative time for depth across all edge sites. The solid black line indicates the mean cumulative time for depth across all in-forest sites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="455931_fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>Frequencies of occurrence of fish varied across the tidally driven depth profile (Figs 4a and 4b). Patterns of fish occurrence were quite similar between edge and in-forest sites with overall frequencies of occurrence highest at mid-tide, especially mid-ebb tide (Figs 4a and 4b), and lowest at extreme depth values (low or high tide).</p>
<fig id="fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig 4.</label><caption><title>Boxplots of average square root transformed frequency of occurrence for each common taxon across depth on a) edge sites; b) in-forest sites.</title><p>The blue line is the LOESS curve representing the general pattern of habitat use for all common taxa considered.

<p>We identified 4 main taxa-specific patterns of utilisation across the depth profile: 1) taxa using mangrove habitats at high tide (High tide users); 2) taxa using mangrove habitats at mid-tide (flood or ebb; Mid-tide users); 3) taxa without any apparent preferences for depth (Generalist users); 4) taxa accessing and leaving mangrove habitats at low depth (Shallow water users) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

Common taxa followed four main patterns of mangrove habitat utilisation across depth: 1) taxa using mangrove habitats at high tide (High tide users); 2) taxa using mangrove habitats at mid-tide (flood or ebb; Mid-tide users); 3) taxa without any apparent preferences for depth (Generalist users); 4) taxa accessing and leaving mangrove habitats at low depth (Shallow water users).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="455931_fig5.tif"/></fig>
<p>Fish composition varied greatly among sites, with distinct assemblages generating four different clusters on the nMDS plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). The 1<sup>st</sup> cluster comprised all the samples conducted in-forest, the 2<sup>nd</sup> cluster comprised 5 of the 6 samples conducted at shallow edge sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>), the 3<sup>rd</sup> cluster comprised all the samples conducted at site 5, and the 4<sup>th</sup> cluster comprised 3 of the 4 samples conducted at site 7 and 1 sample conducted at site 3. The samples conducted on the first day (X) and the ones conducted on the following day (Xrep) during the same lunar phase plotted close to each other on the nMDS plot and were for most of them grouped in the same clusters. Three sites were outliers (1, 3 and 7) during spring tides and did not group into any cluster. This could be explained by the presence of sedentary species (<italic>Cryptocentrus leptocephalus</italic> at site 1, and <italic>Neopomacentrus sp.</italic> at site 7), thus if the camera was placed in front of their home, the same individual was most of the time recorded across the entire video driving the fish assemblage composition (<italic>Neopomacentrus</italic> spp. and). Lunar phase did not influence fish assemblages given that the same sites during spring and neap tides grouped together in the same respective clusters.</p>

<sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mangrove edge and mangrove forest, the two major component habitats of the Bourak&#x00E9; mangrove system, featured distinct taxonomic diversity and fish assemblage composition. Fish assemblages varied substantially across the tidal cycle, with species-specific patterns of mangrove habitat utilisation. Spatial differences in water depth among sites within a same habitat also seemed to influence fish assemblages across this mangrove/coral system.</p>
<p>The setting of this tropical mangrove/coral system influenced the nature of the fish assemblages recorded. At least 72 taxa made use of this relatively small mangrove/coral system, with most species classified as tropical marine and reef-associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Most taxa recorded have not been identified as mangrove-associated in previous studies in coastal estuarine mangroves in the west Pacific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], suggesting that their presence is linked to the proximity of coral reefs, further supporting the contention that mangrove-coral habitats are interconnected. Conversely, many families important in other Indo-Pacific mangrove systems remote from coral reefs, such as Leiognatidae, Ambassidae, Sillaginidae, Terapontidae, or Toxotidae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] were not recorded in Bourak&#x00E9;. Juveniles of at least 12 reef fish species were recorded (<italic>Lutjanus fulviflamma</italic>, <italic>Lutjanus argentimaculatus, Lutjanus russellii</italic>, <italic>Lethrinus</italic> spp. (2 species), <italic>Bolbometopon muriculatum</italic>, <italic>Siganus lineatus</italic>, <italic>Caranx</italic> sp., <italic>Epinephelus caeruleopunctatus</italic>, <italic>Scarus</italic> sp., <italic>Acanthurus</italic> sp., <italic>Neopomacentrus</italic> sp.). Additionally, relatively small individuals of <italic>Epinephelus lanceolatus</italic> and <italic>Acanthopagrus akazakii</italic> were observed. Therefore, juveniles of two species classified as vulnerable on the IUCN list (<italic>E. lanceolatus</italic> and <italic>B. muricatum</italic>), and one endemic species (<italic>A. akazakii</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] used this system. These findings highlight that near-coral mangrove habitats in the Central Indo-Pacific, such as Bourak&#x00E9;, function as important habitats for juvenile reef fish in parallel to the situation in the Tropical Atlantic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].</p>
<p>While early studies concluded that high connectivity between coral reefs and mangroves had little influence on mangrove fish assemblage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], recent evidence suggest that in many instances there are high occurrence of reef-associated fish in mangroves adjacent to reefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. While supporting this idea, the current study emphasises that the utilisation and value of mangrove systems vary locally and cannot be generalised without understanding of location-specific factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Fish assemblages varied temporally across the tidal cycle. Tide-induced depth variation has been linked to changes in fish assemblages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. This result was corroborated here as fish assemblages varied across depths, with more fish observed during mid-tides, and most species generally avoiding extreme shallow or deep water. In fact, fish seem to display species-specific responses to depth with four main patterns identified: taxa using mangrove habitats at high tide (High tide users); 2) taxa using mangrove habitats at mid-tide (flood or ebb; mid-tide users); 3) taxa without any apparent preferences for depth (Generalist users); 4) taxa accessing and leaving mangrove habitats at low depth (Shallow water users). The first two patterns mainly comprised taxa known to use mangrove habitats extensively such as <italic>Fibramia lateralis</italic>, <italic>Lutjanus argentimaculatus</italic>, <italic>Siganus lineatus</italic>, <italic>Gerres oyena</italic>, or species belonging to the Gobiidae family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], while the other two profiles comprised mainly marine and reef-associated species. In essence, rather than accessing mangrove habitats as soon as they become available, many species seem to use mangrove habitats only for a restricted period of time later in the tide. Other studies that looked at variations in fish assemblages across the tidal cycle also reported species-specific responses to the depth profile and highlighted that species using mangrove habitats extensively were accessing them at shallower depth than other less frequently observed species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. These patterns could be the result of behavioural adaptations to avoid adverse DO conditions that can occur early or late in the tide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Species using extensively mangrove habitats must be adapted to tolerate lower depth and DO conditions compare to species occasionally using mangrove habitats when they are more suitable. More studies are needed to link tidal fish migrations with DO conditions in mangrove habitats because DO is likely be a critical environmental factor determining the value of these habitats.</p>
<p>Lunar phase was another influential factor, largely responsible for temporal variations in mangrove utilisation by fish. More fish were detected during neap tide than spring tide, however, taxonomic richness and fish assemblage composition were similar. These data contradict previous studies that observed more fish at spring tide than neap tide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. These authors suggest that spring tides result in more habitats available and for longer duration, attracting more fish. We firstly thought that this result was an artefact of the methodology, with fish disappearing from the field of view as water became too deep. However, we compared fish abundance within the same depth intervals between neap and spring tides, and fish abundance was still significantly lower during spring tides, which suggests that there may be another explanation. One explanation could be that at spring tides fish can access more intertidal habitats, reducing the probability of encounter with the UVCs. We also observed very strong currents in the channel and along the mangrove edge that could prevent fish from benefiting from using mangrove habitats as the energy needed to remain on the mangrove edge may be too high.</p>
<p>This study highlighted clear spatial variations in fish assemblages across the different mangrove habitats. Indeed, fish assemblages were distinctly different between the mangrove edge and just a few meters inside the mangrove forest. Most fish were recorded cruising on the edge of the mangrove forest, while sightings inside the mangrove forest were sparser. The two hypotheses that are usually made to explain why fish use mangrove forests relate to foraging and finding shelter, however, neither were confirmed by the current study as few foraging activities were observed and few individuals were observed actively sheltering among mangrove prop-roots. In fact, few species made regular use of the mangrove forest, supporting the idea that most fish species simply remain on the edge and potentially retreat into the forest for opportunistic feeding, or when threatened by larger predators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. This result aligns with the observations in estuarine mangrove forests of northern Australia where few species make regular use of the in-forest habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. These two habitats (edge and in-forest) probably confer different values to fish, however, fish could benefit from most attributes that physically attract them in mangrove systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] by using the mangrove fringe, without venturing into the forest. Accessing the forest could be disadvantageous because of adverse dissolved oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] or because of increased risk of stranding.</p>
<p>Fish assemblages exhibited small-scale spatial (ten or so meters) heterogeneity, particularly along the forest edge compared to in-forest sites. There was a clear distinction in terms of fish assemblages in the nMDS plot between sites 1 and 9, and sites 3, 5 and 7. This pattern could be explained by water depth profile differences, or because of differences in substrate, with sites 1 and 9 featuring dead corals, small live coral boulders and sand, and shallow depth, while other edge sites also had dead corals, along with small and larger live coral boulders but lacked sand, and deeper depth. Conversely, all the in-forest sites were quite similar in terms of fish assemblages, suggesting that they provide a homogeneous habitat with similar substrate and depth profile throughout the system. Johnston and Sheaves (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] also identified species-specific responses to different small-scale habitats according to their depth and substrate composition. The importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity of fish assemblages was highlighted by Becker et al. (2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] who observed the influence of small spatial scale changes in water depth and substrate composition on fish assemblages at seagrass beds in South Africa. It is important to consider small-scale spatial heterogeneity when characterising the habitat value of a system to fish, or when using fish assemblages as a bio-indicator of ecological change or ecosystem health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The settings in which mangrove systems occur is important in determining the values they provide to fish. Within a mangrove system, mangrove forest and mangrove edge proved to be two distinct habitats from the point of view of fish. The values reflected in their patterns of utilisation were species-specific, suggesting that utilisation and value need to be considered species-by-species if we are to fully understand the role mangrove systems play in maintaining fish communities. The high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of fish assemblages complicates the characterisation of mangrove systems value and utilisation, suggesting that simplistic models are unlikely to be suitable and that care needs to be exercised when transferring understanding to a new location. These data provide important information for managers to implement adequate conservation strategies that includes location-specific knowledge and integration to broader interconnected habitat mosaics.</p>
