<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Virus-host interactions are frequently studied in bulk cell populations, obscuring cell-to-cell variation. Here we investigate endogenous herpesvirus gene expression at the single-cell level, combining a sensitive and robust fluorescent in situ hybridization platform with multiparameter flow cytometry, to study the expression of gammaherpesvirus non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) during lytic replication, latent infection and reactivation in vitro. This method allowed robust detection of viral ncRNAs of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (&#x03B3;HV68), Kaposi&#x2019;s sarcoma associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus, revealing variable expression at the single-cell level. By quantifying the inter-relationship of viral ncRNA, viral mRNA, viral protein and host mRNA regulation during &#x03B3;HV68 infection, we find heterogeneous and asynchronous gene expression during latency and reactivation, with reactivation from latency identified by a distinct gene expression profile within rare cells. Further, during lytic replication with &#x03B3;HV68, we find many cells have limited viral gene expression, with only a fraction of cells showing robust gene expression, dynamic RNA localization, and progressive infection. These findings, powered by single-cell analysis integrated with automated clustering algorithms, suggest inefficient or abortive &#x03B3;HV infection in many cells, and identify substantial heterogeneity in viral gene expression at the single-cell level.</p>

<title>AUTHOR SUMMARY</title>
<p>The gammaherpesviruses are a group of DNA tumor viruses that establish lifelong infection. How these viruses infect and manipulate cells has frequently been studied in bulk populations of cells. While these studies have been incredibly insightful, there is limited understanding of how virus infection proceeds within a single cell. Here we present a new approach to quantify gammaherpesvirus gene expression at the single-cell level. This method allows us to detect cell-to-cell variation in the expression of virus non-coding RNAs, an important and understudied class of RNAs which do not encode for proteins. By examining multiple features of virus gene expression, this method further reveals significant variation in infection between cells across multiple stages of infection. These studies emphasize that gammaherpesvirus infection can be surprisingly heterogeneous when viewed at the level of the individual cell. Because this approach can be broadly applied across diverse viruses, this study affords new opportunities to understand the complexity of virus infection within single cells.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> are a family of large dsDNA viruses that include multiple prominent human and animal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Although these viruses infect different cell types, and are associated with diverse pathologies, they share conserved genes and two fundamental phases of infection: lytic replication and latent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Lytic replication is characterized by a cascade of viral gene expression, active viral DNA replication and the production of infectious virions. Conversely, latency is characterized by limited viral gene expression and the absence of de novo viral replication. While latent infection is a relatively quiescent form of infection, the herpesviruses can reactivate from latency, to reinitiate lytic replication.</p>
<p>Among the herpesviruses, the gammaherpesviruses (&#x03B3;HV) are lymphotropic viruses that include the human pathogens Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and Kaposi&#x2019;s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (&#x03B3;HV68, or MHV-68; ICTV nomenclature <italic>Murid herpesvirus 4</italic>, MuHV-4), is a well-described small animal model for the &#x03B3;HVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. While these viruses establish a lifelong infection that is often clinically inapparent, immune-suppressed individuals are particularly at risk for &#x03B3;HV-associated malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Herpesvirus gene expression is extremely well-characterized in bulk populations. Despite increasing evidence for single-cell heterogeneity in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], there remains limited understanding of herpesvirus infection at the single-cell level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we tracked endogenous viral and host RNAs using a sensitive, robust fluorescent in situ hybridization assay combined with multiparameter flow cytometry (PrimeFlow&#x2122;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] to analyze the expression and inter-relationships of viral ncRNA, viral mRNA and cellular mRNA at the single-cell level during &#x03B3;HV latency, reactivation and lytic replication. These studies revealed unanticipated heterogeneity of infection, emphasizing how single-cell analysis of virus infection can afford significant new insights into the complexity of &#x03B3;HV infection.</p>

<title>Single-cell analysis of viral RNAs during lytic infection</title>
<p>Traditional measurements of gene expression frequently rely on pooled cellular material, obscuring intercellular variation in gene expression. To better define expression of &#x03B3;HV RNAs at the single cell level, we employed the PrimeFlow&#x2122; RNA assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] to study viral gene expression during murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (&#x03B3;HV68) infection, a small animal &#x03B3;HV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. This method is a highly sensitive, extremely specific in situ hybridization assay, integrating Affymetrix-designed branched DNA technology with single-cell analysis powered by multiparameter flow cytometry. This method has been successfully used to detect both virus and host RNAs (e.g. in the context of HIV infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]).</p>
<p>We first tested the ability of PrimeFlow&#x2122; to measure multiple viral RNAs during lytic infection with &#x03B3;HV68, including small non-coding RNAs (tRNA-<underline>m</underline>iRNA <underline>e</underline>ncoding <underline>R</underline>NAs or TMERs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]) and mRNAs. Mouse fibroblasts were infected with an intermediate multiplicity of infection (MOI=5 plaque forming units of virus/cell) resulting in a mixture of infected and uninfected cells. Under these conditions, TMER-5, one of the eight &#x03B3;HV68 TMERs, and the &#x03B3;HV68 gene 73, were readily detectable by conventional real-time PCR in &#x03B3;HV68-infected, but not mock-infected, cultures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, C). Parallel cultures were analyzed for RNA expression by PrimeFlow&#x2122;. Whereas mock-infected cells had no detectable expression of either the &#x03B3;HV68 TMERs or gene 73, WT &#x03B3;HV68-infected fibroblasts had a prominent population of TMER&#x002B; and gene 73&#x002B; cells, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and 1D). Infection of cells with a TMER-deficient &#x03B3;HV68 (TMER-TKO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]), in which TMER expression is ablated through promoter disruption, revealed no detectable TMER expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), yet robust gene 73 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Parallel studies revealed ready detection of gene 18, another &#x03B3;HV68 gene product (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). These studies show that PrimeFlow&#x2122; is a sensitive, robust and specific method to detect both viral non-coding and messenger RNAs during lytic infection, quantifying both the frequency of gene expression and expression on a per cell basis.</p>

<title>Heterogeneous gene expression during &#x03B3;HV latency and reactivation from latency</title>
<p>&#x03B3;HV latency is characterized by limited gene expression. We next measured viral RNAs during latency and reactivation using the &#x03B3;HV68-infected A20 HE2.1 cell line (A20.&#x03B3;HV68), a drug-selected latency model with restricted viral gene expression that can reactivate following stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. A20.&#x03B3;HV68 cells are characterized by restricted viral gene expression, yet remain competent for reactivation from latency and the production of infectious virions following chemical stimulation with the phorbol ester, TPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>When we compared TMER expression between uninfected (parental, virus-negative A20) and infected (A20.&#x03B3;HV68) cells by qRT-PCR, the viral ncRNA TMER-5 was exclusively detectable in A20.&#x03B3;HV68 cells, with minimal changes between untreated and chemically-stimulated conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). PrimeFlow&#x2122; analysis of TMER expression in untreated A20.&#x03B3;HV68 cells revealed that a majority of these cells expressed the TMERs, as defined by a positive signal in samples subjected to the TMER probe relative to unstained cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Untreated A20.&#x03B3;HV68 cells contained a high frequency of cells expressing intermediate levels of TMERs (i.e. TMER<sup>mid</sup> cells), with a significant signal enrichment above parental, virus-negative A20 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>While the frequency of TMER<sup>mid</sup> cells remained relatively constant following TPA stimulation (compare &#x201C;Untreated&#x201D; versus &#x201C;Stimulated&#x201D;, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), stimulated A20.&#x03B3;HV68 cultures also contained a small fraction of cells with high levels of TMERs (i.e. TMER<sup>high</sup> cells), not present in untreated cultures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). Chemical stimulation is known to result in variable penetrance of reactivation in latently infected cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Based on this, we hypothesized that these rare, TMER<sup>high</sup> cells may represent a subset of cells that are undergoing reactivation from latency.</p>
<p>To test this, we analyzed the properties of TMER<sup>mid</sup> and TMER<sup>high</sup> cells, comparing viral protein expression in untreated and stimulated A20.&#x03B3;HV68 cells. We analyzed: 1) a &#x03B3;HV68 expressed GFP-hygromycin resistance fusion protein (HygroGFP), under the control of a heterologous viral promoter (the CMV immediate early promoter) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], and 2) the &#x03B3;HV68 regulator of complement activation (RCA), a viral protein encoded by the &#x03B3;HV68 gene 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The vast majority of TMER<sup>mid</sup> cells were negative for HygroGFP and RCA (i.e. HygroGFP-RCA-), regardless of whether the cells were present in untreated or stimulated cultures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>). Conversely, TMER<sup>high</sup> cells, which were uniquely present in stimulated cultures, had a significantly increased frequency of HygroGFP&#x002B; cells with induction of RCA protein&#x002B; cells in a subset of cells when compared to TMER<sup>mid</sup> cells present in either untreated or stimulated cultures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>). By using imaging flow cytometry, we further analyzed the subcellular localization of TMERs in TMER<sup>mid</sup> cells compared with TMER<sup>high</sup> RCA&#x002B; cells. TMERs were predominantly nuclear in both TMER<sup>mid</sup> and TMER<sup>high</sup> RCA&#x002B; cells, as defined by co-localization with DAPI fluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). These data demonstrate that the TMERs are expressed during latency, and that following reactivation-inducing stimulation, TMERs are further induced in a rare subset of cells which are characterized by increased viral transcription and translation.</p>

<title>Detection of endogenous viral gene expression during KSHV latency and reactivation</title>
<p>To extend these findings, we analyzed viral gene expression in the KSHV infected B cell tumor line, BCBL-1, focused on detection of an abundant viral ncRNA, the KSHV polyadenylated nuclear RNA (PAN, nut1, or T1.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. PAN RNA is known to be highly inducible upon induction of reactivation in KSHV latently infected B cell lymphoma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The frequency of PAN RNA&#x002B; cells was low in untreated BCBL-1 cells, with &#x223C;1&#x0025; of cells spontaneously expressing this ncNRA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>).</p>

Data show (D) histogram overlays of these populations with fluorescence quantification provided in panel E. Gene 73 analysis includes samples in which there was no gene 73 probe (i.e. &#x201C;No Probe&#x201D;, in solid gray), to define background fluorescence. (F, G) Flow cytometric analysis of stimulated BCBL-1 cells, using histogram overlays, to compare cell size (forward scatter, FSC), granularity (side scatter, SSC) and gene 73 expression in cells that are either PAN RNA negative [-] (blue) or PAN RNA positive [&#x002B;] (red). Data show (F) histogram overlays of these populations with fluorescence quantification provided in panel G, with gene 73 analysis including a &#x201C;No Probe&#x201D; sample (gray) to define background fluorescence. Due to variable baseline fluorescence values for SSC and gene 73 between experiments, values were internally standardized to fluorescent intensities within the PAN RNA negative population for each experiment, with data depicting mean &#x00B1; SEM. Symbols in panels B and C indicate values from individual samples. Data are from two independent experiments, with biological replicates within each experiment, with total number of biological replicates as follows: No Probe (n = 2), BL41 control (n = 3), BCBL-1 untreated (n = 6), BCBL-1 stimulated (n = 6).

<p>Despite the low frequency, this hybridization was clearly above background, as ncRNA defined on the KSHV- and EBV-negative B cell lymphoma cell line BL41 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>).

Although stimulation of BCBL-1 cells significantly increased the frequency of PAN RNA&#x002B; events compared to untreated cultures, PAN RNA expression on an individual cell basis was comparable between cells from untreated or stimulated cultures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). As anticipated, stimulation of BCBL-1 cells was associated with increased viral DNA, consistent with stimulated cultures undergoing reactivation from latency (Supplemental <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We next analyzed the properties of BCBL-1 cells as a function of PAN RNA expression. In untreated cells, PAN RNA&#x002B; or RNA-cells had comparable cell size (define by forward scatter, FSC) and granularity (defined by side scatter, SSC). Gene 73 expression was low in untreated BCBL-1 samples, with signal intensity in PAN RNA-cells close to the background fluorescence observed in unstained samples. PAN RNA&#x002B; cells in untreated cultures had a modest increase in gene 73 expression relative to PAN RNA-cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>). In stimulated BCBL-1 cultures, PAN RNA&#x002B; cells had a modest decrease in cell size (defined by forward scatter) and a trend towards reduced granularity (defined by side scatter) compared to PAN RNA-cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>).</p>
<p>Stimulated BCBL-1 cultures also had an increased gene 73 signal when compared to unstained samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), with PAN RNA&#x002B; cells again showing &#x223C;2-fold increase compared to PAN RNA-cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>). These data demonstrate robust detection of PAN RNA by PrimeFlow&#x2122;, and further identify PAN RNA expression in a subset of both untreated and reactivation-induced BCBL-1 cells.</p>

<title>Single-cell analysis of actin mRNA degradation as a readout of virus-induced host shutoff</title>
<p>Many herpesviruses, including &#x03B3;HV68, EBV and KSHV, induce host shutoff during lytic replication and reactivation from latency, a process characterized by dramatic decreases in host mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].

The actin RNA<sup>low</sup> population had a fluorescent signal that was only modestly above background fluorescence (defined by the &#x201C;No probe&#x201D; sample), suggesting an all-or-none phenomenon in which cells either had no change in actin RNA levels or had pronounced actin RNA degradation.

<p>To determine whether actin RNA regulation could also be observed during &#x03B3;HV68 latency and reactivation, we measured actin RNA levels in A20.&#x03B3;HV68 cells. Parental, virus-negative A20 cells and A20.&#x03B3;HV68 cells had relatively comparable actin RNA levels by qRT-PCR, in both untreated and stimulated cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Given that host shutoff is expected to primarily occur in rare, reactivating cells, we measured actin RNA degradation relative to TMER expression by the PrimeFlow&#x2122; method. Untreated A20.&#x03B3;HV68 cultures had no discernable population of TMER&#x002B; actin RNA<sup>low</sup> events, whereas stimulated cultures were characterized by a rare population of TMER<sup>high</sup> actin RNA<sup>low</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). We further compared actin RNA expression between TMER<sup>mid</sup> and TMER<sup>high</sup> cells, in untreated versus stimulated cultures using our previously defined subpopulations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). While TMER<sup>mid</sup> cells from either untreated or stimulated cultures were predominantly actin RNA&#x002B;, TMER<sup>high</sup> cells from stimulated cultures showed a significant increased frequency of actin RNA<sup>low</sup> events (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-G</xref>).

<p>To validate these findings using a more conventional method, we compared TMER and gene 73 RNA co-expression on a biaxial plot. By comparing mock-infected, WT-infected and TMER-TKO-infected cultures, this analysis revealed five populations of gene expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), including cells with: 1) no detectable expression of either viral RNA (TMER-gene 73-), 2) TMER&#x002B; gene 73-cells (bottom right quadrant), 3) TMER-gene 73&#x002B; cells (upper left quadrant), 4) TMER<sup>low</sup> gene 73<sup>low</sup> cells (lower left edge of the upper right quadrant), and 5) TMER<sup>high</sup> gene 73<sup>high</sup> cells (upper right quadrant). The definition of TMER positive events was defined based on background fluorescent levels observed in TMER-TKO infected cultures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These 5 populations were each assigned a unique color for subsequent analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>We then compared the cellular phenotype and gene expression within these 5 distinct populations. Analysis of TMERs, gene 73, actin RNA, RCA protein, cell size (forward scatter), and granularity (side scatter) revealed multiple types of viral gene expression. As expected, TMER-gene 73-cells (in black) had no evidence of virus infection, with no detectable viral protein (RCA) or actin downregulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-E</xref>). Cells with low expression of either the TMERs and/or gene 73 contained viral RNAs, but had minimal expression of either viral protein or actin downregulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-E</xref>). In stark contrast, cells that were TMER<sup>high</sup> gene 73<sup>high</sup> (in red, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-E</xref>) had multiple characteristics of progressive virus infection including a prominent fraction of cells that expressed RCA and/or had actin RNA downregulation. Further, TMER<sup>high</sup> gene 73<sup>high</sup> cells were consistently smaller in cell size (defined by forward scatter, FSC) and higher in granularity (defined by side scatter, SSC), a feature that was unique to this phenotype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the heterogeneous patterns of RNA and protein expression among lytically-infected cells, we next queried TMER subcellular localization as a function of viral gene expression using imaging flow cytometry. While the majority of TMER&#x002B; cells had a primarily nuclear TMER localization (defined by DAPI co-localization, as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]), the frequency of cells with nuclear TMER localization was highest among TMER&#x002B; gene 73-cells and lowest among TMER&#x002B; gene 73&#x002B; RCA&#x002B; cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>). These data suggest that the TMERs can be localized in either the nucleus or cytoplasm during &#x03B3;HV68 lytic replication, and that this localization is not strictly a function of magnitude of gene expression.</p>

<p>Finally, we used tSNE, a dimensionality reduction algorithm, to better delineate the relationship between TMER, gene 73, RCA protein and actin downregulation across populations defined by variable TMER and gene 73 expression. Consistent with our histogram analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-E</xref>), uninfected and intermediate populations that expressed either TMERs or gene 73 were relatively uniform in gene expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). In contrast, TMER<sup>high</sup> gene 73<sup>high</sup> cells expressed a wider array of phenotypes, including both a predominant fraction of cells that were actin RNA<sup>low</sup> RCA&#x002B;, as well as a distinct group of cells that were actin RNA&#x002B; RCA-(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Notably, RCA expression and actin degradation were inversely correlated, with very few cells that expressed RCA also high for actin RNA. Actin RNA&#x002B; populations among TMER<sup>high</sup> gene 73<sup>high</sup> cells were associated with larger cell size (Supplementary Fig. 2). The diversity of phenotypes among TMER<sup>high</sup> gene 73<sup>high</sup> cells was confirmed by biaxial gating of actin RNA versus RCA protein expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). In total, these data indicate heterogeneous progression of lytic replication in vitro. While some cells have robust viral mRNA and protein expression, additional cell subsets are characterized by limited or divergent gene expression.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Herpesvirus gene expression has been historically analyzed in bulk cell populations. These studies have provided an essential cornerstone to understanding the transcriptional and translational capacity of the herpesviruses. Despite this, recent studies on cellular and viral transcription from other systems have emphasized a high degree of cell-to-cell variation in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], something we have further investigated here. By applying the PrimeFlow&#x2122; methodology to measure endogenous viral gene expression across multiple gammaherpesviruses, and multiple stages of infection, we have gained critical new insights into the inter-relationships of gene expression at the single-cell level.</p>
<p>A primary focus of the current study has been to analyze expression of &#x03B3;HV ncRNAs. Although the TMERs, EBERs and PAN RNA all represent abundant &#x03B3;HV ncRNAs, these ncRNAs are transcribed by distinct mechanisms: KSHV PAN is a highly-inducible, RNA pol II-transcribed ncRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], in contrast to the RNA pol III-transcribed TMERs and EBERs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. This differential regulation was mirrored in the expression patterns we observed. Whereas TMERs and EBERs were detected in a large fraction of latently infected cells, PAN RNA was expressed in a low frequency of latently infected cells, with prominent induction following cell stimulation and the induction of reactivation. The viral ncRNAs were efficiently detected, as might be predicted due to their abundance. The viral gene 73 encodes a transcription factor that is expressed at a far lower level and are also efficiently detected, demonstrating that rare mRNAs can be measured coincidently with abundant RNAs and with proteins, with no modifications required. A unique advantage of our current approach is the ability to measure the frequency of ncRNA expressing cells and changes in expression within individual cells. This has been particularly insightful for the identification of rare PAN RNA&#x002B; cells in untreated BCBL-1 cells and a TMER<sup>high</sup> subpopulation of cells in reactivating A20.&#x03B3;HV68 cells. Integrating this method with cell sorting will afford future opportunities to investigate unique properties of these rare cell populations.</p>
<p>Among the viral ncRNAs measured, in-depth analysis of TMER expression during &#x03B3;HV68 infection has revealed new insights into infection. In the context of latency, the TMERs are constitutively expressed in many, but not all, latently infected cells using the A20.&#x03B3;HV68 model. Further, stimulating these cells to undergo reactivation has a minimal effect on the frequency of cells expressing intermediate levels of TMERs (i.e. TMER<sup>mid</sup> cells), instead resulting in the appearance of a minor population of TMER<sup>high</sup> cells. Notably, TMER<sup>high</sup> cells show additional features of lytic cycle progression, including actin RNA degradation and RCA protein expression. Why only some latently infected cells show the TMER<sup>high</sup> phenotype, and what regulates the inducible expression of the RNA pol III-transcribed TMERs remain important questions raised by this analysis.</p>
<p>Of the &#x03B3;HVs studied here, only &#x03B3;HV68 has a robust in vitro lytic replication system. Our studies on &#x03B3;HV68 lytic replication revealed multiple unanticipated results. By using cultures that contained both infected and uninfected cells, our analysis identified at least four different subsets of cells, stratified by differential viral gene expression of the TMERs and gene 73. Strikingly, during lytic replication there were many cells with limited viral gene expression, expressing low levels of either the TMERs and/or gene 73, but lacking additional signs of virus gene expression (i.e. actin RNA degradation or RCA protein expression). Conversely, only some viral RNA&#x002B; cells showed robust viral expression characterized by a constellation of gene expression, defined as TMER<sup>high</sup> gene 73<sup>high</sup> actin RNA<sup>low</sup> RCA&#x002B;. While there is precedence that reactivation from latency in KSHV infection can be asynchronous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], this heterogeneity of viral gene expression during in vitro lytic replication was unanticipated and suggests that lytic infection under these reductionist conditions is either asynchronous, abortive, or inefficient. This heterogeneity of gene expression raises important questions regarding the universality of the prototypical cascade of immediate early, early and late gene expression that is widely accepted in the herpesvirus field and suggests additional levels of complexity that may be obscured by bulk cell analysis.</p>
<p>This method allows multiplexed analysis of single-cell gene expression, to both directly measure viral RNAs and downstream consequences of gene expression including viral protein production and host RNA degradation, secondary to protein translation. This approach has notable advantages to conventional analyses of gene expression: 1) it can measure endogenous viral gene expression (both mRNA and ncRNA) in the absence of recombinant viruses or marker genes, and 2) it can rapidly analyze gene and protein expression inter-relationships, across millions of cells, providing unique complementary strengths to other single-cell methodologies (e.g. single-cell RNA-seq). In future, this method can be further integrated with additional antibody-based reagents, to simultaneously query post-translational modifications (e.g. protein phosphorylation) as a function of cell cycle stage. It is also notable that through the use of imaging flow cytometry, it is possible to interrogate subcellular RNA and protein localization throughout distinct stages of virus infection.</p>
<p>In total, these studies demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis of herpesvirus gene expression. Our data emphasize the heterogeneity of &#x03B3;HV gene expression at the single-cell level. The factors that underlie this heterogeneity are currently unknown, but could reflect either asynchronous or inefficient infection in many infected cells (e.g. in the context of lytic infection). Whether this variation arises from viral or cellular heterogeneity is a fundamental question for future research.</p>

DAPI (BioLegend) was used on a subset of samples following manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol, prior to PrimeFlow&#x2122; probe hybridization. Flow cytometric analysis was done on LSR II (BD Biosciences), Fortessa (BD Biosciences), and ZE5 (Bio-Rad) flow cytometers, with compensation values based on antibody-stained beads (BD Biosciences), and modified as needed post-collection using FlowJo.</p>

<title>Imaging flow cytometry</title>
<p>Cells were treated as described above then harvested, and split into two aliquots: one for conventional flow cytometry, and one for imaging flow cytometry, acquired on an Amnis ImageStream&#x00AE;<sup>X</sup> Mark II imaging flow cytometer (MilliporeSigma) with a 60X objective and low flow rate/high sensitivity using INSPIRE&#x00AE; software. Brightfield (BF) and side scatter (SSC) images were illuminated by LED light and a 785nm laser respectively. Fluorescent probes were excited off 405nm, 488nm, and 642nm lasers with the power adjusted properly to avoid intensity saturation of the camera. Single color controls for compensation were acquired by keeping the same acquisition setting for samples, with the difference of turning the BF LED light and 785nm (SSC) laser off.</p>
<p>The acquired data were analyzed using IDEAS&#x00AE; software (MilliporeSigma). Single cells that were in focus were defined as a population with a high &#x201C;gradient RMS&#x201D; value, an intermediate &#x201C;Area&#x201D; value, and a medium to high &#x201C;Aspect ratio&#x201D; value for subsequent analysis. Positive and negative events for each fluorescent marker were determined using the &#x201C;Intensity&#x201D; feature. TMER nuclear localization was quantified using &#x201C;Similarity&#x201D; feature, the log-transformed Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient by analyzing the pixel values of two image pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. The degree of nuclear localization of TMER was measured by correlating the pixel intensity of two images with the same spatial registry. The paired TMER and DAPI images were quantified by measuring the &#x201C;Similarity Score&#x201D; which cells with high similarity scores display high TMER nuclear localization with similar image pairs. By contrast cells with low similarity scores show low TMER nuclear localization with dissimilar image pairs.</p>

<title>RNA and qRT-PCR</title>
<p>RNA was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies) per manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol and re-suspended in DEPC treated water. 3 &#x03BC;g of RNA was treated with DNase 1 (Promega) for 2 hours at 37&#x00B0;C, heat inactivated for 10 min at 65&#x00B0;C. 500 ng of RNA was then subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScript II (Life Technologies) following manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol for gene specific, oligo(dT), or random primers (Life Technologies). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using iQ SYBR Green super mix (Bio-Rad) follow manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol using host and viral primer sets (Table S2) or using QuantiTech Primer Assay (Qiagen) for 18s (Hs-RRN18S_1_SG). qPCR conditions: 3 min at 95&#x00B0;C, amplification cycles for 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95&#x00B0;C, annealing/ extension at temperature for specific primer set for 1 min ending with a melt curve which started at 50&#x00B0;C or 55&#x00B0;C to 95&#x00B0;C increasing 0.5&#x00B0;C for 0:05 sec. A standard curve for each primer set was generated by pooling a portion of each sample together and doing a 1:3 serial dilution. 75 ng of cDNA of the unknown samples was loaded per qPCR reaction/primer set, with reactions run on a Bio-Rad 384 CFX LightCycler and data analyzed using Bio-Rad CFX manager software. Data analysis was done using the 1:3 standard curve as the control Ct value to calculate the delta ct, and the Pfaffl equation was used to define the fold difference between the gene of interest and 18s (reference gene) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. qPCR products were analyzed by melt curve analysis, with all reactions having a prominent, uniform product. In the case of primers with an aberrant melt curve product (e.g. that arose at late cycles), products were clearly a different product as defined by melt curve analysis.</p>

<title>KSHV genome quantification</title>
<p>BCBL-1 or BL41 cells were plated at 7.5e5 cells/well in a 6 well plate with 20 ng/ml TPA and 0.3 mM NaB or vehicle only (DMSO and H<sub>2</sub>O). Cells and supernatant were harvested at 72 hrs post-treatment, hard-spun for 30 min at 4&#x00B0; C and DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit following manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol, except for sample digestion for 1 hour instead of 10 min. 100 ng of DNA per sample was used for qPCR analysis via SYBR green detection using KSHV ORF50 primers (5&#x2019;-TCC GGC GGA TAT ACC GTC AC-3&#x2019; and 5&#x2019;-GGT GCA GCT GGT ACA GTG TG-3&#x2019;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. qPCR was analyzed using relative quantification normalized against unit mass calculation, ratio = E<sup>deltaCt</sup> (Real-Time PCR Application Guide, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. 2006).</p>

<title>Software and Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All flow cytometry data were analyzed in FlowJo (version 8.8.7 or 10.5.0), with flow cytometry data shown either as histogram overlays or pseudo-color dot plots (with or without smoothing), showing outliers (low or high resolution) on log<sub>10</sub> scales. Statistical analysis and graphing were done in GraphPad Prism (Version 6.0d and 7.0d). Statistical significance was tested by unpaired t test (when comparing two conditions) or by one-way ANOVA (when comparing three or more samples) subjected to multiple corrections tests using recommended settings in Prism. <italic><underline>X-shift analysis:</underline></italic> For automated mapping of flow cytometry data using X-shift, data were obtained from compensated flow cytometry files, exported from FlowJo, using singlets that were live (defined by sequential gating on single cells by FSC-H vs. FSC-W and SSC-H vs. SSC-W, that were DAPI bright vs. SSC-A). These events were imported into the Java based program VorteX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.stanford.edu/&#x223C;samusik/vortex/">http://web.stanford.edu/&#x223C;samusik/vortex/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Four parameters [TMER (AlexaFluor (AF) 488), RCA (PE), gene 73 (AF647), and Actin (AF750)] were selected for clustering analysis using the X-shift algorithm. The following settings were used when importing the data set into VorteX: i) Numerical transformation: arcsinh(x/f), f=150, ii) noise threshold: apply noise threshold of 1.0 (automatic and recommended setting), iii) feature rescaling: none, and iv) normalization: none, v) a Euclidean noise filter was used with a Minimal Euclidean length of the profile of 1.0, and vi) an import max of 1,000 rows from each file after filtering was selected. The following settings were used when preparing the data set for clustering analysis: i) distance measure: angular distance, ii) clustering algorithm: X-shift (gradient assignment), iii) density estimate: N nearest neighbors (fast), iv) number of neighbors for density estimate (K): from 150 to 5, with 30 steps, and v) number of neighbors for mode finding (N): determine automatically. After the cluster analysis was completed, all results were selected and the K value that corresponded with optimal clustering (the elbow point) was calculated, in this case K= 50. All clusters (seven clusters total) for the optimal K value were selected and a Force-Directed Layout was created. The maximum number of events sampled from each cluster was 20, and the number of nearest neighbors was 10. All settings used for this analysis were automated or explicitly recommended (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nolanlab/vortex/wiki">https://github.com/nolanlab/vortex/wiki</ext-link>). Force-Directed layouts in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> were saved as graphml files from VorteX, opened in the application Gephi v 0.9.1, and colored by different variables (Cluster ID, experimental group, Actin mRNA, RCA, Gene 73, and TMERs respectively) in Adobe Illustrator CC 2017. Full details on use of the X-shfit algorithm and analysis pipeline can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. <italic><underline>tSNE analysis:</underline></italic> Gated events for each of the six identified populations were exported from FlowJo, and then imported into Cytobank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cytobank.org">www.cytobank.org</ext-link>) for analysis using the viSNE algorithm. Each file was used for a separate viSNE analysis (six total runs), where all available events were selected for clustering (202,669, 128,028, 29,096, 5,610, 8,956, 35,850 respectively) and four parameters were selected for clustering (Actin mRNA, RCA, Gene 73, and TMERs). The resulting tSNE plots were colored according to expression using the &#x201C;rainbow&#x201D; color option, with individual events shown using the stacked dot option. The channel range was user-defined for each marker according to the range in expression established in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>.</p>
