<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>The Regulator of G-protein Signaling 12 (Rgs12) is important for osteoclast (OC) differentiation, and its deletion in vivo protected mice against pathological bone loss. To characterize its mechanism in osteoclastogenesis, we selectively deleted Rgs12 in OC precursors using the LysM-Cre transgenic line or overexpressed the gene in RAW264.7 cells. Rgs12 deletion led to increased bone mass with decreased OC numbers, whereas its overexpression increased OC number and size. Proteomics analysis of Rgs12-deficient OCs identified an upregulation of antioxidant enzymes under the transcriptional regulation of Nrf2, the master regulator of oxidative stress. We confirmed an increase of Nrf2 activity and impaired production in Rgs12-deficient cells. Conversely, Rgs12 overexpression suppressed Nrf2 through a mechanism dependent on the 26S proteasome, and promoted RANKL-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NF&#x03BA;B, which was abrogated by antioxidant treatment. We therefore identified a novel role of Rgs12 in regulating Nrf2, thereby controlling cellular redox state and OC differentiation.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Osteoporosis is a pervasive disorder characterized by skeletal fragility and microarchitectural deterioration that predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The disease has a significant global impact, affecting an estimated 200 million people worldwide and exerts a heavy economic burden&#x2014;the affected are projected to rise by approximately 50&#x0025; within the next 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Therefore, understanding the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is an urgent matter to develop better treatments for this debilitating disease.</p>
<p>Bone remodeling is carried out by the coordinated actions of the bone-forming osteoblasts (OBs) and the bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCs). Disorders of skeletal deficiency, such as osteoporosis, are typically characterized by enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption relative to bone formation, thereby resulting in net bone loss. Although significant progress has been made in OC behavior, it remains largely unknown about the regulatory mechanism that drives OC differentiation, which restricts the effectiveness of current treatments.</p>
<p>Regulators of G-protein Signaling (RGS) are a family of proteins comprised of more than 30 proteins that share a conserved RGS domain and play a classical role in attenuating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling through its GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) activity to inactivate the G&#x03B1; subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The RGS proteins are multifunctional proteins which hold vital cellular processes, including cell differentiation. Rgs12 is unique in that it is the largest protein in its family. In addition to the RGS domain, contains a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO1 (PDZ) domain, a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, a tandem ras-binding domain (RBD1/2), and a GoLoco interaction motif. The multi-domain architecture of Rgs12 suggests a role as a scaffolding protein in complexes where multiple signaling pathways might converge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as a normal byproduct of cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Recent studies clearly show that RANKL-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) are indispensable for OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). ROS at high levels induce oxidative stress, which if left unchecked becomes deleterious to cell. At low concentrations, however, ROS have been shown to participate in signaling events in OCs, including the RANKL-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phospholipase C gamma (PLC&#x03B3;), nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#x03BA;B), and [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>] oscillations; all of which contribute to the activation of nuclear factor of T-cells (NFAT), the master regulator of OC differentiation. Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence have consistently shown that suppression of ROS by various means inhibits OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). In particular, RANKL-dependent activation of PLC&#x03B3;, [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>] oscillations, and NFAT were abrogated when the OC precursors were treated with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Furthermore, our previous studies have that Rgs12 silencing could inhibit PLC&#x03B3; activation, [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>] oscillations, and the expression of NFATc1 and its downstream factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Hence, these findings led us to hypothesize that Rgs12 may play a role in regulating the cellular redox state, thereby controlling OC differentiation.</p>
<p>Using an <italic>in vivo</italic> Rgs12 conditional knockout mouse model, we found that RANKL-dependent ROS was suppressed in Rgs12-deficient bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). Additionally, Rgs12-deficient cells have elevated levels of phase II detoxification and antioxidant enzymes. We further identified that Rgs12 deficiency increased the activation of Nrf2, the master transcription factor responsible for the expression of antioxidant proteins. Conversely, Rgs12 overexpression could suppress Nrf2 and promote osteoclastogenesis. Our results therefore demonstrate a novel function of Rgs12 in regulating ROS during OC differentiation, likely by suppressing Nrf2 to inhibit the expression of antioxidant proteins. These findings contribute to a better understanding of ROS regulation in OCs and future treatment strategies for diseases of excessive bone loss such as osteoporosis.</p>

<title>Targeted deletion of Rgs12 in myeloid cells increased trabecular bone mass</title>
<p>To assess the role of Rgs12 on OC differentiation and bone remodeling <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a conditional gene knockout mouse model by crossing Rgs12<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice with LysM-Cre transgenic mice (LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup>).

<title>Rgs12 promotes osteoclast formation</title>
<p>To assess the role of Rgs12 in osteoclastogenesis, OC precursors isolated from LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were differentiated using M-CSF and RANKL. While control BMMs differentiated into large, TRAP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> multinucleated OCs, Rgs12-deficient precursor cells showed a reduction in the number of OCs containing 6-9 nuclei and 10&#x002B; nuclei, which were also visibly smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">B</xref>). Complementing our Rgs12 knockout model, we generated an Rgs12 overexpression OC model in which RAW264.7 cells were stably-transfected with a vector carrying a recombinant N-terminus FLAG-tagged Rgs12 gene (Flag-Rgs12). Rgs12 overexpression in RAW264.7 cells was confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Using this cell model, we next determined whether Rgs12 overexpression could promote osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3D</xref>). Converse to our findings in Rgs12 knockout cells, we found that overexpression of Rgs12 in RAW264.7 cells led to an increased number of OCs with 10&#x002B; nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>). We also observed significantly decreased numbers of smaller OCs containing 3-5 and 6-9 nuclei in Rgs12 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>), presumably because most of the smaller OCs have fused to form large OCs containing 10&#x002B; nuclei. In a study investigating the relationship between osteoclast size and state of resorptive activity, a greater proportion of large osteoclasts were active whereas non-resorbing osteoclasts were on average smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Additionally, quantification of the mean areas of OCs with 10&#x002B; nuclei revealed that Rgs12-overexpressing OCs were larger as compared to empty vector-transfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Our findings consequently demonstrate the importance of Rgs12 in promoting OC formation, which is consistent with the osteopetrotic phenotype observed in Rgs12-deficient mouse model.</p>

<title>Rgs12-defcient osteoclast precursors show an increased expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant proteins</title>
<p>To uncover the role of Rgs12 in OC differentiation, we employed the <italic>IonStar</italic> liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based quantitative proteomics strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) to profile the temporal dynamics in the global protein levels in Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> and LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> BMMs at 0, 1, 3, and 5 days of OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Proteomics analysis identified 3,714 quantifiable proteins that are present in all samples (no missing data), using a highly stringent identification criteria of &#x2265;2 peptides per protein and 1&#x0025; false discovery rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Within this dataset, we identified 83 and 61 unique proteins that were significantly up- and downregulated, respectively, in LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> BMMs relative to Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> BMMs. Proteins were considered significantly altered if they exceeded the thresholds set at <italic>p</italic>&#x003C;0.05 and &#x003E;0.3 log<sub>2-</sub>transformed ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Most of the protein expression changes in Rgs12-deficient cells were captured at 3 and 5 days of OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). To determine the biological significance of these altered proteins, we performed gene ontology analysis to identify the canonical pathways involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Processes related to OC differentiation (e.g. &#x201C;NFAT Signaling&#x201D;, &#x201C;RANK Signaling in OCs&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Role of OCs in Rheumatoid Arthritis&#x201D;) were enriched at 3 and 5 days of OC differentiation. Closer inspection showed that OC marker proteins including metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp9), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (Trap), ATPase H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> transporting V0 subunit D2 (Atp6v0d2), and integrin &#x03B2;3 (Itgb3) were significantly downregulated in LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> OCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Additionally, the analysis revealed several biological functions related to ROS homeostasis that were impacted by Rgs12 deletion (e.g. &#x201C;Production of ROS&#x201D;, &#x201C;Superoxide Radical Degradation&#x201D;, and NRF2-mediated Stress Response&#x201D;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Inspection of the proteins involved in these pathways showed a significant upregulation of numerous Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes responsible attenuating oxidative stress, including: peroxiredoxin 1/4 (Prdx1/4), thioredoxin 1/2 (Trxr1), glutathione reductase (Gshr), and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (Nqo1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Upstream regulator (transcription factor) analysis identified that the antioxidant enzymes upregulated in LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> OCs share the common upstream regulator Nrf2, a key transcription factor that regulates cellular redox balance through the expression of protective antioxidant and phase II detoxification proteins. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) (Fig S4A). Although the upstream regulator analysis predicted an upregulation of Nrf2 activity, the transcription factor itself was not detected by our proteomics analysis. Proteins of typically low abundance such as cytokines, signal regulatory molecules, and transcription factors tend to be &#x201C;crowded out&#x201D; during MS analysis by more highly abundant proteins such those proteins involved in glycolysis and purine metabolism, protein translation, and cytoskeletal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Nonetheless, our proteomics-based discovery tool allowed us to generate the hypothesis that Nrf2 is aberrantly activated by Rgs12 deletion, causing excessive clearance of ROS by antioxidant enzymes and in turn disrupting OC differentiation.</p>

<title>Deletion of Rgs12 elevated Nrf2/Keap1 expression and Nrf2 activity</title>
<p>Based on our proteomics analysis, we hypothesized that Rgs12 is needed to suppress Nrf2 activity and facilitate the formation of ROS, which has been previously shown to play a critical role in OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we assessed Nrf2 activity and the expression of Nrf2 and Keap1 in Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> and LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Western blotting of Nrf2 in day 3 OCs also showed increased levels of Nrf2 in LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">B</xref>). Keap1, however, which is known to suppresses Nrf2 activity by facilitating its degradation via the proteasome pathway, was unexpectedly elevated in Rgs12-deficient cells. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of Nrf2 demonstrated increased nuclear translocation of the transcription factor in LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>, upper panel). The elimination of ROS with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione, was able to completely suppress Nrf2 nuclear translocation in both Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> and LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>, middle panel). Conversely, induction of oxidative stress using the peroxide <italic>tert</italic>-buthylhydroxyperoxide (tBHP) potently induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>, bottom panel). To further test whether elevated Nrf2 activity in Rgs12-deficient OCs could result in reduced intracellular ROS levels, we detected intracellular ROS levels. As expected, the RANKL-dependent ROS induction observed in control cells was suppressed in LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> OCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). These findings demonstrate an abnormal upregulation of Nrf2 activity and expression in Rgs12-deficient cells, indicating that Rgs12 may be required to suppress Nrf2 to facilitate osteoclastogenesis.</p>

<title>Rgs12-mediated suppression of Nrf2 activity is dependent on the proteasome degradation pathway</title>
<p>Under basal conditions (i.e. absence of cellular stress), Nrf2 remains inactive through its interaction with Keap1, which causes its continual ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). A variety of stress conditions can induce conformational changes in Keap1, thereby releasing Nrf2 from the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, allowing it to accumulate and translocate into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). To better understand the mechanism by which Rgs12 suppresses Nrf2 activity, we therefore first determined whether the ability of Rgs12 to suppress Nrf2 activity relies on this canonical mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Given that Rgs12 deletion resulted in elevated Nrf2 expression and nuclear translocation, we first determined whether Rgs12 overexpression could exert the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">B</xref>). We measured Nrf2 protein levels in RAW264.7 cells stably transfected with the Rgs12-His or empty vector and found no difference when cells are at their basal state (i.e. uninduced). Stimulation of RAW264.7 cells with <italic>tert</italic>-buthylhydroquinone (tBHQ), which is known to directly bind Keap1 and attenuate its inhibitory effect on Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), caused a robust induction of Nrf2 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">B</xref>). More importantly, RAW264.7 cells overexpressing Rgs12 showed a significant reduction of Nrf2 protein levels that resulted from Keap1 inhibition compared to those in the control cells. Moreover, the ability of Rgs12 to facilitate Nrf2 degradation despite the inhibition of Keap1 suggests that Rgs12 functions downstream of Keap1, either by controlling the ubiquitination or proteasomal degradation of Nrf2.</p>

<p>Given the possibility that the reduction of Nrf2 levels in Rgs12 overexpression cells may be a result of increased Nrf2 degradation, we further tested whether inhibiting the proteasome, a step downstream of Keap1, could attenuate the ability of Rgs12 to facilitate Nrf2 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">E</xref>). Similar to tBHQ, preventing Nrf2 degradation using the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 caused Nrf2 protein to substantially accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>, left panel). Interestingly, when Nrf2 protein levels were artificially induced, we observed the presence of a lower molecular weight band, which could correspond to a different post-translational modification state (e.g. unphosphorylated or non-ubiquitinated). Furthermore, we did not observe any changes in Keap1 protein levels. In the previous scenario wherein Rgs12 overexpression could still promote Nrf2 degradation in spite of tBHQ treatment, this was not the case when using MG-132. In fact, inhibiting the proteasome was able to reverse the ability of Rgs12 to promote Nrf2 degradation, indicating its requirement for the proteasome&#x2019;s function. Repeating this experiment in RAW264.7 cells differentiated for 3 days with RANKL showed that Nrf2 levels were suppressed in OCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>, right panel); likely due to reduced transcriptional activity, which corroborates with findings from previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). More importantly, Rgs12 overexpression could suppress Nrf2 protein levels, but inhibition of the proteasome using MG-132 reversed this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>, right panel). To confirm that Rgs12 inhibits Nrf2 through a post-translational mechanism, we measured Nrf2 transcript levels by qPCR and found no difference between wild-type or Rgs12-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Overall, our data collectively indicate that Rgs12 suppresses Nrf2 activity by facilitating its degradation through the proteasome-dependent pathway.</p>

<title>Rgs12-mediated activation of osteoclast MAPK and NF&#x03BA;B signaling is dependent on intracellular ROS</title>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The importance of ROS in osteoclasts has been underlined by the growing body of evidence that ROS increased with aging or during inflammation can stimulate bone resorption and exacerbate bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Targeting ROS in diseases of excess bone resorption such as osteoporosis could therefore be an important therapeutic strategy. Additionally, an important mechanism of cellular ROS clearance relies on the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway which is very well characterized, especially in the context of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). However, the upstream signaling molecules that could regulate the Keap1-Nrf2 axis in OCs remains unknown. Targeting this gap in knowledge, our study uncovered a novel role of the signaling protein Rgs12 in regulating Nrf2, thereby controlling cellular redox state and OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated the essential role of Rgs12 in OC differentiation such that Rgs12 knockout mice exhibited increased bone mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) and OC precursors isolated from these mice showed reduced OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). On the contrary, overexpressing Rgs12 in RAW264.7 cells significantly promoted OC formation and increased the size of resultant OCs. However, the mechanism by which Rgs12 regulates OC differentiation remains unclear.</p>
<p>Proteomics is a powerful tool that has led to numerous discoveries of proteins and biological processes that drive OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Notably, this technique was recently used to map the podosome proteome which helped to advance our understanding of determinants in the macrophage multinucleation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), and how metabolism and energy is redirected towards bone resorption in OCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Proteomics can therefore provide a broad yet informative overview of the systemic changes in the differentiating OC. To discover the cellular function of Rgs12 in OCs, we employed a robust and high-throughput quantitative proteomics approach to characterize the global protein changes of OCs derived from Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> and LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, the analysis identified the upregulation of a collection of antioxidant enzymes that are transcriptionally regulated by the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter region, which is activated by the transcription factor Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Based on this evidence, we further investigated the role of Rgs12 in Nrf2 signaling. We found that Nrf2 protein levels and nuclear translocation were increased in OC precursors in which Rgs12 was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Because our data showed that Rgs12 deficiency upregulated Nrf2, we expected that Keap1 levels should be reduced in order to facilitate the increased Nrf2 activity. On the contrary, Keap1 levels were upregulated in Rgs12-deficient cells, suggesting that the Nrf2 upregulation may be independent of the Keap1. We speculate that Rgs12-deficient cells may be overcompensating Keap1 expression in order to rein back the increased Nrf2 activity. Nevertheless, consistent with the upregulation of Nrf2 and its corresponding antioxidant enzymes, the RANKL-dependent induction of ROS was attenuated in Rgs12-deficient cells. Taking an opposite approach, we demonstrated that Rgs12 overexpression in OC precursors could also enhance RANKL-mediated activation of ERK and NF&#x03BA;B, which is known to be dependent on ROS (Fig. 7). Inhibition of intracellular ROS blocked the effect of Rgs12 overexpression, indicating that Rgs12 promotes RANKL-dependent signaling by facilitating ROS production. Overall, the data collectively demonstrate that Rgs12 promotes osteoclastogenesis by facilitating ROS generation through the suppression of Nrf2 and its target antioxidant genes.</p>
<p>Nrf2 is constitutively expressed but its activity is inhibited through its interaction with Keap1. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is restricted to the cytoplasm where it is continually depleted through the proteosomal degradation pathway. When bound to Nrf2, Keap1 recruits the Cul3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which ubiquitinates and targets Nrf2 for degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). The Keap1 protein containing multiple reactive cysteine residues that serve as redox sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) Stressor conditions including oxidative stress causes the electrophilic modification of Keap1, inducing conformational changes which cause the protein to dissociate from Nrf2 and allow the transcription factor to translocate into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). We therefore determined how Rgs12 regulates this well-defined mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). tBHQ is a selective inhibitor of Keap1 activity by covalently binding the protein&#x2019;s reactive thiols and could activate Nrf2 and its downstream proteins in RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Furthermore, tBHQ inhibited OC differentiation via the upregulation of heme oxygenase-1, a Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzyme (Yamaguchi et al., 2014). In our study, we determined whether Rgs12 could suppress the tBHQ-dependent upregulation of Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). We reasoned that if Rgs12 relies on a Keap1-dependent mechanism, then the inhibition of Keap1 by tBHQ should prevent the ability of Rgs12 to suppress Nrf2. However, we observed that Rgs12 was still able to suppress Nrf2 despite blocking Keap1 activity, indicating that Rgs12 functions downstream of Keap1. Following Keap1-mediated ubiquitination of Nrf2, the targeted protein is degraded by the proteasome. Again, we reasoned that if Rgs12 is dependent on the proteasomal degradation pathway, then inhibition of this pathway using MG-132 should prevent Rgs12-mediated suppression of Nrf2. Indeed, we found that Inhibiting the proteasome was able to reverse the Rgs12-mediated degradation of Nrf2, which places Rgs12 in between Keap1 and the proteasome in the Nrf2 degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">E</xref>). Thus, Rgs12 could either regulate the Cul3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to facilitate the ubiquitination of Nrf2, or directly control proteasome activity. It is interesting to note that NF&#x03BA;B activation is also dependent on the proteasomal degradation of inhibitor of &#x03BA;B (I&#x03BA;B), which otherwise sequesters NF&#x03BA;B to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). If Rgs12 could modulate proteasome activity, it is possible that Rgs12 could directly promote NF&#x03BA;B by facilitating the degradation of I&#x03BA;B. However, the fact that antioxidant treatment to suppress ROS could almost completely block the phosphorylation of NF&#x03BA;B points to an important role of ROS, and not just the proteasomal degradation of I&#x03BA;B in NF&#x03BA;B activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). This potential crosstalk between the NF&#x03BA;B and Nrf2 pathways will need to be evaluated in future studies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study points to a novel role of Rgs12 in OC redox biology, thus forming the molecular basis for developing therapies for osteoporosis and other diseases of bone loss. Additionally, we found a new factor that could modulate the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, which is important within the context of ROS biology.</p>

<title>Protein Extraction and Precipitation/ On-Pellet Digestion</title>
<p>Cells were harvested using ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-formic acid, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5&#x0025; sodium deoxycholate, 1&#x0025; SDS, 2&#x0025; NP-40, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitor (cOmplete, Mini, EDTA-free; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Samples were prepared for MS analysis using an established method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>).</p>

<p>The &#x201C;IonStar&#x201D; LC-MS experimental pipeline was developed and optimized in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). A stringent set of criteria including a low peptide and protein false discovery rate (FDR) of &#x003C; 1&#x0025; and &#x2265;2 peptides per protein was used for protein identification. An ion current-based quantification method (IonStar processing pipeline) was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>).</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>For the Nrf2 nuclear translocation experiment, BMMs were cultured on coverslips and treated with RANKL and M-CSF for 72 h, 5 mM NAC for 16 h, or 50 &#x03BC;M tBHP for 16 h. Coverslips were fixed with 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature and permeabilized using 0.1&#x0025; Triton X-100 for 5 minutes at room temperature. Coverslips were blocked using Image-iT FX signal enhancer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at room temperature, stained with the primary antibody in 1&#x0025; BSA/TBST overnight at 4 &#x00B0;C, and stained with the secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma) was used as a counterstain for nuclei. The coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold antifade mountant (Thermo) and images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>For experiments studying the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, cells were cultured in 6-well plates and pre-treated with the indicated concentrations of tBHQ or 25 &#x00B5;M MG &#x2212;132 for 4 h. For MAPK and NF&#x03BA;B activation experiments, stable-transfected RAW264.7 cells were cultured in 6-well plates and starved in serum-free medium containing 5 mM NAC for 16 h. Cells were subsequently induced with RANKL (200 ng/mL) and M-CSF (100 ng/mL) for the indicated times. Western blotting was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: Nrf2 (H-300) and Nrf2 (C-20) (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), Keap1 (E-20) (1:100, SCBT), phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), p38 (1:1000, CST), phospho-ERK1 (Thr202/Tyr204) &#x002B; ERK2 (Thr186/Tyr187) (1:100, Abcam), ERK1/2 (1:1000, CST), phospho-NF&#x03BA;B p65 (Ser536) (1:1000, CST), NF&#x03BA;B p65 (1:1000, CST), and &#x03B2;-actin (1:4000, SCBT). Densitomety analysis was performed using ImageJ(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) and normalized to the &#x03B2;-actin signal. Relative phosphorylation of was presented as the ratio between the phosphorylated normalized to the nonphosphorylated/total protein. NAC, tBHQ, and tBHP were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and MG-132 was obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).</p>
