<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Meiosis is a key cellular process of sexual reproduction involving the pairing of homologous sequences. In many species however, meiosis can also involve the segregation of supernumerary chromosomes, which can lack a homolog. How these unpaired chromosomes undergo meiosis is largely unknown. In this study we investigated chromosome segregation during meiosis in the haploid fungus <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> that possesses a large complement of supernumerary chromosomes. We used isogenic whole chromosome deletion strains to compare meiotic transmission of chromosomes when paired and unpaired. Unpaired chromosomes inherited from the male parent as well as paired supernumerary chromosomes showed Mendelian inheritance. In contrast, unpaired chromosomes inherited from the female parent showed non-Mendelian inheritance but were amplified and transmitted to all meiotic products. We concluded that the supernumerary chromosomes of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> show a meiotic drive and propose an additional feedback mechanism during meiosis which initiates amplification of unpaired female-inherited chromosomes.</p>

<body>
<p>In eukaryotes meiosis is a highly conserved mechanism that generates gametes and facilitates recombination by pairing of homologous chromosomes. Meiosis combines one round of DNA replication with two subsequent rounds of chromosome segregation (reviewed in (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klutstein and Cooper, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref></italic>)). DNA replication during the meiotic S-phase progression is coupled directly to interactions between homologous sequences and results in the pairing of chromosomes and recombination (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cha et al., 2000</xref></italic>). The initial pairing of homologous chromosomes is important for meiosis and proper chromosome segregation (reviewed in (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Loidl, 2016</xref></italic>)). However, it is less clear how meiosis proceeds when pairing of homologous chromosomes does not take place due to unequal sets of chromosomes, as is the case in organisms with non-essential supernumerary chromosomes.</p>
<p>Supernumerary chromosomes, also known as B chromosomes, conditionally dispensable chromosomes or accessory chromosomes, are present in some but not all members of a population, and estimated to be present in 14&#x0025; of karyotyped orthopteran insect species (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jones, 1995</xref></italic>), 8&#x0025; of monocots, and 3&#x0025; of eudicot species (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Levin et al., 2005</xref></italic>). These chromosomes commonly show non-Mendelian modes of inheritance, leading to segregation distortion during meiosis and a change in the frequency of the supernumerary chromosome in the progeny &#x2013; a process that has been described as a chromosome drive (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Valente et al., 2017</xref></italic>). Segregation advantage of supernumerary chromosomes can be due to drive mechanisms at the pre-meiotic, meiotic, or post-meiotic stages of gamete formation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hasegawa, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Houben et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Houben, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mroczek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ohta, 1996</xref></italic>) and has been demonstrated in animals and plants (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mroczek et al., 2006</xref></italic>). In fungi, supernumerary chromosomes have been characterized in several species and notably studied in fungal pathogens where their presence in some cases is associated with virulence (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Miao et al., 1991</xref></italic>). The underlying mechanisms causing non-Mendelian inheritance of the supernumerary chromosomes in fungi are however poorly understood.</p>
<p>The genomic composition of the fungal plant pathogen <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> provides an attractive model to analyze supernumerary chromosome transmission. The genome of this fungus contains one of the largest complements of supernumerary chromosomes reported to date (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goodwin et al., 2011</xref></italic>). The eight distinct supernumerary chromosomes (chr14 to chr21) of the reference isolate IPO323 show presence/absence polymorphisms among isolates and differ in their genetic composition compared to the essential chromosomes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goodwin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Plissonneau et al., 2016</xref></italic>). The supernumerary chromosomes in <italic>Z. tritici</italic> are enriched in repetitive elements (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dhillon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goodwin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grandaubert et al., 2015</xref></italic>), mainly heterochromatic (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schotanus et al., 2015</xref></italic>) and frequently lost during mitosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moeller et al., 2018</xref></italic>) and meiosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Croll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fouch&#x00E9; et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goodwin et al., 2011</xref>; Wittenberg, Alexander H J et al., 2009)</italic> and they show a considerably lower recombination rate compared to the core chromosomes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Croll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Stukenbrock and Dutheil, 2017</xref></italic>). However, core and supernumerary share many repetitive element families and their subtelomeric regions contain the same transposable element families (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dhillon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grandaubert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schotanus et al., 2015</xref></italic>). In contrast to many gene-poor supernumerary chromosomes described in plants and animals, those in <italic>Z. tritici</italic> possess a relatively high number of protein-coding genes (727, corresponding to 6&#x0025; of all genes) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grandaubert et al., 2015</xref></italic>). Recently, we demonstrated that the supernumerary chromosomes of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> confer a fitness cost: Isogenic strains lacking distinct supernumerary chromosomes produce higher amounts of asexual spores during host infection when compared to wild type with the complete set of supernumerary chromosomes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Habig et al., 2017</xref></italic>). Despite the instability and fitness cost of the supernumerary chromosomes, they have been maintained over long evolutionary times (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stukenbrock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Stukenbrock and Dutheil, 2017</xref></italic>), and it is therefore intriguing to address the mechanisms of supernumerary chromosome maintenance in the genome in <italic>Z. tritici.</italic></p>
<p>Here, we used <italic>Z. tritici</italic> with its unique set of supernumerary chromosomes as a model to study the dynamics of unpaired chromosomes during meiosis. <italic>Z. tritici</italic> is a heterothallic, haploid ascomycete (i.e. two individuals of different mating type <italic>[mat1-1</italic> and <italic>mat1-2]</italic> are required to form a diploid zygote) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kema et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kema et al., 2018</xref></italic>). If two haploid cells of opposite mating types contain a different complement of supernumerary chromosomes, the resulting diploid zygote consequently contains unpaired chromosomes. Upon Mendelian segregation during meiosis (segregation of the homologues chromosomes during meiosis I followed by chromatid segregation during meiosis II), four (50&#x0025;) of the eight produced ascospores are predicted to contain the unpaired chromosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To test this prediction, we performed crosses between isolates with different subsets of supernumerary chromosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on controlled experiments and tetrad analyses, we surprisingly found that the supernumerary chromosomes of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> are subject to a meiotic drive restricted to unpaired chromosomes inherited from the female parent. Our results suggest that this drive mechanism is due to an additional, female-specific amplification of unpaired chromosomes during meiosis, a process that can ensure the maintenance of these chromosomes over long evolutionary times.</p>

The spermatial nucleus is transferred from the male partner via the trichogyne to the ascogonium of the female partner, resulting in plasmogamy and a dikaryon with two separate nuclei. Prior to karyogamy, the chromosomes are replicated and this comprise each two chromatids and meiosis is initiated by pairing of homologous chromosomes. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are segregated, followed by chromatid separation in meiosis II. A subsequent mitosis results in the production of eight ascospores contained within one ascus. The expected segregation of chromosomes according to Mendelian law of segregation is shown -which for unpaired chromosomes is 4:0. (B) Schematic illustration of the distribution of supernumerary chromosomes present in the parental strains exemplified for five of nine different crosses performed in this study. Parental strain IPO323 contains eight supernumerary chromosomes (chr14-21, blue). Parental strain IPO94269 contains six supernumerary chromosomes with homolog in IPO323 (chr14, chr15, chr16, chr17, chr19, and chr21 in orange). The IPO323 chromosomes chr18 and chr20 are not present in IPO94269. We used a set of IPO323 chromosome deletion strains to generate an additional unpaired chromosome (as example IPO323&#x0394;chr14 X IPO94269, IPO323&#x0394;chr15 X IPO94269, IPO323&#x0394;chr18 X IPO94269, IPO323&#x0394;chr20 X IPO94269 to demonstrate the one to three unpaired chromosomes and the five to six paired chromosomes present in the different crosses). Orange and blue indicate chromosomes that are shared between both strains. Checkered orange and checkered blue indicate chromosomes that are unique to one parent and therefore unpaired in the zygote.</p></caption>

<title>Unpaired supernumerary chromosomes show drive correlated with mitochondrial transmission</title>
<p>To test the transmission of supernumerary chromosomes during meiosis we used the reference strain IPO323 (mating type <italic>mat1-1)</italic> and eight isogenic chromosome deletion strains (IPO323&#x0394;chr14-21, mating type <italic>mat1-1)</italic> generated in a previous study (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Habig et al., 2017</xref></italic>). Each of the chromosome deletion strains differs in the absence of one supernumerary chromosome, thereby allowing us to compare the transmission of individual chromosomes in a paired and an unpaired state. We crossed these strains, <italic>in planta,</italic> with another <italic>Z. tritici</italic> isolate: IPO94269 <italic>(mat1-2)</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) in three separate experiments (A, B and C) and used a combination of PCR assays, electrophoretic karyotyping and whole genome sequencing to assess the segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. IPO94269 contains six supernumerary chromosomes homologous to the IPO323 chromosomes 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 21 (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>)(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goodwin et al., 2011</xref></italic>). The experiments included a total of 39 crosses of IPO323/IPO323 chromosome deletion strains with IPO94269 resulting in different complements of paired and unpaired supernumerary chromosomes in the diploid zygote (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, Table S1). We hypothesized that the inheritance of the unpaired supernumerary chromosomes could be linked to the female or male role of the parental strain. Sexual mating of heterothallic fungi of the genus <italic>Zymoseptoria</italic> involve a female partner that produces a sexual structure called the ascogonium. The ascogonium receives the spermatium with the male nucleus from the fertilizing male partner through a particular structure called the trichogyne (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Crous, 1998</xref></italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, the same strain can act as either the female or male partner (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kema et al., 2018</xref></italic>). Mitochondrial transmission is generally associated with the female structure (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ni et al., 2011</xref></italic>). We used specific mitochondrial PCR based markers to distinguish the mitochondrial genotype in the progeny and thereby determine which of the two parental strains (in this case IPO323 or IPO94269) acted as a female partner in a cross.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In all three experiments the ascospore progeny showed either the mitochondrial genotype of IPO94269 or IPO323 therefore both strains can act as the female and male partner during crosses (Table S2, S3, S4). However, transmission of the mitochondrial genotype varied significantly between experiments whereby the relative frequency of the IPO94269 mitochondrial genotype in the progeny was 80&#x0025;, 11&#x0025; and 65&#x0025; in experiment A, B and C, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, the transmission of unpaired chromosomes correlated to the sexual role (female/male) of the parent from which the unpaired chromosome was inherited. Unpaired chromosomes inherited from IPO94269 were underrepresented among ascospores with the IPO323 parent mitochondrial genotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, the unpaired supernumerary chromosomes 18 and 20, which were always inherited from the parent IPO323, were highly overrepresented among ascospores with the IPO323 mitochondrial genotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). For ascospores with the mitochondrial type of the IPO94269 parent, this segregation distortion was reversed. Unpaired chromosomes inherited from IPO94269 were highly overrepresented among ascospores with the mitochondrial genotype of the IPO94269 parent. On the other hand, the unpaired supernumerary chromosomes 18 and 20, always inherited from the IPO323 parent, were underrepresented among ascospores with the mitochondrial genotype of the IPO94269 parent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Unpaired supernumerary chromosomes show a segregation advantage only when inherited from the female parent. (A) Relative frequencies of mitochondrial genotypes in random and randomized ascospores in experiments A, B and C. The mitochondrial transmission varied significantly between the three experiments. Statistical significance was inferred by Fisher&#x2019;s exact test (p&#x003C;2.2&#x002A;10<sup>-16</sup>). (B) Relative frequencies of the presence and absence of unpaired supernumerary chromosomes in all progeny ascospores pooled for experiments A, B and C according to the mitochondrial genotype of the ascospore. Orange and blue indicate unpaired chromosomes originating from IPO94269 or IPO323, respectively. For simplification the frequencies of unpaired chromosomes 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 21 originating from IPO94269 are pooled, while data for both unpaired chromosome 18 and 20 originating from IPO323 are depicted separately. Unpaired chromosomes inherited from the parent that provided the mitochondrial genotype (i.e. the female parent) are overrepresented in the progeny, while the same chromosomes when originating from the male parent are not. Statistical significance was inferred by a two-sided binomial test with a probability of p&#x003D;0.5. (C) Cell density affects the sexual role during mating and thereby the transmission of the mitochondria. Relative frequencies of mitochondrial genotype in random and randomized ascospores isolated from crosses of IPO94269 and IPO323&#x0394;chr19 that were co-inoculated on wheat at different cell densities. The resulting progeny shows a correlation between cell-density and mitochondria transmission. Strains inoculated at lower density in general take the female role as observed by the mitochondrial transmission. Statistical significance was inferred by a two-sided Fisher&#x2019;s exact test compared to the co-inoculation with equal cell densities of both strains. d) The cell density affects the transmission of unpaired chromosomes. Relative frequencies in all ascospores of the presence and absence of unpaired supernumerary chromosomes 19, inherited from parent IPO94269 and unpaired chromosomes 18 and 20, inherited from IPO323 &#x0394;chr19 are indicated according to the cell density of the parental strains IPO94269 and IPO323&#x0394;chr19 at inoculation. Statistical significance was inferred by a two-sided Fisher&#x2019;s exact test compared to the co-inoculation with equal cell density of both strains.(&#x002A; &#x003D; p&#x003C;0.05, &#x002A;&#x002A; &#x003D; p&#x003C;0.005, &#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; &#x003D; p&#x003C;0.0005, see Table S5 for details on all statistical tests).</p></caption>

<p>Although the transmission of the supernumerary chromosomes was highly similar between experiments A, B and C when the mitochondrial genotype was used to group the data (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>), the overall transmission of the supernumerary chromosomes varied considerable between the experiments due to the highly divergent mitochondrial genotype inheritance in the three experiments (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). However, we find a clear transmission advantage for all supernumerary chromosomes, except chromosome 14, when pooling all data from the three experiments (transmission to more than 50&#x0025; of the progeny) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that unpaired supernumerary chromosomes show a chromosome drive mechanism, but this drive is restricted to chromosomes inherited from the mitochondria-donating female parent.</p>

<title>Transmission of mitochondria is affected by the cell density</title>
<p>We next asked which factors determine the sexual role and thereby the mitochondrial inheritance in the sexual crosses of <italic>Z. tritici.</italic> To this end, we considered the cell density of the two parental strains as well as the relative timing of infection as determining factors of the sexual role. To test this, we set up crosses between the strains IPO323&#x0394;chr19 and IPO94269 in which the cell density varied from 10<sup>5</sup> cells to 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL of each of the parental strains. Furthermore, we set up crosses in which we varied the relative timing of the infection of the two parental strains to each other by inoculating one parental strain 6 or 12 days later than the other parental strain. To distinguish the female and male partner in the crosses we again assessed the mitochondrial transmission frequencies. Interestingly, we find that the cell density of the two parental strains strongly correlates with the transmission of the mitochondrial genotype. Crosses with a lower cell density of IPO323&#x0394;chr19 resulted in a higher proportion of the progeny carrying the IPO323 mitochondrial genotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, a lower cell density of IPO94269 resulted in a higher proportion of the progeny carrying the IPO94269 mitochondrial genotype. This illustrates that a density-dependent mechanism affects the sexual role of the <italic>Z. tritici</italic> strains during sexual mating.</p>
<p>Variation in the sexual role in turn affected the transmission of unpaired supernumerary chromosomes. The unpaired chromosome 19 inherited from the parent IPO94269 increased in frequency in the meiotic progeny with increasing frequency of the IPO94269 mitochondrial genotype. Unpaired chromosome 18 and chromosome 20 inherited from the parent IPO323&#x0394;chr19 increased in frequency in the meiotic progeny with an increase in frequency of the IPO323 mitochondrial genotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, we find that the relative timing of the infection of the two strains affected the transmission of the <italic>Z. tritici</italic> strains. In crossing experiments where one strain was inoculated with six or twelve days delay, the later-inoculated strain more frequently exhibited the female role (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). This could be either due to the later inoculated strain having a growth disadvantage compared to the earlier inoculated strain therefore producing a lower density of cells. This scenario would be in agreement with our observation that the parental strain with lower cell density develops the female structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Alternatively, the timing of maturation of the male and female structures might differ and possibly the female and male structures of different age could be incompatible. However, a clear effect of cell density and timing is discernable and we therefore conclude that environmental factors that affect the infection density and timing of different <italic>Z. tritici</italic> strain also strongly affect the sexual role of strains and thereby the transmission of supernumerary chromosomes.</p>

<title>Paired supernumerary chromosomes show Mendelian segregation with frequent losses</title>
<p>In <italic>Z. tritici,</italic> as in other ascomycetes, one meiosis produces eight ascospores by an additional mitosis following meiosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ni et al., 2011</xref>; Wittenberg, Alexander H J et al., 2009).</italic> The outcome of single meiotic events can be analyzed by tetrad analyses whereby the eight ascospores of a tetrad - in ascomycetes an ascus - are isolated and genotyped. We used tetrad analyses to address how paired supernumerary chromosomes segregate during meiosis. For a total of 24 separate asci, we verified that all eight ascospores originated from the same ascus and were the products of a single meiosis using six segregating markers located on the essential chromosomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). With these 24 asci we could identify segregation patterns and furthermore eliminate post-meiotic effects on the observed chromosomal frequencies. Each tetrad allowed the analysis of the segregation pattern for both unpaired and paired chromosomes. First, we focused on the segregation of paired chromosomes within these tetrad. In the 24 asci we could observe the transmission of paired accessory chromosomes in 129 instances. We could discern the segregation of each paired supernumerary chromosome using specific segregating markers for each of the supernumerary chromosomes from both parental strains. In general, the paired supernumerary chromosomes showed Mendelian segregation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Of the 129 instances of supernumerary chromosome pairing, 120 (93&#x0025;) showed Mendelian segregation with the expected 4:4 ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, black outline) and only nine instances (7&#x0025;) showed a deviation from the 4:4 ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, red outline). In no instances did the number of ascospores with a segregating marker for a paired supernumerary chromosome exceed the four ascospores predicted by Mendelian segregation. In two of the nine instances however, we found ascospores with two copies of supernumerary chromosome 21, representing one copy from IPO323 and another from IPO94269. Whole genome sequencing validated the presence of two copies of chromosome 21 in the genomes of these ascospores. In the two additional ascospores of the tetrad analysis the chromosome 21 was missing (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A-C</xref>) suggesting that the deviations from non-Mendelian segregation are due to loss of chromosomes, non-disjunction of sister chromatids, or non-disjunction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wittenberg, Alexander H J et al., 2009</xref></italic>).</p>

<p>We next extended the analysis of transmission fidelity to include all ascospores isolated in experiments A, B and C to compare the rate of loss of paired supernumerary chromosomes. We assessed the rate of chromosome loss from 10078 instances of paired supernumerary chromosomes in isolated meiotic progenies. In 377 cases (3.7&#x0025;) we found evidence for supernumerary chromosome loss in the ascospores based on the absence of specific chromosome markers (Table S6). Interestingly, the frequency of loss of paired supernumerary chromosomes varies significantly between the individual chromosomes (&#x03C7;<sup>2</sup>-Test: exp. A: p&#x003D;1.96&#x00D7;10<sup>-06</sup>, exp. B: p&#x003D;1.72&#x00D7;10<sup>-09</sup>, exp.

The frequency of chromosome loss, however, shows no correlation to particular chromosome characteristics like chromosome size or the extent of homology between the chromosomes from IPO323 and IPO94269 (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Unpaired supernumerary chromosomes inherited from the female show meiotic drive</title>
<p>Using the same 24 complete tetrads we dissected the fate of unpaired chromosomes during single meiotic events. Each tetrad contained between one to three unpaired chromosomes with chromosome 18 and 20 being solely inherited from IPO323 and chromosome 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19 being solely inherited by the IPO94269 in crosses performed with the five IPO323 whole-chromosome-deletion strains. In contrast to paired supernumerary chromosomes, unpaired supernumerary chromosomes show distinct segregation distortion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) that correlates with mitochondrial transmission; unpaired chromosomes originating from the female parent show a strong meiotic chromosome drive. On the other hand, unpaired chromosomes originating from the male parent (i.e. the parent that did not provide the mitochondria) show Mendelian segregation and are more frequently lost.</p>

Analysis of segregation of unpaired supernumerary chromosomes in 24 complete tetrads according to the mitochondrial genotype. The transmission of chromosomes unique to one of the parental strains and the mitochondrial genotype was detected using chromosomal or mitochondrial markers originating from IPO94269 (orange) and IPO323 (blue) in eight ascospores derived from 24 asci. When IPO323 was the female parent (i.e. the ascospores inherited the mitochondrial genotype of the IPO323 parent) unpaired chromosomes 18 and 20 originating from IPO323 show a strong chromosome drive and are overrepresented in the ascospores. When IPO94269 was the female parent unpaired chromosomes originating from IPO94269 show a strong chromosome drive. Unpaired chromosomes originating from the male parent (i.e. the one not donating the mitochondrial genotype) show Mendelian segregation or are lost.

<p>In the 24 tetrads dissected here, all eight ascospores originating from the same ascus showed the same mitochondrial genotype (Table S3-S4) confirming previous results on the uniparental inheritance of mitochondria in <italic>Z. tritici (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kema et al., 2018</xref></italic>). Isolated ascospores had the mitochondrial genotype of the parent IPO323 in 18 asci, while the ascospores of the remaining six asci showed the IPO94269 genotype, confirming that both parental strains, IPO323 and IPO94269, can act as the female parent during sexual mating with no significant difference between the two strains (two sided binomial (p&#x003D;0.5), p&#x003D;0.25) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kema et al., 2018</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>In 18 asci that showed the IPO323 mitochondrial genotype, supernumerary chromosomes 18 and 20, inherited from IPO323 (the female), were unpaired in 15 and 16 meioses, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Chromosome 18 was present in all eight ascospores in 11 of the 15 asci (ascus #1-11) instead of the expected four ascospores. In two asci, the chromosome was present in six ascospores (ascus #12-13). Chromosome 20 was present in all eight ascospores (ascus #1-15) in 15 of the 16 asci and in one ascus in six ascospores (ascus #16). This transmission pattern was reversed for the six asci exhibiting the IPO94269 mitochondrial genotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) Here, the female-inherited unpaired chromosomes from IPO94269 show meiotic drive while the male-inherited unpaired chromosomes from IPO323 show Mendelian segregation or were lost (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). We validated our PCR-karyotyping by sequencing the genomes of 16 ascospore isolates originating from two asci and mapped the resulting reads to the reference genome of IPO323. For all 16 ascospores we find similar coverage for all essential chromosomes and supernumerary chromosomes (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>) and all 16 ascospores show similar coverage for chromosome 18 and 20 verifying the transmission of these chromosomes to the eight ascospores of each ascus instead of the expected four ascospores.</p>
<p>The meiotic drive of the unpaired supernumerary chromosome could imply an additional amplification step that only affects unpaired chromosomes derived from the female parent. We found however that in one cross, this additional amplification of an unpaired chromosome was incomplete: In the ascus A08-1, unpaired chromosome 18 was transmitted to all eight ascospores, but four of the ascospores contained only a partial chromosome 18, (Figure</p>
<p>S3F). The partial chromosomes 18 showed Mendelian segregation, indicating that the additional amplification step of the unpaired chromosome 18 occurred prior to the first meiotic division, which in this rare case was incomplete.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The fate of supernumerary chromosomes during meiosis is poorly understood despite the widespread occurrence of this type of chromosome in different taxa. Here, we show that unpaired chromosomes of the fungal plant pathogen <italic>Z. tritici</italic> are transmitted and amplified by a meiotic drive which acts only on chromosomes inherited from the female parent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Crossing experiments of haploid individuals of opposite mating types document this as: i) unpaired supernumerary chromosomes show chromosome drive only when inherited from the female parent; ii) unpaired supernumerary chromosomes show Mendelian segregation with frequent losses when inherited from the male parent; and iii) paired supernumerary chromosomes show Mendelian segregation, but with frequent losses during meiosis.</p>

Light blue/orange: paired supernumerary chromosome. Checkered blue: unpaired supernumerary chromosome. (A) Chromosome drive occurring during meiosis, only those unpaired supernumerary chromosomes in the zygote that originated from the female parent are subject to an additional round of DNA replication, allowing for pairing of the two copies of the chromosome. (B) Alternative scenario under which the chromosome drive occurs prior to meiosis. All supernumerary chromosomes are amplified to double the copy number during development of the female ascogonium. The supernumerary chromosomes are paired in the zygote during meiosis.

<p>Our data strongly suggest that this chromosome drive does not result from pre-or post-meiotic mechanisms but occurs during meiosis. First of all, we exclude the occurrence of a post-meiotic chromosome drive, e.g. killing of ascospores that did not contain the drive element, as this would make it impossible to isolate complete tetrads, which we were able to. Second, we consider any pre-meiotic mechanisms that could affect the number of accessory chromosomes unlikely. These mechanisms could either be a premeiotic amplification (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) or preferential segregation of the supernumerary chromosomes. Both mechanism would affect all supernumerary chromosomes in the haploid nucleus prior to karyogamy, because at this stage it not defined which of the supernumerary chromosomes will become paired and which will be unpaired. Therefore, these mechanisms should always affect all supernumerary chromosomes irrespective of whether they will become paired or unpaired after karyogamy. If such a pre-meiotic amplification or preferential segregation would occur, the diploid zygote resulting after karyogamy would be trisomic for all paired supernumerary chromosomes and disomic for the unpaired chromosomes. This trisomie would result in a non-Mendelian inheritance of paired supernumerary chromosomes. We did however, observe Mendelian segregation for the paired supernumerary chromosomes and importantly did not find any indication of additional copies of paired supernumerary chromosomes in the tetrad analysis. This segregation pattern would only be possible if the additional copies of the female-inherited paired supernumerary chromosomes would be lost during meiosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Tightly regulated chromosome loss has been described for sex chromosomes in several insect species during embryonic development, where maternal and paternal imprinting determine the elimination of chromosomes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">S&#x00E1;nchez, 2014</xref></italic>). For <italic>Z. tritici,</italic> a similar mechanism would imply that all additional copies of all female supernumerary chromosomes would be eliminated during meiosis - except for the two copies of the female-inherited unpaired supernumerary chromosomes - while male supernumerary chromosomes would be unaffected. We consider this mechanism to be unlikely. In general, any pre-meiotic mechanism should affect both unpaired and paired chromosomes and therefore would require a counteracting mechanism after karyogamy that results in the Mendelian Segregation pattern observed in the paired supernumerary chromosomes. Instead, we propose that an additional amplification affecting only female-inherited supernumerary chromosomes could be a plausible scenario explaining the observed meiotic drive of supernumerary chromosomes in <italic>Z. tritici</italic> during sexual mating. The additional amplification of unpaired supernumerary chromosomes would require an additional initiation of DNA-replication restricted to unpaired chromosomes and therefore a feedback between pairing of homologous chromosomes and DNA replication. Although DNA-replication is a highly regulated process and any feedback from chromosome pairing is currently unknown, we suggest that this model is the most likely to explain the observed pattern. Feedback between meiotic S-phase and the pairing of homologous chromosomes has been proposed based on the effects of interchromosomal interaction proteins like Spo11 - a key mediator of interhomolog interactions that is responsible for the initiation of meiotic recombination - on the progression of meiotic DNA replication (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cha et al., 2000</xref></italic>). Although Spo11 cannot explain the additional amplification of unpaired chromosomes it highlights a potential for a feedback between pairing of homologues and DNA-replication. In addition, pairing of homologous chromosomes or sequences has also been described for somatic cells in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> highlighting the possible existence of homologues pairing prior to DNA-replication (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Burgess et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dernburg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Joyce et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Scherthan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Weiner and Kleckner, 1994</xref></italic>). We therefore consider it possible that meiosis in <italic>Z. tritici</italic> involves an additional feedback mechanism that induces an additional round of amplification based on the unpaired chromosome status.</p>
<p>A meiotic chromosome drive can explain the continued maintenance of supernumerary chromosomes in <italic>Z. tritici</italic> despite the negative effects on fitness during host infection (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Habig et al., 2017</xref></italic>). However, it is unclear how this type of chromosome drive can act simultaneously on several separate chromosomes. In our experiments, we found that seven of the eight supernumerary chromosomes showed drive, and we hypothesize that the drive mechanism (i.e., the additional amplification of the unpaired female supernumerary chromosomes) depends on a general characteristic of the supernumerary chromosomes. Interestingly, we observed the meiotic drive of unpaired accessory chromosomes for 7 of the 8 accessory chromosomes of the reference isolate IPO323. Chr14 for which no such transmission advantage was observed, is the largest of the accessory chromosomes (773 kb) in IPO323 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goodwin et al., 2011</xref></italic>). A large insertion spanning approx. 400 kb in chr14 shows presence/absence polymorphism in <italic>Z. tritici</italic> resulting in isolates that contain a much smaller chr14 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Croll et al., 2013</xref></italic>). Interestingly the smaller chr14 showed a transmission advantage when present in one the parental strains in a previous study (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Croll et al., 2013</xref></italic>), which could point to chromosome size as a factor influencing the observed drive.</p>
<p>Currently, we cannot explain why the hypothesized additional amplification of the supernumerary chromosome is restricted to unpaired chromosomes inherited from the female parent. In ascomycetes, plasmogamy and karyogamy are separated by a dikaryon stage, in which the female and male nuclei are separate (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ni et al., 2011</xref></italic>). Consequently, there is a temporal separation of the processes determining uniparental inheritance of the mitochondria, nuclear inheritance, and the proposed additional amplification of the unpaired supernumerary chromosomes. Female chromosome drive in the fungus would depend on a female-derived signal that persists through plasmogamy to karyogamy when DNA amplification takes place. We currently do not know the nature of this signal, but speculate that it could be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms similar to genomic imprinting.</p>
<p>In this study, we have shown that supernumerary chromosomes of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> are subjected to a meiotic drive, which is probably dependent on an additional meiotic amplification of unpaired chromosomes. This mechanism may explain the continued maintenance of supernumerary chromosomes in <italic>Z. tritici</italic> over long evolutionary times in spite of their frequent loss during mitosis and their fitness cost during plant infection and asexual propagation.</p>

<title>Ascospore isolation and ascus verification</title>
<p>Ascospores were isolated from the WA 18-28h after ejection from the ascus using a dissecting stereo microscope and a sterile syringe needle, placed onto YMS plates and grown for 6-7days at 18&#x00B0;C. One colony per isolated ascospore was streaked out on YMS plates and grown again for 6-7 days at 18&#x00B0;C. Single colonies were isolated and used for all further characterisation. To isolate all ascospore from an ascus eight germinated ascospores that were spatially separate on the WA were considered to be ejected from one ascus. All eight ascospores were isolated.</p>
<p>To verify that the eight ascospores originated from the same ascus, the following six segregating markers located on the essential chromosomes were used: <italic>mat1-1/mat1-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Waalwijk et al., 2002</xref></italic>), 11O21, 04L20, caa-0002, ggc-001 and ac-0001 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Goodwin et al., 2007</xref></italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Only when i) all eight ascospores from one putative ascus showed a 4:4 ratio based on the amplification of these markers AND ii) exactly two ascospores were twins, we considered the ascospores to be derived from one ascus. As an internal PCR control an amplification of the <italic>gapdh</italic> (primer: 879, 880) was used to verify negative PCR results.</p>
<p>In experiment B a total of 440 ascospores were isolated from 55 asci, and of these, 128 ascospores from 16 asci met the criteria and were considered to be derived from within one ascus. In experiment C a total of 504 ascospores were isolated from a total of 63 asci, and of these, 64 of eight asci met these criteria. The mitochondrial genotype was determined using the primers Mt-SSR-F and Mt-SSR-R (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kema et al., 2018</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Ascospores were karyotyped for the presence of supernumerary chromosomes using primer pairs specifically designed to test for the presence of chromosomes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 derived from IPO323 and from IPO94269 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>, Figure S4) using standard conditions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Habig et al., 2017</xref></italic>).

For paired supernumerary chromosomes, we designed the primers to reveal a size difference in the amplification products of IPO323-derived and IPO94269-derived chromosomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>, Figure S4).

<caption><p>Transmission of unpaired chromosomes and mitochondria. (A) Detailed presence/absence frequencies for all unpaired supernumerary chromosomes according to the mitochondrial genotype present in all ascospores. Data for the three experiments A, B and C are depicted separately. Statistical significance was inferred by a two-sided binomial test with a probability of p&#x003D;0.5. (B) Detailed presence/absence frequencies for all unpaired supernumerary chromosome in experiment A, B and C, restricted to all co-inoculation crosses using 1&#x002A;10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL cell density for both parental strains. Experiment A, B and C differ in the observed transmission advantage for the chromosomes originating from the parent IPO94269 (orange) or IPO323 (blue). Statistical significance was inferred by a twosided binomial test with a probability of p&#x003D;0.5. (C) Presence/absence frequencies of all unpaired supernumerary chromosomes pooled for all three experiments A, B and C, restricted to all co-inoculation crosses using the 1&#x002A;10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL cell density for both parental strains. All supernumerary chromosomes, with the exception of chromosome 14 show a highly significant transmission advantage. Statistical significance was inferred by a two-sided binomial test with a probability of p&#x003D;0.5. (D) Varying the infection time points impact the sexual role in crosses. Relative frequency of ascospore mitochondrial genotype is affected by the relative timing of the infection of the two parental strains IPO94269 (orange) and IPO323&#x0394;chr19. IPO94269 and IPO323&#x0394;chr19 were inoculated at either day 0, day &#x002B;6 and day &#x002B;12 creating situations were one parental strains had already established an infection when at day &#x002B;6 and day &#x002B;12 the other parental strains was inoculated on the same leaf. Parental strains infecting relatively later will preferentially assume the female role. Statistical significance was inferred by a two-sided Fisher&#x2019;s exact test compared to the co-inoculation of both strains at day 0.
