<title>Abstract</title>
<p>There is now extensive evidence that the hippocampus replays experiences during quiet rest periods, and that this replay benefits subsequent memory. A critical open question is how memories are prioritized for replay during these offline periods. We addressed this question in an experiment in which participants learned the features of 15 objects and then underwent fMRI scanning to track item-level replay in the hippocampus using pattern analysis during a rest period. Objects that were remembered less well were replayed more during the subsequent rest period, suggesting a prioritization process in which weaker memories&#x2014;memories most vulnerable to forgetting&#x2014;are selected for wake replay. Participants came back for a second session, either after a night of sleep or a day awake, and underwent another scanned rest period followed by a second memory test. In the second session, more hippocampal replay of a satellite during the rest period predicted better subsequent memory for that satellite. Only in the group with intervening sleep did rest replay predict improvement from the first to second session. Our results provide the first evidence that replay of individual memories occurs during rest in the human hippocampus and that this replay prioritizes weakly learned information, predicts subsequent memory performance, and relates to memory improvement across a delay with sleep.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The brain is highly active even when an organism is disengaged from its sensory environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. There is accumulating evidence from the rodent literature that the hippocampus replays recent experiences during these rest periods, typically measured as place cells firing in a sequence corresponding to an experienced trajectory of locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. These replay events appear to be functional: they relate to later memory performance and their disruption impairs memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Many human studies, mainly using fMRI, likewise suggest that content from a recent experience reactivates during subsequent rest periods, and that this activity relates to later memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. These studies have found replay<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> of individual items outside the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and category-level reinstatement within the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], though replay of individual items within the human hippocampus has not yet been observed.</p>
<p>What process determines which memories get replayed? The brain likely cannot replay every experienced event during rest, nor would it be worthwhile to do so&#x2014;not all memories need or deserve further processing. There is evidence that memories are more likely to be replayed during subsequent awake rest when associated with reward or fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. There is also evidence that certain kinds of memories benefit more from a period of sleep, including memories that are relevant to future behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], that are emotionally laden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], and that are weaker in strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Of particular relevance, this prioritization of weaker memories was observed in prior work using the current paradigm, where objects exposed least frequently during training benefitted the most from a nap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. These sleep studies do not directly demonstrate that replay prioritizes weaker (or other types of) memories, as replay was not measured, but the ubiquity of sleep replay and its association with memory improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] suggest that prioritized replay is a potential mediator of the behavioral benefits. While there have been many studies assessing the relationship of rest replay to subsequent memory, there has not yet been a direct test of how initial memory strength relates to subsequent replay.</p>
<p>The current study assesses how replay is prioritized on the dimension of memory strength, and tests the effects of such replay on subsequent memory, using a property-inference task developed in prior work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Participants learned the features of 15 &#x201C;satellite&#x201D; objects belonging to three categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), where satellites in the same category shared most of their features. Those assigned to a Sleep group participated in a first session in the evening and a second session the next morning, while those assigned to a Wake group had their first session in the morning and second session that evening. In Session 1, we (1) taught participants the features of the satellites, (2) tested their memory for these features, (3) measured the neural response generated by each of the satellites in the fMRI scanner, and then (4) used pattern analysis to assess whether individual items were replayed by the hippocampus during a rest period in the scanner. In the second session, we again tested memory, measured neural responses to the individual satellites, and assessed replay during rest, with the one difference that the memory test came last instead of first.</p>

<p>This design allowed us to answer four questions critical to understanding the role of hippocampus in the consolidation of object knowledge:</p>
<p>1. Are representations of recently learned individual items replayed in the human hippocampus during quiet rest? Prior literature in humans and rodents suggests that this occurs, but it has not yet been observed at the resolution of individual items in humans.</p>
<p>2. Does probability of replay relate to the strength of a memory, as determined by the initial memory test? It is possible that weaker memories are prioritized for replay, as suggested by the sleep literature; alternatively, stronger memories may be more likely to persist into subsequent rest.</p>
<p>3. Does replay of specific items in the hippocampus predict subsequent memory? Prior literature in humans and rodents suggests a positive relationship, though this has not yet been assessed for individual hippocampal memories in humans.</p>
<p>4. Does the relationship between wake replay and memory improvement over a delay relate to the presence of intervening sleep? Replay measured during awake rest periods may reflect (or perhaps influence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]) the processing that continues to occur in the intervening period between sessions, and this processing may be especially beneficial over sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>24 participants (14 females, mean age = 24.5 years, range = 19&#x2013;38 years) from the Princeton University community participated in exchange for monetary compensation or course credit. Data from six additional subjects were excluded due to excessive motion (three subjects), technical issues (two subjects), and poor performance on the one-back task in the scanner (one subject; A' &#x003E; 2 SD below average). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at Princeton University.</p>
<p>Subjects reported no history of neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, major medical issues, or use of medication known to interfere with sleep. Subjects also reported having a regular sleep-wake schedule, which was defined as regularly going to bed no later than 2AM, waking up no later than 10AM, and getting at least 7 hours of total sleep per night on average. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire [MEQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] were used to screen out potential subjects with excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS score &#x003E;10), extreme chronotypes (MEQ &#x003C; 31 or &#x003E; 69), and poor sleep quality (PSQI &#x003E; 5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>Participants learned about 15 novel &#x201C;satellite&#x201D; objects organized into three classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Each satellite has a &#x201C;class&#x201D; name (Alpha, Beta, or Gamma) shared with other members of the same category, a unique &#x201C;code&#x201D; name, and five visual parts. One of the satellites in each category is the prototype (shown on the left for each category in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), which contains all the prototypical parts for that category. Each of the other satellites has one part deviating from the prototype. Thus, each non-prototype shares 4 features with the prototype and 3 features with other non-prototypes from the same category. Exemplars from different categories do not share any features. Each satellite has <italic>shared features</italic>: the class name and the parts shared among members of the category, and <italic>unique features</italic>: the code name and the part unique to that satellite (except for the prototype, which has no unique parts). Satellites were constructed randomly for each participant, constrained by this category structure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Procedure: prior to experiment</title>
<p>Subjects were instructed to attempt at least 7 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights prior to (and during, in the case of Sleep subjects) the study. Adherence to the sleep schedule was tracked with daily sleep diaries. Subjects were also asked to refrain from any alcohol for 24 hours prior to the first session, and throughout the experiment, and to keep caffeine intake to a minimum during this period. Heavy caffeine users (>3 servings per day) were not enrolled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Procedure: Session 1 Training</title>
<p>Participants learned about the satellites in two phases. In the first phase, which lasted 15 minutes on average, the satellites were introduced one by one. For each satellite, the class and code name were displayed, followed by the image of the satellite. A box highlighted each of the five visual features on the satellite image one by one, to encourage participants to attend to each feature. Participants were then asked to recall the class and code names by clicking on one of three options given for each name. Next, participants used a point-and-click interface to try to reconstruct the satellite image from scratch. Icons representing the five part types were displayed on the right hand side of the screen, and when an icon was clicked, all the possible versions of that part were displayed in a row on the bottom of the screen. The participant could then click on one of the part versions on the bottom to add it to the satellite in the center of the screen. If the participant was too slow at this task (took longer than 15 s), or reconstructed the satellite incorrectly, a feedback screen would appear displaying the correct features.</p>
<p>In the second phase of training, which lasted 32 minutes on average, participants were shown a satellite with one feature missing, which could be one of the five visual features, the code name, or the class name (code and class name buttons were displayed along with the part icons on the right hand side of the screen, and when selected, displayed the corresponding name options in a row on the bottom). Using the same point-and-click interface, participants chose a feature (out of all possible) to complete the satellite. If they chose the correct feature, they were told it was correct, and could move on to the next trial. If they chose an incorrect feature, they were shown the correct feature, and had to repeat the trial until they chose the correct feature.</p>
<p>Remembering the shared properties of the satellites is easier than remembering the unique properties, as the shared properties are reinforced across study of all the satellites in the same class. The task was titrated in pilot testing to ensure that, at the end of training, participants performed equivalently at retrieving shared and unique properties of the satellites. To accomplish this, unique features were queried 24 times more frequently than shared features. This phase of training continued until the participant reached a criterion of 66&#x0025; of trials correct on a block of 32 trials, or until 60 minutes had passed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Procedure: Session 1 Test</title>
<p>Immediately after training, participants were tested by again filling in missing features of the satellites, now without feedback. The test phase had 39 trials, with two missing features per trial, which allowed us to collect more information per trial as well as provide less exposure to the correct features (to minimize learning during the test phase). The test phase took 10 minutes on average. Each satellite appeared twice in the test phase: once with its code name and its class name or one shared part tested, and once with two shared parts or one unique part and one shared part tested. The remaining 9 trials tested generalization to novel satellites. Novel satellites were members of the trained categories but had one novel feature. The queried feature for novel items was always a shared part (class name or shared visual feature). Test trials were presented in a random order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Procedure: fMRI scanning</title>
<p>After completion of the first session test phase, participants were scanned while viewing the satellite images (without names) for 52 minutes. Satellites subtended up to 19 degrees of visual angle on the scanner projection. There were 8 runs, lasting 6.5 mins each, with self-paced breaks between runs. In each run, each of the 15 images was presented four times in pseudo-random order, such that each satellite appeared in the first, second, third, and fourth quarter of the trials. Four trials in each run were randomly chosen to be duplicated, such that these satellites were shown twice in immediate succession. These served as rare (4 trials out of 64) targets for a one-back task that subjects performed while viewing the satellites, to encourage maintenance of attention. Subjects pressed one key on a keypad to indicate that the current satellite was not an exact repetition of the previous satellite, and a different key to indicate that it was a repetition. Keys corresponded to index and middle fingers of the right hand, with key assignment for repetition and no-repetition counterbalanced across subjects. Feedback for responses at each trial was provided as a green or red dot at fixation. Each satellite was presented for 3s with a jittered interstimulus interval (40&#x0025; 1s, 40&#x0025; 3s, 20&#x0025; 5s), to facilitate modeling of the response to individual items.</p>
<p>Next, we collected a ninth 6.5-min functional run where participants were instructed to relax and watch the fixation dot on the screen, emphasizing that they should keep their eyes open.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Procedure: Session 2</title>
<p>In Session 2, participants did the same scan procedure, with images presented in a different random order. Then they got out of the scanner and completed the same test phase as in the first session, with items presented in a different random order. The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [KSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], which assesses state sleepiness/alertness on a scale of 1 (extremely alert) to 9 (very sleepy), was completed at the beginning and end of each session.</p>
<p>Participants in the Sleep group (n=12) began the first session around 7pm and the second session around 9am, and participants in the Wake group (n=12) began the first session around 9:30am and the second session around 10pm (time choices were constrained by scanner availability). They were not told in the first session that there would be a second memory test, though when asked afterwards, they generally reported feeling that a second test was likely and that they were not surprised by it. Subjects in the Wake condition were instructed not to nap between sessions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>fMRI data acquisition</title>
<p>Data were acquired using a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner with a volume head coil. In each session, we collected 9 functional runs with a T2&#x002A;-weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence (36 oblique axial slices: 3&#x00D7;3 mm inplane, 3 mm thickness; TE=30 ms; TR=2000 ms; FA=71&#x00B0;; matrix=64&#x00D7;64). Each run contained 195 volumes. We collected two anatomical runs for registration across subjects to standard space: a coplanar T1-weighted FLASH sequence and a high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence. An in-plane magnetic field map image was also acquired for EPI undistortion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i">
<title>Regions of interest (ROIs)</title>
<p>The hippocampus ROIs were calculated for each participant in subject space using automatic segmentation in Freesurfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. ROIs of hippocampus subfields CA1 and CA2/3/DG were defined from a probabilistic atlas of the medial temporal lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], projected into subject space for analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2j">
<title>fMRI preprocessing</title>
<p>Functional runs were preprocessed using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 5.98, part of FSL (FMRIB&#x2019;s Software Library, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>), including: removal of first four volumes, motion correction using MCFLIRT (individual runs with excessive estimated motion were excluded); fieldmap-based EPI unwarping using PRELUDE&#x002B;FUGUE; slice-timing correction using Fourier-space time-series phase-shifting; non-brain removal using BET; spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 5mm; and high-pass temporal filtering using a 64s-sigma Gaussian kernel. Functional runs were registered with FLIRT to the FLASH image, the MPRAGE image, and an MNI standard brain with interpolation to 2mm isotropic voxels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2k">
<title>General Linear Model (GLM) for calculation of satellite templates</title>
<p>We modeled the evoked response to individual satellites across a dataset concatenating the 8 preprocessed runs for satellite-viewing periods. The GLM was fit using FILM with local autocorrelation correction in FSL. The model contained a regressor for each of the 15 satellites. Each regressor had a delta function at every presentation of the satellite, excluding repetitions added for the one-back task, convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function. There were also 8 regressors indicating which run the data at that TR corresponded to. The resulting parameter estimates reflected the response of all voxels to each individual satellite, which we call the satellite&#x2019;s <italic>template</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2l">
<title>Replay analysis</title>
<p>Within each session for each participant, we compared each of these templates to the pattern of activity at each TR of the rest period to find potential replay events. After preprocessing the data from the rest period as described above, the time series was low-pass filtered through a convolution with a three-point-width Hamming window. This transformation makes the data frequency closer to that of the hemodynamic response function, serving as a replacement for event-related convolution in this scenario where event timing is unknown. We next converted to percent signal change and excluded any voxels with variance more than three SDs from the mean. Then, for all voxels within an ROI or a searchlight (defined as described below), we computed the Pearson correlation between each template and the pattern of activity at each TR of the rest period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This resulted in a matrix of positive and negative values for 15 satellites by 191 TRs in the rest period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>, left).</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 2.</label>
<caption>
<p>Methods. (<bold>a</bold>) Each satellite&#x2019;s template (satellite 1 shown as example) consists of a pattern of beta weights across all voxels in the hippocampus. The template is correlated with the preprocessed pattern of activity across all voxels in the hippocampus at each TR of the rest period. (<bold>b</bold>) This results in a matrix of correlation value between all templates and all rest period TRs, which is thresholded to reflect &#x201C;potential replays.&#x201D; (<bold>c</bold>) The potential replay activity for a given template is summed across TRs and then correlated with memory performance.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="173021_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To narrow this matrix down to potential replay events, we only considered activity with strong correspondence between templates and rest period activity. At each TR, we defined strong correspondence as more than 1.5 SDs above the mean across the 15 satellites (1.5 value based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]). We chose this approach to increase our chances of seeing satellite-specific replay, as opposed to a brain state at a given TR that resembles satellites in general, while still allowing for the possibility that multiple satellites (or none) are replayed at a given TR.</p>
<p>After thresholding the matrix at each TR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>, right), we summed the total amount of potential replay activity across all TRs for each satellite, and then correlated these values with that individual&#x2019;s memory for the satellites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Across-subject statistics were calculated on these Fisher-transformed correlation values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2m">
<title>Representation of category structure</title>
<p>Within the hippocampus and subfield ROIs, we calculated all pairwise correlations between templates corresponding to satellites from the same category and all correlations between templates for satellites from different categories, and subtracted the average between-category correlation from the average within-category correlation. This provides an estimate of the extent to which objects from the same category are represented similarly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2n">
<title>Searchlight analyses</title>
<p>We additionally ran the replay and representation-of-category-structure analyses within every 3 x 3 x 3 voxel cube in the brain. We assigned the final replay-behavior correlation value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>) for the replay analysis, or the correlation difference value for the category-structure analysis, to the center voxel of each searchlight, and then projected these maps to MNI space to allow comparison across participants. We used the <italic>randomise</italic> function in FSL to perform permutation tests to test for reliable clusters, using a cluster formation threshold corresponding to <italic>p</italic>=0.01.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2o">
<title>GLM for univariate change effects</title>
<p>We also ran a GLM to test for overall univariate differences in activity level between the first and second session. Instead of one regressor for each satellite, the model had one regressor with a delta function at every image presentation. We subtracted the map for Session 1 from the map for Session 2, and assessed cluster reliability for Sleep and Wake groups separately as well as contrasting Sleep and Wake groups.</p>

<title>Test performance</title>
<p>Performance on the first test was not different for subjects in the Sleep vs. Wake groups in unique, shared, or novel item features (<italic>p</italic>s>0.564). Performance was also not different within each group for unique and shared features, indicating a successful match based on the different feature-type query frequencies used in training (mean Sleep unique = 0.701, mean Sleep shared = 0.677, <italic>t</italic>[11]=0.444, <italic>p</italic>=0.666; mean Wake unique = 0.695, mean Wake shared = 0.715, <italic>t</italic>[11]=0.686, <italic>p</italic>=0.507).</p>
<p>Based on our prior work using this paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], we predicted that the Sleep group would improve in memory for shared features from the first to second session, the Wake group would decline in memory for shared and unique features, and the Sleep group would improve more than the Wake group for shared and unique features. We thus employed one-tailed t-tests in these analyses. As expected, we found a reliable difference between Sleep and Wake groups in improvement from the first to second session in overall memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; <italic>t</italic>[22]=2.110, <italic>p</italic>=0.023, one-tailed), and a reliable difference between groups for unique visual (<italic>t</italic>[22]=2.190, <italic>p</italic>=0.020, one-tailed) and shared visual features (<italic>t</italic>[22]=1.995, <italic>p</italic>=0.029, one-tailed).</p>

<p>The Sleep group showed significant improvement in overall memory (collapsing across shared and unique features) from Session 1 to Session 2 tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; mean improvement in proportion correct = 0.057; <italic>t</italic>[11]=2.498, <italic>p</italic>=0.015, one-tailed), while the Wake group showed a nonsignificant decrement in performance (mean = &#x2212;0.022, <italic>t</italic>[11]=0.731, <italic>p</italic>=0.240, one-tailed). As in our prior study, memory for shared features in the Sleep group increased reliably, while memory for unique features stayed constant (mean change for shared = 0.137, <italic>t</italic>[11]=4.187, <italic>p</italic>=0.001, one-tailed; mean change for unique = &#x2212;0.022, <italic>t</italic>[11]=0.693, <italic>p</italic>=0.503). In the Wake group, there was a nonsignificant improvement in memory for shared features (mean = 0.049, <italic>t</italic>[11]=1.333, <italic>p</italic>=0.896, one-tailed), and a decrease in memory for unique features (mean = &#x2212;0.092, <italic>t</italic>[11]=-2.081, <italic>p</italic>=0.031, one-tailed). Note that participants were exposed to the visual features of the satellites in the scanner between the two behavioral tests, which could have affected absolute levels of change from Session 1 to Session 2 within each group; however, this issue does not affect Sleep/Wake comparisons, as visual feature exposure was matched across these conditions.</p>
<p>Change in novel item feature performance was similar for the two groups, as we had found in our prior study.

<title>Correlation between memory performance and subsequent hippocampal replay within Session 1</title>

We correlated replay for each satellite in each session with change in performance for that satellite (Session 2 &#x2013; Session 1 performance).

<title>Representation of category structure</title>

<p>We ran exploratory wholebrain searchlights looking for other regions where item replay during Session 1 or Session 2 might relate to behavior within that session, or regions where replay during Session 1 or Session 2 might relate to the change in performance from Session 1 to 2. No regions survived multiple comparisons correction.</p>
<p>We also ran a searchlight to test whether areas outside the hippocampus might represent the category structure (as found in hippocampal subfield CA1). We found two significant clusters, both associated with visual processing, identified according to a probabilistic atlas of the visual system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]: One in visual cortex (corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.0002), spanning V1-V4, and another in frontal cortex (corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.031), partially overlapping with the frontal eye fields and falling within regions of the inferior frontal sulcus involved in spatial vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Responses in these areas likely reflect the fact that objects in the same category share visual features. There were no differences in category structure between sessions or groups in this wholebrain analysis.</p>
<p>We next tested whether there were any changes in overall, univariate activity level from the first to second session. While there were no effects that survived cluster correction for the Wake group, or for Sleep contrasted with Wake, we did find a reliable cluster in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that increased in activity from Session 1 to 2 in the Sleep group (corrected <italic>p=</italic>0.030; coordinates of center of gravity: 45.2, 87.8, 35.8; extent=521 voxels).</p>

<title>Assessing the role of attention</title>
<p>There is a potential alternative explanation for the negative correlation between memory and subsequent replay in Session 1 due to the presence of the intervening fMRI measurement period: If participants attend more during the measurement period to the stimuli that they had just performed poorly on, this could cause persistence of the representations of those attended satellites into the subsequent rest period. To test this idea, we assessed whether satellites with worse average memory performance in Session 1 had higher BOLD activity in a canonical attention network (&#x201C;attention&#x201D; network from neurosynth.org using reverse inference: <italic>attention_pFgA_z_FDR_0.01.nii</italic>) during the subsequent measurement period. We found no evidence for a relationship (mean correlation = 0.014, <italic>t</italic>[23]=0.253, <italic>p</italic>=0.803). We also tested for this effect in the hippocampus and found no relationship there (mean correlation = &#x2212;0.003; <italic>t</italic>[23]=0.060, <italic>p</italic>=0.952). Next, we ran the analysis at every voxel in the brain and assessed whether any areas showed reliable cluster-corrected results. There were no reliable clusters looking across the whole brain, nor with small volume correction within the attention network (all <italic>p</italic>s>0.686). We therefore conclude that attention to poorly-remembered stimuli during the measurement period is unlikely to be driving the negative relationship between memory and replay in Session 1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>How does hippocampal replay during quiet rest relate to previous learning and to subsequent memory? To address these questions, we taught participants the features of 15 objects and assessed replay of individual object representations before and after memory tests. We did extensive repeated exposure of the objects during fMRI scanning to maximize our ability to create a high-fidelity template that could be used to track replay. We found that objects that were initially remembered poorly were subsequently replayed more in the hippocampus, while in a second session, objects that were replayed more were subsequently better remembered. Furthermore, replay was related to change in memory from the first to second test only for participants that slept between the two sessions. These results address the four questions raised in the introduction, with important implications for our understanding of consolidation of object knowledge.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Individual items are replayed in the human hippocampus</title>
<p>While prior work has shown item-specific replay outside the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and coarser replay within the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], the current results provide the first evidence for item-specific replay in the human hippocampus. This demonstration of item-specific replay is grounded in the observed correlations (computed across-items, within-subjects) between replay and memory performance.</p>

<title>Replay prioritizes weaker memories</title>
<p>Prior fMRI studies showing a positive relationship between replay and subsequent memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] fit with the idea that replay causes better memory. However, these results can also be explained in terms of stronger memories being replayed more (without there necessarily being a causal relationship between replay and subsequent memory). Our results from the second session fit with this latter story, but the results from the first session do not. Instead, the negative correlation between replay and preceding memory in the first session suggests the use of a prioritization algorithm that focuses on weaker memories. This is consistent with prior findings from this paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], where weaker items benefitted from a short period of sleep (whereas overnight sleep benefitted all items). Taken together, these findings suggest that the brain&#x2019;s first priority is to process weaker information. A recent study in rodents found that replay during rest was important for gradually-strengthened but not quickly-formed memories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], perhaps reflecting a similar process. Prioritization of weaker information is also consistent with the finding that encoding difficulty predicts the occurrence of more sleep spindles (which are associated with replay) during a subsequent nap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] and the general tendency for sleep to benefit information that is more weakly encoded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>One human fMRI study found that activity patterns in the hippocampus that were strongest during encoding (explaining the most variance in a Principal Component Analysis) persisted into rest and correlated with subsequent memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. This may seem to contrast with our study and others, but these strong patterns did not necessarily correspond to strongly-encoded items&#x2014;they could in principle relate to a monitoring process associated with weaker memories. Of course, memory strength is not the only dimension that can drive prioritized wake replay; other known dimensions include fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and reward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].</p>

<title>Replay is associated with better subsequent memory</title>
<p>In Session 2, items replayed more showed better subsequent memory. This result is consistent with accumulating findings from both the rodent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] and human literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] suggesting a functional role for hippocampal replay (i.e., improved consolidation), although&#x2014;for reasons discussed above&#x2014;this correlation unto itself is not evidence that replay causes better subsequent memory.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>The relationship of wake replay to processing during sleep</title>
<p>Wake replay in both sessions was associated with greater memory improvement for participants who slept than for those who remained awake between sessions. Thus while wake replay may have its own benefits, it may also lay the groundwork for subsequent sleep-dependent consolidation processes. One hypothesis suggested in other work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] is that processing during wake rest serves to &#x201C;tag&#x201D; memory traces for subsequent replay during sleep. Alternatively, it may be that some other factor occurring prior to rest (during initial encoding) drives prioritization during both wake and sleep replay, and that the larger effects observed in the Sleep group arise because those participants encountered less wake-based interference, or more replay overall during sleep. In either case, some process must occur prior to the rest period that constrains which representations are revisited later. The process cannot simply reflect encoding of an external error signal, since participants did not receive feedback during the test phase in our study. Instead some process sensitive to the strength of the representation generated during test must have provided the signal that subsequently led to increased wake replay.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Systems consolidation</title>
<p>Consistent with a prior study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], memory for the satellite objects, and in particular the features shared across members of a category, was better after a night of sleep than a day awake. These results may reflect an increased reliance on cortical areas as a result of systems consolidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], as cortical areas employ more overlapping representations than the hippocampus and should therefore facilitate memory for shared features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. One cortical region often implicated as a consolidation site is the mPFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], and our whole-brain univariate analysis found increased activation across sessions in that region for the Sleep but not the Wake group. We did not find any evidence that the hippocampus was less involved in this task from the first to second session in the Sleep group [cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], though any decreased reliance on the hippocampus may take more time.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that wake replay in the hippocampus does not simply reflect the strongest representations rising to the surface, but instead is adaptive, prioritizing memories that most need strengthening. The results provide the first evidence for hippocampal replay of individual memories in humans, and add to a growing literature suggesting that wake replay is associated with improved subsequent memory. The findings also point to a relationship between wake replay and the memory processing that occurs over a night of sleep, a promising dynamic to explore in future research.</p>
