<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Ribosomal proteins (RPs) play important roles in modulating the MDM2-p53 pathway. However, less is known about the upstream regulators of the RPs. Here we identify SPIN1 (Spindlin 1) as a novel binding partner of human RPL5/uL18 that is important for this pathway. SPIN1 ablation activates p53, suppresses cell growth, reduces clonogenic ability, and induces apoptosis of cancer cells by sequestering uL18 in the nucleolus, preventing it from interacting with MDM2, and thereby alleviating uL18-mediated inhibition of MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity towards p53. SPIN1 deficiency increases ribosome-free uL18 and uL5 (human RPL11), which are required for SPIN1 depletion-induced p53 activation. Analysis of cancer genomic databases suggests that SPIN1 is highly expressed in several human cancers, and its overexpression is positively correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Altogether, our findings reveal that the oncogenic property of SPIN1 is highly attributed to its negative regulation of uL18, leading to p53 inactivation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The well-documented tumor suppressor p53, referred as &#x201C;the guardian of the genome&#x201D;, is activated upon exposure to a myriad of cellular stresses. While loss of wild type p53 causes fatal damages to cells, it is not surprising that the TP53 gene is mutated in more than 50&#x0025; human cancers, and the functions of p53 are often impeded through various mechanisms in the remainder <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. One predominant negative regulator of p53 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, an oncoprotein that conceals the N-terminal transcriptional activation (TA) domain of p53 <sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and deactivates this protein by either abrogating its transcriptional activity, or inducing its nuclear export and ubiquitination <sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. A plethora of cellular stress could stabilize p53 by blocking the MDM2-p53 feedback loop <sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. For example, p19<sup>ARF</sup> inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and proteolysis by associating with MDM2 <sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Another pathway is so-called the ribosomal proteins (RPs)-MDM2-p53 pathway <sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Accumulating evidence has continuingly verified this pathway as an emerging mechanism for boosting p53 activation in response to ribosomal stress or nucleolar stress over the past decade <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Ribosomal stress is often triggered by aberrant ribosome biogenesis caused by nutrient deprivation, inhibition of rRNA synthesis or malfunction of ribosomal proteins or nucleolar proteins <sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Earlier studies showed that disruption of ribosomal biogenesis induces translocation of a series of ribosomal proteins, including uL18 (human RPL5), uL5 (human RPL11), uL14 (human RPL23), eS7 (human S7) and uS11 (human S14) <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and bind to MDM2, blocking its ability to ubiquitinate p53 and consequently stabilizing p53 to maintain cellular homeostasis <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Although there are a few proteins that have been identified to regulate this RPs-MDM2-p53 pathway, such as PICT-1 inhibition of uL5 24,25 and SRSF1 inhibition of uL18 <sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, it still remains to determine if there are more proteins that can regulate the RPs-MDM2-p53 pathway. In this present study, we identified SPIN1 as another uL18 regulator.</p>
<p>SPIN1, a new member of the SPIN/SSTY family, was originally identified as a highly expressed protein in ovarian cancer <sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. The oncogenic potential of SPIN1 was later supported by the observation that overexpression of SPIN1 increases transformation and tumor growth ability of NIH3T3 cells <sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Signaling pathways responsible for SPIN1 functions include PI3K/Akt, Wnt and RET that are highly relevant to tumorigenesis <sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. In addition, SPIN1 acts as a reader of histone H3K4me3 and stimulates the transcription of ribosomal RNA-encoding genes <sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, suggesting its role in rRNA synthesis.</p>
<p>In screening uL18-associated protein complexes using co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, we identified SPIN1 as one of the potential uL18 binding proteins. We confirmed the specific interaction of SPIN1 with uL18, but not with uL5 or uL14, and also found out that by binding to uL18, SPIN1 prevents the inhibition of MDM2 by uL18 and promotes MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Also, SPIN1 knockdown induced ribosomal stress by facilitating the release of ribosome-free uL18 or uL5, accompanying p53 activation. Furthermore, SPIN1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a predominant p53-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo, consequently suppressing tumor growth in a xenograft model. Therefore, these results for the first time demonstrate that SPIN1 can regulate the RP-MDM2-p53 pathway by directly interacting with uL18, and suggest SPIN1 as a potential molecule target in this pathway for developing anti-cancer therapy in the future.</p>

<title>SPIN1 interacts with uL18</title>
<p>Our and others&#x2019; studies previously demonstrated that uL18 can stabilize p53 by binding to MDM2 and inhibiting its E3 ligase activity toward p53 <sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. In order to identify potential upstream regulators that may modulate the uL18-MDM2-p53 circuit, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using HEK293 cells that stably expressed Flag-uL18 with the anti-Flag antibody, and the co-immunoprecipitated proteins were cut out for mass spectrometric (MS) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The MS results not only revealed several previously described p53 regulatory proteins, such as MYBBP1A, PRMT5 and SRSF1, as uL18 binding proteins (Table S1), but also identified SPIN1 as a novel uL18-binding protein candidate that was previously shown to play a role in tumorigenesis and rDNA transcription <sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Next, we confirmed the interaction between SPIN1 and uL18 by performing a series of reciprocal co-IP assays. As expected, ectopic SPIN1 was specifically pulled down by ectopic uL18 and vice versa in HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref>). Their interaction was also verified in HEK293 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Also, we validated the interaction between endogenous SPIN1 and uL18 in HEK293 cells using anti-SPIN1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Interestingly, only uL18, but not uL5, was co-immunoprecipitated with SPIN1. In line with this result, when comparing ectopic Flag-uL18 with Flag-uL5 and Flag-uL14, we found that only uL18, but not the other RPs, could pull down Myc-SPIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>), further bolstering the specific interaction between uL18 and SPIN1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SPIN1 specifically binds to uL18, but not uL5 or uL14, in cancer cells.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>SPIN1 knockdown inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of cancer cells by activating p53</title>
<p>Previous and recent studies showed that SPIN1 is a potential oncogene <sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, and uL18 can stabilize p53 by binding to MDM2 <sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. We therefore wondered if the interaction between SPIN1 and uL18 could confer any role to SPIN1 in regulation of the p53 pathway. First, we determined if depletion of SPIN1 might affect p53-dependent cellular outcomes. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of SPIN1 dramatically elevates p53 protein level in several wild type p53-containing cells, including U2OS, H460 and HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>), without affecting p53 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Consistently, protein and mRNA levels of p53 target genes, such as p21 and PUMA, were also increased in response to SPIN1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Moreover, the effects of SPIN1 siRNA on p53 activity were dose-dependent (Supplementary Fig. S2). Conversely, overexpression of SPIN1 in HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> decreased the protein levels of p53 and its targets, such as p21 and PUMA, and the mRNA levels of these target genes, without affecting p53 mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>).</p>

<p>(<bold>a</bold>) SPIN1 knockdown induces protein levels of p53 and its target genes.

<p>We next generated both HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> and HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> cell lines that express scramble shRNA or SPIN1 shRNA to evaluate biological outcomes of SPIN1 knockdown. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>, the expression of p53 and some of its target genes were markedly induced when SPIN1 was knocked down by its specific shRNA in HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup>cells, but not in HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup>cells. Using these cell lines for cell viability assays, we observed that SPIN1 ablation more dramatically represses the cell viability of HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> than that of HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>). In line with this observation, SPIN1 depletion also led to more predominant reduction of HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> colonies than that of HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> colonies, though both of the reductions were statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Furthermore, percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis caused by SPIN1 shRNAs was much higher in HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> cells than in HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> cells, as measured by sub-G1 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2H</xref>). Notably, these effects were proportional to the efficiency of SPIN1 knockdown by two different shRNAs, indicating that the observed effects are highly related to SPIN1 levels. Collectively, these data suggest that SPIN1 plays an oncogenic role by predominantly inactivating the p53 pathway, although SPIN1 may also possess a p53-independent role in cancer cell growth and survival.</p>

<title>SPIN1 promotes p53 degradation by enhancing MDM2-mediated ubiquitination</title>
<p>Since SPIN1 knockdown affected only the protein, but not the mRNA, levels of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>), we next sought to determine the underlying mechanism. We first performed a cycloheximide-chase experiment using HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>, knockdown of SPIN1 markedly prolonged p53&#x2019;s half-life from &#x223C;30 mins to &#x223C;60 mins, as compared to scramble siRNA. Inversely, ectopic SPIN1 greatly shortened p53&#x2019;s half-life, from &#x223C;40 mins to &#x223C;20 mins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). To further evaluate the effect of SPIN1 on MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, which is the main mechanism responsible for p53 turnover <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, we then performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay by transfecting HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> cells with plasmids indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. The results clearly showed that ectopic SPIN1 enhances MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, co-transfection of SPIN1 with MDM2 led to a stronger reduction of p53 protein levels, which was abrogated by proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Interestingly, the induction of p53 degradation by SPIN1 was MDM2-dependent, as overexpression of SPIN1 failed to repress ectopic p53 protein expression in p53 and MDM2 double knockout MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that SPIN1 reduces p53 stability by enhancing MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation.</p>

<title>SPIN1 prevents uL18 from MDM2 binding by sequestering it in the nucleolus</title>
<p>Besides its role as a component of ribosome, uL18 has some well-established extra-ribosomal functions, acting as a bridge in connecting p53 activation to cellular stress response machinery <sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Upon ribosomal stress, uL18 can translocate from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm of a cell, where it binds to MDM2 <sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, leading to stabilization of p53 and consequently p53-dependent cell growth arrest, apoptosis or senescence. We then investigated if SPIN1 might regulate this function of uL18, since SPIN1 could bind to uL18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), knockdown of SPIN1 led to p53 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), and SPIN1 inhibited MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). First, as expected <sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, overexpression of uL18 induced the protein levels of p53 and its targets, such as p21 and MDM2, in wild type p53-containing U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This induction of the p53 pathway by uL18 was markedly reduced by co-transfected SPIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Since the effect of uL18 on p53 is through uL18&#x2019;s interaction with MDM2 and consequent inhibition of its E3 ligase activity towards p53<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, we tested if SPIN1 may affect uL18-MDM2 interaction. Interestingly, our co-immunoprecipitation result showed that ectopic Myc-SPIN1 dramatically reduces the amount of Flag-uL18 co-immunoprecipitated with HA-MDM2 in a dose-dependent manner, although Myc-SPIN1 itself did not co-immunoprecipitate with HA-MDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref> and S3A). This effect was specific to the uL18-MDM2 interaction, as Myc-SPIN1 overexpression did not alter the interactions between uL5 and MDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Our immunofluorescence result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref> and S3B) showed that SPIN1 and uL18 are clearly co-localized in the nucleolus, suggesting that SPIN1 might sequester uL18 in the nucleolus and thus prevent it from binding and inactivating MDM2 in the nucleoplasm. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SPIN1 is a regulator of the uL18-MDM2-p53 pathway, acting by preventing uL18 from interaction with MDM2.</p>

<title>SPIN1 depletion also causes ribosomal stress, activating p53</title>
<p>Previous studies showed that SPIN1 could recognize H3K4 methylation and stimulate rRNA gene expression, unveiling its role in rRNA synthesis <sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Disruption of rRNA synthesis leads to disassembly of ribosomal precursors and release of ribosome-free ribosomal proteins from the nucleolus <sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Based on these lines of information, we speculated that dysregulation of SPIN1 itself might also impact ribosome biogenesis, resulting in accumulating ribosome-free ribosomal proteins to activate p53. To test this speculation, we first carried out a sucrose gradient fractionation assay using scramble-and SPIN1-shRNA transfected HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> cells. The collected fractions were subjected to Western blot (WB) analysis. As anticipated, the levels of uL18 and uL5 in the soluble and ribosome-unbound fractions were markedly increased in SPIN1-depletion cells, accompanying with elevated p53 and MDM2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Interestingly, the binding between endogenous uL18/uL5 and MDM2 increased upon SPIN1 knockdown, resembling ribosomal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Indeed, as expected, knockdown of SPIN1 reduced the expression of pre-rRNA and rRNA (Supplementary Fig. S4). Moreover, as clearly illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, overexpression of SPIN1 compromised p53 activation induced by actinomycin D or 5-Fu treatment, which was reported to trigger ribosomal stress that in turn triggers the formation of RPs-MDM2 complex <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. To further confirm the role of these free forms of ribosomal proteins in SPIN1 ablation-induced p53 activation, we knocked down uL18 or uL5 using siRNA with or without SPIN1 depletion in U2OS cells. Strikingly, the reduction of either uL18 or uL5 abrogated SPIN1 knockdown-induced p53 levels, as well as its target p21, as compared to scramble siRNA-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that knockdown of SPIN1 could also lead to ribosomal stress, releasing ribosome-free uL18 and uL5, which are required for p53 activation induced by SPIN1 depletion.</p>

<title>Mapping of uL18- and SPIN1-binding domains</title>
<p>To understand the physical interaction between SPIN1 and uL18 in more details, we generated recombinant GST-SPIN1 and His-uL18 proteins covering full-length or different domains. Our GST-pull down assay showed direct interactions between these two full-length proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). Additionally, the second Tudor domain of SPIN1 was required for uL18 binding, as His-uL18 was specifically pulled down by the fragments containing the second Tudor domain (amino acid 121-193) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). Moreover, both the N- and C-termini of uL18 were found to bind to SPIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>), and these two fragments were required for uL18-MDM2 binding as well (Supplementary Fig. S5). Based on these data and the aforementioned results, we proposed a model for the role of SPIN1 in regulation of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Under the condition of low SPIN1 level, nucleolar uL18 escapes from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm, and works together with uL5 to bind MDM2 and to inhibit its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity towards p53, consequently leading to p53 activation and p53-dependent cell growth arrest and apoptosis, suppressing cancer cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>, left panel). But when SPIN1 levels are high or abnormally upregulated in cancer cells, SPIN1 retains uL18 in the nucleolus, thereby preventing uL18 from suppression of MDM2 activity and resulting in p53 degradation, favoring tumor cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>, right panel). This conjecture is further supported by the following xenograft experiment.</p>

<title>SPIN1 depletion impedes xenograft tumor growth</title>
<p>To translate the above-described cellular functions of SPIN1 into more biological significance, we established a xenograft tumor model by inoculating the aforementioned HCT116 (both p53&#x002B;/&#x002B; and p53-/-) cell lines that expressed scramble shRNA or SPIN1 shRNA into NOD/SCID mice, and monitored tumor size for 18 days. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>, SPIN1 knockdown more markedly slowed down the growth of xenograft tumors derived from HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> cells than that from HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> cells. Notably, SPIN1 depletion also reduced the growth of tumors derived from HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> cells, suggesting that SPIN1 might possess a p53-independent function required for cancer cell growth. In line with the tumor growth curve, the reduction of tumor mass and weight by SPIN1 knockdown was more profound in HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> groups (&#x223C;60&#x0025; reduction in weight) than that in HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> groups (&#x223C;30&#x0025; reduction in weight) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D</xref>).

<p>The data presented above suggest that SPIN1 is required for tumorigenesis. Therefore, we further searched some available genomic and gene expression database for SPIN1 expression in cancers. Interestingly, our analysis of TCGA genome database <sup><xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> indicated that the SPIN1 gene is markedly amplified in a panel of cancers, including prostate, sarcoma, lung, stomach, breast, head and neck, pancreas and colorectal cancers (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Consistent with this observation, the analysis of Oncomine database <sup><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> also showed that SPIN1 mRNA expression is extensively upregulated in melanoma tissues when compared with normal skin tissues (&#x223C;2.367 folds upregulation, Supplementary Fig. S7B).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The tumor suppressor p53 provides a critical brake on cancer development in response to ribosomal stress, as impairing this ribosomal stress-uL18/uL5-p53 pathway could accelerate tumorigenesis in c-Myc transgenic lymphoma mice <sup><xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. However, it remains largely elusive whether this pathway is subjected to the regulation by other yet unknown proteins. In our attempt to understand molecular insights into this possible regulation, we identified SPIN1, the nucleolar protein important for rRNA synthesis <sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, as a novel regulator of the uL18-MDM2-p53 pathway through interplay with uL18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Our studies as presented here provide the first line of evidence for that SPIN1 acts as an upstream regulator of uL18&#x2019;s accessibility to MDM2 for p53 activation.</p>
<p>Using IP-MS analysis, we identified SPIN1 as a new uL18-associated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Our biochemical and cellular experiments using co-IP and GST pull down assays further validated the direct association of SPIN1 with uL18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>). Moreover, we found that SPIN1 and uL18 co-localized in the nucleolus by immunofluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref> and S3B). Remarkably, SPIN1 specifically binds to uL18, but not uL5 and uL14, as no binding was detected between ectopic SPIN1 and uL5 or uL14 by co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Interestingly, SPIN1 does not appear to bind to MDM2, as it was not co-immunoprecipitated with MDM2 either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Although our previous reports described a complex of uL18/uL5/uL14-MDM2 <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, our present findings indicate that SPIN1 may work in a separate complex with uL18 differed from reported RPs-MDM2 complexes. Also our results suggest that SPIN1 may retain uL18 in the nucleolus so that the latter is unable to shuttle to the nucleoplasm and to inhibit MDM2 activity towards p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>SPIN1 expression in cells is tightly controlled, as several studies have shown that SPIN1 expression could be negatively monitored by some tumor suppressive non-coding RNAs, such as miR-489 and miR-219-5p <sup><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Moreover, elevated expression of SPIN1 was strongly correlated with advanced histological stage, chemoresistance and metastasis in patients with breast cancer <sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Consistent with the aforementioned oncogenic role of SPIN1, our study as presented here showed that SPIN1 depletion by its specific shRNA leads to the augment of the p53-dependent cancer cell growth arrest and apoptosis. This is at least partly because SPIN1 can promote MDM2-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), which is highly likely attributable to its capability to prevent uL18 from binding to MDM2 through retaining uL18 in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Also, knockdown of SPIN1 led to the increase of ribosome-free uL18 and uL5 levels, of the uL18/uL5-MDM2 complex, and of p53 level and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). The activation of p53 by knocking down SPIN1 is due to the ribosomal stress caused by the depletion of this nucleolar protein, as SPIN1 is required for rRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I <sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Also, consistent with these observations, overexpression of SPIN1 reduced the activation of p53 by Actinomycin D treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>), whereas knockdown of uL18 or of uL5 impaired the activation of p53 by SPIN1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Several genes have been implicated to modulate the RPs-MDM2-p53 pathway through interplay with ribosomal proteins <sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>-<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. In particular, SRSF1 was identified as a component of the RP-MDM2-p53 complex, and could stabilize p53 via uL18 <sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Different from their studies, SPIN1 specifically forms an independent complex with uL18, but not MDM2 or other ribosomal proteins, such as uL5 or uL14, and acts as a negative regulator of p53. Therefore, our present findings unveil a novel mechanism for suppression of the uL18-MDM2-p53 pathway by SPIN1, whose depletion consequently leads to p53-dependent cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.</p>
<p>Consistent with its oncogenic activity, SPIN1 is often amplified in a panel of cancer types with less or no p53 mutation based on our analysis of human samples available in TCGA database (Supplementary Fig. S7A-S7B). In addition, elevated SPIN1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in breast, colorectal and gastric cancer patients (Supplementary Fig. S7C-S7F), further indicating that SPIN1 acts as a potential oncogene. In line with these database observations, we found that overexpression of SPIN1 promotes cancer cell survival, while knockdown of SPIN1 leads to cancer cell death as well as the suppression of cancer cell growth and colony formation predominantly in wild type p53-containing cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Remarkably, knockdown of SPIN1 inhibited xenograft tumorigenesis derived from human colon cancer cells, which was much more significantly in HCT116<sup>p53&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> cells than in HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). These results demonstrate that SPIN1 can promote tumor growth and survival by inactivating p53 and its pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, we also found that SPIN1 ablation had a moderate inhibitory effect on cell growth in p53-null HCT116 cells in vitro and in vivo as mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). These findings suggest that SPIN1 might also possess p53-independent oncogenic effects, which might be explained by two possible mechanisms. First, SPIN1 has been reported to execute its oncogenic potentials by activating Wnt and PI3K/Akt pathways <sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, both of which are closely correlated with cancer progression <sup><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. Second, since our previous study has demonstrated that uL18 and uL5 could inactivate TAp73 through association with MDM2 <sup><xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>, it is possible that the SPIN1-uL18 interaction might impose suppression on TAp73 activity as well, ultimately leading to cell growth arrest and apoptosis.</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated the role of SPIN1 in rRNA transcription <sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, which provides a clue that dysregulation of SPIN1 may perturb ribosome biogenesis. In fact, in our current study, we observed that SPIN1 deletion per se increases the levels of ribosome-free uL18 and uL5, accompanying elevated p53 protein levels, which recapitulates the effects of ribosomal stress. Our observation that p53 induction caused by SPIN1 depletion could be abrogated by knockdown of either uL18 or uL5 further supports this hypothesis. Therefore, while it is conceivable that SPIN1 counteracts p53 by blocking the interaction between uL18 and MDM2 as discussed above, the mechanism by which disruption of SPIN1 causes ribosomal stress may be also responsible for p53 activation.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings unveil SPIN1 as another novel and important regulator of the MDM2-p53 pathway by predominantly inhibiting the association of uL18 with MDM2 to modulate p53 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>) and provide molecular insights into the fine regulation of this pathway as well as a potential target for the future development of an anti-cancer therapy.</p>
