<abstract><title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Myostatin, a key regulator of muscle mass in vertebrates, is biosynthesised as a latent precursor in muscle and is activated by sequential proteolysis of the pro-domain. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which pro-myostatin remains latent, we have solved the structure of unprocessed pro-myostatin and analysed the properties of the protein in its different forms. Crystal structures and SAXS analyses show that pro-myostatin adopts an open, V-shaped structure with a domain-swapped arrangement. The pro-mature complex, after cleavage of the furin site, has significantly reduced activity compared with mature growth factor and persists as a stable complex that is resistant to the natural antagonist follistatin. The latency appears to be conferred by a number of distinct features that collectively stabilise the interaction of the pro-domains with the mature growth factor, enabling a regulated step-wise activation process, distinct from the prototypical pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1. These results provide a basis for understanding the effect of missense mutations in pro-myostatin and pave the way for the design of novel myostatin inhibitors.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The pathological outcomes which arise as a result of aberrant cellular signalling, including cancer, highlight the importance of spatial and temporal signal control in biology. One of the ways that signalling protein activity can be controlled is by the expression of these molecules as inactive, or latent forms, with activation occurring only where and when a timely response is required. Controlled proteolysis is a common mechanism of activation for the pro-forms of bioactive molecules and is well characterised in many biological systems, from the proteases of the digestive system, to secreted growth factors. Controlled post-translational activation allows the proteins to be expressed and stored in a precursor form and then rapidly activated in response to external stimuli.</p>
<p>Myostatin, (also called growth and differentiation factor 8; GDF-8), of the transforming growth factor &#x03B2; (TGF-&#x03B2;<italic>)</italic> superfamily of signalling proteins is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. Dysfunctional myostatin signalling liberates muscle growth and yields the characteristic hyper-muscular phenotypes seen in myostatin-null animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Unsurprisingly, manipulation of myostatin signalling has become an attractive prospect for increasing functional muscle mass in the context of muscular atrophic disorders including muscular dystrophy, sarcopenia and cancer-associated cachexia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Myostatin itself is a relatively well characterised member of the TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily, and like other members, is synthesised as an inactive precursor (pro-myostatin), with N-terminal signal peptide and pro-domain, and C-terminal growth factor (GF) domain. The precursor forms a covalently linked dimer through a conserved disulfide in the GF domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Cleavage of pro-domains by furin-like pro-protein convertases, either during secretion or extracellularly, yields a non-covalent complex of the dimeric mature GF with its associated pro-domains (pro-myostatin complex)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The non-covalent association of pro-domains is typically thought to retain myostatin in a latent state by occluding receptor epitopes and rendering it unable to engage its receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast to pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 which undergoes integrin-driven mechanical activation, a secondary proteolytic cleavage within the pro-domain by bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1)/tolloid (TLD) metalloproteases liberates the full signalling capacity of mature myostatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The liberated, mature myostatin will form aa heterotetrameric complex with two activin responsive type II receptors (ActIIRA or ActIIRB) and two of either activin type I (ALK4) or TGF-&#x03B2; type I (ALK5) receptors to initiate signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Assembly of a competent receptor complex results in SMAD 2/3 phosphorylation by the type I receptors and translocation of SMADs to the nucleus for modulation of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>At present, three structures of pro-TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily members are available; pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1, pro-activin A and pro-BMP-9, all of which display unique arrangements of pro and mature GF domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. As mentioned above, in some cases the pro-domain confers latency to the pro-form, as is known to be the case for pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 and pro-myostatin. Conversely, pro-activin A and pro-BMP-9 complexes show equivalent signalling activity to their free mature GFs, suggesting a weak, non-inhibitory association of pro-domains. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> TGF-&#x03B2;1, which forms a latent complex with its furin-cleaved pro-domains, utilises an inter-molecular disulfide bond to cross-link pro-domains and enclose the dimeric GF in an inhibitory stranglehold, requiring mechanical or proteolytic activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Pro-myostatin lacks the cysteines needed for this this latency conferring covalent linkage, and as such the structural basis for its latency remains unclear.</p>
<p>Myostatin is known to be secreted as both the unprocessed precursor and the furin cleaved complex, with the former thought to constitute the major pool of myostatin in the extracellular space of skeletal muscle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Within the extracellular environment of muscle, latent pro-myostatin is localised to the extracellular matrix (ECM), through pro-domain mediated interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and latent TGF-&#x03B2; binding proteins (LTBPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In the extracellular space, soluble antagonists of the mature GF, including follistatin, FSTL3, GASP1, GASP2 and decorin, contribute an additional layer of control, within an already complex regulatory environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Targeted inhibition of myostatin signalling to enhance muscle growth continues to present a considerable clinical challenge. A number of myostatin binding antibodies, designed to suppress myostatin signalling in the context of muscular atrophic disorders, have failed to meet primary clinical endpoints in phase II trials (bimagrumab, Novartis; PINTA 745, Atara)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Similarly, an ActRIIB receptor-Fc fusion (ACE-031, Acceleron) was withdrawn from phase II trials due to safety concerns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. To date, no myostatin inhibitors are approved for clinical use. It seems probable that attempts to block mature myostatin signalling are hampered by the cross-reactivity of soluble antagonists with structurally related TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily growth factors. This is particularly likely for soluble receptor-Fc fusions, which exhibit a natural promiscuity for TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily ligands.</p>
<p>The difficulties associated with targeting the mature, active growth factor, make the more structurally diverse pro-forms of these proteins potentially more meaningful targets for intervention. Aside from lower conservation in sequence and structure, the pro-forms show increased abundance and longevity over the mature growth factors which are difficult to target due to the short temporal and spatial window within which they exert their paracrine signal. Stabilisation of a latent conformation of the pro-myostatin complex and/or inhibition of proteolytic processing of the precursor could offer alternate routes to selective neutralisation of myostatin signalling. Understanding the mechanism by which the pro-domains render the growth factor inactive will be essential for these efforts.</p>
<p>Here we present crystal structures of unprocessed human pro-myostatin, the major extracellular storage form in skeletal muscle tissue and an attractive target for intervention in muscle wasting conditions. This structure reveals a unique arrangement of GF and pro-domains to confer latency within the TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily. An unexpected &#x2018;open-armed&#x2019; conformation, with no direct interaction between the pro-domains of the domain-swapped dimer, makes pro-myostatin structurally distinct from latent pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1. This structure allows us to understand the determinants of latency and reveals features that enable controlled activation of myostatin. It provides us also with a rational basis for the development of the next generation of myostatin inhibitors.</p>

<p>Unprocessed human pro-myostatin was expressed as inclusion bodies in <italic>E. coli</italic> and subsequently solubilised, refolded and purified. As expected, the protein migrated on non-reduced SDS-PAGE as a disulfide-linked dimer and analysis by size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) confirms the dimeric state under native conditions, with molecular weight of 84.5 &#x00B1; 0.005 kDa (cf. calculated from the sequence 85.4 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>For functional analysis, an engineered variant of bacterially expressed pro-myostatin was generated in which the native furin cleavage site was replaced by a HRV-3C protease site, to allow us to study the effects of proteolytic processing of the precursor <italic>in vitro</italic>. The HRV-3C cleaved pro-myostatin was shown, by SEC-MALS, to form a stable non-covalent complex with a molecular mass of 83.4 &#x00B1; 0.008 kDa, consistent with the expected mass for a complex of a mature GF dimer with two associated pro-domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). Pro-domain cleavage appears to proceed via a semi-cleaved intermediate, a small proportion of which persists in the final preparation, even after incubation with a molar excess of protease. The mature GF dimer could be purified from the complex by reverse phase chromatography, and was shown to activate SMAD2/3 signalling in HEK293T cells with high potency (EC50: 0.1 nM, 95&#x0025; C.I [0.09, 0.12]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). While uncleaved pro-myostatin was entirely inactive at the highest concentrations of protein tested, the HRV-3C cleaved complex shows low-level signalling activity, approximately 100-fold less potent than the purified mature GF (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>)</bold>. Bioactivity of the pro-myostatin complex, traditionally thought to circulate as an entirely latent complex in serum, has been observed previously by Szlama <italic>et al</italic>, who interpret the unexpected activity as the result of partial dissociation of the pro-domains under assay conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This is in clear contrast to both pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 and pro-activin A complexes. Latent pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 shows no activity under similar assay conditions, whereas the pro-activin A pro-domain exerts only a marginal inhibitory effect at the picomolar concentrations where the mature growth factor has been shown to be active. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>To evaluate whether cleavage at the furin-site causes significant conformational change of the protein, we analysed both uncleaved and cleaved pro-myostatin using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The scattering profiles were very similar in both cases and the estimated radii of gyration (R<sub>g,uncleaved</sub>=40.0 &#x00C5;, R<sub>g,cleaved</sub>=38.9 &#x00C5;) and maximum particle dimensions (D<sub>max,uncleaved</sub>=140.6 &#x00C5;, D<sub>max,cleaved</sub>=146.6 &#x00C5;) of the proteins are very similar (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1D</xref>, S1</bold>). This suggests that no drastic re-organisation of the protein is triggered by the proteolysis of the furin site, consistent with the significant latency of this complex in bioassays.</p>
<p>To study the stability of the cleaved pro-myostatin complex, we used biolayer interferometry (BLI) to monitor the dissociation of the mature GF from the pro-domain, which was immobilised on biosensor tips through the N-terminal His-tag. We observe slow dissociation of the GF, consistent with the low level of activity seen in cellular assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>). Interestingly, this dissociation cannot be facilitated by follistatin 288 (FST-288). This is in stark contrast to the pro-activin A complex, which readily dissociates in the presence of FST-288 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1F</bold></xref>). On the other hand, same experiment using uncleaved pro-myostatin shows no significant difference in the presence or absence of FST-288, while uncleaved pro-activin A actually shows an increase in response when exposed to FST-288, suggesting an interaction with growth factor part of activin A, even before proteolytic cleavage releases the mature domain from its pro-domain (<bold>Figure S2</bold>). These results suggest that the complex is highly stable, more so than pro-activin A and that regulation of myostatin by follistatin can only take place after the pro-domain has dissociated from the mature GF.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b"><title>Structure determination</title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular details of latent pro-myostatin, we crystallised the uncleaved precursor form of human pro-myostatin, with its native furin site intact. This protein crystallised readily in a number of conditions, yielding cubic crystals. These were used to determine the structure at a resolution of 4.2 &#x00C5;, using experimentally determined phases from selenomethione-labelled protein (<bold>Figure S3</bold>). Merging data from multiple crystals (<bold>Table S1</bold>) significantly improved the quality of the electron density for this structure, so that we could trace most of the backbone and observe large side chains. However, we were unable to unambiguously assign the sequence of the pro-domain using this low resolution data.</p>
<p>Using a surface entropy reduction approach, we identified a mutant form of pro-myostatin that crystallised in a new crystal form and diffracted to higher resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. One symmetrical half of the low-resolution dimer was used as the search model for molecular replacement of a higher resolution dataset, and the structure was solved again, this time at 2.6 &#x00C5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). We were able to build 92&#x0025; and 81&#x0025; of residues of the two protomers into the electron density. The remaining regions are disordered, with 27 and 62 residues missing from chains A and B respectively. In both crystal forms, the asymmetric unit contains a single dimeric molecule. The quality of electron density differs markedly between different parts of the two chains (<bold>Figure S4</bold>), and as such, our interpretations are based on the analysis of both chains of the higher resolution structure.</p>

<sec id="s2c"><title>The structure of human pro-myostatin</title>
<p>Like related pro-TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily members, pro-myostatin is a disulfide-linked homodimer, each chain of which contains an N-terminal pro-domain and C-terminal mature GF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). The GF domains consist of four antiparallel &#x03B2;-strands or &#x2018;fingers&#x2019; and a cystine-knot motif, characteristic of TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily members. Two identical GF protomers associate through their concave &#x2018;palms&#x2032;, and are linked covalently through a disulfide bond between equivalent Cys339 residues in the GF &#x2018;wrist&#x2019; region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). The pro-domain retains the familiar structural elements of other pro-TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily members, including N-terminal &#x2018;forearm&#x2019; helices which grasp the mature GF, and a globular &#x2018;shoulder&#x2019; domain, which sits atop the mature GF protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Given the latency of the pro-myostatin complex, it was expected that the pro-domains would adopt a closed conformation like that of pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1, albeit without the cross-linking disulfide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Instead, pro-myostatin adopts a V-shaped, &#x201C;open arm&#x201D; conformation with no interactions between the shoulder domains, similar to that observed for non-latent pro-BMP-9 and pro-activin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>The individual chains of both our low and high resolution structures overlay well (C&#x03B1; RMSD: 0.68 &#x00C5;, 227 atoms, using non-covalently associated pro- and mature domains as a single entity). However, there is a considerable shift in the inter-protomer angle between the two structures, measured from the dimerization disulfide to the tips (Gln358) of the mature domain fingers, with the low resolution model adopting a more closed conformation (89.2&#x00B0; vs. 108.5&#x00B0;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). This suggests the pro-form has significant conformational flexibility about the dimer interface. To explore this, we used SAXS data to calculate a molecular envelope for uncleaved pro-myostatin. The resulting envelope shows an extended structure, consistent with what we see in the crystal structures, but is less well defined and multiple inter-protomer conformations, rotating about the dimerisation disulfide, could be accommodated within the envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The individual mature GF protomers also overlay well with the structure of myostatin bound to follistatin 288 (PDB: 3HH2, RMSD: 0.63&#x00C5;, 65 atoms), but exhibit a shift in inter-protomer angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This observation is consistent with that of Walker <italic>et al</italic>, who recently showed that the mature myostatin GF dimer crystallises with radically different inter-protomer angles in apo and FST-288 bound states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Conformational plasticity is similarly well documented for activin A, which has inter-protomer angles ranging from 50&#x00B0; in complex with type II receptor ecto-domain (PDB: 1NYS), to 108&#x00B0; when bound to FST-315 (PDB: 2P6A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In both of our structures, the GF domain &#x2018;wrist&#x2019; helix and pre-helix region, which forms a significant interface with the opposing protomer, and establishes the presumed binding site for the type I receptor, is displaced in the presence of the pro-domain. Instead, this sequence forms a &#x03B2;&#x2013;hairpin visible within the crystal contact of one chain and binds on the exposed face of the pro-domain &#x03B1;1 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). The GF wrist helix and pre-helix region are thought to constitute an important component of the putative type I receptor epitope and while there is currently no structure of a myostatin-receptor complex, the ALK5 binding mode can be inferred from the ALK5:TGF-&#x03B2;3 structure (2PJY)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Displacement of the wrist helix by the pro-domain would render myostatin unable to engage the type I receptor while bound to its pro-domain. In contrast to this, the N-terminal domain (ND) of FST-288 occupies the type I receptor site without displacing the wrist helix, and this site is known to accommodate a number of different ligands by utilising this &#x2018;non-invasive&#x2019; binding mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 the wrist helix is also displaced, and in pro-activin A density for the helix is missing altogether, suggesting similar displacement from the core of the GF domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In the pro-BMP-9 structure, the wrist helix remains in place, with the &#x03B1;5 helix from the prodomain occupying a similar position to the helix of the FST-288 ND domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s2d"><title>Pro-myostatin forms a domain-swapped, open armed dimer</title>
<p>Similar to previously determined structures of TGF-&#x03B2; family pro-domains, the myostatin pro-domain consists of an N-terminal &#x03B1;1 helix/loop/&#x03B1;2 helix &#x2018;forearm&#x2019; motif, and a C-terminal globular &#x2018;shoulder&#x2019; domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The pro-myostatin forearm is structurally similar to that of pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 and pro-activin A, with the exception of a five residue insert, which forms a short &#x03B1;-helix (lasso helix) in the latency lasso linking &#x03B1;1 and &#x03B1;2 helices. The &#x03B1;1 helix of the myostatin pro-domain occupies the major hydrophobic groove of one GF protomer, and is followed by the latency lasso which wraps between the &#x2018;fingertips&#x2019; of the GF domain, providing an interface between pro and GF domains. The downstream &#x03B1;2 helix extends across the convex surface of one GF protomer, and occludes the type II receptor binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Electron density for the sequence linking the pro-domain forearm to the shoulder, and housing the BMP1/TLD cleavage site (Arg98/Asp99), is missing in both protomers. Based on the distances between resolved residues and the directionality of electron density, it is apparent that the connectivity from the pro-domain forearm to the shoulder is such that the forearm interacts with the GF domain from the same chain, but with the shoulder from the opposite chain, giving rise to a domain-swapped arrangement, as is the case for pro-activin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The distance from the last resolved residue of the forearm (Asp95) to the first visible residue of the shoulder (Glu107) is 22.7&#x00C5; in our proposed domain-swapped arrangement (<bold>Figure S5</bold>). In the alternative connectivity, the missing 11 residues must span 35.2&#x00C5;, which would require a near linear trajectory between endpoints. Such a constrained structural feature is unlikely given the lack of density in this region. With the domain-swapped topology, the extent to which the V-shaped dimer can open up will be limited by the linker sequence between &#x03B1;2-helix and the shoulder domain binding to the opposite mature domain. Our high resolution structure is missing 11 and 12 residues from this linker in the two protomers and the last visible residues are 23 and 24 &#x00C5; apart, respectively, suggesting that a more open conformation could be still be accommodated (<bold>Figure S5</bold>).</p>
<p>Similarly, density for the furin cleavage site and sequence linking the pro-domain to the GF domain is weak and missing in places, however we were able to trace the entire main-chain in one of the two protomers. The density supports an additional domain-swapped conformation in which the pro-domain shoulder of one chain interacts with the GF domain of the other (<bold>Figure S5</bold>). It is noteworthy that the furin site is visible in the structure as it suggests a more constrained substrate than pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 and pro-Activin A, which both lack density for the furin site. In the uncleaved pro-activin A structure the furin site is not visible in the electron density, lacking ten residues with 16 &#x00C5; between the last visible residues. In pro-myostatin, 12 residues span a direct distance of 34 &#x00C5; resulting in a less flexible and therefore less accessible furin site (<bold>Figure S5</bold>).</p>
<p>Given the unusual open-armed conformation and lack of interaction between pro-domain shoulders, the question arises as to what drives the increased latency of the pro-myostatin complex over non-latent superfamily members.</p>

<sec id="s2e"><title>Latency conferring interactions of the pro-domain forearm</title>
<p>One of the key latency determining regions of the TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily pro-domains is the N-terminal helix-loop-helix forearm motif, with residues 42-115 originally identified as the inhibitory fragment of pro-myostatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This range incorporates the entire forearm region, extending from the N-terminus of the &#x03B1;1 helix to the start of the shoulder domain, and many of these latency conferring interactions are conserved between pro-myostatin and pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In our structures, the &#x03B1;1 helix is clearly helical in nature from Arg45 to Leu64. As anticipated, the pro-domain &#x03B1;1 helix interaction with the GF domain is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, and of the seven aliphatic residues within this helical sequence, six are buried within the hydrophobic groove of the GF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). These aliphatic residues are conserved in pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 (with exception of Ile58), and are known to contribute towards its latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4F</bold></xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Takayama <italic>et al</italic> have synthesised a range of myostatin inhibitory peptides based on the mouse pro-domain &#x03B1;1 helix sequence, the best of which (Trp44-Leu64) binds to mature myostatin with a KD of 29 nM and has been shown to increase muscle mass in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The authors have recently shown by alanine scanning that the aforementioned hydrophobic residues are critical to the inhibitory function of these peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the affinities of these &#x03B1;1 helix-derived peptides are not high enough to fully explain the latency, in line with the fact that many of the residues in this helix are conserved in non-latent pro-activin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4F</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to hydrophobic contributions, a number of electrostatic interactions stabilise the &#x03B1;1 helix: GF interface. Arg45 forms hydrogen bonds with backbone carbonyls of Glu274 and Ser276 located on the N-terminal extension of the GF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>), however truncation of the arginine sidechain was reported to have little effect on the inhibitory function of &#x03B1;1 helix derived peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Lys49 forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Glu274 while Arg52 forms multiple hydrogen bonds to backbone carbonyls of Ala306, Asn307 and Met367 from the GF fingers. Lys63, near the C-terminus of the &#x03B1;1 helix hydrogen H-bonds to the main-chain carbonyl of Pro365.</p>
<p>Cationic residues within the &#x03B1;1 helix of pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 are reported to mediate non-covalent interaction with ECM bound LTBP-1, promoting subsequent covalent linkage through Cys33<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Given the conservation of these residues in pro-myostatin, and the prior observation that pro-myostatin interacts non-covalently with LTBP-3 (the primary LTBP expressed in skeletal muscle), it is possible that these interactions are conserved <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. From a structural perspective, these charged residues may maintain the complex in such a conformation competent for LTBP association (Arg52 and Lys63 are buried in the &#x03B1;1:GF interface), or form part of the LTBP-3 docking site (Lys57 is exposed to solvent and thus a potential LTBP-3 binding candidate).</p>
<p>The latency lasso extending from the C-terminus of the &#x03B1;1 helix wraps around the mature domain fingertips. A five amino-acid insertion in the latency lasso, unique to pro-myostatin and pro-GDF11, creates a short &#x2018;lasso helix&#x2019; not observed in other pro-TGF-&#x03B2; family structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). The downstream &#x03B1;2 helix lies against the convex face of the GF, occluding the putative type II receptor site. Tyr94 of the &#x03B1;2 helix forms a hydrogen bond to the Asn349 backbone carbonyl, an interaction also observed in pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>). The forearm: GF interface is dominated by aliphatic residues, and the shielding of these hydrophobic surfaces by the pro-domain is consistent with the vastly increased solubility of the pro-forms over the mature ligands, which are notoriously prone to aggregation under physiological-like buffer conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f"><title>The pro-domain shoulder forms an extensive stabilising interface</title>
<p>The globular shoulder domain of pro-myostatin is structurally conserved with other pro-TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily structures and consists of two anti-parallel &#x03B2;-sheets and a short &#x03B1;-helix. Unlike pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1, the pro-myostatin shoulder domain lacks the &#x03B2;8/9 hairpin extension which facilitates covalent dimerization of the pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 pro-domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the distinguishing features of pro-myostatin is the substantial interface that the shoulder domain shares with the GF/forearm. The shoulder adopts a markedly different conformation to that of pro-activin A and pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1. Given the lack of a covalent constraint (as in pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1), the pro-myostatin shoulder is rotated almost &#x2018;parallel&#x2019; to the mature domain, and shares a considerably larger interface with the GF and forearm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>). This is accompanied by extended hydrogen bonding at the antiparallel &#x03B2;-sheet interface between GF and shoulder, with eight hydrogen bonds compared to five in pro-Activin A, four in pro-BMP-9, and only two for pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>). In the case of pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1, the reduced &#x03B2;-sheet interface is the result of considerable twisting between mature and shoulder domains to accommodate its &#x2018;closed&#x2019; conformation.</p>
<fig id="fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Shoulder interactions A. Surface representation of mature GF protomer (orange) and pro-domain forearm (red, blue or green) showing the pro-domain shoulder interaction surface area (white, calculated using PyMOL). B. Extended hydrogen bonding (dashed lines) between the pro-domain shoulder (red) and mature domain (orange) with stick models of the two strands overlaid on cartoon representation of the same structure. C. The forearm (red) interaction with the mature GF (orange) is stabilised by interaction of the &#x03B1;1 helix with shoulder (grey) at the fastener, and by lasso interaction with loop &#x03B2;6/&#x03B2;7 of the shoulder. This binding mode completely encircles the GF finger, and occludes both putative receptor sites. For simplicity, only a single protomer is shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="153403_fig5.tif"/></fig>
<p>The pro-myostatin shoulder straddles the GF, and interacts with the forearm on both convex and concave sides of the GF, effectively sandwiching it between (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>). The &#x03B2;6/&#x03B2;7 loop of the shoulder domain latches over the latency lasso, completing the circle of pro-domain elements which enclose the second finger of the GF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>). This extensive interaction may function to both mask surface hydrophobicity, and stabilise the furin cleaved complex, preventing spontaneous activation by dissociation. Furthermore, there is a well resolved stacking interaction between Arg65 at the tip of the &#x03B1;1 helix, with His 112 and Tyr1 1 1 of the linker containing the BMP-1/TLD cleavage site, which appears to hold this cluster of charged features close to the &#x03B1;1 helix, further stabilising the shoulder/latency lasso interface (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref></bold>). These residues are equivalent to the &#x2018;fastener&#x2019; residues described for pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1, non-conserved mutation of which was shown to liberate TGF-&#x03B2;1 signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the highly acidic sequence downstream of the BMP-1/TLD cleavage site (Glu107, Asp108, Asp109, Asp110) and the highly basic furin consensus sequence from the same chain almost overlap within the cavity between protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>). It is tempting to speculate that interaction between the primary and secondary cleavage sites may play a role in the regulation of pro-myostatin activation. In our proposed domain-swapped arrangement, in which the same chain crosses first from the N-terminal forearm to the shoulder on the opposite side and then back again to the mature GF, the entire complex is supported by criss-cross connectivity with the furin site coming over the BMP-1/TLD site, possibly providing steric protection of the latter. Cleaving the furin site would release the first of these tethers, and potentially increase lability of the shoulder domains. For activin A, this seems to be sufficient to release the latency that the pro-domain exerts. In the case of myostatin, the shoulder domain interaction is strong enough to prevent dissociation from the mature growth factor, stabilised by the link from a2 helix to the first &#x03B2;-strand of the pro-domain. Subsequent cleavage of the BMP-1/TLD site removes this second tether, possibly disengaging the fastener interaction and allowing the shoulder, which is now attached only non-covalently, to dissociate from the GF/Forearm. The details of myostatin activation remain under investigation.</p>

<sec id="s2g"><title>Structural polymorphisms in human pro-myostatin</title>
<p>So far 134 unique naturally occurring missense mutations, involving 112 residues (77 in the pro-domain), have been identified in human pro-myostatin (Ensembl genome assembly GRCh38.p10, accessed on 05.06.2017). In order to further probe the molecular the determinants of latency, a series of pro-myostatin variants were made, designed either to recapitulate interesting natural polymorphisms, or to disrupt previously unappreciated interactions that we identified by structural analysis. In light of new structural information, we analysed the known polymorphisms and selected those that were most likely to affect pro-myostatin latency while eliminating residues that have already been shown to have an effect in previous studies (Table S2). We also selected several other residues that, in the absence of structural data, had not been analysed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The most interesting substitutions for this analyses were those affecting the fastener (Arg65Ala, Arg65Cys, Tyr111His, His112Arg), and Lys153Arg, which has been associated with muscle and obesity related phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In addition, we chose a naturally occuring Ala84Gly variant at the interface of forearm and shoulder domains as well as Trp203 which forms part of the globular shoulder domain, and makes a hydrogen bond with backbone of Lys83 in the latency lasso using the indole nitrogen. Trp203 was mutated to Ala, His and Phe, in an attempt to minimise the effect of removal of the large side chain from the core of the shoulder. All mutated residues and their immediate surroundings are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Pro-myostatin structural polymorphisms. A.

Inhibition of mature myostatin signalling by <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed pro-domains, determined using myostatin responsive luciferase reporter assay.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="153403_fig6.tif"/></fig>
<p>We first created expression constructs of selected mutants for production in HEK293-(CAGA)12 luciferase reporter cells, to analyse the effect of these mutations on bioactivity. In this setup, secreted pro-myostatin complexes showed minimal activity in the absence of cleavage at the tolloid-site, however when proteins were produced by co-transfecting cells with increased amounts of a construct encoding human tolloid-like 2, a number of variants showed deviation from wild-type activity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref>, S6). Mutation of Arg65 from the fastener motif to alanine increased signalling activity significantly over the wild type, but mutation of the same residue to cysteine abolished activity, presumably because of the detrimental effect of introducing a lone cysteine into an extracellular protein. The other fastener mutations also increased myostatin activation with His112Arg behaving similarly to Arg65Ala, but Tyr111His was the most effective in reducing the latency of the protein, with over 2- fold higher activity compared to the wild type protein. The mechanism of increased activity of these variants is not certain, however it seems likely that weakening of the fastener interaction promotes increased dissociation of the pro-domain fragments following proteolysis by furin and BMP-1/TLD sites.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, the known polymorphic variant Lys153Arg had only a modest effect on myostatin activity, compared to wild-type protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The Ala84Gly variant showed no effect over the wild type protein. Mutations of Trp203 showed minimal increase in activity with low levels of tolloid co-expression, but at higher tolloid concentrations (where the wild-type protein was ca. 6x more active), Trp203 variants showed significantly reduced activity. This may be due to disruption of protein stability, given Trp203 is involved in a tightly packed hydrophobic interaction within the pro-domain shoulder.</p>
<p>To analyse the effect of these mutations in more detail, the same mutations were introduced into an <italic>E. coli</italic> expression construct of the myostatin pro-domain. The proteins were expressed solubly in <italic>E. coli</italic> as MBP fusions and assessed for their ability to inhibit mature myostatin in <italic>trans</italic>. Mutations of Trp203 and similarly Arg65Cys gave very poorly soluble protein and thus were excluded from this part of the study. The wild-type myostatin pro-domain inhibited mature myostatin signalling in our experimental system, with an IC50 of 0.3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). All variant forms of the pro-domain inhibited signalling to a similar extent as the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, Table S4). The fact that these pro-domain variants did not recapitulate the same pattern of effects on activity observed for HEK293 expressed pro-complexes suggests these mutations do not meaningfully disrupt the pro:mature complex when reconstituted in <italic>trans</italic>. This may point to a mechanism in which the latency driving interactions are fully established only when the native protein folds and assembles into the domain-swapped complex.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Extracellular regulation of cell-signalling proteins is of clear biological importance, both during development and into maturity. Storage of signalling molecules in the extracellular matrix provides a means of rapid response to physiological change, avoiding the need to first synthesise, process and secrete the protein following stimulation. The mechanisms of extracellular storage and regulation of TGF-&#x03B2; family growth factors are diverse and a spectrum of latency exists within the pro-TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily, ranging from the fully auto-inhibited TGF-&#x03B2;s, to the BMPs and activins which readily dissociate from their pro-domains following cleavage, and instead rely on soluble antagonists to regulate signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Pro-myostatin occupies an intermediate position on this scale, forming a weakly bioactive complex which requires further proteolytic activation to liberate full signalling capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pro-domains of TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily proteins are poorly conserved in sequence with comparison to the mature GF domains, making structural predictions and modelling of the pro-domains difficult. In addition to variation at the amino-acid sequence level, the pro-forms for which we have structural information, show marked variability in their overall domain topology. The structures solved here show that latent pro-myostatin does not conform to the expectation of a &#x2018;closed-arm&#x2019; conformation, as is seen for latent pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1. Instead, pro-myostatin forms an open, elongated structure, more reminiscent of non-latent pro-Activin A and pro-BMP-9. The open-armed conformation observed crystallographically (in two distinct crystal forms) also exists in solution, as shown by SAXS, and interestingly, the overall conformation (and associated particle dimensions) does not seem to change significantly upon cleavage of the pro-domain.</p>
<p>Despite differing overall topologies, the specific pro:GF interactions which drive the latency of these pro-complexes are mostly conserved with pro-TGF-&#x03B2;1, with the exception of the covalent linkage of TGF-&#x03B2;1 pro-domains at the bow-tie motif. In the absence of the avidity provided by the pro-domain dimerization, myostatin utilises other mechanisms to increase its latency compared to activin A, which in its overall topology is much more similar to myostatin. Our analyses suggest that there is no single critical feature that confers latency to the protein, but rather the latency arises from multiple features that increase the pro-mature affinity combinatorically.</p>
<p>We propose a model for the synthesis and activation of myostatin, based on the structures and data presented here and in other studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). With the domain-swapped, zig-zagged conformation of the protomer of pro-myostatin dimer, it is likely that a monomeric structure forms first, with the pro-domain supporting a dimerization-compatible conformation of the mature domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-C</xref>). In this dimeric unprocessed precursor form of myostatin we can identify a number of features that contribute to its latency and provide a foundation for a tightly controlled activation process. The key features are: increased affinity of the &#x03B1;1 helix for the mature GF, a fastener epitope that locks the N-terminus around the mature GF domain fingers and the extended interface that the shoulder domain makes with the mature GF and the latency lasso that binds to it, stabilising this complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This latency is released by a controlled, sequential proteolysis of the furin and tolloid sites, with the furin site in particular being only moderately accessible, and at least before cleavage, partially obscuring the tolloid site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-F</xref>). Cleavage of the furin site alone is not sufficient for complete activation, as the extended non-covalent interactions prevent the furin cleaved complex from dissociating, even in the presence of competing high affinity antagonist follistatin. Release of the second (BMP-1/TLD) tether and separation of the two halves of the pro-domain is required before myostatin can exert its function. The shoulder domain is free to dissociate once the covalent linkage to the forearms is severed, which would then allow the helix-loop-helix epitope to dissociate as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G-H</xref>). Removal of the &#x03B1;1 helix will enable the GF wrist-helix to form, re-establishing the type I receptor binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). The mature GF is now free to interact with its receptors and induce signalling. At the same time, this mature GF becomes a target for soluble inhibitors such as follistatin, which must act before the mature GF finds its receptor on cell surface.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Model for myostatin biosynthesis and activation. The diagrams shows schematically different stages of myostatin biosynthesis (A-C), the features of the latent precursor (D) and the sequential activation of the pro-myostatin by furin and BMP-1/TLD (E-F), dissociation of the complex (G-H) and release of the mature GF (I).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="153403_fig7.tif"/></fig>
<p>It is possible that the fully latent complex can only assemble during synthesis, as supported by our mutagenesis data in which pro-domain variants which reduce latency of the pre-assembled complex do not have the same effect when the variant pro-domain is supplied in <italic>trans</italic>. While our latent pro-myostatin complex shows low-level signalling activity in cellular assays, it is likely that the cleaved pro-complex is further stabilised <italic>in vivo</italic>, by interactions with components of the extracellular matrix, including perlecan and LTBP-3, which are known to bind elements of the pro-myostatin pro-domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Non-covalent bridging of pro-domains by ECM bound interactors could provide a mechanism for increasing functional affinity of the complex, requiring targeted activation by BMP1/TLD proteases.</p>
<p>This structure and the analysis of the activation process provides us with a framework for assessing the effect of polymorphisms on myostatin function. Analysis of several missense polymorphisms in the pro-domain of myostatin demonstrate that some of these variants are more easily activated, and would potentially affect the musculature of those carrying the polymorphisms. As most of these polymorphism data are part of large scale anonymised studies, we are unable to assess phenotypic information relating to these individuals.</p>
<p>In addition to extending our understanding of the molecular details of myostatin activation, the crystal structures of this complex provide new ideas for the inhibition of myostatin signalling. A number of myostatin-neutralising antibodies have made it to clinical trials for a range of muscle wasting conditions, but these therapies tend to target the mature GF dimer which is present only for a limited period after activation, and shares significant structural homology with functionally unrelated TGF-&#x03B2; superfamily ligands. Perhaps stabilising the latent state of the pro-form will provide a more effective strategy for specific neutralisation of myostatin in the extracellular space.</p>

<sec id="s4a"><title>Cloning and expression of pro-myostatin constructs for bacterial expression</title>
<p>A construct encoding human pro-myostatin lacking the signal peptide (residues 19-375, Uniprot 014793) was cloned into pHAT2 vector using <italic>BamHI</italic> and <italic>NotI</italic> restriction sites (pro-MSTN). The final construct contained an N-terminal His-tag and additional linker sequence, appending a total of 20 non-native amino acids to the protein N-terminus. For crystallography constructs, a TEV cleavage site was introduced into the N-terminal sequence by substituting the native sequence from Glu36-Cys42 with the TEV consensus ENLYFQGS, allowing removal of the predicted disordered N-terminus (proMSTN-&#x0394;43) <italic>in-vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Surface entropy reduction mutations, identified using the UCLA SERp server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (G319A, K320A, K217A, Q218A, E220A), were introduced into the &#x0394;43 crystallography construct (proMSTN-&#x0394;43-mut).</p>
<p>For functional experiments, an additional construct was generated in which an HRV-3C protease site was engineered into the position of the native furin cleavage site, to allow robust cleavage <italic>in-vitro</italic> (proMSTN-3C). The aforementioned modifications to the original construct were completed using multi-step PCR protocol with overlapping oligonucleotide primers containing the modified sequence. The sequences of all oligonucleotides used for cloning are listed in Table S3.</p>
<p>Sequence-verified constructs were transformed into competent BL21(DE3)&#x002B;pUBS520 cells by heat-shock and then grown overnight at 37&#x00B0;C overnight on LB-agar plates supplemented with 100 &#x03BC;g/ml of ampicillin and 25 &#x03BC;g/ml kanamycin. The cells were grown in 1L 2xYT media until OD600 between 0.8- 1.0 and then for an additional 3 hours at 37&#x00B0;C after induction with 400 &#x03BC;M IPTG. The resulting cell pellet was harvested by centrifugation (4000 g, 20 mins).</p>

<sec id="s4b"><title>Refolding and purification of bacterially expressed pro-myostatin constructs</title>
<p><italic>E. coli</italic> cells were lysed with Emulsiflex C5 and inclusion bodies prepared as per Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The washed inclusion bodies, from 1L culture volume, were resuspended in 100 mM TCEP pH 7.0 and then solubilised by addition of 15 mL solubilisation buffer (8 M guanidine-HCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA and 0.1 M cystine) and incubated at room temperature while shaking, for 1 hour. The solubilised protein was clarified by centrifugation (15,000 g, 20 mins) and soluble material buffer exchanged into 6 M urea and 20 mM HCl, adjusted to 1 mg/mL and rapidly diluted 1:10 into 1L of cold refolding solution (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 1 M pyridinium propyl sulfobetaine (PPS), 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM cystine and 2 mM cysteine) while stirring vigorously. The refolding solution was kept at 4&#x00B0;C for 7 days before purification.</p>
<p>One litre of refolding solution was filtered (0.65 &#x03BC;M Sartopure filter cartridge) prior to loading onto a 10 mL Source Q15 anion exchange column pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0. Five column volumes of the equilibration buffer were used to wash the unbound material, followed by elution with a linear gradient over 20 column volumes from 0-100&#x0025; elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 1 M NaCl). For crystallographic constructs, the His-tagged N-terminus was removed by TEV protease cleavage. Following anion exchange capture, the pooled fractions were buffer exchanged to 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and incubated overnight with 200 &#x03BC;L TEV protease (2 mg/mL). TEV cleaved pro-myostatin was incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Cube Biotech) to separate the cleaved N-terminus and protease. After incubation with Ni-NTA resin for one hour at 4&#x00B0;C, the flow through containing cleaved protein was collected.</p>
<p>As a final step of purification for all constructs, protein fractions were concentrated and loaded onto HiLoad Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (GE healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and analysed by reduced and non-reduced SDS-PAGE.</p>
<p>Selenomethionine-labelled protein was expressed in minimal medium using metabolic suppression method to minimise endogenous methionine production and refolded and purified like the unlabelled protein. Selenomethionine incorporation was confirmed to be complete by mass spectrometry.</p>
<p>For production of the cleaved pro-myostatin complex, the native furin site was replaced by an HRV-3C cleavage site, and the protein purified as described for the wild-type protein, except for initial capture from refolding which was done using 5mL HiTrap Q HP (GE) column instead of Source Q15 column. The purified protein was then incubated with GST-HRV 3C fusion at a 4:1 mass ratio for 3 days at 4&#x00B0;C in gel filtration buffer (above). GST-tagged HRV 3C was separated from the cleaved complex by incubation with PureCube glutathione agarose resin (Cube Biotech). The complex was further purified by gel filtration (as above) with the dimeric mature domain and prodomain co-eluting as a single peak suggesting successful formation of a stable complex.</p>
<p>Mature myostatin was purified from the HRV-3C cleaved pro-myostatin complex by reverse phase chromatography (RPC). Acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were added to the purified complex, for final concentrations of 10&#x0025; and 0.1&#x0025; respectively. The acidified complex was then loaded onto ACE C8 300 4.6x250 mm RPC column, pre-equilibrated with 10&#x0025; ACN and 0.1&#x0025; TFA. The protein was eluted over 20 column volumes to 100&#x0025; elution buffer (90&#x0025; ACN, 0.1&#x0025; TFA). Peak fractions were then dried by centrifugal evaporation. Mature myostatin was resuspended in 10 mM HCl prior to use. All protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using calculated absorption coefficients at 280 nm.</p>
