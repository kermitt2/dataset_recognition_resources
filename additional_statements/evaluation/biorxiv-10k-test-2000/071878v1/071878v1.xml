<title>Abstract</title>
<p>T cells must respond differently to antigens of varying affinity presented at different doses. Previous attempts to map pMHC affinity onto T cell responses have produced inconsistent patterns of responses preventing formulations of canonical models of T cell signalling. Here, a systematic analysis of T cell responses to 1,000,000-fold variations in both pMHC affinity and dose produced bell-shaped dose-response curves and different optimal pMHC affinities at different pMHC doses. Using sequential model rejection/identification algorithms, we identified a unique, minimal model of cellular signalling incorporating kinetic proofreading with limited signalling coupled to an incoherent feed forward loop (KPL-IFF), that reproduces these observations. We show that the KPL-IFF model correctly predicts the T cell response to antigen co-presentation. Our work offers a general approach for studying cellular signalling that does not require full details of biochemical pathways.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>T cells initiate and regulate adaptive immune responses when their T cell antigen receptors recognise antigens. The T cell response is known to depend on the antigen affinity/dose but the precise relationship, and the mechanisms underlying it, are debated. To resolve the debate, we stimulated T cells with antigens spanning a 1,000,000-fold range in affinity/dose. We found that a different antigen (and hence different affinity) produced the largest T cell response at different doses. Using model identification algorithms, we report a simple mechanistic model that can predict the T cell response from the physiological low affinity regime into the high affinity regime applicable to therapeutic receptors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>T cell activation is critical for initiating and regulating adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). It proceeds when T cell receptors (TCRs) on the T cell surface bind to antigenic peptides loaded on major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs). Binding of pMHC ligands to the TCR initiates a large signal transduction cascade that can lead to T cell activation as measured by functional responses such as proliferation, differentiation, target cell killing, and the production and secretion of effector cytokines. These responses critically depend on the pMHC affinity and dose. T cells are known to discriminate between normal and infected or cancerous cells based on differences in pMHC affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). It is also appreciated that the pMHC dose determines, for example, the peripheral induction of regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Although the proteins that form the TCR-regulated signalling network have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), it remains unclear how the architecture they form integrates the pMHC affinity and dose into T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies performed over the last two decades have focused on empirically mapping the relationship between pMHC affinity and T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). A number of studies have reported an optimal pMHC affinity for T cell activation but other studies have failed to observe the optimum. Interestingly, a subset of studies have suggested that the optimal pMHC affinity may be less pronounced at high pMHC doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The mechanism underlying an optimal pMHC affinity (or half-life) is proposed to be a trade-off between serial binding and kinetic proofreading but we have recently shown that this trade-off would lead to an optimal pMHC affinity at all pMHC doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>An accurate model of T cell signalling pathways that can predict the T cell response to a broad range of antigen ligand affinity and dose is important not only to understand physiological T cell responses but also in the rational design of T cell based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Engineered therapeutic TCRs and chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have been produced to bind, for example, cancer antigens with high affinity (dissociation constants, <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>, in the picomolar to nanomolar range). A specific example is the NY-ESO-1 cancer antigen, for which both high affinity TCRs and CARs have been produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The optimising of these therapies has focused, in part, on trying to determine the optimal receptor affinity for clinical efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>)).</p>
<p>A key challenge in the study of cellular signalling in general, and particularly in T cells, is the organisation of large amounts of molecular information into accurate mathematical models that can predict cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The reductionist approach has been to incorporate the known biochemistry into mathematical models, but it is well recognised that this relies on many assumptions (e.g. which proteins and interactions to include, their binding and reaction rate constants, concentrations, etc.) leading to models whose accuracy is difficult to determine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). This may, in part, explain why canonical models of T cell signalling have been elusive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). An alternative holistic approach is to infer models from experimental data without any prior assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) (e.g. of the known biochemistry).</p>
<p>In this work, we utilised the high affinity engineered c58c61 TCR that binds the NY-ESO-1 cancer antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) to measure primary human T cell activation in response to a 1,000,000-fold variation in pMHC affinity and dose. We found bell-shaped dose-response curves with inhibition at high pMHC doses. Moreover, different pMHCs (and hence different affinities) produced the largest T cell response at different pMHC doses. Without making prior assumptions about the known biochemistry, we identified a unique and modular pathway architecture for cellular signalling that reproduced these observations: kinetic proofreading with limited signalling coupled to an incoherent feedforward motif (KPL-IFF). We show that the identified KPL-IFF model predicts the outcome of pMHC co-presentation experiments. These mechanistic insights force a revision of the serial binding and kinetic proofreading model for T cell activation. The revised KPL-IFF model now predicts T cell activation from the physiological low affinity regime into the high affinity regime applicable to therapeutic TCRs and CARs.</p>

<title>T cell activation in response to a 1,000,000-fold variation in antigen affinity/dose</title>
<p>As a first step to identify a T cell signalling model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) we established a TCR/pMHC system with a large range of affinities by using the therapeutic affinity-matured c58c61 TCR that recognises a peptide derived from the cancer antigen NY-ESO-1 in complex with HLA-A&#x002A;02:01 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> &#x007E; 50 pM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). This TCR contains 14 amino acid substitutions (primarily at the contact interface) but maintains the same binding mode as the parental 1G4 TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Using single, double, and triple peptide mutations we produced a panel of 11 pMHCs that span a 1,000,000-fold range in affinity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b-c</xref> and SI Appendix, Table S1, Figure S1). The observed changes in affinity were largely a result of changes in the off-rate <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>.</p>
<p>We next transduced the c58c61 TCR into primary human CD8&#x002B; T cells and the Jurkat T cell line (SI Appendix, Figure S2a) before stimulating them with a 1,000,000-fold range of pMHC concentration. In the case of the primary T cells we measured the supernatant concentration of IFN-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> or MIP-1<italic>&#x03B2;</italic> after 4 hours of stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d-e</xref> and SI Appendix, Figure S2b). In the case of the Jurkat T cells we measured the supernatant concentration of IL-8 after 16 hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref> and SI Appendix, Figure S2c) or the transcriptional activity of AP1/NFAT (SI Appendix, Figure S2d).</p>

<p>Four striking features were observed. First, the dose-response appeared to exhibit a bell-shape with reduced cytokine production at high pMHC concentrations. This bell-shape was less pronounced or absent for low affinity ligands, which is consistent with published studies reporting a sigmoidal dose-response for low affinity ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Second, the peak amplitude of the bell-shaped dose-response was similar for pMHCs despite large differences in their affinities. The next two features describe the observation that the pMHC that produced the most cytokine was dose dependent. At higher concentrations (to the right of the peaks) there is an obvious intersection of the dose-response curves so that different pMHC ligands produce the most cytokine at different doses (e.g. 4A8K or 4A5A in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d-f</xref>). In contrast, at lower concentrations (to the left of the peaks) curve intersection is not apparent so that a single intermediate affinity pMHC produces the most cytokine. These four phenotypic features are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 1:</label>

<graphic xlink:href="071878_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>While a bell-shaped dose-response can be a result of activation induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), this is unlikely to be the case here. We found that the dose-response for cytokine production appeared bell-shaped at all times with continued cytokine production to the right of the peak (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Moreover, direct detection of apoptosis by Annexin V binding revealed a maximum increase of only 10&#x0025;, which is insufficient to explain the observed reduction in cytokine production (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Further, lower levels of cytokine observed to the right of the peak were associated with lower levels of Annexin V, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that lower cytokine is a result of increased apoptosis at high pMHC doses. These observations suggested a reduced rate of cytokine production per cell at high pMHC doses, which we confirmed using single cell cytokine production in Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>) and in primary T cells (SI Appendix, Figure S2e).</p>
<p>We observed inter-donor variability that could not be explained by differential TCR expression or pMHC activity. For example, the pMHC that produced the largest response to the left of the peak varied between 4A, 5Y, and 8S (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref> and SI Appendix, Figure S2b). However, the feature that a single pMHC of intermediate affinity produced the largest response to the left of the peak was consistent. Therefore, although the quantitative features of the data exhibited variability, we observed a high level of consistency for the key qualitative phenotypic features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, we found that Jurkat T cells required a higher amount of antigen to produce cytokine but that the overall response exhibited the same qualitative phenotypic features observed in the primary T cells. Although these Jurkats express CD8&#x03B1;, their reduced sensitivity may be related to the absence of CD8&#x03B2;, which has previously been shown to increase antigen sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Sequential model rejection identifies the KPL-IFF model as sufficient to explain T cell responses</title>
<p>We next identified a T cell signalling network consistent with all key features by sequentially rejecting models. To do this, we tested models of increasing complexity starting with the simplest possible cellular mechanism, namely the occupancy model, which reduces cellular signalling to a single reaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). In this model, the pMHC ligand binds to the TCR to form a complex that directly activates a protein <italic>P</italic> that is assumed to be linearly proportional to cytokine production. By examining the predicted dose-response for this model it is clear that the model is insufficient to explain the phenotypic features (e.g. it does not produce a bell-shaped dose-response, feature 1) and therefore we reject this model as a plausible model of T cell signalling.</p>
<p>Bell-shaped dose-response curves can be produced by incoherent feedforward motifs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), which are common architectures in transcriptional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). In this model, the TCR-pMHC complex directly inhibits <italic>P</italic> and indirectly activates <italic>P</italic> (by activating <italic>Y</italic> which itself is able to activate P). The model can produce inhibition at high pMHC concentrations if the activatory pathway (through <italic>Y</italic>) saturates, allowing inhibition to dominate at the highest pMHC concentrations. The appearance of the bell-shape in this model can explain the observation that a different pMHC affinity produces the largest response to the right of the peak (feature 4). However, this model is also rejected because it produces a bell-shaped dose-response for all pMHC ligands independent of their affinity (feature 1).</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">

</fig>
<p>Bell-shaped dose-response curves can be produced for high but not low affinity ligands by introducing kinetic proofreading (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). In this model, the pMHC ligand does not trigger signalling immediately upon binding TCR but instead must remain bound until it becomes signalling competent (denoted as <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub>). This delay means that low affinity pMHCs (with faster <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>) induce a lower maximal concentration of <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> than high affinity pMHC (see SI Appendix, Figure S3 for a plot of C<sub>1</sub> for pMHC with different values of <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>). If this is below the level at which <italic>Y</italic> saturates then inhibition at high pMHC concentrations will not be observed with low affinity pMHC. As expected, kinetic proofreading has improved antigen discrimination by dramatically decreasing the T cell response to low affinity pMHC. This model, however, is also rejected because it predicts that the highest affinity ligand will produce the largest response left of the peak in contrast to experimental observations (feature 3).</p>
<p>Introducing limited signalling into kinetic proofreading can produce an optimal affinity over a range of pMHC concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). In this model, activated TCR-pMHC complexes (<italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub>) signal for a limited period of time before converting to a non-signalling state (<italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub>) thereby introducing a penalty for pMHC that remain bound for long periods of time. This model is now able to explain all key features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and we therefore accept the kinetic proofreading with limited signalling coupled to an incoherent feedforward loop (KPL-IFF) model as a plausible signalling model for T cell activation.</p>

<title>Systematic model identification confirms that the KPL-IFF model is unique</title>
<p>Having identified the KPL-IFF model as sufficient to explain all phenotypic features, we next determined whether other models, with a potentially different underlying mechanism, can also explain all phenotypic features.</p>
<p>We first systematically examined models of equal or lower complexity to the KPL-IFF model. To do this, we studied all combinations of 3 reaction arrows between <italic>Y</italic> and <italic>P</italic> and the 3 receptor states (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Of the 560 possible reaction networks (16 choose 3) only the 304 networks that contain a connection between the ligand and <italic>P</italic> were analysed. For each of these putative signalling networks, we performed an exhaustive search that included a dense parameter scan followed by optimisation of the 5 free parameters (see SI Appendix, Figure S4). The output of the analysis is a list of networks ordered by their ability to reproduce the phenotypic features (Movie S1). As expected, the first network to appear is the KPL-IFF model but, unexpectedly, the 303 subsequent networks were all unable to explain all phenotypic features.</p>
<p>We highlight 3 models from the network search that are inconsistent with the phenotypic features (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b-d</xref>). A mirrored model in which activation is direct but inhibition is indirect cannot produce a bell-shaped dose-response (feature 1) because activation cannot saturate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). A re-directed model where inhibition comes from an earlier complex not subjected to kinetic proofreading (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>) cannot explain a different optimal pMHC affinity to the right of the peak (feature 4) nor the observation that the peak response is similar for different affinity ligands (feature 2). Lastly, models without an incoherent feedforward loop but with negative feedback, although able to produce oscillations of <italic>P</italic> in time, cannot produce a bell-shaped dose-response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref> and Figure S5, see also SI Appendix for a mathematical proof).</p>

<p>To determine whether more complex models can explain all key features using different mechanisms, we performed the same systematic network analysis on models with 4 reaction arrows between <italic>Y</italic>, <italic>P</italic> and an additional node <italic>X</italic> and 4 receptor states (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>). A systematic analysis of the 26,069 networks with a connection between the ligand and <italic>P</italic> revealed 274 compatible networks (Movie S2). However, examining these 274 networks showed that the basic mechanism underlying all compatible networks was KPL-IFF. For example, the incoherent feedforward loop could involve indirect inhibition so long as inhibition saturates after activation as a function of ligand dose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>) or it could involve both direct activation and inhibition with the net effect being inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4g</xref>). As above, negative feedback could not produce bell-shaped dose-response curves (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the KPL-IFF signalling network (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>) is sufficient to explain all phenotypic features. Given that the systematic analyses implicitly include simpler models (e.g. by allowing for the magnitude of reaction arrows to be negligible) we were able to further conclude that the KPL-IFF model is the simplest model able to explain all features.</p>
<p>The KPL-IFF model contains 5 parameters; kinetic proofreading (<italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub>), limited signalling (<italic>&#x03D5;</italic>), inhibition (<italic>&#x00B5;</italic>), activation (<italic>&#x03B4;</italic>), and amplification (<italic>&#x03BB;</italic>). We used Approximate Bayesian Computations with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) to establish the set of these parameters that are able to reproduce the key features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We found that large variation of the parameters were possible provided that they obeyed certain relationships (see SI Appendix, Figure S6). For example, we found that <italic>&#x00B5;</italic> and <italic>&#x03B4;</italic> can vary by 1000-fold provided that <italic>&#x00B5;</italic> &#x003E; <italic>&#x03B4;</italic> and that increases in <italic>&#x03D5;</italic> can reproduce the phenotypic features provided that <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> decreased proportionally. Using the provided applet (see SI Appendix), we find that bell-shaped dose-response curves are less pronounced when the condition <italic>&#x00B5;</italic> &#x003E; &#x03B4; is not satisfied. A large variation in the parameters is tolerated because the phenotypic features are scale-free (see SI Appendix).</p>

<title>The KPL-IFF model predicts the T cell response to co-presentation of pMHC ligands</title>
<p>T cells generally experience mixtures of pMHC ligands when becoming activated. Previous studies have shown that co-presentation of an additional pMHC can modulate the T cell response in various ways, including both enhancing and inhibiting T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>).</p>
<p>To address the effects of pMHC co-presentation, we extended the KPL-IFF model to include an additional pMHC ligand with different binding kinetics and concentrations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). We used the extended KPL-IFF model to predict the T cell response to a titration of a lower affinity ligand in the presence of fixed concentrations of a higher affinity ligand (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). As a result of the incoherent feedforward loop the model predicted a sigmoidal dose-response when the concentration of the high affinity ligand was left of its peak (&#x2272;.0.025) and a constant response when the concentration of the high affinity ligand was right of its peak (&#x2273;0.025). This is a direct result of the saturating activating pathway of the incoherent feedforward. Surprisingly, the model predicted that T cell activation cannot be inhibited by signals induced by the low affinity ligand even when the high affinity ligand is presented at concentrations that saturate the activation pathway of the incoherent feedforward. We confirmed these predictions by stimulating T cells with a titration of the lower affinity ligand, 5P, in the presence of fixed concentrations of the higher affinity ligand, 4A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). As predicted by the model, the dose-response curves appeared sigmoidal at lower doses of 4A and largely constant at higher doses, without any obvious inhibition of T cell activation by 5P.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have measured the T cell response to a 1,000,000-fold variation in antigen affinity and dose. We found bellshaped dose-response curves with a different pMHC (and hence different affinity) producing the largest T cell response at different doses. We show, without making prior biochemical assumptions and with the constraint of parsimony, that kinetic proofreading with limited signalling coupled to an incoherent feedforward loop (KPLIFF) is the only model that can explain all phenotypic features of the experimental data. We further confirmed predictions of the model concerning pMHC co-presentation. Remarkably, the KPL-IFF model can explain the T cell response to a 1,000,000-fold variation in antigen affinity and dose based on a simple pathway architecture despite the enormous molecular complexity in T cell signalling.</p>
<p>The present work has uncovered two independent mechanisms that lead to an optimal pMHC affinity. At low doses (left of the peak) we find that limited signalling through the TCR allows a single intermediate affinity pMHC to dominate the dose-response curve whereas at higher doses (right of the peak) a different pMHC affinity produces the most cytokine as a result of the bell-shaped dose-response curves produced by the incoherent feedforward loop. In light of our comprehensive data, it is likely that discrepancies between previous studies were a result of a limited range of tested pMHC affinity and dose. The model may account for previous work showing a bell-shape dose-response in the induction of regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>Modified TCRs and CARs often target tumour associated antigens that are differentially expressed between normal and cancer cells. Therefore, the antigen dose can be a critical determinant of succesful immunotherapy. As a result of the bell-shaped dose-response, we find that low affinity receptors can actually outperform high affinity receptors at high antigen doses. Our model provides a rationale for optimising the affinity of therapeutic receptors based on the target antigen dose, as recently proposed for a CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). We provide a tool that can be used to examine the predicted T cell response for antigens of different affinities presented at different doses (Applet S1).</p>
<p>A number of studies have implicated negative feedback in TCR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), but we find that negative feedback cannot explain the phenotypic features of T cell activation. For example, negative feedback cannot produce bellshaped dose-response curves. We note that our model does not preclude the existence of signalling proteins with negative effects, such as tyrosine phosphatases that can determine, for example, the net rate of TCR phosphorylation (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>). Negative feedback may be more important for the short timescale process of antigen discrimination rather than the longer timescale process of T cell activation that has been the focus of the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>The limited signalling mechanism is related to previous work showing that a trade-off between serial binding and kinetic proofreading leads to an optimal pMHC half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Serial binding of a single pMHC to many TCRs can increase signalling when the pMHC concentration is low and individual TCRs signal for a limited period of time upon binding. Under these conditions longer binding half-lives can reduce the number of productive TCR engagements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). We find that at low doses reduced signalling is only observed when the TCR/pMHC half-life measured in solution is longer than 1 minute (e.g. low dose of 4A, 5Y, 8S compared to 9V in SI Appendix, Figure S2b,c). It follows that while limited signalling (and hence serial binding) may not be critical for physiological TCR-pMHC interactions, which have half-lives that last seconds, it is likely to be important for the design of high affinity therapeutic TCRs or CARs for T cell adoptive transfer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>The internalisation of TCR is known to take place upon TCR triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) and it can be realised by different mechanisms. Intracellular signalling induced by activated TCR that leads to TCR internalisation is a form of negative feedback and, as discussed above, negative feedback cannot explain the observed phenotypic features. Limited signalling may result from the tagging of TCR for internalisation and explicitly including this internalisation, without incoherent feedforward, does not lead to bell-shaped dose-response curves in the steady-state (SI Appendix, Figure S8). The KPL-IFF model may implicitly be capturing TCR surface dynamics because directed movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) combined with polarised recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) of TCR into the immune synpase may balance with TCR internalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) to maintain the relatively constant TCR concentration at the immune synapse assumed by the KPL-IFF model, which is consistent with previous calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). A recent study has shown that changing the pMHC affinity can induce a programme that over a timescale of several days changes TCR levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). The KPL-IFF model can explain their observation that the higher affinity ligand induced greater TCR downregulation if TCR levels are determined by the output of the KPL-IFF model.</p>
<p>The systematic analyses revealed that a large number of more complex models can explain the phenotypic features (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>). This illustrates the broad challenge of 1) formulating unique models based on the known biochemistry and 2) relating the unique model we have formulated to the known biochemistry. Limited signalling may result from modification of the TCR signalosome, such as ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) and/or its movement into membrane environments incompatible with signalling (e.g. endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) or microvesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>)) (SI Appendix, Figure S7b). Kinetic proofreading can be realised by a number of different molecular mechanisms, such as sequential or random phosphorylation of the TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) and/or the recruitment of Lck associated coreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) (SI Appendix, Figure S7a). The incoherent feedforward loop may result from the fact that LAT can both activate (via Grb2 and SOS) and inhibit (via Dok1/Dok2 and RasGAP) Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) (SI Appendix, Figure S7c) or from the observation that the TCR signalosome, by virtue of being able to associate with both a tyrosine kinase (ZAP-70) and a tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1), can produce incoherent signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Additionally, the positive and negative arms of the incoherent feedforward may represent two pathways that converge to regulate cytokine production. Future work is required to map the known biochemistry onto the KPL-IFF architecture.</p>
<p>The systematic search for parsimonious models that can reproduce phenotypic features of cellular activation, without prior biochemical assumptions, produces signalling pathways with tractable architectures. Just as subatomic details (e.g. nuclear structure) are not necessary for atomic molecular dynamics simulations, we argue that the correct description of signalling pathways may not require detailed biochemical knowledge of individual proteins. These predictive pathway models provide a mechanistic understanding of the modular network components required to integrate input signals from the cell surface into cellular activation outputs. Although they do not include full molecular detail, they offer an intuitive framework upon which biochemical information can be mapped, which has so far been elusive with reductionist approaches.</p>
