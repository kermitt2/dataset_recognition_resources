<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Learning the spatial organization of the environment is essential for most animals&#x2019; survival. This often requires the animal to derive allocentric information about the environment from egocentric sensory and motor experience. The neural circuits and mechanisms underlying this transformation are currently unknown. We addressed this problem in electric fish, which can precisely navigate in complete darkness and whose requisite brain circuitry is relatively simple. We conducted the first neural recordings in the <italic>preglomerular complex</italic>, the thalamic region exclusively connecting the <italic>optic tectum</italic> with the spatial learning circuits in the <italic>dorsolateral pallium</italic>. While tectal egocentric information was eliminated in preglomerular neurons, the time-intervals between object encounters were precisely encoded. We show that this highly-reliable temporal information, combined with a speed signal, can permit accurate path-integration that then enables computing allocentric spatial relations. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in spatial learning via sequential encounters in all vertebrates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Learning to navigate within the spatial organization of different habitats is essential for animals&#x2019; survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Geva-Sagiv, Las, Yovel, &#x0026; Ulanovsky, 2015</xref>). Electric fish, for example, occupied a lucrative ecological niche by evolving the ability to navigate and localize food sources in complete darkness using short-range electrosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jun et al., 2016</xref>). The spatial acuity that they exhibit, along with their reliance on learned landmark positions, strongly suggest that they memorize the relative arrangement of the landmarks and the environmental borders. The information animals use to generate such <italic>allocentric</italic> knowledge include sensory experiences collected during object encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Petreanu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Save, Cressant, Thinus-Blanc, &#x0026; Poucet, 1998</xref>) and motor actions (heading changes and distance traveled) executed between such encounters; utilization of these motor variables in spatial learning and navigation is termed <italic>path integration</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Collett &#x0026; Graham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Etienne &#x0026; Jeffery, 2004</xref>). This acquired information, however, is always <italic>egocentric</italic> in nature. Fittingly, the primary brain regions dedicated to sensory and motor processing, such as the <italic>optic tectum</italic> (OT) of all vertebrates and many cortical regions in mammals are topographically organized along an egocentric coordinate system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Knudsen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sparks &#x0026; Nelson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Stein, 1992</xref>). The neural mechanisms underlying the transformation of the egocentric sensory and motor information streams into an allocentric representation of the environment are completely unknown in any animal species; past research has not shown nor hypothesized as to which neural structures and processes are involved.</p>
<p>Teleost fish offer an attractive model for studying this question, as their related brain circuitry is relatively tractable: lesion studies point to the dorsolateral pallium (DL) as the key telencephalic region involved in spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rodriguez et al., 2002</xref>), similarly to the medial cortex in reptiles and the hippocampus in mammals (see Discussion). Importantly, DL receives all sensory and motor information from OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bastian, 1982</xref>) via a single structure &#x2013; the diencephalic preglomerular complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Giassi, Duarte, Ellis, &#x0026; Maler, 2012</xref>) (PG, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>); moreover, PG receives very little feedback from areas associated with DL &#x2013; essentially making PG a feed-forward information bottleneck between egocentric and allocentric spatial representations. This architecture provides unique access to study egocentric-to-allocentric transformations in the vertebrate brain. In what follows we describe the first electrophysiological recordings conducted in PG of any fish species. PG has been considered part of the fish thalamus, based on simple anatomical criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Giassi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mueller, 2012</xref>). Our recordings provided an additional functional correspondence in that PG cells emit rapid spike bursts likely mediated by the T-type Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> channels (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref></bold>) characteristic of the OT targets in thalamic regions of other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ramcharan, Gnadt, &#x0026; Sherman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Reches &#x0026; Gutfreund, 2009</xref>). In this contribution, we show a radical conversion of the topographic spatial representation in OT into a reliable non-topographic temporal representation of encounter sequences. We then use a computational model to demonstrate that this temporal information is readily accessible for decoding and that it is sufficiently accurate to account for spatial precision during naturalistic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jun et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We characterized the responses of 84 electrosensory PG cells of the weakly electric fish <italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic> to moving objects; several motion protocols were used and the sample size for each protocol is mentioned in context. Neuronal activity was recorded extracellularly (<bold><xref rid="fig1S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 2</xref></bold>) in immobilized fish while objects (brass or plastic spheres) were moved relative to the skin using a linear motor (Methods). Cells responding to this stimulation were predominantly found in the lateral nucleus of the PG complex, PGl (<bold><xref rid="fig1S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 3</xref></bold>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Egocentric spatial information is abolished in PG</title>
<p>We first examined the spatial representation in PG cells by measuring their receptive fields (RFs; measured in 27 cells). The OT electrosensory cells driving PG have spatially-restricted, topographically organized RFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bastian, 1982</xref>), and thus provide labeled-line information on the egocentric position of objects. In PG, by contrast, only 11&#x0025; of the cells (3/27) were topographic with a spatially restricted RF (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>); the majority of PG cells (89&#x0025;, 24/27) responded across most or all of the fish&#x2019;s body (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). Therefore, PG activity does not convey a topographic &#x2018;labeled-line&#x2019; code of object position. We also checked whether object location is encoded by the firing-rate of PG neurons (i.e., a rate code). The firing-rate was significantly correlated with object position only in one non-topographic cell (4&#x0025;, 1/24 neurons; <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.05, random-permutations test, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Similarly, mutual information between object position and firing-rate was significant only in two non-topographic cells (8&#x0025;, 2/24 neurons; <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.05, random-permutations test, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>). Therefore, almost all PG cells have whole-body RFs and lack egocentric spatial information&#x2013; the hallmark of all electrosensory regions from the sensory periphery up to OT.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>PG cells respond to object encounters</title>
<p>Next, we checked what information PG neurons convey about object motion. OT cells, which drive PG, respond to an object moved parallel to the fish (longitudinal motion) while the object traverses their RFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bastian, 1982</xref>). Only a minority of recorded PG units (25&#x0025;, 7 out of 28 tested with longitudinal motion) responded in this manner (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Rather, the majority of PG units (78&#x0025;, 21/28) exhibited a strikingly different behavior, emitting a brief burst response confined to the onset (and sometimes to the offset) of object motion, but not during motion itself (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). This is further demonstrated when motion in each direction was broken into four segments separated by wait periods (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>), evoking responses at the onset (yellow arrowheads) and offset (red arrows) of each segment across the entire body. We next applied transverse motion, which mimics an object looming/receding (incoming/outgoing) into/from the electrosensory receptive field (tested in 40 cells). Three types of responses to such motion were identified: proximity detection, encounter detection, and motion-change detection; 27.5&#x0025; (11/40) displayed more than one type of response. Proximity detectors (70&#x0025;, 28/40) responded when an object was encountered very close to the skin (&#x003C;1.5 cm, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>); encounter detectors (20&#x0025;, 8/40) responded when an object either entered to or departed from their electroreceptive range (&#x223C;4 cm, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>); lastly, motion-change detectors (47.5&#x0025;, 19/40) displayed a response similar to that observed in longitudinal motion, firing at the onset/offset of motion (i.e., when the object accelerated/decelerated, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>); remarkably, this type of response was relatively distance-invariant, yielding comparable responses both very close to (0.5 cm) and very far from (5.5 cm) the skin despite the drastic effects of distance on both the magnitude and spread of the object&#x2019;s electrical image (<bold><xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref></bold>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen, House, Krahe, &#x0026; Nelson, 2005</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We conclude that PG electrosensory cells predominantly respond to novelty: onset/offset of object motion within their receptive field or the introduction/removal of objects into/from this receptive field; we use the term object encounters to designate all such events. Most PG cells responded both to conductive and non-conductive objects (<bold><xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 2</xref></bold>) and would therefore not discriminate between different object types, e.g., plants versus rocks. We can, therefore, infer that during active exploration of the environment, PG reports to the dorsal pallium whenever the fish encounters or leaves a prey or a landmark (e.g., root mass or rock) or alters its swimming trajectory near a landmark.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>PG cells display history-independent, spatially non-specific adaptation</title>
<p>While egocentric spatial information was scarce in PG, temporal information was prevalent. Many of the PG cells exhibited pronounced adaptation to repeated motion (45&#x0025;, 15/33 neurons tested with repeated-motion protocol; <bold><xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). We delivered a sequence of object encounters (motions in and out of the RF, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>); time-intervals between sequential encounters were drawn randomly and independently (in the range of 1&#x2013;30 s). The response intensity (number of spikes within an individually determined time window) of these adapting cells to each encounter was strongly correlated with the time-interval immediately prior to that encounter (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). By contrast, there was no significant correlation with intervals prior to the last one (inset of <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). Thus, a large subset of PG cells encoded the duration of the time-interval <italic>preceding the last encounter</italic> &#x2013; but did not convey information about the intervals prior to that. We term this history-independent adaptation. To quantify this insensitivity to prior history, the response of each cell was modeled using a use-dependent resource variable with memory parameter f]; the memory of past intervals is more dominant as f] &#x2192; 1, while f] = 0 for a completely history-independent cell (<bold><xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). We found that 47&#x0025; of the adapting cells (7/15) were best fitted with f] &#x003C; 0.1, and only 13&#x0025; (2/15) had f] &#x003E; 0.5 &#x2013; meaning that most cells indeed carried little information about time-intervals preceding the last one. Interestingly, similar behavior was also found in visually-responsive PG cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 3</xref></bold>). This result contrasts with many studies in the mammalian cortex, where adaptation is incremental and responses depend on multiple preceding intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lampl &#x0026; Katz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ulanovsky, Las, Farkas, &#x0026; Nelken, 2004</xref>). Moreover, a spatial &#x2018;oddball&#x2019; experiment (Methods), which we conducted on 14 neurons (6 of which were adapting) revealed that this adaptation is also spatially non-specific &#x2013; i.e. encounters at one body location adapt the response to encounters at all other locations (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref></bold>). We thus discovered here an entirely novel adaptation mechanism in the vertebrate thalamus that enables neurons to encode the time between the two most recent successive stimuli, without contamination by prior encounter history and irrespective of the objects&#x2019; egocentric position.</p>

<title>PG activity explains path integration acuity</title>
<p>Can PG activity be used to explain observed spatial behavior in freely-swimming electric fish? PG is the only source of sensory information for the dorsolateral pallium (DL), the likely site of spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rodriguez et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the history-independent adapting PG cells provide DL with one <italic>necessary</italic> component for path integration: the temporal sequence of object encounters (the two other components are heading-direction and linear velocity). To demonstrate this, we constructed a bootstrap model of the PG population (Methods). This model was then stimulated at random time-intervals. The last time-interval could be precisely decoded from the population response using an unbiased Maximum-Likelihood Estimator (MLE, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>, Methods). As expected, the estimation error increased with the time-interval being decoded and decreased with population size (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). Given the animal&#x2019;s velocity, the model&#x2019;s estimated interval may be converted to traveled distance (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). Finally, we compared the model&#x2019;s estimation error with the behavioral errors exhibited by fish trained to find food at a specific location, either directly after leaving the tank boundary (long distance to food) or after leaving a memorized landmark (shorter distance to food) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jun et al., 2016</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). The distributions of the temporal and spatial behavioral errors (boxplots in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref></bold>), both with and without landmarks, were captured by MLE using only &#x223C;500 adapting cells. The lateral subdivision of PG (PGl), in which most motion-responsive cells were found, contains about 60,000 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Trinh, Harvey-Girard, Teixeira, &#x0026; Maler, 2015</xref>); based on our data we can estimate that around 21&#x0025; of these are history-independent adapting cells (7/33), i.e. close to 13,000. Thus, the number of PGl cells is <italic>sufficient</italic> to attain the observed behavioral precision, even when additional encoding errors (e.g. in heading and velocity estimation) are taken into account. Taken together, our simulations suggest that time-interval encoding in PG can consistently account for the observed behavioral precision of spatial learning.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results suggest the following egocentric-to-allocentric transformation scheme: PG derives a sequence of discrete novelty events (encounters) from OT activity. The remarkable history-independent adaptation process provides an accessible, accurate and unbiased representation of the time intervals between encounters. We have found visually-responsive PG cells displaying similar adaptation features (<bold><xref rid="fig3S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 3</xref></bold>), suggesting that this mechanism is implemented across multiple sensory modalities. The elimination of egocentric spatial information in PG &#x2013; both in the response itself and in its adaptation &#x2013; ensures that the encoding of time is invariant to the specific body part encountering the object. This temporal information is then transmitted to DL, which can use it to integrate the fish&#x2019;s swim velocity to obtain distance-traveled, a key allocentric variable. For fish, the necessary velocity information may be provided by the lateral-line system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chagnaud, Bleckmann, &#x0026; Hofmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Oteiza, Odstrcil, Lauder, Portugues, &#x0026; Engert, 2017</xref>); several lateral-line responsive PG units were encountered in our recordings (<bold><xref rid="fig4S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). Finally, DL can combine the distance information with instantaneous heading-direction (vestibular system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Straka &#x0026; Baker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yoder &#x0026; Taube, 2014</xref>) to yield the animal&#x2019;s allocentric spatial position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Etienne &#x0026; Jeffery, 2004</xref>). A recent study in zebrafish suggests that DL neurons can indeed process temporal information on the long time-scales discussed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng, Jesuthasan, &#x0026; Penney, 2014</xref>). Our computational analysis demonstrates that the PG temporal information is sufficient to account for the spatial acuity displayed in behavioral studies of gymnotiform fish utilizing electrosensory information alone (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> <xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Our findings shed light on the primitive basis of egocentric-to-allocentric transformations. Short-range sensing, used by ancestor species living in low-visibility environments, necessitated the perception of space through temporal sequences of object encounters. With the evolution of long-range sensory systems such as diurnal vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">MacIver, Schmitz, Mugan, Murphey, &#x0026; Mobley, 2017</xref>), simultaneous apprehension of the spatial relations of environmental features became possible. The neural mechanisms implementing sequential (space-to-time) spatial inference and simultaneous spatial inference presumably both exist in mammals, e.g. we can acquire a map of relative object locations by looking at a scene from afar, or by walking and sequentially encountering landmarks with our eyes closed. Whether the sequential or the simultaneous spatial-inference is more dominant may depend on the species (e.g., nocturnal or diurnal) and on context (e.g., open field or underground burrows). However, it is not clear whether sequentially versus simultaneously-acquired spatial knowledge is processed in a common circuit. Indeed, clinical case studies on the regaining of eyesight in blind humans indicate that sequential and simultaneous spatial perceptions are fundamentally different, and may therefore involve two distinct computations and neuronal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sacks, 1995</xref>). The population of thalamic neurons that we discovered may underlie one of these two major computations &#x2013; the encoding of sequential temporal information &#x2013; and we hypothesize that such neurons underlie sequential spatial learning in all vertebrates.</p>
<p>There is substantial evidence indicating that the pathway studied here indeed has parallels in other vertebrates, and specifically in mammals. PG&#x2019;s homology to posterior thalamic nuclei is supported by previously published anatomical and developmental findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Giassi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mueller, 2012</xref>), as well as by physiological (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref></bold>) and molecular (<bold><xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref></bold>) results presented here. The thalamic pulvinar nucleus is particularly similar to PG in that it receives direct tectal input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berman &#x0026; Wurtz, 2011</xref>). Its involvement in visual attention and saliency in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Robinson &#x0026; Petersen, 1992</xref>) corresponds to PG&#x2019;s involvement in novelty detection (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). Moreover, pulvinar lesions are associated with saccadic abnormalities and deficits in the perception of complex visual scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arend, Rafal, &#x0026; Ward, 2008</xref>), suggesting a link to the sequential mode of spatial learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Komura et al. (2001)</xref> demonstrated that posterior thalamic regions (including the rodent equivalent of the pulvinar) can implement interval timing computations over long time-scales (&#x003E;&#x003E;1s); however, the mechanistic basis for these computations has not been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Simen, Balci, de Souza, Cohen, &#x0026; Holmes, 2011</xref>) and potential contributions to path integration have not been explicated. Finally, a recent study in rodents demonstrated spatially non-specific adaptation in VPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jubran, Mohar, &#x0026; Lampl, 2016</xref>), a posterior thalamic nucleus responding to vibrissal object encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yu, Derdikman, Haidarliu, &#x0026; Ahissar, 2006</xref>). Taken together, we hypothesize that thalamic space-to-time mechanisms akin to those presented here play an important role in mammalian sequential spatial learning, especially in nocturnal animals relying on sparse sensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Save et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The telencephalic target of PG, DL, resembles the mammalian hippocampus not only in function, as revealed in lesion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rodriguez et al., 2002</xref>), but also in development, gross circuitry and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Elliott, Harvey-Girard, Giassi, &#x0026; Maler, 2017</xref>). The role of the hippocampus in spatial learning and navigation is well established, and hippocampal neural correlates of allocentric spatial variables have been exquisitely described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barry &#x0026; Burgess, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buzsaki &#x0026; Moser, 2013</xref>). There is also evidence for the importance of time coding in the mammalian hippocampus: &#x2018;Time cells&#x2019; responsive to elapsed time have been reported and, in some cases, these cells also respond at specific spatial loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eichenbaum, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study on the representation of goals in the hippocampus found cells encoding the length/duration of the traveled path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sarel, Finkelstein, Las, &#x0026; Ulanovsky, 2017</xref>). The mechanism we have found may therefore contribute to creating temporal coding in the hippocampus, not just in the context of egocentric-to-allocentric transformations but rather whenever expectations associated with specific time intervals need to be generated. It should be noted, however, that unlike DL&#x2019;s direct thalamic input via the PG bottleneck, the hippocampus receives sensory and motor information primarily via the cortex. Furthermore, multiple bi-directional pathways connect the mammalian sensory and motor cortical regions with the hippocampal network. Pinpointing the exact loci where egocentric-to-allocentric transformations may take place in the mammalian brain is therefore extremely challenging. We propose that this transformation is initiated in the mammalian thalamus where history-independent adaptation also encodes time between encounter events. Finally, we propose that this thalamic output contributes to the generation of an allocentric spatial representation in the mammalian hippocampus.</p>

<title>Experimental Model</title>
<p>All procedures were approved by the University of Ottawa Animal Care and follow guidelines established by the Society for Neuroscience. <italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic> fish (imported from natural habitats in South America) were kept at 28&#x00B0;C in community tanks. Fish were deeply anesthetized with 0.2&#x0025; 3-aminobenzoic ethyl ester (MS-222; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; RRID: SCR_008988) in water just before surgery or tissue preparation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5b">
<title>Surgical procedure for in-vivo recordings</title>
<p>Surgery was performed to expose the rostral cerebellum, lateral tectum and caudal pallium. Immediately following surgery, fish were immobilized with an injection of the paralytic pancuronium bromide (0.2&#x0025; weight/volume), which has no effect on the neurogenic discharge of the electric organ that produces the fish&#x2019;s electric field. The animal was then transferred into a large tank of water (27&#x25A1;&#x00B0;C; electrical conductivity between 100&#x2013;150&#x25A1;&#x03BC;S&#x25A1;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and a custom holder was used to stabilize the head during recordings. All fish were monitored for signs of stress and allowed to acclimatize before commencing stimulation protocols.</p>

<sec id="s5c">
<title>Neurophysiology</title>
<p>Custom made stereotrodes or tritrodes were made of 25-&#x03BC;m diameter Ni-Cr wire (California Fine Wires). Each electrode was manually glued to a pulled filamented glass pipette (P-1000 Micropipette Puller, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA); the glass pipette provided mechanical rigidity that allowed advancing the tetrode to the deep-lying PG. Prior to recording, tetrode tips were gold-plated (NanoZ 1.4, Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) to obtain 200&#x2013;300 kOhm impedance at 1kHz. The electrode was positioned above the brain according to stereotaxic brain atlas coordinates (150-300 &#x00B5;m caudal to T26 and 800-1000 &#x00B5;m lateral to midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Maler, Sas, Johnston, &#x0026; Ellis, 1991</xref>)), and lowered using a micropositioner (Model 2662, David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) while delivering visual and electrosensory stimuli. Tectal responses to such stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bastian, 1982</xref>) were usually detected twice, around 1200 &#x00B5;m and around 1900 &#x00B5;m ventral to the top of cerebellum (as expected from the curved shape of OT). The electrode usually then transversed nucleus Electrosensorius, producing weak multi-unit responses to electrocommunication stimuli around 2300-2500 &#x00B5;m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Heiligenberg, Keller, Metzner, &#x0026; Kawasaki, 1991</xref>). PG units were usually encountered between 2800 &#x00B5;m and 3400 &#x00B5;m ventral to the top of the cerebellum, and were easily identified due to their characteristic rapid spike bursts (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref></bold>). Differential extracellular voltage was obtained by using one stereotrode/tritrode channel as reference. This enabled near-complete cancellation of the electric organ discharge (EOD) interference.</p>
<p>We report on the responses of 84 PG neurons responsive to object motion; several motion protocols were used and the sample size for each protocol is mentioned in context. We also found PG cells responding to electrocommunication signals, mostly within the medial subdivision of PG (PGm). As expected from the sparse retinal input to OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sas &#x0026; Maler, 1986</xref>), we recorded only a small number (<italic>n</italic> = 19) of PG cells responsive to visual input (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>&#x2013; figure supplement 2</bold>). In addition, we identified a small number of cells responsive to passive electrosensory (Grewe, Kruscha, Lindner, &#x0026; Benda) (ampullary receptors, <italic>n</italic> = 27), acoustic (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and lateral line (<italic>n</italic> = 7, <bold><xref rid="fig4S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 2</xref></bold>) stimulation &#x2013; but did not attempt to further characterize their coding properties.</p>
<p>Cell responses were initially manually tested with brass and plastic spheres. Cells responding to both were also tested with an electrically neutral gel ball made of 15&#x0025; agarose in tank water to exclude lateral-line responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Heiligenberg, 1973</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 2</xref></bold>). A plastic or brass sphere (1.21 cm diameter) was connected to an electromechanical positioner (Vix 250IM drive and PROmech LP28 linear positioner, Parker Hannifin, Cleveland, OH), which was pre-programmed for the appropriate motion sequence and initiated by outputs from our data acquisition software (Spike2, Cambridge Electronic Designs, Cambridge, UK). Typically, a trapezoidal velocity profile was used with 150 cm/s<sup>2</sup> acceleration and 5 cm/s peak velocity, and total distance in either direction of 8 cm (longitudinal) or 5 cm (transverse). For protocols involving motion in two axes (receptive field sampling, Oddball), the object was attached to a second electromechanical positioner (L12-100-50-12-P linear actuator, Firgelli Technologies, Ferndale, WA), which was mounted perpendicularly to the first one. In order to measure the receptive field (RF) size, we used one motor to repeatedly perform transverse object motion (towards and away from the fish) while a second motor was used to randomly change the longitudinal position between repetitions. This protocol was performed on a total of 27 cells. To check the spatial specificity of the adaptation process (i.e. if it is affecting only the body location experiencing the encounters or a whole-body effect), we performed a spatial oddball experiment: First, a series of N &#x2018;standard&#x2019; encounters (in and out transverse object motion, N=5-9) were given in rapid succession at one location (e.g. the head); the (N&#x002B;1)<sup>th</sup> encounter was given at a different location (e.g. the trunk) while maintaining the same time-interval between encounters (3-5 s, the second motor was used to quickly switch positions). Each such series was followed by a long recovery period (&#x2265;30s) and then repeated in the opposite direction. This was performed on a total of 14 cells, out of which 6 were found to be adapting (in either direction).</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>In the initial experiments the location of PG was verified by preparing histological sections and locating the electrode track marks (<bold><xref rid="fig1S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 3</xref>)</bold>. After recordings were complete, the fish was deeply anesthetized using tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222 0.2 g/L; Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, Mo) and transcardially perfused with 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde, 0.1&#x0025; glutaraldehyde, and 0.2&#x0025; picric acid in 0.1 M PBS pH 7.4.

Single units were sorted offline by performing principal component and clustering analyses.

<title>Analysis of behavioral data</title>
<p>Published spatial learning data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jun et al., 2016</xref>) were used; methods used for the generation of these data are explained in detail in that study. Briefly, South American weakly electric fish (<italic>Gymnotus</italic> sp.) were trained to find food (a mealworm restrained to a suction cup) in complete darkness, at a specific location within a 150 cm diameter custom made circular arena. In experiments with landmarks, four acrylic objects (two square prisms, 5.6 and 9.0 cm/side and two cylinders, 7.6 cm and 10.2 cm diameter) were placed in fixed locations within the arena. In each daily session, each fish was given four trials to find the food. After a 12-session training stage, animal performance stabilized, and four test sessions were performed in which food was omitted in one randomly assigned &#x2018;probe&#x2019; trial. Only data from these four last sessions were analyzed here. A total of four fish were used with landmarks and eight fish were used without landmarks. Fish behavior was video recorded and tracked as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jun, Longtin, &#x0026; Maler, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The cruising time/distance from the last encounter (with either a landmark or the tank wall) to the location of the food is the epoch/trajectory the fish had to memorize in order to perform path integration. This was measured in each of the &#x2018;food&#x2019; trials (<bold><xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 1A,B</xref></bold>); the segment from the last encounter (3 cm from a landmark or 6 cm from the arena wall) to the detection of food (3 cm from food location) was found and the trajectory total length and duration were computed. The spatial &#x2018;decoding&#x2019; errors were obtained by measuring where the fish searched for the missing food in the probe trials (<bold><xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 1C,D</xref></bold>); the normalized histogram of the visiting frequency across space (heat map) was fitted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function described by six parameters (&#x03BC;<sub>x</sub>, &#x03BC;<sub>y</sub>, &#x03C3;<sub>x</sub>, &#x03C3;<sub>y</sub>, &#x03B8;, A: colored oval contours). The distance between the Gaussian center (&#x03BC;<sub>x</sub>,&#x03BC;<sub>y</sub>) (white &#x2018;x&#x2019; mark) and the food location (white &#x2018;&#x002B;&#x2019; mark) is the spatial error; dividing this error by the median velocity in the trial produces the temporal error.</p>

<caption><p>Spatial learning accuracy observed in behaving fish. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jun et al., 2016</xref>), fish were trained to find food in a specific location in complete darkness, either with or without the aid of landmarks. After a 12-session training stage, the animals&#x2019; performance stabilized and four test-sessions were performed. Each test session consisted of four trials, three with food present in the designated location and one &#x2018;probe&#x2019; trial where the food was absent. The improvement in the animals&#x2019; performance (time required to find food in each trial) during the training stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jun et al., 2016</xref>), as well as the spatial statistics during the probe trials (see panels C, D below) indicate that the animals learnt to estimate the designated food location. Since only short range electrosensation was available to the fish, this indicates the use of path-integration from the home location, the tank walls or the encountered landmarks. For the current study, we re-analyzed the data reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jun et al.
