<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKZ) is associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of malignant diseases, but its biological function on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been explored. This study was aimed to analyze apoptosis induced by Knockdown of DGKZ and its mechanism in human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells.In the present study qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of DGKZ in HL-60, THP-1, K562, H9, Jurkat and CD34 cell lines. DGKZ-shRNA lentiviral vector was established and used to infect acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to determine the viability of HL-60 cells DGKZ knocked down. Apoptosis and cell cycle phase of HL-60 cells after DGKZ knockdown were evaluated by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was performed to investigated the protein expression related to apoptosis and cell cycle. Results showed DGKZ expression were stable and higher in Jurkat, HL-60, THP-1,K562 leukemia cells than those of H9 and CD34 cells. Compared with cells of the shCtrl group, DGKZ was markedly knocked down in cells which were transfected with lentivirus encoding shRNA of DGKZ in HL-60 cells. DGKZ knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in HL-60 cells. Western blot results indicated the expressions of caspase-3, caspase-8, and survivin markedly increased in HL-60 cells after knockdown of DGKZ. The results suggest Knockdown of DGKZ can inhibit proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase through caspases pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant disease group with an idiosyncratic nature and its incidence tends to increase year by year. Leukemia poses a major threat to the survival of patients, and researchers have been working on understanding the pathogenesis of the disease <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism remains unclear and a number of studies have suggested that there is a significant correlation between disease and multiple genes <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Several studies have suggested that diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKZ) is associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of malignant diseases, such as acquired aplastic anemia, gastric cancer, and neuroblastoma <sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. However, its biological function in AML has not been studied.</p>
<p>DGKZ, which is encoded by <italic>DGKZ</italic>, is a subtype of DGK-IV<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. It is thought to act in cell cycle regulation, where diacylglycerol (DGA) acts as an intracellular second messenger <sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. It can specifically activate protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinase, which further activate signal transduction pathways through protein phosphorylation and ultimately affect cell proliferation as well as differentiation<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. DGKZ is involved in transient ischemic attack, liver function, and myocardial pathological damage repair, showing its protective effects in different cells. Research shows that DGKZ has a role in the regulation of glioma, gastric cancer, liver cancer, and the pathological process of colon cancer<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of DGKZ knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis in leukemia HL-60 cells, which is helpful for exploring therapeutic strategies targeting leukemia.</p>

<title>Regulation of signaling molecules in DGKZ knockdown cells</title>
<p>To further illuminate the molecular mechanisms by which DGKZ affects HL-60 cells, a PathScan<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Antibody Array Kit was used to detect changes in signaling molecules in HL-60 cells before and after DGKZ knockdown. The results showed that expression of ERK1/2, HSP27, Smad2, p53, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/JNK were significantly down-regulated in HL-60 cells after RNAi against DGKZ. Meanwhile, expression levels of PARP, caspase-3, and Survivin were up-regulated in HL-60 cells after RNAi against DGKZ. The data indicated that DGKZ knockdown could significantly inhibit the growth of HL-60 cells via blockade of anti-apoptotic genes and promotion of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig.7</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression of Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Survivin</title>
<p>To further unveil the mechanism of DGKZ knockdown-induced apoptosis, various key effector of programmed cell death were quantified by western blot. The results showed caspase-3, caspase-8, and survivin protein levels in HL-60 infected with LV-shDGKZ were much higher than those of LV-shCtrl group.</p>

<p>The pathogenesis of AML has been unclear and every effort to increase our understanding of AML pathogenesis is of great significance <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. DGKZ is associated with a variety of malignant diseases in humans<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and is also related to proliferation and apoptosis of T cells in the blood system<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.With the popularity of precision medical advancement, stem cell technology, cell therapy technology, and the progress of new drugs, survival will greatly enhance in cancer patients. Furthermore, certain cancers may be avoided through preventive treatment, while some may even be completely cured. Whether cancer can be completely overcome remains a question that can only be answered by time. However, technological breakthroughs remain a strategic turning point.</p>
<p>Recently, several studies have shown that DGKZ plays a certain role in multiple system diseases suggesting that the gene is relevant to the pathogenesis and prognosis of a variety of diseases. Studying this emerging gene may bring new hope to those seriously ill.We conducted a series of related experiments to investigate the expression level of DGKZ gene in various cell strains of the leukemia and cytologically the effect of DGKZ knockdown on proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle. Existing research has showed that expressions of DGKZ in Jurkat, HL-60, and K562 cell lines were higher than those of H-9 and CD34 cell lines, suggesting that DGKZ could be a bio-marker of leukemia. After DGKZ knockdown, the proliferation rate of HL-60 cell infected with LV-shDGKZ was significantly lower than control since the 3th day and the number of apoptotic leukemic cells increased along with a decline in the total number of cells.These results indicated DGKZ is associated to proliferation and DGKZ knockdown can induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells.</p>
<p>To reveal the mechanism of growth suppression effect following DGKZ knockdown, the cell cycle distributions of HL-60 cells were assayed by flow cytometry. Results showed percentage of G2/M phases markedly increased while the percentage of S phases decreased in DGKZ knockdown cells.These results suggest DGKZ knockdown could induce G2/M phase arrest of HL-60 cells. Following DGKZ knockdown, the expression of ERK1/2, HSP27, Smad2, p53, p38 MAPK, and SAPK /JNK in the stress and apoptosis pathways were significantly up-regulated in HL-60 cells after DGKZ knockdown. Meanwhile, expression levels of PARP, caspase-3, and survivin were up-regulated in HL-60 cells knocked down DGKZ.</p>
<p>In conclusion our experimental results indicated DGKZ knockdown could inhibit proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells and caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase arrest by regulating Caspases pathways. It suggest that DGKZ be a novel target gene for the treatment of leukemia.</p>
