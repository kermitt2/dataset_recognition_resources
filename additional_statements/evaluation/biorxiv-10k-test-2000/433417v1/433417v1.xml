<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The yeast <italic>Komagataella phaffii</italic> is widely used as a microbial host for heterologous protein production. However, molecular tools for this yeast are basically restricted to a few integrative and replicative plasmids. Four sequences that have recently been proposed as the <italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeres could be used to develop a new class of mitotically stable vectors. In this work we designed a color-based genetic assay to investigate genetic stability in <italic>K. phaffii</italic>. Plasmids bearing each centromere and the <italic>ADE3</italic> marker were evaluated in terms of mitotic stability in an <italic>ade2/ade3</italic> auxotrophic strain which allows plasmid screening through colony color. Plasmid copy number was verified through qPCR. Our results confirmed that the centromeric plasmids were maintained at low copy number as a result of typical chromosome-like segregation during cell division. These features, combined with high transformation efficiency and <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly possibilities, prompt these plasmids as a new addition to the <italic>K. phaffii</italic> genetic toolbox.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The methylotrophic yeast <italic>Komagataella phaffii</italic> is considered as one of the most important platforms for the production of proteins and metabolites. We sought in this study to develop a color-based genetic system widely used in other yeasts to assess mitotically stability of vectors carrying the proposed <italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeres. First, we constructed a <italic>K. phaffii</italic> strain (LA3) mutant for <italic>ADE2</italic> and <italic>ADE3</italic>; this resulted in a strain that forms white colonies and when transformed with a vector (pPICH-ADE3) carrying <italic>ADE3</italic> turns red. Next, the four <italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeres were cloned into pPICH-ADE3 and tested in LA3 for copy number and plasmid stability. Centromeres are responsible for proper chromosome segregation during cell division, hence guaranteeing that both daughter cells receive one copy of the duplicated DNA. Our results show that three <italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeres behaved as expected conferring extra stability to the replicative plasmids and maintaining them at low copy number. Once characterized, centromeres can be used as parts in the construction of advanced genetic manipulation tools, thus allowing the construction of strains capable of expressing large metabolic pathways for the production of complex biochemicals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Komagataella phaffii</italic> is a methylotrophic yeast of great industrial importance which has been used for more than 30 years as a heterologous protein production platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Its genome was first published in 2009 and has since then been refined and thoroughly studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. As a result, in addition to a protein factory, <italic>K. phaffii</italic> has also been widely considered as a platform for the production of chemicals, biopharmaceuticals, vitamins and other molecules. However, the construction and regulation of new pathways demand complex molecular biology tools which are not readily available for this yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>K. phaffii</italic> genetic manipulation traditionally involves the use of shuttle vectors assembled in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and subsequently integrated into the yeast&#x2019;s genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Recent studies have described the development of a wide range of genetic parts for use in this yeast, as well as new methods of plasmid assembly and transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. An alternative to integrative strategies is the use of replicative plasmids, which are usually based on the well-known ARS1 sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. These plasmids may overcome some drawbacks such as genetic instability in multi-copy strains and non-specific integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In addition, they present higher transformation efficiency when compared to integrative vectors and can be assembled by <italic>in vivo</italic> recombination, which eliminates the need for bacterial transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. However, replicative plasmids show low mitotic stability when compared to integrative vectors and few vector options are available for use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Stability problems can be circumvented by the creation of centromeric plasmids, which may provide proper segregation during mitosis. A greater mitotic stability as well as low copy number allow stable and constant protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Centromeric plasmids can be constructed <italic>in vivo</italic>, allowing the assembly and cloning of large sequences including whole metabolic pathways and regulatory regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Therefore, the construction of such vectors would be of great value for <italic>K. phaffii</italic> strain development in the context of synthetic biology.</p>
<p>Centromeres are typically surrounded by large heterochromatin sections in most organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Their structure ranges from simple &#x201C;point&#x201D; centromeres of only &#x223C;125 bp in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to epigenetic, sequence-independent centromeres, such as those present in plants and animals. The reason for this phenomenon is that, for most eukaryotes, centromeres are maintained epigenetically and not genetically. Sequence homologies are rare in and between species, hampering the definition of a consensus sequence. In addition, some DNA regions can be centromeric or not depending on its function in previous cell cycles, which highlights the epigenetic nature of the centromere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>As for non-conventional yeasts there are wide variations in centromere size and structure. <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> has centromeres that show some homology to the CDEI and CDEIII regions of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> while Kuraishia capsulata centromeres have 200-bp conserved sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, <italic>Candida tropicalis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> have regional centromeres named after their sizes which range from 3 to 110 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeres have recently been identified, bearing no sequence similarities to those of any other yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3"><sup>3</sup></xref>. Since centromere function relies strongly on its structure rather than on its sequence, a centromere-specific histone H3 variant (CSE4) was used in the search for centromeric regions in <italic>K. phaffii</italic>. A CSE4 homolog was identified in chromosome 2 and tagged with a fluorescence marker. The corresponding nuclear localization of the histone-DNA complex indicated a centromere pattern typical of budding yeasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3"><sup>3</sup></xref>. Tridimensional conformation analysis followed the centromere clustering pattern observed in yeasts and narrowed down all four <italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromere locations to 20 kb windows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Considering that a low transcription rate is typical of centromeric regions, RNA-seq analysis allowed to pinpoint the putative centromeric locations for all four <italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Similarly to <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. pombe, <italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeres are formed by inverted repeats. All four sequences have two inverted repeats of &#x223C;2,5 kb, separated by a central segment of 800 to 1300 bp. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis showed that the CSE4 histone binds preferably to the central region, but also along the inverted repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeric sequences contain early replication peaks with autonomously replicating sequences, characteristics that are also observed in centromeres of other yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. According to recently published studies, there are native ARS sequences contained within centromeres 2 and 4. These comprise regions within the inverted repeats, as well as unique adjacent sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to expand the functional analysis of the <italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeres we sought in this study to develop a genetic system based on an <italic>ade2/ade3</italic> auxotrophic strain and a replicative vector carrying the wild-type <italic>ADE3</italic>. Vectors carrying each individual centromere were used to assess plasmid copy number and mitotic stability.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>In yeasts, adenine synthesis pathway is used as a tool for auxotrophic selection, gene copy number indicator and for plasmid stability analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Many genes from this pathway have been deleted in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in order to create auxotrophic strains, while in <italic>K. phaffii</italic> studies have only focused on <italic>ADE1</italic> and <italic>ADE2</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. <italic>K. phaffii</italic> LA2, a strain mutant for <italic>ADE2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], was used as a starting point for the construction of a strain that would allow plasmid stability verification. Deletion of <italic>ADE2</italic> results in cells auxotrophic for adenine which accumulate a red pigment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] while deletion of genes located upstream, such as <italic>ADE1</italic> or <italic>ADE3</italic>, should prevent the formation of such pigment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. As expected, the deletion of <italic>ADE3</italic> in LA3 strain results in white colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). Deletion of <italic>ADE3</italic> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has regulatory effects in the histidine synthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Consequently, <italic>ade2 ade3</italic> strains are not only auxotrophic for adenine, but also for histidine. In order to verify if this phenotype is applicable to <italic>K. phaffii</italic>, we plated strains X-33, LA2 and LA3 on MD medium without supplementation, comparing growth and colony color to cells plated on MD medium with adenine and histidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). LA3 strain displayed the expected histidine auxotrophy phenotype, showing that the adenine-histidine pathways in <italic>K. phaffii</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have common characteristics.</p>

<p>In order to assess plasmid stability, we first constructed plasmid pPICH-ADE3 bearing the <italic>ADE3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). When transformed with pPICH-ADE3, LA3 cells should return to being red and any changes on colony color would allow a simple screening of plasmid loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Although adenine auxotrophy has been explored for other purposes in <italic>K. phaffii</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], this particular color-based system has not yet been used for measuring plasmid stability in this yeast.</p>
<p>pPICH-ADE3 was used for cloning of all four <italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeres. Since it revealed extremely difficult to amplify entire centromeric regions we designed a strategy to amplify centromeres in halves in order to reduce fragment size and to avoid primer annealing inside the inverted repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>). Amplified fragments exhibited in their ends overlapping regions that would allow recombination between each other and with vector pPICH-ADE3.</p>

<p>LA3 strain was individually transformed with pPICH-ADE3 and all four constructed centromeric plasmids (pPICH-CEN1&#x2013;4). Plasmids were verified for autonomous replication by PCR analysis which confirmed their circular conformation (data not shown) and by plasmid rescue in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In this case, only pPICH-CEN3 could not be recovered, probably because CEN3 was the only centromere that could not be cloned directly in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Plasmid stability was firstly verified through colony color in non-selective medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>). When plated on YPD non-selective medium, colonies transformed with pPICH-ADE3 lost their color rapidly and presented a red center with large white edges, a result consistent with plasmid instability. In contrast, strains transformed with all centromeric plasmids presented a uniform red coloration throughout the colony.</p>

<p>Further stability examination of the centromeric plasmids was performed by growing cells in liquid YPD medium for 144 hours. After diluting and plating cultures on non-selective medium, red and white colonies were counted and compared between each construction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>). LA3 strain transformed with pPICH-ADE3 did not yield red colonies in any growth period, indicating that the plasmid was mitotically unstable. Conversely, centromeric plasmids presented a higher mitotic stability than pPICH-ADE3. After 96 hours of growth, cells with pPICH-CEN1 started to present white colonies, while all other centromeric plasmids remained stable. After 144 hours, pPICH-CEN1 was lost in most colonies while the other centromeric plasmids were lost in &#x003C;10&#x0025; cells. The reason for the instability of pPICH-CEN1 is still unclear but it could be related to the absence of important regulatory regions.</p>

<p>Yeast centromeric plasmids knowingly have a higher mitotic stability under non-selective conditions than common replicative vectors since they are equally segregated between daughter cells and therefore provide a uniform culture of cells containing the plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. A centromeric vector containing <italic>K. phaffii</italic> CEN2 has been constructed and it presented an enhanced stability when compared to a replicative plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In addition to <italic>K. phaffii</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, centromeric plasmids have been developed for other yeasts such as <italic>S. pombe, C. glabrata</italic> and <italic>Scheffersomyces stipitis</italic> and in all cases enhanced plasmid stability under non-selective conditions was verified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Yeast replicative plasmids are normally replicated but are unevenly distributed between daughter cells, which creates both multi-copy and plasmidless cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Under selective conditions, cells lacking the plasmid are unable to survive and the result is a population of multi-copy plasmid-containing cells. The construction of centromeric plasmids should provide better plasmid segregation and stability and cells should maintain a low and stable plasmid copy number during yeast growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Plasmid copy number was assessed by qPCR after strains were grown in YPD medium containing zeocin in order to ensure that all cells assayed were harboring the centromeric plasmids. Results from qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>) indicate that the strain transformed with centromeric plasmids carried 1&#x2013;2 copies per cell while the replicative plasmid was present at approximately 25 copies per cell. The difference between plasmid copy number for the replicative vector and all centromeric vectors was significant according to a t-test (p&#x003C;0.05). This result illustrates the expected segregation pattern described above for growth in selective conditions and, together with the mitotic stability analysis, provides a clear picture of <italic>K. phaffii</italic> genetic manipulation using centromeric plasmids.</p>

<p>The number of plasmids in each cell was estimated by qPCR. LA3 was used as negative control. Statistical analysis comparing each of the centromeric plasmids with the replicative vector was performed through a t-test using GraphPad Prism 5. (p&#x003C;0.05). Error bars depict the standard deviation of the mean (n &#x003D; 3).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="433417_fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In a previous study, <italic>K. phaffii</italic> transformed with a centromeric plasmid was analyzed regarding plasmid copy number and compared to both a replicative plasmid and an integrative strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Results exhibited an equal low number of plasmids per cell in all strategies, which does not correspond to our observation. This can be explained by the fact that their analysis was performed in non-selective medium, a condition in which replicative plasmids are readily lost as we have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref> (pPICH-ADE3).</p>
<p>Overall, our results indicate that centromeric plasmids could be employed as a new tool for genetic manipulation of <italic>K. phaffii</italic>. Plasmids were maintained for long periods in non-selective medium, indicating that growth can be performed without the addition of antibiotics or any form of selective pressure. The centromeric plasmids&#x2019; low copy numbers per cell characterize a stable and homogeneous culture that can provide reliable expression results. Finally, their structure as a circular molecule allows <italic>in vivo</italic> plasmid assembly with relatively short homologous sequences when compared to genomic integration techniques where sequences have to be much longer for directed homologous recombination. Simpler assembly may also facilitate the construction of larger and more sophisticated vectors such as yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC) whose stability features may be also analysed by the color-based assay described in this work.</p>

<title>Quantitative PCR (qPCR)</title>
<p>Cells were grown to an O.D. of 1 in 10 mL YPD containing zeocin and then collected by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 5 minutes. Cell pellet was resuspended with 1 mL 0,25&#x0025; SDS and incubated at 98&#x00B0;C for 8 minutes according to Nakamura (2018). Finally, cell debris was removed by centrifugation and DNA was diluted 10-fold in water before qPCR reactions.</p>
<p>Quantitative PCR reactions used primers qZEO-F and qZEO-R for plasmid quantification and qHIS-F and qHIS-R as an internal single-copy control. Assays were carried out with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) thermal cycler. Analysis used the absolute quantification method and standard curves that ranged from 1&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> to 1&#x00D7;10<sup>8</sup> copies of the gene of interest. pPIC9 (Invitrogen) and pPICH linearized plasmids were used for construction of the standard curves.</p>

<p><italic>K. phaffii</italic> was electroporated following two different protocols.

<title>Construction of an <italic>ade2 ade3</italic> strain for color-based stability assays</title>
<p>Strain LA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29"><sup>29</sup></xref> was transformed with an <italic>ADE3</italic> deletion cassette and had the marker recycled before moving on with the centromeric plasmid transformations. Construction of the deletion cassette used PCR reactions assembled by an &#x201C;In-Fusion&#x201D; cloning reaction. Briefly, primers ADE3up-F and R; ADE3dw-F and R were used for PCR amplification of 491 bp and 582 bp, respectively, from <italic>K. phaffii genome. These</italic> reactions amplified sequences used for directing homologous recombination and substitution of the complete <italic>ADE3</italic> coding sequence. Meanwhile, primers ADE3lox-F and ADE3lox-R amplified the <italic>kanR</italic> geneticin resistance cassette from plasmid pGKL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34"><sup>34</sup></xref>. PCR fragments were assembled and cloned into pBluescript II SK<sup>&#x002B;</sup> linearized with <italic>Sma</italic>I. A final PCR reaction using primers ADE3up-F and ADE3dw-R amplified the whole deletion cassette which was used for transformation of <italic>K. phaffii</italic> LA2. Cells were selected in YPD containing geneticin.</p>
<p>The resulting <italic>ade2 ade3</italic> strain was later transformed with pYRCre2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35"><sup>35</sup></xref> and selected in YPD supplied with hygromycin B. This step promoted a Cre-mediated excision of the <italic>kanR</italic> cassette eliminating geneticin resistance. After PCR confirmation of marker recycling using primers ADE3conF and ADE3conR, the resulting strain was plated in non-selective YPD medium, causing loss of the pYRCre2 plasmid. The resulting strain was named LA3.</p>

<title>Construction of centromeric plasmids containing <italic>ADE3</italic></title>
<p>Plasmid pPICH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29"><sup>29</sup></xref>, which is derived from pPICHOLI (MoBiTec), was digested with <italic>Not</italic>I for cloning of the <italic>K. phaffii</italic> native <italic>ADE3</italic>. The complete gene was amplified from X-33 DNA using primers ADE3up-F and ADE3dw-R following digestion with <italic>Not</italic>I. After vector dephosphorylation, fragments were ligated and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> XL-10 Gold. One positive clone was then submitted to site-directed mutagenesis using primers Mut1(Hpa) and Mut2(Bam) for removal of the <italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction site present within the <italic>ADE3</italic> coding sequence. The final plasmid containing ARS1, the <italic>Sh ble</italic> resistance marker and <italic>ADE3</italic> was named pPICH-ADE3.</p>
<p>pPICH-ADE3 was digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI for cloning of all four <italic>K. phaffii</italic> centromeres. These were amplified from <italic>K. phaffii</italic> X-33 genomic DNA using two PCR reactions for each centromeric sequence. Primers Cen1/2/3/4-F and Cen1/2/3/4c-R amplified the first inverted repeat of each centromere while primers Cen1/2/3/4c-F and Cen1/2/3/4-R amplified the other half of the sequences. In order to promote <italic>in vitro</italic>/<italic>in vivo</italic> assembly amplicons had approximately 80 bp homology between each other and 15 bp with pPICH-ADE3. Firstly, we attempted an &#x201C;In-Fusion&#x201D; cloning reaction for each of the four centromeres using linearized pPICH-ADE3 and the two PCR fragments. Plasmids were extracted and analyzed by restriction digestion. Centromeres 1, 2 and 4 were successfully assembled and cloned into the plasmid through this strategy.</p>
<p>Centromere 3 did not yield any <italic>E. coli</italic> clones following the &#x201C;In-Fusion&#x201D; reaction; therefore, we proceeded to an <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly strategy. Primers Cen370-F and Cen3c-R; Cen3c-F and Cen370-R amplified both inverted repeats adding 70 bp of homologous sequences between the fragments and pPICH-ADE3. Finally, we transformed <italic>K. phaffii</italic> LA3 using the linearized vector and both centromeric fragments, using 85 bp of homology for directing recombination. Clones were selected in YPD supplied with zeocin.</p>
<p>The resulting plasmids were named pPICH-CEN1, pPICH-CEN2, pPICH-CEN3 and pPICH-CEN4. All plasmids were transformed into <italic>K. phaffii</italic> LA3 for subsequent stability and quantification assays.</p>

<title>Stability analysis</title>
<p>LA3 strain transformed with each of the four centromeric plasmids was grown in 20 mL YPD for 16 hours at 28&#x00B0;C and 200 rpm. This culture was inoculated to 20 mL YPD to an initial optical density of 0,1. After 24 h of growth under the same conditions the culture was used as inoculum for another flask containing 20 mL YPD to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0,1. This procedure was repeated every 24 h until a total of 144 hours. At 96 and at 144 hours of growth, a small amount of cells was diluted 10<sup>6</sup>-fold and 100 &#x03BC;L of this dilution were plated on YPD. Plates were incubated at 30 &#x00B0;C for 72 h.</p>
