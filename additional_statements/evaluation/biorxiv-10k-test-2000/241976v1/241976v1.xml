<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>Annexins are phospholipid binding proteins that somehow translocate from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to the outer leaflet <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. For example, Annexin A2 is known to localise to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (cell surface) where it is involved in plasminogen activation leading to fibrinolysis and cell migration, among other functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Despite having well described extracellular functions, the mechanism of annexin transport from the cytoplasmic inner leaflet to the extracellular outer leaflet of the plasma membrane remains unclear. As annexin A2 and A5 bind to negatively charged lipid head groups of the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, we hypothesised that lipid remodelling may be involved in their translocation to the cell surface. Here, we show that phospholipid flipping activity is crucial for the transport of annexins A2 and A5 across membranes in cells and in liposomes. The lantibiotic, cinnamycin, which flips lipids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, facilitates the transport of annexin A2 and A5 to the cell surface in many types of human cells. Furthermore, we identified TMEM16F (anoctamin-6) as a lipid scramblase required for transport of these annexins to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This work reveals a mechanism for annexin translocation across membranes which depends on plasma membrane phospholipid flipping. This translocation process may be relevant to many other phospholipid binding proteins in diverse membrane compartments.</p>

<p>To assess the role of lipid remodelling in annexin transport across membranes, we studied the effect of the lipid flipping toxin, cinnamycin, in mammalian cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Cinnamycin is a 19-amino acid lantibiotic that flips phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) from one leaflet of the lipid bilayer to the other, both in liposomes and cell membranes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. We confirmed that cinnamycin can flip lipids in HeLa cells, as measured by the amount of PE and PS on the cell surface determined by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We next treated HeLa cells with cinnamycin for 30 min in serum-free medium, washed the cells with serum-free medium and incubated the cells with EDTA to dissociate all available cell surface annexin A2 and A5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Cinnamycin treatment dramatically increased the amount of annexin A2 and A5 in the EDTA eluate without impacting cell morphology or viability, as shown by microscopy and lactate dehydrogenase activity in the eluate fraction, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref> and Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE1">Fig. 1a-b</xref>). As a negative control, no annexin A2 and A5 was detected in the eluate when cells were incubated in serum-free medium without EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The increase in annexin A2 and A5 on the cell surface in cinnamycin-treated cells was specific, as no cytosolic proteins or transmembrane proteins such as actin, Arf1, Arf6 and transferrin receptor were detected in the eluate fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref> and Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE1">Fig. 1c</xref>). When cinnamycin was used at concentrations that compromised cell membrane integrity, we observed actin release in the eluate fraction (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE1">Fig. 1d</xref>), suggesting that actin in the eluate correlated with cell lysis. Mass spectrometry confirmed that cinnamycin stimulated translocation of annexin A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This phenomenon was not limited to HeLa cells and could be demonstrated in several other lines (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Furthermore, mastoparan X, another lipid-flipping toxin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, caused a similar increase in annexin A2 detectable on the cell surface (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the requirement for lipid flipping activity in annexin translocation to the cell surface, we conducted the assay at 4&#x00B0;C. At this temperature, cinnamycin binds to the membrane but lipid flipping is abrogated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Cinnamycin-mediated annexin A2 translocation to the cell surface was inhibited at 4&#x00B0;C (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE1">Fig. 1g</xref>). To evaluate the importance of annexin A2 lipid binding in the transport process, we analysed the translocation of an annexin A2 mutant (Y23A) which is defective in lipid binding and has a defect in cell surface localisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Cinnamycin was unable to facilitate the translocation of the annexin A2 lipid binding mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Together, these data support a mechanism whereby annexin A2 and A5 are transported to the cell surface by first binding to lipids on the inner leaflet of the membrane before being translocated across to the cell surface during lipid remodelling.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether lipid flipping is the minimal requirement for annexin transport across membranes, we developed an <italic>in-vitro</italic> liposome system using recombinant annexin A5 and cinnamycin. We first confirmed that cinnamycin could flip lipids in liposomes using an assay based on the quenching of NBD-PE by dithionite (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE2">Fig. 2</xref>). Next, liposome binding and sedimentation experiments showed that annexin A5 binds to phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylethanolamine (PC:PE) liposomes in the presence of calcium and can be removed from the membrane by the calcium chelator EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>, lane 1 vs 3). Interestingly, pre-treatment with cinnamycin increased the EGTA-resistant annexin A5 fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>, lane 4). This suggests that annexin A5 was translocated from the outer leaflet of the liposome membrane (surface of the liposome) to the inner leaflet or lumen of the liposome where it was protected from removal by EGTA. To confirm this phenomenon, we used a proteinase K protection assay. Proteinase K is very efficient in cleaving exposed proteins from membrane surfaces <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. PC:PE liposomes were pre-incubated with annexin A5 before incubation with proteinase K, which resulted in digestion of free and surface-bound annexin A5 detected by a dramatic decrease in amount of full-length annexin A5 seen by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>, lane 1 vs 3). A small fraction of full-length annexin A5 and a near full-length cleavage product was also detected; this corresponded to fully-protected and partially membrane-inserted annexin A5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>, lane 3). Protease protection was membrane-dependent, as all available annexin A5 was degraded in the presence of membrane-solubilising detergent (triton) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>, lane 4). Importantly, cinnamycin pre-treatment increased the levels of the full-length annexin A5 and the near full-length cleavage product detectable after proteinase K digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>, lane 5). Therefore, cinnamycin increased the proportion of annexin A5 protected from proteinase K degradation, in agreement with the EGTA assay.</p>

Results are average of duplicate measurements. Similar effects were detected in two independent experiments.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>A similar protection assay was used in combination with a fluorescence quenching assay, allowing a real-time readout for degradation. In this assay, annexin A5 was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules. At high density, the fluorescence of the FITC molecules is quenched due to their close proximity on annexin A5. When proteinase K is added, accessible FITC-annexin A5 is cleaved, allowing the FITC molecules to be spatially separated, triggering an increase in their intrinsic fluorescence (dequenching). Proteinase K-induced FITC-annexin A5 dequenching was unaffected when incubated with cinnamycin then triton without liposomes, or when incubated with PC-only liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref> (i-ii)), as annexin A5 does not bind PC alone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. By contrast, proteinase K-induced FITC-annexin A5 dequenching was reduced when PE-containing liposomes were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c(iii)</xref>). This is consistent with results from the previous protection assay, indicating that there is a fraction of annexin A5 protected from protease cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c(iii)</xref>). Furthermore, in agreement with previous results, PE-containing liposomes pre-treated with cinnamycin exhibited further attenuated FITC dequenching, compared to control/DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c(iii)</xref>). Finally, the addition of triton completely recovered FITC fluorescence in both DMSO and cinnamycin conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c(iii)</xref>). Taken together, these three approaches suggest that lipid flipping induced by cinnamycin facilitates annexin A5 translocation across liposome membranes.</p>
<p>Given that cinnamycin lipid flipping activity is sufficient to translocate annexin across membranes in cells and liposomes, we looked for a mammalian protein that could drive this process in cells. Plasma membrane lipid asymmetry is maintained by transmembrane proteins that flip lipids from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet and vice versa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. One family of proteins with lipid flipping activity are the scramblases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Scramblase activity is calcium-dependent and energy-independent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Scramblase dysfunction results in Scott&#x2019;s syndrome, a mild bleeding disorder resulting from a lack of phosphatidylserine externalisation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Scott&#x2019;s syndrome has been attributed to mutations in the phospholipid scramblase known as TMEM16F (also called anotamin-6) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Due to the importance of TMEM16F lipid flipping activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, we investigated a role for TMEM16F in the translocation of annexin A2 and A5 to the cell surface. Clonal TMEM16F HeLa knockout cell lines were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and matched wild-type controls with no targeting were also isolated (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). We confirmed gene targeting using sequencing and qPCR (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE3">Fig. 3c</xref>). We were unable to measure the protein level of TMEM16F as the few antibodies that we tried did not show specific signals on western blot (data not shown). However, we confirmed a functional defect in lipid flipping in the TMEM16F knockout cell lines by measuring the level of PS on cell surface in cells challenged with ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a(i)</xref>). We treated TMEM16F wild-type or -deficient cells with ionomycin for 10 min at 37&#x00B0;C in the presence of annexin A5-Cy5 and propidium iodide. Cell surface PS (and PE) were analysed by measuring the amount of annexin A5-Cy5 bound to live cells by flow cytometry. TMEM16F-deficient cells were unable to externalise PS in response to an increase in intracellular calcium, whereas wild-type cells and positive matched non-targeted controls showed an increase in the amount of PS on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a(i)</xref> and Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This confirms that TMEM16F activity is abolished in TMEM16F knockout cells. Interestingly, the level of PS (and PE) on the cell surface of TMEM16F deficient cells under unstimulated conditions was also slightly reduced compared to the wild-type and untargeted controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a(ii)</xref> and Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4">Fig. 4b</xref>), showing for the first time that TMEM16F is constitutively active.</p>

<p>To investigate the role of TMEM16F in translocation of annexins, we assessed the level of annexin A2 and A5 on the cell surface of TMEM16F deficient cells. Cells were treated with EDTA to release annexin A2 and A5 and the eluate was assessed by western blot, as described earlier. Strikingly, in both TMEM16F-deficient clones, annexin A2 and A5 were severely reduced in the EDTA eluate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Annexin A2 and A5 were not detected in the serum-free medium (SFM) eluate, and actin and LAMP-2 were absent from all eluates (SFM or EDTA) indicating this was a specific process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). To ensure that the lack of annexin on the cell surface was due to reduced translocation rather than reduced retention at the cell surface, we assessed the level of annexin released into the supernatant over 24 hours. No annexin A2 and A5 were detected in the supernatant from wild-type or TMEM16F-deficient cells (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This demonstrated that annexin A2 and A5 were not translocated and thus present in the medium in TMEM16F-deficient cells (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE4">Fig. 4c</xref>), whereas annexin A2 and A5 are translocated across the membrane in wild-type cells and detectable on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The lack of annexin A2 and A5 on the cell surface in TMEM16F-deficient cells is not due to off-target effects as the phenotype is consistent across both clones targeted with different sgRNAs. Furthermore, the phenotype was normalised when the TMEM16F-deficient cells were reconstituted with mouse, mCherry-tagged TMEM16F (mCherry-mTMEM16F) via lentiviral transduction that restored lipid flipping activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c, d</xref> and Extended Data 5a, b and c). This established that TMEM16F is required for transport of annexin to the cell surface.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that cinnamycin stimulates lipid flipping in a manner comparable to TMEM16F, therefore, we set out to determine if its activity could substitute for TMEM16F. Cells were treated with cinnamycin and the level of PS and PE externalisation was assessed by annexin A5-Cy5 binding to live cells by flow cytometry. Cinnamycin stimulated lipid flipping in both wild-type and TMEM16F-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref> and Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE6">Fig. 6a, b</xref>). Therefore, cinnamycin can be used as a surrogate for TMEM16F lipid flipping activity. TMEM16F-deficient cells treated with DMSO showed reduced annexin A2 and A5 in the EDTA eluate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>), however when treated with cinnamycin there was a significant increase in the amounts of annexin A2 and A5 detectable in the EDTA eluate in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Cinnamycin also increased the level of annexin A2 and A5 on the cell surface in wild-type HeLa, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This demonstrates that lipid flipping activity is sufficient for translocation of annexin A2 and A5 from the cytosol to the cell surface and was not due to a lack of annexin retention at the cell surface as annexin A2 was not present in the medium during cinnamycin treatment as described earlier (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figE6">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we have identified a mechanism for membrane translocation of annexins which is mediated by lipid flipping/remodelling. This process provides an explanation for the longstanding mystery of how some cytoplasmic proteins reach the cell surface independent of conventional secretion or described modes of unconventional secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In cells, this lipid flipping-dependent translocation is primarily mediated by TMEM16F and enables transport of a protein from the inner intracytoplasmic domain of the plasma membrane to the exterior outer leaflet. This transport is ATP-independent and calcium-dependent and does not require the complex translocon-type machinery as seen for conventional trafficking of proteins into the ER or mitochondria.</p></sec>

<sec id="s2e"><title>Preparation of liposomes</title>
<p>Thin films were generated following dissolution of the lipids in a 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol mixture and then dried under a stream of argon gas while they were rotated. The final compositions in mole percentage of the different liposome population were PE-containing liposomes (50&#x0025; DOPE and 50&#x0025; POPC) and PC-containing liposomes (100&#x0025; POPC). The films were lyophilized overnight, and the containers were sealed with argon gas to prevent oxidation and stored at &#x2212;20&#x00B0;C. Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) were generated by solubilising the lipid films with physiologic salt buffer (PSB), composed of 100 mM KOAc, 2 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, using vigorous vortexing. For generation of large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), the films were suspended in PSB and vortexed for 1.5 min. The lipid suspension underwent five cycles of freezing and thawing followed by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes with 1 and 0.1 &#x03BC;m diameter pores (from Avanti Polar Lipids) to create LUV.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2f"><title>Lipid flipping assay in liposomes</title>
<p>The following lipid flipping assay in liposomes is well established, see ref <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Briefly, fluorescent measurements were performed using SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices) in 96-well plates with total reaction volumes of 100 &#x03BC;l at a constant temperature of 37<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>C. Excitation was set on 480nm, and emission was set on 530 nm (NBD fluorescence) with low PMT sensitivity. LUV (PC:PE 1:1, and 0.6&#x0025; NBD-PE) at 500 &#x03BC;M in PSB were pre-incubated with cinnamycin (10 &#x03BC;M) or DMSO, as a control, for 30 min and changes in NBD fluorescence during the experimental period were recorded and the effects of dithionite (3 mM) were assessed. Dithionite reduces the NBD molecules on the head group of the lipids. Because only NBD in the outer membrane leaflet is accessible to react with dithionite, a partial decrease in fluorescence is observed. When the fluorescent system reached a steady-state, a membrane-solubilising detergent (triton 0.5&#x0025;) was added, which exposes the NBD in the inner leaflet and the decrease in NBD fluorescence was assessed. If cinnamycin induces lipid flipping, then there would be a difference in the level of fluorescence (compared to DMSO control) after dithionite treatment, which correlates to the different level of NBD-PE in the outer leaflet.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2g"><title>Annexin A5 liposome binding experiments</title>
<p>MLV suspension (1 mM) was supplemented with CaCl<sub>2</sub> (5 mM) and was incubated with FITC-Annexin A5 (1:7 dilution from stock solution) for 30 min in room temperature to allow Annexin A5 binding to liposomes. Cinnamycin (10 &#x03BC;M) or DMSO was added for a further 40 min incubation at 37&#x00B0;C. Some of the samples were also treated with EGTA (10 mM) for 20 min in in room temperature before all samples were centrifuged (16,000g, 30 min at 4&#x00B0;C). Liposome pellets were mixed with boiling SDS-sample buffer for 1 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes and subjected to western blot analysis with anti-Annexin A5 antibodies for the detection of the membrane-bound fraction of Annexin A5.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2h"><title>Protease protection assay - SDS-PAGE analysis</title>
<p>LUV suspension (100 &#x03BC;M) was supplemented with CaCl<sub>2</sub> (5 mM) and was incubated with FITC-Annexin A5 (1:4.5 dilution from stock solution) for 30 min in room temperature. Cinnamycin (10 &#x03BC;M) or DMSO was added for further 40 min incubation at 37&#x00B0;C. For proteinase K experiments, a stock solution of the protease was freshly prepared by in PSB (10 mg/ml) prior to the experiment and was kept on ice. Proteinase K was added to liposome samples (1:20 dilution from stock solution) and incubation was carried out for further 1 h at 37&#x00B0;C to allow full digestion. For some samples, triton X-100 (0.5&#x0025;) was added together with Proteinase K. We then inactivated the protease by adding a small amount of PMSF (from 0.25 M stock dissolved in DMSO) to the liposome samples, and put this on ice. The proteolysis samples were transferred into boiling SDS sample buffer and immediately pipetted several times. The boiled protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the proteinase K-protected fraction of Annexin A5 was detected by western blot analysis with anti-Annexin A5 antibodies.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2i"><title>Protease protection assay &#x2013; fluorescent measurements</title>
<p>Fluorescent measurements were performed using SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices) in 96-well plates with total reaction volume of 100 &#x03BC;l in constant temperature of 37&#x00B0;C. All measurements were performed in duplicate. Excitation was set on 480nm, and emission was set on 530 nm (detection of FITC fluorescence) with low PMT sensitivity. FITC-Annexin A5 (1:25 dilution from stock solution) was added to LUV suspension (500 &#x03BC;M) supplemented with CaCl<sub>2</sub> (5 mM) and divided in 100 &#x03BC;l samples in a 96-well plate. Cinnamycin (10 &#x03BC;M) or DMSO was added to the plate and FITC fluorescence was recorded every min using the kinetic measurement mode of the instrument. After 40 min, proteinase k was added to the wells for further 50 min incubation and FITC florescence was recorded.

<sec id="s2k"><title>Western blotting</title>
<p>All samples were resolved by 12&#x0025; SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for blotting. Membranes were blocked with 0.05&#x0025; (w/v) skim milk powder in PBS containing 0.1&#x0025; Tween-20 (PBS-Tween) for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were then probed with an appropriate dilution of primary antibody overnight at 4&#x00B0;C. Membranes were washed three times in PBS-Tween before incubation in diluted secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed as before and developed with ECL (Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent RPN2106 for the detection of proteins in the cell lysates or Cyanagen, Westar XLS100 for the detection of proteins in the eluate fractions) using a Bio Rad Chemi Doc XRS system.

PEI (polyethylenimine) was used as transfection reagent. 48h after transfection, cell culture medium was collected and replaced by fresh medium; this step was repeated 2 times at intervals of 24 h. Virus preparations were then combined. Viral particles were added to cells, spin at 1,000g for 30 min and incubated overnight. After 24 h, medium was replaced by full medium and cells were incubated for 5 more days. Transduced cells were selected with puromycin and sorted to enrich mCherry-expressing cells.</p></sec>

<sec id="s2o"><title>TMEM16F CRISPR-mediated gene disruption</title>
<p>TMEM16F was targeted in either exon 2 or exon 3, both of which are conserved across splice variants. TMEM16F specific oligonucleotides (Sigma-Aldrich; table S1) were designed and top and bottom strands were annealed, and then cloned into the Cas9 expression vector pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) (Addgene plasmid &#x0023; 48139) as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Transfected cells were selected with 2.5 &#x03BC;g/ml puromycin for 24 hours. Once recovered, cells were single cell sorted into 96 well plates by FACS. TMEM16F targeting was verified by collecting genomic DNA from clonal lines using QuickExtract DNA extraction solution and the CRISPR/Cas9 targeted region amplified with primers flanking at least 200 base pairs either side of the expected cut site (table S1). PCR products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing and insertions and deletions analysed by using the Tracking of Indels by DEcomposition (TIDE) web tool <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, to analyse insertions and deletions larger than 50 base pairs, the R code was kindly provided by Prof van Steensel. TIDE analysis showed that the expected region had been targeted and each knockout clone was devoid of wild type TMEM16F DNA (Fig. S3A and B). Clonal wild type control lines that had been through transfection, selection and single cell cloning steps, but had not efficiently targeted TMEM16F, were used as matched positive controls for each exon (Fig. S3A and B). Due to the lack of antibodies specific for TMEM16F we were unable to analyse expression at the protein level, therefore, we assessed the mRNA levels which were reduced in TMEM16F knockout cells (Fig. S3C).</p></sec>

<caption><title>Lipid flipping activity of cinnamycin in liposomes</title>
<p>Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) (PC:PE 1:1, and a trace of NBD-PE) were pre-incubated with cinnamycin (10 &#x03BC;M) or DMSO, as a control, for 30 min and changes in NBD fluorescence during the experiment time were recorded. Dithionite (3 mM) was added to the mixture during the experiment. Dithionite reduces the NBD molecules on the head group of the lipids. Because only NBD in the outer membrane leaflet is accessible to react with dithionite, a partial decrease in fluoresce is observed. An additional decrease in fluorescence was detected when membrane-solubilising detergent (triton 0.5&#x0025;) was added, which exposes the NBD in the inner leaflet. Cinnamycin-treated LUV were more susceptible to dithionite-mediated NBD reduction, since some of the NBD-PE in the inner leaflet (which was previously inaccessible to dithionite) was flipped to the outer leaflet by cinnamycin and this fluorescence (which is detectable on both inner and outer leaflets) would have been quenched by the dithionate after flipping to the outer leaflet. Thus, the decrease in fluorescence caused by cinnamycin versus DMSO reflects the amount to NBD-PE that has flipped.</p></caption>
