<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>A new method is described for the seamless assembly of independent, prefabricated and functionally tested blunt-end, double strand nucleic acid <italic><underline>parts</underline></italic> (DNA fragments) into more complex biological <italic><underline>devices</underline></italic> (vectors) and higher order <underline>multi-device <italic>systems</italic>.</underline> Individual <italic>parts</italic> include bacterial selection markers, bacterial origins of replication, promoters from a variety of different species, transcription terminators, shuttle sequences and a variety of &#x201C;N&#x201D; and &#x201C;C&#x201D; terminal solubility/affinity expression tags. Pre-assembly modification of <italic>parts</italic> with DNA modifying enzymes is not required. Seamless assembly of multiple parts is accomplished in a single step using a specialized thermostable enzyme blend in about 30 minutes. Combinatorial assembly of <italic>parts</italic> is an inherent feature of the new process, substantially simplifying <italic>device</italic> and <italic>system</italic> optimization. To underscore the utility of the new process, <italic>parts</italic> were assembled into several protein expression <italic>devices</italic> in order to identify the optimal expression construct for a model target gene, as an example of the utility of the assembly process, and a higher order multi-<italic>device system</italic> is also described, for the over-expression of a four-enzyme bio-synthetic pathway, and optimized for end-product accumulation in <italic>E. coli</italic> as a paradigm for how this assembly process could be used to address the assembly of more complex biological pathways.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The discipline of synthetic biology has greatly benefitted from key enabling technologies such as DNA synthesis and sequencing becoming accessible to more researchers due to the reduction in the previously prohibitive financial entry point. To date however, a third enabling technology, molecular cloning, has not kept pace with technological advances made in DNA synthesis and DNA sequencing. One of the most highly recognized collection of techniques and materials developed to improve conventional cloning of biological <italic>parts</italic>, <italic>devices</italic> and <italic>systems</italic> is &#x201C;BioBricks&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Briefly, the &#x201C;bricks&#x201D;, or <italic>parts,</italic> of this technology represent cloned DNA sequences possessing defined functions, such as antibiotic resistance and ribosome binding sites. <italic>Parts</italic> are assembled to create larger <italic>devices</italic> such as protein expression vectors and several <italic>devices</italic> are joined into a <italic>system</italic> such as a biosynthetic pathway. BioBrick <italic>devices</italic> and <italic>systems</italic> are constructed by &#x201C;hierarchical binary assembly&#x201D; of <italic>parts,</italic> or &#x201C;one-brick-at-a-time.&#x201D; More specifically, BioBrick&#x2019;s represent functional double strand DNA molecules housed within carrier plasmids flanked by universal and precisely defined upstream and downstream sequences that are technically not part of the BioBrick. These universal sequences contain restriction enzyme recognition sites for one of two closely related enzymes, each having slightly different recognition sequences but upon cleavage generate identical termini (isocaudomers). Linking two BioBricks together requires isolation of the individual <italic>parts</italic> from their carrier plasmids by specific isocaudomer(s) digestion, end repair in some cases, ligation and finally bacterial transformation. A major drawback to this technique is that BioBrick <italic>parts</italic> must not contain these restriction enzyme recognition sites within the sequences to be assembled. Also, BioBrick hierarchical binary assembly is time consuming, tedious and not conducive to combinatorial assembly.</p>
<p>Other assembly methods that convert <italic>parts</italic> into <italic>devices</italic> also rely on the isolation of <italic>parts</italic> and <italic>devices</italic> from dedicated BioBrick-like &#x201C;destination vectors&#x201D; (BioBricks [2], SLIC [3], Gibson [4], CPEC [5], SLiCE [6], and In-Fusion [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clontech.com/US/Products/Cloning_and_Competent_Cells/Cloning_Resources/Selec-tion_Guides/In-Fusion_Cloning_Kits">http://www.clontech.com/US/Products/Cloning_and_Competent_Cells/Cloning_Resources/Selec-tion_Guides/In-Fusion_Cloning_Kits</ext-link>]). In other methods, significant <italic>parts</italic> manipulation with either one or more Type-II restriction enzymes is required (GoldenGate [7], MoClo [8], GoldenBraid [9]). Alternatively, <italic>parts</italic> manipulation with T5-exonuclease or a combination of Pfu and Taq DNA polymerases are required for Gibson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and DATEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) assembly methods, respectively, to create overlaps for subsequent annealing and ligation. In summary, assembly methods are complicated when restriction enzyme specificity must be considered at each stage of <italic>parts</italic> and <italic>devices</italic> design. Also, creating small <italic>parts</italic> between 50 and 250 base pairs with one or more enzymes possessing exonuclease activity is difficult due to the propensity of these enzymes to completely degrade the <italic>parts</italic>. It is apparent that these limitations curtail combinatorial experimental design and significantly slow the process of identifying optimal <italic>devices</italic> and <italic>systems</italic>.</p>
<p>Providing prefabricated and functionally validated <italic>parts</italic> to researchers without the need for retrieval from destination vectors, combined with a seamless protocol conducive to combinatorial assembly of <italic>parts</italic> into <italic>devices</italic> and higher order <italic>systems,</italic> would represent a significant improvement in synthetic biology molecular cloning. This paper describes such a system. Prefabricated <italic>parts</italic> are provided such that a wide variety of <italic>devices</italic> can be rapidly assembled. Appropriately chosen <italic>parts</italic> are combined and assembled in a single-tube reaction creating molecules that transform/transfect and properly function as <italic>devices</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic>, mammalian and yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) cells. Multiple assembles can be performed in parallel to generate a collection of unique <italic>devices</italic> that can be used in combination to optimize novel biological <italic>systems</italic>. The utility of this technology, referred to as &#x201C;SureVector&#x201D; (SV), was validated by assembling <italic>parts</italic> into a collection of <italic>devices</italic> (plasmids) in order to perform a protein expression screen to identify the best expression tag combination for a model gene of interest (GOI). To further demonstrate the applicability of the SV process, a multi-<italic>device system</italic> was designed and constructed to reconstitute a four-enzyme biosynthetic pathway in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This multi-<italic>device system</italic> enabled the identification of several over-expressing bacterial clones within one week.</p>

<sec id="s2a"><title>SureVector (SV) P<italic>arts</italic></title>
<p>SureVector <italic>parts</italic> include bacterial origins of replication [OR], bacterial selectable markers [SM], XP-1 and XP-2 referred to as &#x201C;Expansion <italic>parts</italic>&#x201C; containing sequences allowing replication and selection in a variety of organisms (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and mammalian cells; defined in more detail below), promoters [P] (<italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and mammalian), and protein expression tags [T] (both C-terminal and N-terminal tags are available). Each <italic>part</italic> is flanked by unique 30 base pair (bp) sequences not found in any global DNA databases, such as NCBI&#x2019;s Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST <underline>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>),</underline> and allow specific assembly of <italic>parts</italic> into <italic>devices</italic> (example shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and ultimately <italic>systems</italic>.

<sec id="s2b"><title>XP1 and XP2 Expansion <italic>Parts</italic></title>
<p>XP1 <italic>parts</italic> contain either the yeast autonomous replication sequence (yARS or 2-micron circle) allowing plasmid replication in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> or a linker derived from a unique nucleotide sequence not possessing a function other than to tether a chosen bacterial origin of replication to an XP2 fragments during <italic>parts</italic> assembly.</p>
<p>The XP2 <italic>parts</italic> include either a non-functional tether sequence, as above, or the lacI repressor found in <italic>E. coli</italic>, or mammalian selection markers or yeast auxotrophic markers, allowing yeast to grow in the absence of an essential amino acid. XP2 <italic>parts</italic> designed specifically for use in mammalian cells include blasticidin, puromycin or hygromycin selection markers. For yeast, XP2 <italic>parts</italic> include the auxotrophic markers URA3 and HIS3 and the selection marker for hygromycin resistance. XP2 <italic>parts</italic> also contain a transcription terminator; either the bovine growth hormone polyA signal (bGH pA) specific for mammalian cells or a rho independent terminator for bacterial transcripts provided by the strong hairpin forming sequence (5&#x2019;- GCCGCCAGCGGAACTGGCGGC-3&#x2019;). These terminator sequences are positioned and oriented within the XP2 <italic>part</italic> to terminate transcripts from an upstream GOI.</p>

<sec id="s2c"><title>Large Scale Production and Purification of SV <italic>Parts</italic></title>
<p>Large scale <italic>parts</italic> synthesis was performed by PCR in 96-well plates using sequence verified master plasmid templates. Each reaction contained 1 ng of plasmid template, 1x Herculase II reaction buffer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.), 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 0.4 &#x00B5;M of each PCR primer and 2 &#x00B5;l of pre-formulated Herculase II enzyme (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 100 &#x00B5;L. Thermocycling conditions were: 1 cycle at 95 &#x00B0;C for 2 min.; 30 cycles at 95 &#x00B0;C for 20 sec., 55 &#x00B0;C for 20 sec. and 72 &#x00B0;C for 30 sec.; 1 cycle at 72 &#x00B0;C for 3 min. Contents of multiple 96-well plates for each SV <italic>part</italic> were pooled and purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions (Beckman-Coulter). Correct lengths and purities of SV <italic>parts</italic> were assessed with an Agilent Technologies, Inc. BioAnalyzer.</p>

<sec id="s2d"><title>General Assembly of SV <italic>Parts</italic> into <italic>Devices</italic></title>
<p>SV <italic>parts</italic> designed to assemble into a desired <italic>device</italic> were combined with a SV adapted GOI part and other reaction components were added as follows: 1x SureVector reaction buffer, 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 5.0 nM of each <italic>part</italic> (e.g. SM &#x002B; OR &#x002B; XP1 &#x002B; XP2 &#x002B; T &#x002B; GOI &#x002B; P) and 1 &#x00B5;L of pre-formulated enzyme in a final volume of 20 &#x00B5;L. Thermocycling of these components consisted of 1 cycle at 95 &#x00B0;C for 2 min.; 8 cycles at 95 &#x00B0;C for 20 sec., 55 &#x00B0;C for 20 sec. and 68 &#x00B0;C for 30 sec.; 1 cycle at 68 &#x00B0;C for 3 min. Following thermocycling, one unit of <italic>Dpn</italic> I restriction enzyme was added to the reaction and incubated for 5 minutes at 37 &#x00B0;C. One &#x00B5;L of the reaction was transformed into XL1-Blue Supercompetent <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) according to instructions and varying amounts (10, 20 and 50 &#x00B5;L) of the transformation mixtures were spread onto LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic and incubated at 37 &#x00B0;C until colonies were easily visualized (12 &#x2013; 16 hrs.). <italic>Device</italic> DNA was purified from select C-terminal reverse primer: colonies and either analyzed by restriction digestion, or sequenced to verify correct <italic>parts</italic> assembly, or used directly in downstream processes.</p>

<sec id="s2e"><title>SV <italic>Parts</italic> Assembly into Nedd5 Protein Expression <italic>Devices</italic></title>
<p>To demonstrate an obvious use of the new SV cloning method, the human Nedd5 gene was chosen as a model GOI for performing an expression screening experiment. Nedd5 is a mammalian septin known to associate with actin-based structures such as the contractile ring and stress fibers and is involved in the process of cytokinesis in human brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), although the specific nature of Nedd5 is not pertinent to this paper. The Nedd5 gene containing a start and a stop codon was adapted by PCR to be SV compatible by using the primers listed below:</p>
<p>N-terminal forward primer 5&#x2019;- <underline>GGTGGCGGAGGTTCTGGAGGCGGTGGAAGT<bold><italic>A</italic></bold></underline> <bold><italic>TG</italic></bold>GGATCCATGTCTAAGCAACAACCAACTC-3&#x2019; and N-terminal reverse primer 5&#x2019;-<underline>TCGAGGAGATATTGTACACTAAACCAAATG</underline><bold><italic>TCA</italic></bold>CACATGCTGCCCGAGAGCCCCGCTGTCAC-3&#x2019;.</p>
<p>The Nedd5 gene containing a start codon but lacking a stop codon was adapted by PCR to be SV compatible by using the following primers:</p>
<p>C-terminal forward primer:</p>
<p>5&#x2019;- <underline>CCTTGTTTAAACTTTAAGAGGAGGGCCACC</underline><bold><italic>ATG</italic></bold>GGATCCATGTCTAAGCAACAACCAACTC-3&#x2019; and</p>
<p>C-terminal forward primer:</p>
<p>5&#x2019;-<underline>CCACCGCCTCCAGAACCTCCGCCACCCACA</underline>TGCTGCCCGAGAGCCCCGCTGTCACTGTCAC-3&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Primers show the start codon or stop codon in bold-italicized type and all primers include unique 30 bases [underlined] for assembly with adjacent <italic>parts</italic>. The resulting Nedd5 PCR products were used as the model GOI and assembled into a variety of twelve expression constructs each containing a different C- or N-terminal expression tag. The following <italic>parts</italic> were used in these assemblies: Amp [SM] &#x002B; pBR322 [OR] &#x002B; XP-1 linker &#x002B; XP-2 <italic>lacI</italic> &#x002B; Nedd5 [GOI] with either C-terminal Tags[T] (c-Myc, thioredoxin, streptavidin binding protein, calmodulin binding protein, His6 or hemagglutinin) or N-terminal tags (GST, MBP, His6, SBP, CBP, or HisDbsA, calmodulin binding protein or hemagglutinin) &#x002B; pTac [P] (Refer to section entitled &#x201C;General assembly of SV <italic>parts</italic> into <italic>devices</italic>&#x201C;).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f"><title>SV Nedd5 Expression <italic>Devices</italic> Screening</title>
<p>Nedd5 clones with different expression tags were cultured overnight at 37&#x00B0;C with shaking at 250 rpm in 1 ml of LB broth containing ampicillin (50 &#x00B5;g/ml). The following day, 10 ml cultures of LB broth containing ampicillin (50 &#x00B5;g/ml) were inoculated with these clones and incubated at 37&#x00B0;C with shaking at 250 rpm until the OD<sub>600</sub>, a measure of bacterial growth, reached 0.6 (approximately 1 hour). Protein expression from the P<sub>Tac</sub> promoter was induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM followed by incubation for 20 hours at 30&#x00B0;C with shaking at 250 rpm. Volumes of cells equal to OD<sub>600</sub> of 3.0 were removed from each culture at time zero (uninduced samples) and after 20 hours of incubation (induced samples). The samples were then centrifuged and cell pellets resuspended in 120 &#x00B5;l of 8M urea. The mixtures were vortexed well and incubated at 75&#x00B0;C for 5 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged and supernatants analyzed for Nedd5 expression by SDS-gel electrophoresis.</p>

<p>Two sets of bi-cistronic <italic>devices</italic> were designed and assembled, one containing the ribA and ribD genes and the other containing the ribB and ribE genes. A ribosome binding site (RBS) was included in the 3&#x2019; region of the ribA and ribB genes downstream of their native stop codon and the same sequence was also included in the 5&#x2019; region upstream of the ATG start codon of the ribD and ribE genes. This RBS sequence was used as the overlap by which the ribD and ribE genes were positioned downstream of ribA and ribB genes, respectively. The intended outcome was to place two rib genes under control of one promoter and couple expression of the upstream and downstream rib genes via a second RBS between the two rib genes. This was done to attempt to balance expression levels of the individual rib genes. This second RBS overlap region between the rib genes was designed in such a way that the downstream rib gene was not in the same reading frame as the upstream rib gene thus preventing two gene products in the same <italic>device</italic> from becoming physically linked. An additional stop codon was also added to each upstream rib gene to further guard against translation read-through. Bi-cistronic vectors of this type have been used previously for preparation of nuclear receptor partners RAR and RXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) and for the analysis of NF&#x03A6;B p50/p65 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). <italic>Devices</italic> lacking either the upstream or downstream rib gene <italic>parts</italic> were correctly assembled into circular molecules using 90 bp N-terminal and C-terminal &#x201C;Non-Coding&#x201D; linker <italic>parts</italic> NC-N and NC-C, respectively, and were made by overlap extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>):</p>

<p>Bi-cistronic <italic>devices</italic> that only contain a single rib gene required either a NC-N or NC-C <italic>part</italic> in lieu of the corresponding rib gene <italic>part</italic>. Three standard <italic>parts</italic> were used in both sets of rib <italic>devices</italic>; the T7 promoter-HIS6, XP1 linker and XP2 lacI. These 3 standard <italic>parts</italic> were used in various combinations with either the ampicillin or kanamycin selectable markers and the pBR322 or p15a bacterial origins of replication. Therefore, all SV rib <italic>devices</italic> were assembled from just seven SV <italic>parts.</italic> A total of 18 <italic>device</italic> level plasmids were constructed.

<sec id="s2h"><title>Validation of DMRL <italic>System</italic> Synthesis - Assay, Purification and MS Analysis</title>
<p>Monitoring clones for DMRL synthesis on agar plates was straightforward as the DMRL fluoresces within colonies and is secreted into the surrounding media creating fluorescent halos around DMRL positive colonies. DMRL production from clones cultured in liquid media was also straightforward as the compound possesses a characteristic visible light absorption spectrum with &#x03BB; max OD<sub>490</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) that can be measured in cell free supernatants. Validation of DMRL synthesis required its production, purification and analytical characterization. Clone K6A7 produced pronounced fluorescent colony-halos and was chosen for this purpose. A single colony was inoculated into 3 ml of LB-kan-amp liquid media and incubated overnight at 37&#x00B0;C with shaking at 250 rpm. A 2.0 ml sample of this culture was inoculated into a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of LB-kan-amp and incubation continued as before until the OD<sub>600</sub> value reached 0.35. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and incubation continued for an additional 18 hours. Cells were removed by centrifugation and acetic acid added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 5&#x0025;. This sample was applied to a 2.5 &#x00D7; 3.5 cm column of Florisil (Sigma-Aldrich) equilibrated with 5&#x0025; acetic acid. The column was washed with one liter of 5&#x0025; acetic acid and DMRL eluted with 100 ml of 3&#x0025; pyridine. Solvent was removed by evaporation and the residue suspended in 5 ml of water. This sample was applied to a 2.5 &#x00D7; 35 cm column of chromatography grade cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) equilibrated with water and DMRL was eluted with water. Forty milligrams of DMRL were recovered from 0.8g of cells (wet weight) and was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The sample was run on an Agilent 6538 QTOF coupled to an Agilent 1100/1200 lc stack. The column was a Zorbax SB-C18 0.5 &#x00D7; 150 mm. Flowrate = 20&#x00B5;l/min. Injection volume = 5&#x00B5;l. Solvent A was H<sub>2</sub>O &#x2013; 0.1&#x0025; formic acid and solvent B was acetonitrile &#x2013; 0.1&#x0025; formic acid.

For the ms run, a range from m/z = 85 to m/z = 1100 was scanned. For the ms/ms run, m/z 327.1 was targeted, with three different collision energies: ce = 10V, ce = 20V, and ce = 40V.</p>

<sec id="s3c"><title>Re-Creating a Biosynthetic Pathway</title>
<p>The utility of SV <italic>parts</italic> assembly into <italic>devices</italic> and ultimately higher order <italic>systems</italic> was demonstrated by recreating the <italic>E. coli</italic> biosynthetic pathway for 6,7-<underline>d</underline>i<underline>m</underline>ethy-8-ribityl<underline>l</underline>umazine (DMRL), the fluorescent precursor to riboflavin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; 16). DMRL is synthesized by four unique enzymes (expressed from ribA, ribB, ridD and ribE genes) and substrates. The critical initial substrates for this pathway are GTP and ribulose-5&#x2019;-phosphate (R5P). They are funneled through a &#x201C;nucleotide conversion route&#x201D; (NCR), a &#x201C;sugar conversion route&#x201D; (SCR) and a &#x201C;converging condensation route&#x201D; (CCR). The NCR starts by the hydrolytic removal of carbon atom 8 from the imidazole ring of GTP by GTP Cyclohydrolase II (ribA gene product; 17) yielding 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone-5&#x2019;-phosphate (DARPP). DARPP is converted to 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione-5&#x2019;-phosphate (ARPP) by diaminohydroxyphosphoribosylaminopyrimidine deaminase/5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione reductase (ribD gene product; 18, 19), a &#x201C;fused&#x201D; enzyme possessing both NCR and SCR-relevant activities. As the enzyme name describes, the nucleotide base of DARPP is deaminated followed by reduction of the ribosyl moiety to ribityl with NADPH serving as reductant. Separately, L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase, an enzyme exclusively in the SCR (ribB gene product; 20) converts ribulose-5&#x2019;-phosphate (R-5-P) to L-3,4- dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate (DHBP) and formate. Both ARPP and DHBP are dephosphorylated and enter the CCR via DMRL synthase (ribE gene product; 21) resulting in DMRL.

<sec id="s3d"><title>Pathway Construction</title>
<p>DMRL pathway construction was accomplished by first assembling SV <italic>parts</italic> into <italic>devices</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) containing zero, one and two (&#x201C;bi-cistronic&#x201D;) rib genes. PCR primers used to amplify rib gene <italic>parts</italic> A, B, D and E are shown in Materials and Methods. They allowed amplification of rib open reading frames ribA &#x2013; 591 bp, ribB &#x2013; 654 bp, ribD &#x2013; 1104 bp and ribE - 471 bp with appended correct overlaps to make them SV compatible. Two sets of bi-cistronic <italic>devices</italic>, one containing the ribA and ribD genes and the other containing the ribB and ribE genes were also designed and assembled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Ribosome binding sites (RBS) were designed and incorporated into the 3&#x2019;and 5&#x2019; flanking regions of the rib genes and subsequently used as unique overlaps between the genes such that ribD and ribE genes were positioned downstream of the ribA and ribB genes, respectively. The intended outcome of placing two rib genes under control of one T7 promoter and coupling expression of the upstream and downstream rib genes was balanced expression levels. The RBS placed in the 5&#x2019; regions of both ribD and ribE genes promoted downstream rib gene translation efficiency. The RBS overlap between the upstream and downstream rib genes was designed so that the downstream rib genes were out of frame with the upstream rib genes thus preventing two gene products in the same <italic>device</italic> from becoming physically linked. An additional stop codon was also added to each upstream rib gene as an added prevention to translation read-through. Bi-cistronic <italic>devices</italic> of this type have been used previously for preparation of nuclear receptor partners RAR and RXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and for the analysis of NF&#x03A6;B p50/p65 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). SV <italic>devices</italic> lacking one or both rib genes were also assembled using N-terminal and C-terminal &#x201C;Non-Coding&#x201D; <italic>parts</italic>; NC-N and NC-C, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Zero or single rib gene control <italic>devices</italic> required either an NC-N or NC-C <italic>part</italic>, or both in the case of the double negative control, in lieu of a rib gene <italic>part</italic>. Common SV <italic>parts</italic> used in both sets of rib <italic>devices</italic> were the T7 promoter-HIS<sub>6</sub>, XP1 linker and XP2 lacI (allowing IPTG induction of rib gene <italic>devices</italic> expression) in addition to various combinations of ampicillin and kanamycin selectable markers with pBR322 or p15a bacterial origins of replication. Therefore, all 18 SV rib <italic>device</italic> plasmids were assembled from just 7 seven SV <italic>parts</italic>, not including the rib gene <italic>parts</italic>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> <italic>devices</italic> were transformed either individually or in various co-transformation scenarios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) into Agilent BL21(Gold) DE3 <italic>E. coli</italic> and spread onto LB- agar plates containing 100 &#x00B5;g/ml each of kanamycin and ampicillin (LB-kan-amp) plus 0.5 mM IPTG.

Expression screening was initiated the following day and positive <italic>systems</italic> were selected for structural and functional testing in less than one week. While assembled <italic>devices</italic> were being sequenced for validation of their structural integrity, DMRL was purified and characterized by mass spectrometry. Experiments were also performed to determine optimal DMRL synthesis rates and maximum production. The same type of project out sourced to a third-party vendor would have taken several months to complete (previous experience). While optimizing DMRL production was not the goal of these experiments, it is worth noting that 40 mg of DMRL was purified from 100 ml of media collected after growth of 0.8 g (wet weight) of <italic>E. coli</italic> clone K6A7. In stark contrast, Maley and Plaut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) required 5 kg of the mold <italic>A. gossypii</italic> to obtain 160 mg of DMRL.</p>
<p>The combinatorial power, simplicity and assembly accuracy of the SureVector process will facilitate building many &#x201C;multi-device&#x201D; <italic>systems</italic> including unique biochemical synthetic pathways and novel regulatory circuits. Production of fine chemical intermediates and end-products represents an obvious high-value application.</p></sec>
