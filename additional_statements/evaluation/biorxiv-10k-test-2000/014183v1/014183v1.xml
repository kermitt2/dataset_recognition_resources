                <title>Abstract</title>
                <p>We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the determinants of human influenza A H3
                    hemagglutinin evolution, considering three distinct predictors of evolutionary variation at
                    individual sites: solvent accessibility (as a proxy for protein fold stability and/or conservation),
                    experimental epitope sites (as a proxy for host immune bias), and proximity to the receptor-binding
                    region (as a proxy for protein function). We have found that these three predictors individually
                    explain approximately 15&#x0025; of the variation in site-wise <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>
                        dS</italic>. However, the solvent accessibility and proximity predictors seem largely
                    independent of each other, while the epitope sites are not. In combination, solvent accessibility
                    and proximity explain 32&#x0025; of the variation in <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic>.
                    Incorporating experimental epitope sites into the model adds only an additional 2 percentage points.
                    We have also found that the historical H3 epitope sites, which date back to the 1980s and 1990s,
                    show only weak overlap with the latest experimental epitope data, and we have defined a novel set of
                    four epitope groups which are experimentally supported and cluster in 3D space. Finally, sites with
                    dN/dS > 1, i.e., the sites most likely driving seasonal immune escape, are not correctly predicted
                    by either historical or experimental epitope sites, but only by proximity to the receptor-binding
                    region. In summary, proximity to the receptor-binding region, rather than host immune bias, seems to
                    be the primary determinant of H3 immune-escape evolution.

                    <p>The influenza virus is one of the most rapidly evolving human viruses. Every year, it accumulates
                        mutations that allow it to evade the immune response of people previously infected. Which sites
                        in the virus&#x2019; genome allow this immune escape is not entirely understood, but
                        conventional wisdom states that specific &#x201C;immune epitope sites&#x201D; in the protein
                        hemagglutinin are primarily responsible, and these sites are commonly targeted by vaccine
                        development efforts. Here, we survey all available experimental data on immune epitopes in
                        hemagglutinin, and we demonstrate that these immune epitope sites may not be that crucial for
                        influenza evolution. Instead, we propose and find evidence for a simple geometrical model: sites
                        that are closest to the location where the virus binds the human receptor (i.e, the furthest
                        away from the viral surface) are the primary driver of immune escape.

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The influenza virus causes one of the most common infections in the human population. The success of
                influenza is largely driven by the virus&#x2019;s ability to rapidly adapt to its host and escape host
                immunity. The antibody response to influenza virus is determined by the surface proteins hemagglutinin
                (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Among these two proteins, hemagglutinin, the viral protein responsible for
                receptor-binding and uptake, is a major driver of host immune escape by the virus. Previous work on
                hemagglutinin evolution has shown that the protein evolves episodically [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">
                    1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During most flu seasons, hemagglutinin
                experiences mostly neutral drift around the center of an antigenic sequence cluster; in those seasons,
                it can be neutralized by similar though not identical antibodies, and all of the strains lie near each
                other in antigenic space [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">
                    7</xref>]. After several seasons in a cluster, the virus escapes its local sequence cluster to
                establish a new center in antigenic space [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c9"
                                                                                                                ref-type="bibr">
                    9</xref>].
            </p>
            <p>There is a long tradition of research aimed at identifying the regions of hemagglutinin to which the
                human immune system responds, and by proxy, the sites that determine sequence-cluster transitions [<xref
                        rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c10"
                                                                                                        ref-type="bibr">
                    10</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Initial attempts to identify and
                categorize immune-epitope sites of H3 hemagglutinin were primarily sequence-based and focused on
                substitutions that took place between 1968, the emergence of the Hong Kong H3N2 strain, and 1977 [<xref
                        rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Those early
                studies used the contemporaneously solved protein crystal structure, a very small set of mouse
                monoclonal antibodies, and largely depended on chemical intuition to identify antigenically relevant
                amino-acid changes in the mature protein. Many of the sites identified in those studies reappeared
                nearly two decades later, in 1999, as putative epitope sites with no additional citations linking them
                to immune data [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Those sites and their groupings are still
                considered the canonical immune epitope set today [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref
                        rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While the limitations of experimental techniques and of
                available sequence data in the early 1980&#x2019;s made it necessary to form hypotheses based on
                chemical intuition, these limitations have been overcome through recent advances in experimental
                techniques and wide-spread sequencing of viral genomes. Therefore, it is time to revisit the question of
                which sites in influenza hemagglutinin are epitope sites. In particular, since the original epitope set
                was identified via sequence analysis, we do not even know whether <italic>bona-fide</italic> immune-epitope
                sites actually exist, i.e., sites which represent a measurable bias in the host immune response. And
                even if such sites do exist, we do not know to what extent the bias in host immune response can be
                quantified with the available biochemical assays. Finally, assuming that immune-epitope sites exist and
                can be experimentally identified, it is possible that they do not experience an elevated selective
                pressure to change amino acids relative to other important sites in the protein.
            </p>
            <p>Some recent studies have begun to address these questions indirectly, via evolutionary analysis. For
                example, over the last two decades, virtually every major study on positive selection in hemagglutinin
                has found some but never all of the historical epitope sites to be under positive selection [<xref
                        rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c18"
                                                                                                          ref-type="bibr">

                Furthermore, each of these studies has found a set of sites that are under positive selection but do not
                belong to any historical epitope. Finally, because every study identifies slightly different sites,
                there seems to be no broad agreement on which sites are under positive selection [<xref rid="c12"
                                                                                                        ref-type="bibr">
                    12</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref
                        rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The sites found by disparate techniques are similar but
                they are never identical.
            </p>
            <p>To dissect the determinants of hemagglutinin evolution and the evidence for epitopes, we linked several
                predictors, including relative solvent accessibility, the inverse distance from the receptor-binding
                region, and experimental immune epitope data, to site-wise evolutionary rates calculated from all of the
                human H3N2 sequence data for the last 22 seasons (1991&#x2013;2014). We found that the inverse distance
                from the sialic acid-binding region explained the largest portion of evolutionary rate variation.
                Moreover, we analyzed all of the available H3 experimental epitope data, and we found that experimental
                data supports redefining and regrouping immune epitope sites for hemagglutinin. After controlling for
                biophysical constraints with relative solvent accessibility, function with distance to the
                receptor-binding region, and immune bias with experimental epitope data, the remaining explanatory power
                of historical categories was relatively low. Finally, by explicitly accounting for each constraint we
                found that we could predict nearly 35&#x0025; of the evolutionary rate variation in hemagglutinin,
                nearly twice as much variation as could be explained by earlier models.

                <p>Our overarching goal in this study was to dissect the factors that determine selective pressures at
                    individual sites in influenza hemagglutinin H3. In particular, we wanted to identify specific
                    biophysical or biochemical properties of the mature protein that determine whether a given site will
                    evolve rapidly or not. As a measure of evolutionary variation and selective pressure, we used the
                    metric <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic>. <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> can measure
                    both the amount of purifying selection acting on a site (when <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS
                    </italic> &#x226A; 1 at that site) and the amount of positive diversifying selection acting on a
                    site (when <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> &#x2273; 1). For simplicity, we will refer
                    to <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> as an <italic>evolutionary rate</italic>, even though
                    technically it is a <italic>relative</italic> evolutionary rate or evolutionary-rate ratio. We built
                    an alignment of 3854 full-length H3 sequences spanning 22 seasons, from 1991/92 to 2013/14. We
                    subsequently calculated <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> at each site, using a fixed-effects
                    likelihood (FEL) model as implemented in the software HyPhy [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">

                <p>Although a number of predictors of site-specific evolutionary rate variation have been developed
                    previously [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">
                        20</xref>,<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">
                        29</xref>] (see Ref. [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] for a recent review), none
                    describe a functional constraint on the evolution of viral proteins. In addition, they generally all
                    predict the amount of purifying selection expected at sites, and therefore they cannot identify
                    sites under positive diversifying selection. Moreover, the short divergence time of viruses causes
                    the systematic biophysical pressures that predict much of eukaryotic protein evolution to be much
                    less dominant in viral evolution [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, we set out to
                    find a constraint on hemagglutinin evolution that was related to the protein&#x2019;s role in viral
                    binding and fusion. A few earlier studies had shown that sites near the sialic acid-binding region
                    of hemagglutinin tend to evolve more rapidly than the average for the protein [<xref rid="c4"
                                                                                                         ref-type="bibr">

                    Furthermore, when mapping evolutionary rates onto the hemagglutinin structure, we noticed that the
                    density of rapidly evolving sites seemed to increase somewhat towards the receptor-binding region
                    (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Therefore, as the primary function of
                    hemagglutinin is to bind to sialic acid and induce influenza uptake, we reasoned that distance from
                    the receptor-binding region of HA might serve as a predictor of functionally driven HA evolution. We
                    calculated distances from the sialic acid-binding region (defined as the distance from site 224 in
                    HA), and correlated these distances with the evolutionary rates at all sites. We found that distance
                    from the receptor-binding region was a strong predictor of evolutionary rate variation in
                    hemagglutinin (Pearson correlation <italic>r</italic> = 0.41, <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 10<sup>

                            colors represent negative correlations. Thus, distances from sites that are redder are
                            better positive predictors of the evolutionary rates in the protein than are distances from
                            bluer sites; distances from blue sites are actually anti-correlated with evolutionary rate.
                            Distances from sites that are colored green have essentially no predictive ability.

                <p>Next, we wanted to verify that this correlation was representative of hemagglutinin evolution and not
                    just an artifact of the specific site chosen as the reference point in the distance calculations. It
                    would be possible, for example, that distances to several spatially separated reference sites all
                    resulted in similarly strong correlations. We addressed this question systematically by making, in
                    turn, each individual site in HA the reference site, calculating distances from that site to all
                    other sites, and correlating these distances with evolutionary rate. We then mapped these
                    correlations onto the structure of hemagglutinin, coloring each site according to the strength of
                    the correlation we obtained when we used that site as reference in the distance calculation (<xref
                            rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We obtained a clean, gradient-like pattern: The
                    correlations were highest when we calculated distances relative to sites near the receptor-binding
                    site, and they continuously declined and then turned negative the further we moved the reference
                    site away from the apical region of hemagglutinin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).
                    This result was in stark contrast to the pattern we had previously observed when mapping
                    evolutionary rate directly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In that earlier case,
                    while there was a perceptible preference of faster evolving sites to fall near the receptor-binding
                    site, the overall distribution of evolutionary rates along the structure looked mostly random to the
                    naked eye.
                </p>
                <p>We thus found a geometrical, distance-based constraint on hemagglutinin evolution: Sites evolve the
                    faster the closer they lie towards the receptor-binding region. This implies that antibody
                    inhibition of viral entry decreases the further an antibody binds from the receptor-binding region.
                    After finding a control for this functional constraint, we next analyzed intrinsic immune bias via
                    experimental immune epitope data.

                <title>Comparing historical epitope groups to experimental immune epitope data</title>
                <p>We asked whether there is experimental evidence that the human immune system displays a bias towards
                    particular regions of hemagglutinin; such a bias would traditionally be called an immune epitope. We
                    obtained all available human and non-human B cell epitopes for H3 hemagglutinin from the Influenza
                    Research Database (IRD). In the database, there were two types of B cell epitopes available for
                    hemagglutinin: linear and non-linear. For humans, there were 31 separate epitope entries consisting
                    of 26 non-linear and 5 linear. For non-humans, there were 134 available epitope entries consisting
                    of 47 non-linear and 87 linear. Most of the non-human, non-linear epitopes contained only a single
                    site; we considered these uninformative and therefore dropped the non-human, non-linear epitopes
                    from further analysis. The human non-linear epitopes were provided as site numbers, so that mapping
                    them onto the protein structure was trivial. By contrast, all linear epitopes were given as short
                    peptide sequences with fewer than 40 amino acids per peptide. We mapped the linear epitopes onto the
                    protein structure by jointly aligning the peptide sequences and the complete set of 3854 protein
                    sequences used for evolutionary-rate calculations. Each linear epitope aligned without gaps to a
                    particular segment of the full protein. The 5 linear human epitopes turned out to be a subset of the
                    87 non-human linear epitopes, and we therefore dropped the linear human epitopes from further
                    analysis.
                </p>
                <p>For both linear and non-linear epitope data, we counted for each site in hemagglutinin how often it
                    appeared in each epitope data set. We then compared these epitope counts to the historical epitope
                    sites (Bush 1999, Ref. [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). We first considered the human,
                    non-linear epitope data. We found some overlap between the historical sites and the experimental
                    non-linear epitope counts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Each of the four largest
                    peaks (i.e., the four regions with strongest experimental evidence of belonging to epitopes) was at
                    least partially captured by the historical epitope groups. The majority of historical epitopes A and
                    B were represented in the non-linear epitope data; A had 16 of 19 sites appear in the experimental
                    data and epitope B had 13 of 22. By contrast, many of the historical sites had no experimental
                    support among the available non-linear epitope data. Of 131 historical epitope sites, only 52
                    appeared at least once in the experimental data set. Historical epitopes C, D, and E were
                    particularly poorly represented as a fraction of their size, with only 8 of 27, 13 of 41, and 2 of
                    22 sites having experimental support, respectively. Among the discrepancies between historical and
                    experimental immune epitopes, an important deviation came from the HA2 chain. By historical
                    convention, no sites from HA2 were included among the hemagglutinin epitopes; as a result, there
                    were a large number of sites appearing in the experimental set that were not defined as historical
                    epitopes.

                <p>To understand to what extent the experimental non-linear epitope sites separated into distinct
                    groups, we performed a clustering analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We
                    considered all sites in the experimental epitope dataset as nodes of a graph, and we drew an edge
                    between any two sites that appeared within the same accession number of the immune epitope database
                    (IEDB). Then, we colored the nodes according to their classification in the historical epitope
                    groups. We found that the non-linear experimental epitope data was able to partially reconstruct the
                    historical epitope groups. In particular, historical epitopes A, B, and D clustered well, with only
                    two sites from A and one site from D being completely disconnected from the rest of the epitope. By
                    contrast, epitopes C and E did not at all recapitulate any experimental data. In addition, as
                    previously shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, there was a relatively large
                    number of experimental epitope sites that were not accounted for by the historical epitope

                            by binding the same set of antibodies are also spatially connected. The only exception is

                    . We then constructed a graph where we connected any two nodes in the non-linear experimental
                    epitope data set with an edge if the two corresponding sites were less than 10 A apart in the 3D
                    structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Again, we colored the nodes by their
                    historical groupings. For these spatial clusters, the historical epitopes were poorly grouped within
                    the non-linear epitope data. All historical epitopes fell into at least two disjoint sets separated
                    by sites not belonging to the same epitope, and no single visible spatial cluster corresponded to a
                    single historical epitope. We concluded that the historical epitope definitions largely failed to
                    spatially cluster within the sites for which we had experimental immune epitope data.
                </p>
                <p>We next considered experimental non-human linear epitopes. By contrast to the non-linear epitopes,
                    the linear epitope set covered nearly every site in the entire hemagglutinin protein (<xref
                            rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). However, the most represented sites in the
                    experimental epitope dataset (near site 100) were almost completely missed by the historical epitope
                    sites. Furthermore, there was a substantial portion of experimental sites near the N-terminal region
                    of HA1 that was completely absent from the historical sites. When we proceeded to perform the same
                    clustering as we had done with the non-linear data, we found that the experimental linear epitope
                    data simply did not at all resemble historical epitope groups (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig
                        S2</xref>). Moreover, since the experimental linear epitopes covered almost every site in HA, it
                    was not clear that they represented any particular immune-system bias. In fact, we expect that the
                    experimental practice of expressing short linear peptides and testing them against antibody binding
                    will generally produce many false positives, sites that are included in the peptide but not actually
                    bound by an antibody. Therefore, for the remainder of this study, we disregarded the non-human
                    linear epitope sites and assumed that the non-linear human B cell epitopes represent the true immune
                    epitope sites. We acknowledge that at least some of the sites included among the linear epitopes
                    should likely be included among the true immune epitopes. However, these sites would first have to
                    be verified by non-linear mapping.

                <title>Regrouping epitope sites with experimental data</title>
                <p>Even though the historical epitopes were able to partially reconstruct the experimental epitope
                    clusters, a simple visual inspection suggested more natural groups than those used in the historical
                    set (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Thus, we re-grouped the experimental
                    non-linear epitopes into the most obvious possible groupings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.
                        3C
                    </xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The non-linear epitope data clustered
                    most naturally into four distinct immune epitope regions, which we referred to as 1&#x2013;4, to
                    distinguish them from the historical epitopes A&#x2013;E. Two of the four regions (experimental
                    regions 2 and 3, respectively) were generally very similar to epitopes A and B in the historical
                    definitions. One of the two remaining regrouped epitopes (experimental region 4) was vaguely similar
                    to the D historical epitope with many sites added. The last epitope (experimental region 1)
                    supported by experimental non-linear data was virtually nonexistent in all previous epitope groups.
                    It had a few sites that were previously classified in the C epitope, and it added a large number of
                    sites from the HA2 chain of hemagglutinin. Finally, there were eight sites that had at least one
                    count in the non-linear epitopes and that could not be easily clustered with the other sites (<xref
                            rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

                <p>We performed the same spatial clustering with our newly defined epitope groups as we had previously
                    done for the historical epitope sites. By contrast to the historical epitopes, we found that our
                    epitope groups, which were defined simply by antibody-clustered sites, partitioned almost perfectly
                    into spatial clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Of the four groups we
                    defined, all but one (experimental region 2) was spatially connected. In addition, experimental
                    region 2 had only a single spatial disconnection. Our data set may be missing a single epitope site
                    that would flip the relevant portion of the graph and connect the two disconnected sections. In
                    addition, the spatial graph suggests how to resolve the ungrouped sites (drawn in black) in <xref
                            rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>. Of these eight sites, which grouped into one pair
                    and two triplets in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, two likely belong to Epitope 2,
                    two likely belong to epitope 3, and three may belong to either epitope 2 or 3. Notably, while our
                    redefined epitopes clustered well in the 3D structure, they looked disconnected and arbitrarily
                    chosen when plotted along the linear chain (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>).

                    3</xref>. As expected, there was a clear spatial distribution of sites. Moreover, Epitopes 2&#x2013;4
                    fell into the apical domain of HA, directly adjacent to the sialic acid-binding region. Only Epitope
                    1, which clearly separated from 2&#x2013;4 in the clustering analysis, was located in the stem of
                    HA.

                <title>Developing a predictive model of hemagglutinin evolution</title>
                <p>Our ultimate goal in this work was to develop a predictive model of hemagglutinin evolution, a model
                    that would use biophysical and/or biochemical properties of the protein to infer sites which are
                    likely going to experience either positive or purifying selection pressure. What should such a model
                    look like? Clearly, even in the complete absence of any host immune pressure not all sites in
                    hemagglutinin are expected to evolve equally. In particular, several recent works have shown that
                    site-specific evolutionary variation is partially predicted by a site&#x2019;s solvent exposure
                    and/or number of residue-residue contacts in the 3D structure [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">
                        19</xref>,<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref
                            rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This relationship between protein structure and
                    evolutionary conservation likely reflects the requirement for proper and stable protein folding:
                    Mutations at buried sites or sites with many contacts are more likely to disrupt the protein&#x2019;s
                    conformation [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or thermodynamic stability [<xref rid="c31"
                                                                                                               ref-type="bibr">
                        31</xref>]. In addition, there may be functional constraints on site evolution. For example,
                    regions in proteins involved in protein&#x2013;protein interactions or enzymatic reactions are
                    frequently more conserved than other regions [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref
                            rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Likewise,
                    for a viral surface protein, we expect that functionally important regions (regions with higher
                    fitness consequences) in the protein that are targeted by antibodies will evolve more rapidly, to
                    facilitate immune escape. And indeed, our results from the previous subsections have shown that (i)
                    the neutralizing antibody epitopes in the IEDB preferentially target sites near the receptor-binding
                    region in hemagglutinin and (ii) proximity to the receptor-binding region is a good predictor of
                    evolutionary variation.
                </p>
                <p>We therefore evaluated how proximity to the receptor-binding region performed as a predictor
                    of <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> in comparison to the previously proposed predictors
                    relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and weighted contact number (WCN). We found that among these
                    three quantities, proximity to the sialic acid-binding region was the strongest predictor,
                    explaining 16&#x0025; of the variation in <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> (Pearson <italic>

                    </xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>). RSA and WCN explained 14&#x0025; and 6&#x0025;
                    of the variation in <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic>, respectively (<italic>r</italic> =
                    0.37, <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup> and <italic>r</italic> = 0.25, <italic>P
                    </italic> = 7 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>). Proximity to the sialic acid-binding region and RSA
                    were virtually uncorrelated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.08, P = 0.09) while RSA and WCN correlated
                    strongly (<italic>r</italic> = &#x2013;0.64, <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>).
                    These results suggested that proximity to the sialic acid-binding region and RSA should be used
                    jointly in a predictive model. Importantly, proximity alone turned out to be the single strongest
                    independent predictor of evolutionary rate currently known, outperforming not only RSA and WCN but
                    also numerous other predictors previously considered [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

                            proximity to receptor-binding region, non-linear epitope status) explains almost twice the
                            variation in <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> (yellow bar on the right).

                <p>We next asked to what extent epitope groups could predict evolutionary variation. We considered both
                    the historical epitope groups (Bush 1999) and our experimentally derived epitopes 1&#x2013;4,
                    defined in the previous subsection. Because a site&#x2019;s epitope status is a categorical
                    variable, we calculated variance explained as the coefficient of determination (
                    <italic>R</italic>
                    <sup>2</sup>) in a linear model with <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> as the response
                    variable and epitope status as the predictor variable. We found that experimental epitopes explained
                    15&#x0025; of the variation in <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic>, comparable to RSA and
                    proximity. In comparison, the historical epitopes alone explained nearly 18&#x0025; of the variation
                    in <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic>, outperforming all other individual predictor variables
                    considered here (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2"
                                                                                             ref-type="table">Table
                        2</xref>). However, as discussed in the previous subsection, the available experimental data
                    suggest that not all of the historical sites may be actual immune epitope sites. Therefore, we
                    suspected that some of the predictive power of historical sites was due to these sites simply being
                    solvent-exposed sites near the receptor-binding region. We similarly wondered to what extent the
                    predictive power of the experimental epitope sites was attributable to the same cause, since, in
                    fact, both historical and experimental epitope sites showed comparable enrichment in sites near the
                    sialic acid-binding region and in solvent-exposed sites (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig.
                        S5</xref>). Thus, we analyzed how the variance explained increased as we combined epitope sites
                    (experimental or historical) with either RSA or proximity or both.

                    Because <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> can measure purifying as well as positive
                    diversifying selection, the percent variance in <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> that a model

                    sites, e.g. sites under positive selection. For example, one could imagine a scenario in which a
                    model does exceptionally well on sites under purifying selection (<italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS
                    </italic> &#x226A; 1) but fails entirely on sites under positive selection (<italic>dN</italic>/<italic>

                    useful than a model that overall predicts less variation in <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> but
                    accurately pinpoints site under positive selection. Therefore, we wondered whether epitope sites
                    might do a poor job predicting background purifying selection but might still be useful in
                    predicting sites with <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> > 1. We found, to the contrary, that
                    neither the historical nor the experimental epitope sites could reliably predict sites with <italic>
                        dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> > 1, alone or in combination with RSA (<xref rid="figS6"

                    predicted four sites with <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> > 1, even in the absence of any
                    other predictors. Notably, all models we considered here were robust to cross-validation. The
                    cross-validated residual standard error was virtually unchanged from its non-cross-validated value
                    in all cases (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
                </p>
                <p>In summary, we found that two simple geometric measures of a site&#x2019;s location in the 3D protein
                    structure, solvent exposure and proximity to the receptor-binding region, jointly outperformed, by a
                    wide margin, any previously considered predictor of evolutionary variation in hemagglutinin,
                    including immune epitope sites. In fact, the vast majority of the variation in evolutionary rate
                    that was explained by the historical epitope sites was likely due to these sites simply being
                    located near the receptor-binding region on the surface of the protein. However, historical epitope
                    sites, in combination with solvent exposure and proximity, had some residual explanatory power
                    beyond even a three-predictor model that combined the two geometric measures with experimental
                    immune-epitope data. We suspect that this residual explanatory power reflects the sequence-based
                    origin of the historical epitope sites. To our knowledge, the historical epitope sites were at least
                    partially identified by observed sequence variation, so that, to some extent, these sites are simply
                    the sites that have been observed to evolve rapidly in hemagglutinin.

            <p>We have conducted a thorough analysis of the determinants of site-specific hemagglutinin evolution. Most
                importantly, we have found that host immune bias (as measured by experimentally determined immune
                epitopes) accounts for a very small but significant portion of the evolutionary pressure on influenza
                hemagglutinin. By contrast, a simple geometric measure, receptor-binding proximity, is the single
                largest constraint on hemagglutinin evolution we have identified, and the only quantity that can predict
                sites with <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> > 1. We have shown that the historical epitope
                definitions overlap only partially with experimentally determined immune-epitope data, and we have
                defined new epitopes based on the experimentally available data. These experimentally supported epitopes
                cluster in protein tertiary structure space. Finally, we have shown that a simple linear model
                containing three predictors, solvent accessibility, proximity to the receptor-binding region, and
                immune-epitope sites, explains nearly 35&#x0025; of the evolutionary rate variation in hemagglutinin H3.

                <p>Efforts to define immune epitope sites in H3 hemagglutinin go back to the early 1980&#x2019;s [<xref
                        rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Initially, epitope sites were identified primarily by
                    speculating about the chemical neutrality of amino acid substitutions between 1968 (the year H3N2
                    emerged) and 1977, though some limited experimental data on neutralizing antibodies was also
                    considered [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In
                    1981, the initial four epitope groups were defined by non-neutrality (amino-acid substitutions that
                    the authors believed changed the chemical nature of the side chain) and relative location, and given
                    the names A through D [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since that original study in
                    1981, the names and general locations of H3 epitopes have remained largely unchanged [<xref rid="c4"
                                                                                                                ref-type="bibr">
                        4</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The sites were slightly revised in 1987 by
                    the same authors and an additional epitope named E was defined [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">
                        11</xref>]. From that point forward until 1999 there were essentially no revisions to the
                    codified epitope sites. In addition, while epitopes have since been redefined by adding or removing
                    sites, no other epitope groups have been added [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref
                            rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; epitopes are
                    still named A&#x2013;E. In 1999, the epitopes were redefined by more than doubling the total number
                    of sites and expanding all of the epitope groups [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. At that
                    time, the redefinition consisted almost entirely of adding sites; very few sites were eliminated
                    from the epitope groups. Although this set of sites and their groupings remain by far the most cited
                    epitope sites, it is not particularly clear what data justified this definition. Moreover, when the
                    immune epitope database (IEDB) summarized the publicly available data for flu in 2007, it only
                    included one experimental B cell epitope in humans (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> in
                    [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). Although there were a substantial number of putative T
                    cell epitopes in the database, <italic>a priori</italic> there is no reason to expect a T cell
                    epitope to show preference to hemagglutinin as opposed to any other influenza protein; yet it is
                    known that several other influenza proteins show almost no sites under positive selection. Moreover,
                    it is known that the B cell response plays the biggest role is maintaining immunological memory to
                    flu, and thus it is the most important arm of the adaptive immune system for influenza to avoid.
                </p>
                <p>The historic H3 epitope sites have played a crucial role in molecular evolution research. Since 1987,
                    an enormous number of methods have been developed to analyze the molecular evolution of proteins,
                    and specifically, to identify positive selection. The vast majority of these methods have either
                    used hemagglutinin for testing, have used the epitopes for validation, or have at some point been
                    applied to hemagglutinin. Most importantly, in all this work, the epitope definitions have been
                    considered fixed. Most investigators simply conclude that their methods work as expected because
                    they recover some portion of the epitope sites. Yet virtually all of these studies identify many
                    sites that appear to be positively selected but are not part of the epitopes. Likewise, there is no
                    single study that has ever found all of the epitope sites to be important. Even if the identified
                    sites from all available studies were aggregated, we would likely not find every site among the
                    historical epitopes in that aggregated set of sites.

                <title>Implications of historical epitope groups for current research</title>
                <p>Given all of this research activity, it seems that the meaning of an immune epitope has been muddled.
                    Strictly speaking, an immune epitope is a site to which the immune system reacts. There is no <italic>
                        a priori
                    </italic> reason why an immune epitope needs to be under positive selection, needs to be a site that
                    has some number or chemical type of amino acid substitutions, or needs to be predictive of influenza
                    whole&#x2013;genome or hemagglutinin specific sequence cluster transitions. Yet, from the beginning
                    of the effort to define hemagglutinin immune epitopes, such features have been used to identify
                    epitope sites, resulting in a set of sites that may not accurately reflect the sites against which
                    the human immune system produces antibodies.
                </p>
                <p>Ironically, this methodological confusion has actually been largely beneficial to the field of
                    hemagglutinin evolution. As our data indicate, if the field had been strict in its pursuit of immune
                    epitopes sites, it would have been much harder to produce predictive models with those sites, in
                    particular given that experimental data on non-linear epitopes have been sparse until very recently.
                    By contrast, the historical epitope sites have been used quite successfully in several predictive
                    models of the episodic nature of influenza sequence evolution. In fact, in our analysis, historical
                    epitopes displayed the highest amount of variance explained among all individual predictors (<xref
                            rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). We argue here that the success of historical
                    epitope sites likely stems from the fact that they were produced by disparate analyses each of which
                    accounted for a different portion of the evolutionary pressures on hemagglutinin. Of course, it is
                    important to realize that some of this success is likely the result of circular reasoning, since the
                    sites themselves were identified at least partially from sequence analysis that included the
                    clustered, episodic nature of influenza hemagglutinin sequence evolution.
                </p>
                <p>Despite the success of historical epitope groups, they do predict only about 18&#x0025; of the
                    evolutionary rate-variation of hemagglutinin. Moreover, since many of these sites likely are not
                    true immune epitopes (and therefore not host dependent), one might ask which features of the
                    historical epitope sites make them good predictors. We suspect that they perform well primarily
                    because they are a collection of solvent-exposed sites near the sialic acid-binding region (see also <xref
                            rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). We had shown previously that sites within 8
                    &#x00C5; of the sialic acid-binding site are enriched in sites under positive selection, compared to
                    the rest of the protein [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A similar result was found in
                    the original paper by Bush et al. [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the related
                    metric of distance from the sialic acid-binding site has not previously been considered as a
                    predictor of evolution in hemagglutinin. Furthermore, before 1999, most researchers thought the
                    opposite should be true; that receptor-binding sites should have depressed evolutionary rates [<xref
                            rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Even today the field seems split on the matter [<xref
                            rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As we have shown here, the inverse of the distance
                    from sialic acid is the single <italic>best</italic> independent predictor of hemagglutinin
                    evolution; by itself this distance metric can account for 16&#x0025; of evolutionary rate-variation.
                    Moreover, by combining this one metric with another to control for solvent exposure, we can account
                    for more than a third of the evolutionary rate variation in hemagglutinin. For reference, this
                    number is larger than the variation one could predict by collecting and analyzing all of the
                    hemagglutinin sequences that infect birds (another group of animals with large numbers of natural
                    flu infections), and using those rates to predict human influenza hemagglutinin evolutionary rates [<xref
                            rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

                <title>Geometric constraints likely dominate adaptive evolution in hemagglutinin</title>
                <p>Why do geometric constraints (solvent exposure and proximity to receptor-binding site) do such a good
                    job predicting hemagglutinin evolutionary rates? Hemagglutinin falls into a class of proteins known
                    collectively as viral spike glycoproteins (GP). In general, the function of these proteins is to
                    bind a host receptor to initiate and carry out uptake or fusion with the host cell. Therefore, in
                    terms of host immune evasion, viral spike GP&#x2019;s have a surface that is both critical for viral
                    survival and is sufficiently long lived that a host immune response is easily generated against it.
                    There are likely many other viral protein surfaces that are comparatively less important or
                    sufficiently short lived during a conformational change that antibody neutralization is impractical.
                    Thus, the virions that survive to the next generation are those with substantial variation at the
                    surface or surfaces with high fitness consequences and a long half-life <italic>in vivo</italic>.
                    Evolutionary variation at surfaces with low or no fitness consequences, or at short-lived surfaces,
                    should behave mostly like neutral variation and hence appear as random noise, not producing a
                    consistent signal of positive selection.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we need to consider that actual epitope sites, i.e., sites
                    towards which the immune system has a bias, may not be that important for the evolution of viruses.
                    An epitope is simply a part of a viral protein to which the immune system reacts. Therefore, it
                    represents a host-centered biological bias. The virus may experience stronger selection at regions
                    with high fitness consequences but that generate a relatively moderate host response compared to
                    other sites with low fitness consequences that generate a relatively strong host response. For
                    example, if an antibody binds to the receptor-binding region of hemagglutinin, the influenza virus
                    must adapt to survive; by contrast, if an antibody binds away from the receptor-binding region, the
                    influenza virus may not be neutralized by that antibody and hence may not experience much selection
                    pressure to adapt. For these reasons, we expect that the geometric constraints we have identified
                    here will be more useful in future modeling work than the experimental epitope groups we have
                    defined. Moreover, we expect that similar geometrical constraints will exist in other viral spike
                    glycoproteins, and in particular in other hemagglutinin variants.

                <p>We used sequences that had been collected since the 1991&#x2013;1992 flu season. Any season before
                    the 1991&#x2013;1992 season had an insufficient number of sequences to contribute much to the
                    selection analysis. The sequences were filtered to remove redundant sequences and laboratory

                    method. As shown in Figure S6, all evolutionary rates fall into a range between <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>

                <p>We computed RSA&#x2019;s as described previously [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
                    Briefly, we used DSSP [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] to compute the solvent
                    accessibility of each amino acid in the hemagglutinin protein. Then, we used the maximum solvent
                    accessibilities [<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] for each amino acid to normalized the
                    solvent accessibilities to relative values between 0 and 1. We found that RSA calculated in the
                    trimeric state produced better predictions than RSA calculated in the monomeric state. Thus, we used
                    multimeric RSA in all models in this study. Both multimeric and monomeric RSA are included in the
                    supplementary data.

                <title>Mapping experimental immune epitopes</title>
                <p>There were two broad categories of epitope data available in the epitope database. One was non-linear
                    epitopes and the other was linear epitopes. In addition, the IRD splits epitopes into B and T cell
                    epitopes and also into the various species whose immune system was tested. Here, we were interested
                    in antibody-driven immune escape, and hence we focused on B cell epitopes.
                </p>
                <p>For B cell epitopes, every linear human epitope was also recognized by the immune system of many
                    other species. Therefore, we decided to split the analysis into linear and non-linear groups. All of
                    the non-linear epitope data came in the form of amino acid plus site number. As a result, we could
                    map the epitopes by simply counting the number of times each site in the protein was hit and the
                    co-occurrences of sites hit by the same antibody.
                </p>
                <p>Mapping linear epitopes was slightly more complicated. We started with the short sequence fragments;
                    each of the fragments was between 5 and 40 amino acids in length. We tried initially to map the
                    fragments onto the emblematic A/Aichi/2/1968 sequence, but it turned out the epitope fragments were
                    actually generated from disparate strains along the H3N2 lineage. The differences between the
                    original founder strain and the fragments meant that we could not accurately map the vast majority
                    of short peptides onto a single sequence. Instead, we took the entire curated and pre-aligned set of
                    3854 sequences that we used in the evolutionary rate calculations. We then aligned the fragments
                    with MAFFT using a very strong opening penalty of 10. We visually checked to be sure all of the 87
                    fragments aligned reasonably well to the full H3 alignment. Then, as with the non-linear epitopes,
                    we counted the number of times each site was hit and the co-occurrences of sites hit by the same
                    antibody.
                </p>
                <p>To calculate the distance maps, we used an H3 protein structure (PDB ID: 4FNK) available in the
                    Protein Databank [<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">
                        44</xref>]. We first cleaned the protein structure using PyMOL [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">
                        45</xref>]. We then used the Bio.PDB module of biopython to compute distances on the protein
                    structure. In a similar fashion to the co-occurrence maps above, we used every site that appeared in
                    at least one epitope. We then calculated the distance from every experimental epitope site to every
                    other experimental epitope site. If a site was within 10 &#x00C5; of another epitope site, then an
                    edge was drawn between them using the igraph package [<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] in
                    the statistical programming language R [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

                    the distance calculations. Conceptually, we can think of this analysis as overlaying a grid on the

                    sequences with canonical bases, non-repetitive sequences, and we have hand filtered the data to
                    ensure all included sequences align appropriately to the 566 known amino acid sites. In addition, we

                <p>The site-wise numbering for the H3 hemagglutinin protein reflects the numbering of the mature
                    protein; this numbering scheme requires the removal of the first 16 amino acids in the full-length
                    gene. Thus, for protein numbering purposes, site number 1 is actually the 17th codon in full-length
                    gene numbering. The complete length of the H3 hemagglutinin gene is 566 sites while the total length
                    of the protein is 550 sites. It is important to point out that the mature H3 protein has two chains
                    (HA1 and HA2) that are produced by cutting the presursor (HA0) protein between sites 329 and 330 in
                    protein numbering. In addition, as a result of cloning and experimental diffraction limitations,
                    most (or likely all) hemagglutinin structures do not include some portion of the first or last few
                    amino acids of either chain of the mature protein, and crystallographers always remove the
                    C-terminal transmembrane span from HA2. For example, the structure we used (PDBID: 4FNK) in this
                    study does not include the first 8 amino acids of HA1, the last 3 amino acids of HA1, or the last 48
                    amino acids of HA2. As a result, HA1 includes sites 9&#x2013;326 and HA2 includes sites 330&#x2013;502.
                    Table S1 lists the gene sequence from one of the three original H3N2 (Hong Kong flu) hemagglutinin

                    used (and many others than were not used) in this study. In general, the most common epitope

                        sites. (C) Distribution of relative solvent accessibilities, for historical epitope and
                        non-epitope sites. (D) Distribution of relative solvent accessibilities, for experimental
                        nonlinear epitope and non-epitope sites. Under both historical and experimental epitope
                        definitions, epitope sites are closer to the sialic acid-binding region and have higher RSA than
                        non-epitope sites.

                    <p>(A) Only epitope status according to the historical definition is used as predictor variable. (B)
                        Historical epitope sites and RSA are used as predictor variables. (C) Only epitope status
                        according to the experimental non-linear epitope data is used as predictor variable. (D)
                        Experimental epitope sites and RSA are used as predictor variables. (E) Only proximity to the
                        sialic acid-binding region (measured as 1/Distance to Residue 224) is used as predictor
                        variable. (F) Proximity and RSA are used as predictor variables. Individual sites with <italic>
                            dN</italic>/<italic>dS</italic> &#x003E; 1 are predicted correctly only if the linear model
                        includes the 1/Distance predictor. However, in all cases, adding the RSA predictor significantly
                        improves the model predictions.
