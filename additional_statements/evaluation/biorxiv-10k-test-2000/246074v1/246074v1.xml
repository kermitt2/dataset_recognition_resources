<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The development of model systems requires a detailed assessment of standing genetic variation across natural populations. The <italic>Brachypodium</italic> species complex has been promoted as a plant model for grass genomics with translational to small grain and biomass crops. To capture the genetic diversity within this species complex, thousands of <italic>Brachypodium</italic> accessions from around the globe were collected and sequenced using genotyping by sequencing (GBS). Overall, 1,897 samples were classified into two diploid or allopolyploid species and then further grouped into distinct inbred genotypes. A core set of diverse <italic>B. distachyon</italic> diploid lines were selected for whole genome sequencing and high resolution phenotyping. Genome-wide association studies across simulated seasonal environments was used to identify candidate genes and pathways tied to key life history and agronomic traits under current and future climatic conditions. A total of 8, 22 and 47 QTLs were identified for flowering time, early vigour and energy traits, respectively. Overall, the results highlight the genomic structure of the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> species complex and allow powerful complex trait dissection within this new grass model species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Climate change is impacting the production of food worldwide (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) while increasing global demand will soon outstrip the rate of improvement in crop yield by traditional breeding methods (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). To address food and climate security, there is a need for agricultural innovation across a range of scientific disciplines, from genomics to phenomics in new species across the landscape (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Key to breeding for more variable future climates, as well as for broad adaptability, is understanding the plasticity of the genetic architecture of agronomic traits across environments. The use of controlled growth cabinets, that can mimic regional diurnal and seasonal climate types (e.g. 4), allows us to examine the genetic architecture underlying complex adaptive traits across field like environments.</p>
<p>Two complex traits that have a large impact on yield are ear emergence and early vigour. The timing of ear emergence is crucially important to yield in many grain growing regions, including Australia where early flowering may lead to cold-induced sterility while late flowering may result in heat stress or lack of water limiting grain filling. Early vigour, defined as an increase in the above ground biomass prior to stem elongation, is a beneficial trait in many environment types, especially when combined with increased transpiration efficiency (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Since vapour pressure is low in winter, increased biomass during early growth improves plant water use efficiency. Early vigour also increases competition against weeds, reduces soil evaporation and may improve yields by increasing total seasonal biomass (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Energy use efficiency is a relatively understudied component of plant growth that represents the efficient transfer of energy, acquired through photosynthesis, to the grain, and may significantly affect yield. Early studies indicate that energy efficiency, via lower respiration rates, are correlated with an increase in biomass in monocot species (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Identification of the genetic architecture of energy use efficiency, timing of heading and early vigour traits, as well as the genetic sensitivity to future temperature profiles, could accelerate breeding in crop species via selection for improved predicted yields in the future.</p>
<p>Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) combine dense genetic markers identified via next generation sequencing and high throughput phenotyping to identify the causative alleles and to predict complex quantitative traits (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The improvement of crop yield involves many complex traits and the expression of these traits can be highly dependent on the growth environment. GWAS is an excellent method for mapping and predicting yield-related traits and their interaction with the environment. GWAS has been undertaken in a number of crop species; for dozens of agronomic traits in diploid species such as rice, barley and corn (for review see 10), and has even be used reasonably successfully in wheat despite the added complexity of a hexaploid genome (e.g. 11).</p>
<p><italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> is a model species for temperate C3 grass crops such as wheat, barley, rye and oats as it is also located in the Pooideae family and has a number of advantageous characteristics as a model species (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). <italic>B. distachyon</italic> also has a number of advantages over the related domestic Pooideae for a GWAS approach as it is a wild species with a wide climatic distribution, resulting in diverse phenotypes, as well as wide genomic diversity, for traits involved in life strategy and abiotic stress tolerance. <italic>B. distachyon</italic> has a fully sequenced small genome of 270Mb (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) compared to the 16Gb of wheat (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) or 5.1Gb of barley (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It also contains a low percentage of repetitive non-coding DNA at 21.4&#x0025; of nucleotides compared to more than 80&#x0025; in wheat (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and 84&#x0025; in barley (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This means that sequence reads from <italic>B. distachyon</italic> are much easier to identify and align compared to wheat, with a larger proportion of the sequencing providing useful reads. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the short stature of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> which allows large numbers of plants to be taken through full life cycles in controlled growth conditions.</p>
<p><italic>Brachypodium</italic> is widespread throughout temperate regions, including its native Mediterranean range and introduced range in Australia, South Africa and western USA (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A large number of accessions have been collected throughout the world by the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> community but the use of these collections in genomic association studies has been delayed by the cryptic nature of the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> species complex. The three species in this complex are difficult to distinguish in the field and include the diploid <italic>B. distachyon</italic>; the diploid <italic>B. stacei</italic>; and the allotetraploid <italic>B. hybridum</italic> which contains one <italic>B. distachyon</italic> -like genome and one <italic>B. stacei</italic> -like genome (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). To add to the complexity there is evidence of distinct subgroups or subspecies of <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). While the genome of the Bd21 genotype of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> was published in 2010, the genome of <italic>B. stacei</italic> and other SNP corrected genomes were released online in 2016 (DOE-JGI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/">http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/</ext-link>). Recently, a <italic>B. distachyon</italic> pan genome was published identifying geographic diversity and many new genes not identified in the initial reference (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Prior to our study, species identification has commonly been undertaken by morphoanatomical classification, a small number of markers or cytology (e.g. 17,23). There is a need for a rapid identification of species, subspecies and genotype lineages, within the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> species complex to aid the selection of HapMap sets and to enable landscape genomic studies of migration and adaptation.</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to 1) characterise the species, genotype and population structure of a <italic>Brachypodium</italic> global diversity set to select a core haplotype mapping set for GWAS in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> and 2) identify the genetic architecture and plasticity of the agriculturally relevant traits of heading date, early vigour and energy use efficiency in response to climate.</p>

<title>Cryptic Brachypodium Species, diverse genotypes and population structure identified using Genotyping by Sequencing</title>
<p>To establish a diverse set of germplasm, thousands of <italic>Brachypodium</italic> accessions were collected on trips to south-west Europe, south-eastern Australia, western USA and through collaborations with the international <italic>Brachypodium</italic> community (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping/blob/master/metadata/brachy-metadata.csv">https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping/blob/master/metadata/brachy-metadata.csv</ext-link>). Out of these, 1968 accessions were grown to produce single seed descent lines in the greenhouses at ANU for subsequent genomic analysis. A reduced representation approach, <italic>PstI</italic> digest, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS; <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) was used to genetically-profile the accessions.</p>
<p>Although once described as a single species, <italic>B. distachyon</italic> has more recently been shown to exist as a species complex consisting of a 5 Chromosome <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, 10 Chromosome <italic>B. stacei</italic>, and a 15 chromosome allopolyploid <italic>B. hybridum</italic> (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). To categorise each accession into species within the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> complex, GBS tags were mapped to a merged reference genome consisting of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> (Bd21-3) and <italic>B. stacei</italic> (ABR114) [v1.1 DOE-JG, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov">https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov</ext-link>]. Most accessions were readily distinguished as having reads that aligned to either or both reference genomes (see methods; Supp. S01). The majority of accessions, 56&#x0025; (1100/1968) were identified as <italic>B. hybridum.</italic> In contrast, only 3&#x0025; (60/1968) were classified as <italic>B. stacei</italic>, while 35&#x0025; (698/1968) were <italic>B. distachyon</italic>. The remaining 6&#x0025; (110/1968) could not be definitively assigned. Mapping of the accessions&#x2019; geographic locations showed that <italic>B. hybridum</italic> has expanded across the globe representing essentially all the collections outside the native range (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Conversely, <italic>B. distachyon</italic> is largely limited to the native Mediterranean and Western Asian regions, with <italic>B. stacei</italic> in the same area but was less common.</p>

<p>Due to the highly selfing nature of all <italic>Brachypodium</italic> species, we next sought to categorise accessions into unique whole genome genotypes representing a single inbred lineage. We used the SNPRelate package (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) to cluster 72 genotypes from 490 high quality <italic>B. distachyon</italic> accessions genotyped at 81,400 SNPs (see methods; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping-notes">https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping-notes</ext-link>; Supp. S02). Recombinant inbred lines, included as positive controls, were often called unique genotypes as expected, but were excluded from subsequent analysis of natural population structure.</p>

<title>Whole genome variation</title>
<p>Whole genome sequencing was performed on a set of 107 <italic>B. distachyon</italic> accessions to determine high density variation at multiple levels, patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and to enable genome wide association studies (GWAS). The samples ranged across the subspecies, population and family levels revealing 2.65M polymorphic sites (1&#x0025; diversity, &#x03B8;, on 260Mb). Most samples were the A subspecies with 3 clear outliers (Bd1-1, Cas2, WLE2-2) belonging to the B subspecies. The subspecies showed fixed divergence at 6.5&#x0025; of sites (169k with &#x003C;100 expected by chance among 3 accession outliers). Within the A subspecies there were 2 clear populations with 1.5&#x0025; fixed divergence among groups. Accessions within the same genotypic lineage diverged at between 0.1-to 0.4&#x0025; of SNPs highlighting the relative amount of rare variation within a unique genotype. A balanced set of representative accessions across the genotype lineages within just the A subspecies was selected for further genomic and phenomic analysis (Supp. S03).</p>
<p>Previous genetic analysis on smaller data sets had shown <italic>B. distachyon</italic> to have substantial levels of population structure (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We sought to refine the ancestral population structure of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> by reducing 107 accessions to 63 highly diverse genotypes using 2,648,921 SNPs. To reduce data complexity SNPs were subsampled to every 100th site to create a final SNP matrix of 26,490 variants that were fed into STRUCTURE v.2.3.4 (34; Supp. S04). STRUCTURE analysis identified three main subgroups among <italic>B. distachyon</italic> genotypes and seven admixed lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). The yellow lineage was the most diverged and represents subspecies B, with the brown and red structure groups representing the predominantly East and West populations of the A subspecies. To visualise the geographic distribution, the ancestral group composition was summed across accessions for each geographic site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The single <italic>B. distachyon</italic> accession from Australia WLE2-2 was nearly identical to BdTR9f (GBS data, Supp. S02) from southern western Turkey, where it may have originated from. It is shown in its ancestral location (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> arrow).</p>
<p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was calculated for consecutive windows of 2000 SNPs across the genome. There was large variation in LD across the genome (Supp. S05) with the median LD 113kb (50 &#x2013; 235kb interquartile range) and the maximum was greater than 2.4Mb.</p>

<title>Determining the best traits and climatic conditions for GWAS in <italic>B. distachyon</italic>
</title>
<p>For our GWAS study we wanted to identify high throughout non-destructive phenotypic measures with high heritability. We also wanted to determine the best environmental conditions to characterise our trait of interest. Hence two preliminary experiments were undertaken, one for flowering time and one for early vigour.</p>
<p>Flowering time was chosen as an ideal trait for GWAS as it has high heritability in many species including Arabidopsis (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)and barley (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In previous studies of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> it has been found that the dependence of flowering time on vernalisation and photoperiod varies between accessions (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This study aimed to identify QTL for earliness <italic>per se</italic> in flowering, i.e. those responsive to the accumulation of thermal time. Hence a preliminary experiment was undertaken to determine if our conditions could meet the vernalisation requirements of all <italic>B. distachyon</italic> accessions and to determine which accessions had strong vernalisation requirements in our conditions. To do this 266 diverse A and B - subspecies accessions, with 5 accessions replicated 5-6 times were grown in both a simulated winter sowing, starting 01 June, and a spring sowing, starting 01 September, in Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia (Supp. S06). Ear emergence was monitored, as a surrogate measure for flowering time as flowering occurs largely within the ear in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> so is hard to accurately record (Supp. S07). Out of the 266 accessions there were 17 accessions that did not flower in the Spring condition, indicating a strong vernalisation requirement (Supp. S08A). All lines flowered in the Winter condition, indicating that night temperatures of 4&#x00B0;C were sufficient to meet vernalisation requirement. As expected, days to ear emergence showed a strong heritability in the winter condition, as calculated from the replicated lines (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.96). The thermal time to flowering was calculated to determine the dependence of flowering on the accumulation of thermal time. The fast cycling accessions, that were not vernalisation requiring, still required a larger thermal time accumulation than the vernalisation requiring accessions (Supp. S08B). This indicates that these either have some low-level requirement for vernalisation that is not being fully met in the Spring condition or that the photoperiod is also a factor in this relationship. As this study aimed to identify QTL for earliness <italic>per se</italic> in flowering, i.e. those responsive to the accumulation of thermal time, we attempted to exclude vernalisation and photoperiod effects by focusing on the winter condition for the GWAS experiment.</p>
<p>In temperate grass crops such as wheat and barley, early vigour can result in an increased yield in short seasons or in seasons where there is high rainfall (reviewed in 6). Often the dimensions of seedling leaves are measured as a nondestructive surrogate measure for early vigour (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). To confirm that this was also an appropriate surrogate measure for early vigour in <italic>B. distachyon,</italic> a highly replicated (n = 10) validation experiment was performed on six diverse <italic>B. distachyon</italic> lines (Supp. S09A) in a simulated Wagga Wagga, seasonal climate starting on 01 September (Spring). After seven weeks, when plants had between four and five mainstem leaves, the dimensions of leaf #3, seedling height, total leaf area, and above ground dry weight were measured and phenotypic correlations were calculated (Supp. S09B). Narrow sense heritability was also calculated to determine which early vigour trait would provide the most power for mapping QTLs with GWAS (Supp. S09C). Leaf #3 width and length correlated well with above ground biomass (r<sup>2</sup>=0.46, p&#x003C;0.01 and r<sup>2</sup>=0.48, p&#x003C;0.01, respectively) and had quite high heritabilities of <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.60 and <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.64, respectively, as compared to above ground dry mass, <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.51. Interestingly, seedling height also had a strong correlation with above ground biomass (r2=0.74, p&#x003C;0.01) with a heritability of <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.74. However, this trait was also more highly correlated with development, as indicated by the number of leaves (r2=0.21, p&#x003C;0.01), than the dimensions of leaf #3. To get the most direct measure of early vigour the dimensions of leaf #3 were chosen as the focus for the GWAS.</p>

<title>Selection of global HapMap set</title>
<p>High-level population structure confounds GWAS when there are few segregating SNPs in common between ancestral groups relative to variation within each subgroups (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Here we focused on subspecies A which contains a majority of unique genotypes, resulting in a HapMap set of 74 genotypes. Within the A subspecies there is still clear population structure, but further subset selection would limit both the sample size and the phenotypic and genotypic diversity, reducing the rate of true positive results. This residual relatedness between lines was accounted for by including a kinship matrix in the GWAS model.</p>

<title>Early vigour and ear emergence shows genotypic variation in response to different simulated environments</title>
<p>To determine the genetic architecture for ear emergence date, early vigour, and a range of other agronomic traits, the refined and balanced HapMap set of 74 <italic>B. distachyon</italic> accessions (Supp. S10), with four biological replicates, were grown in two simulated conditions in specially modified growth chambers (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). To determine the effect of an increase in temperature in line with climate change predictions on the traits of interest, the conditions modelled a present (2015, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and a future (2050, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) temperature profile at Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia. The appropriate increase in average maximum and minimum temperature for each month was determined using an average of 12 global climate change models determined to be high confidence for south east Australia using the Climate Futures Tool (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, 42; Supp. S11).</p>

<p>As expected, the accessions developed quicker and grew larger in the 2050 temperature profile (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, B) as is consistent with a quicker accumulation of thermal time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Early vigour parameters and energy use efficiency traits were measured when the majority of plants were at a four-leaf stage. Growth stages, tiller number and ear emergence date were monitored twice a week (Supp. S12, S13, S14). The experiment was ceased after 200 days of growth, at which time there were 5 and 7 lines that did not flower in the 2015 condition and 2050 conditions, respectively. The remaining lines reached ear emergence at a similar number of days in both the present and future conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). However, when converted to thermal time those lines in the 2015 temperature condition required less thermal time than those in the 2050 temperature condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D, F</xref>). This indicates that there is generally more dependence on photoperiod in this population than on thermal time to trigger the transition to flowering. There was variation between genotypes in the plasticity in their response to the two conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref> &#x0026; F), indicating that it would be worthwhile mapping the genotype by environment interaction.</p>

<title>Determining the genetic architecture of early growth, ear emergence and energy use efficiency traits in response to environment</title>
<p>GWAS was performed on raw and derived traits as described in the methods (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>; Supp. S15 &#x0026; S16). For ear emergence, eight significant QTLs were identified. EarEmerg_QTL3.1 explains 62&#x0025; of the phenotypic variation in thermal time to ear emergence in the 2015 temperature condition while two QTLs, EarEmerg_QTL3.1 and EarEmerg_QTL5.3, explain 56&#x0025; and 10&#x0025; of the phenotypic variance in thermal time to ear emergence in the 2050 temperature condition, respectively. No QTLs were found to be significant in both conditions but EarEmerg_QTL5.3 was significant in the 2050 temperature condition and was just under the significant threshold in the 2015 temperature condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, Supp. S17). Within the 100kb region of this SNP there are 15 genes of which several could be relevant to the regulation of flowering including a YABBY transcription factor (Bradi5g16910), a no apical meristem (NAM) protein (Bradi5g16917) and an expressed gene containing a RNA recognition motif (Bradi5g16930). Interestingly, there were two QTLs that were significant for thermal time to ear emergence, EarEmerg_QTL3.1 and EarEmerg_QTL4.2, but not for days to ear emergence. There were six QTLs identified for the genotype by environment interaction, explaining in part, the variation among lines in response to future climate.</p>

<p>For early vigour, 22 significant QTLs were identified for 5 traits across the two climate conditions (Supp. S15). Two QTLs were identified in both conditions, EarlyVigour_QTL1.1 and EarlyVigour_QTL3.1, and both of these were for leaf #3 length. The 100kb region surrounding these QTLs contained 19 and 13 genes, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> and C). There was a highly significant QTL on chromosome 3 for growth rate 1, EarlyVigour_QTL3.3, a measure of the rate of development of the seedling at the two leaf stage, but only in the 2015 temperature condition. The 100kb region surrounding this QTL contained 13 genes (Supp. S18). A total of 6 QTLs were identified for the genotype x environment interaction across the two conditions for early vigour traits.</p>
<p>For the energy use efficiency traits, a total of 47 QTLs were identified across the two conditions for the three measured traits and four derived traits (Supp. S15). Of these QTL, none were found in both environments. However, a strong QTL, Energy_QTL3.3, was identified for average quantum yield, a measure of photosynthetic efficiency, in the 2015 temperature environment. The 100kb region around this QTL contained 24 genes including a low PSII accumulation 3 chloroplastic protein (Bradi3g01550), a Heat Shock Protein (Bradi3g01477) and several transcription factors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig4D</xref>, Supp. S19).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Thanks to the international <italic>Brachypodium</italic> community, in addition to our own collections, here we were able to provide the most comprehensive survey of <italic>Brachypodium</italic> species complex diversity to date. With 1897 accessions across the globe this is a greater than 10-fold increase from previous studies (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>
<p>Since being described as three separate species in 2012 (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), species identification in the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> species complex has been achieved by morphology, PCR of a select set of markers or DNA barcoding (e.g. 41,42). Here we present a unique systematic method of determining the species of an accession using low coverage genotyping by sequencing and bioinformatics, providing a high throughput and low cost alternative for species identification. We found that the majority of our accessions were in fact <italic>B. hybridum</italic> (56&#x0025;) including the vast majority of accessions in Australia and North America (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The wide dispersion of this species may be due to the benefit of the multiple genomes resulting from polyploidisation (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). There were relatively few <italic>B. stacei</italic> (3&#x0025;), which were limited to the Mediterranean region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Within <italic>B. distachyon</italic> itself we found significant population structure including high level subspecies splits, with 6.5&#x0025; divergence between subspecies, which is greater than that found between <italic>indica</italic> and <italic>japonica</italic> rice at 1.4&#x0025; divergence (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). While many previous studies have focused on individual regions (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), the collection of 490 high quality <italic>B. distachyon</italic> accessions combined with 81,400 high quality SNPs presented here has allowed us to further distinguish subgroups with the <italic>B. distachyon</italic> subspecies, with and eastern and western European group in each subspecies. A number of geographically diverse highly related genotypic lineages were also identified which showed within lineage divergence of between 0.1- to 0.4&#x0025; of SNPs. The geographic spread of these lineages highlights the inbreeding nature and high dispersal ability of <italic>B. distachyon</italic>.</p>
<p>The hierarchical levels of genetic variation within the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> species complex can be attributed to allopolyploidisation and subspeciation, possibly during the most recent ice age; east/west isolation by distance in Europe; and the high levels of self-fertilisation in the species (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). These levels of population structure have been seen in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and other highly selfing plant species such as barley (<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), but are more extreme in <italic>Brachypodium</italic>. In rice, either the <italic>indica</italic> sub-species (<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) or <italic>japonica</italic> sub-species (<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), were separately used for GWAS. Similarly, to deal with the population structure in this study, the HapMap set was limited to the A subspecies of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> with remaining relatedness included in the GWAS analysis using mixed models (QTLrel; 47).</p>
<p>The lack of recombinant genetic diversity with subspecies and populations of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> also limits the power of GWAS analysis. The HapMap set contains a large amount of genomic diversity (&#x003E;1&#x0025; of bases are variable) but the sample size is low and the extent of linkage disequilibrium is high, limiting mapping resolution. However, the patterns are similar to rice where GWAS is very effective as sample size increases (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The construction of a Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population for <italic>B. distachyon</italic> would be advantageous to break-up the population and familial lineages and to increase the frequency of minor alleles. This has been a successful approach in other species such as maize and wheat (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).</p>
<p>In field conditions, determining the relationship between various physiological traits and their impact on yield is difficult due to in-season environmental variability and the presence of a range of abiotic and biotic stresses. However, experiments in growth chambers often have little relevance to field conditions due to the unrealistic and static nature of the conditions. The use of climate chambers provides a realistic range of temperatures, which results in more translatable results to the field (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), while removing the variability caused by weather and stresses. The use of climate chambers also allows the impact of small changes in climate to be observed and the dissection of which components of the climate have the largest influence on a trait of interest. In this study, we examined the effect of an increase in temperature in line with climate change model predictions for 2050 in south eastern Australia. Unexpectedly, there was generally a short delay of flowering time in the 2050 temperature condition with variation in the extent of delay in different genotypes while there was little dependence of flowering on the accumulation of thermal time. This indicates that there may be some vernalisation requirements in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> that are not being met in the 2050 temperature condition. The lack of vernalisation is also evident in the fact that seven lines had not flowered by the end of the 2050 temperature condition while 5 lines did not flower in the 2015 temperature condition. While this GWAS analysis did not identify known flowering time loci that regulate vernalisation-induced flowering such as VRN1, VRN2 and FT (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), the QTL may represent more subtle vernalisation processes that would be important for facultative varieties. Perhaps largely to the difference in growth conditions, the QTL in this study did not overlap with those found in a previous GWAS of flowering time (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Candidate genes identified for flowering time here included several transcription factors, including a YABBY transcription factor whose closest ortholog in rice, Os04g45330, is most highly expressed in the shoot apical meristem and developing inflorescence (Rice Gene Expression Atlas) and whole closest ortholog in Arabidopsis, At2g45190, is involved in regulation of the floral morphology (<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) under EarEmerg_QTL5.3. This QTL was significant in the 2050 temperature conditions and was only just below the significance threshold in the 2015 temperature condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>Early vigour is an important trait in many parts of Australia, and the world, where there is competition from weeds and a shorter season. Despite the highest correlating non-destructive measure of early above ground biomass being seedling height, the most robust QTLs across environments were actually identified by leaf #3 length. Two QTLs identified for leaf #3 length were identified in both environments, indicates they could potentially be useful for breeding for early vigour in multiple environment types. One of these, EarlyVigour_QTL1.1 is located in an area of synteny to other areas where early vigour QTLs have been identified at the end of chromosome 3 in rice (16,58,59) and Chromosome 4 in wheat (<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Within EarlyVigour_QTL1.1 there is a candidate gene, Bradi1g00666, that is described as an ethylene-responsive transcription factor. The main candidate gene in the QTL on Chromosome 3 in rice was also an ethylene responsive gene (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). The EarlyVigour_QTL3.1 for leaf #3 length was also found to be significant across both environments. There were no obvious candidate genes for this QTL but a number of signalling proteins that could be involved in molecular control of leaf size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, Supp. S18).</p>
<p>The balance of energy production and use in plants is highly linked to the conditions that the plant is grown under, however genetic variation controlling the energy efficiency of plants could be used to increase yield potentials. The quantum yield is an indicator of photosynthetic efficiency, the proportion of energy harvested through the light harvesting complexes that goes towards producing photosynthates (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). No QTL were identified in common across both environments, but there were 11 QTL that were identified for the GxE interaction. This may be due to the sensitivity of these energy processes to the subtle difference in environments or a result of being measured on different days to allow comparison of plants at the same developmental stage. A strong QTL was identified for quantum yield, a measure of the efficiency of photosystem II, in the 2015 climate but interestingly not in the 2050 climate. Candidate genes under this QTL included a gene with 66&#x0025; homology to the Low PSII Accumulation 3 (LPA3) gene in Arabidopsis, which has been shown to be important in Photosystems II assembly (<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Further studies into the importance of this QTL in different conditions, as well as the other photosynthesis and respiration QTL, would be worthwhile.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> species complex is heavily structured at the ploidy, subspecies, population, and family levels. This limits the ability to identify the genetic basis of adaptation as relatively few recombinant genotypes were obtained. Despite these limitations, this study indicates the potential to use <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, a model for Pooideae grass crops, to identify genetic variation in key pathways underlying agricultural traits through Genome Wide Association Studies. Further wild collections and/or the development of a Nested Association Mapping (NAM) populations could address the limitation of recombinant genotypes and result in very high power mapping population typical of 1000 genome projects. As it now stands, <italic>Brachypodium</italic> is a good model for both polyploidisation, with likely multiple events among small divergent genomes, and for invasion biology with multiple widespread genotypes identified across continents, regions and sites.</p>

<title>Genotyping by Sequencing and Species Identification</title>
<p>Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was undertaken as described by Elshire and colleagues (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) using PstI enzyme and a library of homemade barcoded adaptors (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping">https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping</ext-link>; 27,28). Approximately 384 samples were multiplexed to run on a single lane in an Illumina HiSeq 2000 with a median number of 564 000 100bp read pairs per sample (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping">https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping</ext-link>). Sequencing runs were undertaken by the Biomolecular Resource Facility (JCSMR, ANU).</p>
<p>Axe (<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) was used to demultiplex sequencing lanes into libraries, allowing no mismatches. AdapterRemoval (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) was used to remove contaminants from reads, and merge overlapping read pairs. Reads were aligned using BWA MEM (<xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>) to the Bd21-3 (<italic>B. distachyon</italic>) and ABR114 (<italic>B. stacei</italic>) reference genomes (Phytozome v.12.1), and to a <italic>B. hybridum</italic> pseudo-reference genome created by concatenating the <italic>B. stacei</italic> and <italic>B. distachyon</italic> reference genomes (Supp. S01). Variants were called using the multiallelic model of samtools mpileup (<xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) and bcftools call (<xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Variants were filtered with bcftools filter, keeping only SNPs of reasonable mapping and variant qualities (&#x003E;=10) and sequencing depth across samples (&#x003E;=5 reads across all samples).</p>
<p>To determine the species of each of the accessions, we computed the proportion of each Chromosome in the <italic>B. hybridum</italic> pseudo-reference covered with at least 3 reads, excluding reads which mapped to multiple locations in the pseudo-reference, using mosdepth (<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The proportions of the <italic>B. distachyon/B. stacei genomes</italic> covered were normalised to be in [0, 1], and then used to assign samples into threshold groups: <italic>B. stacei</italic> (&#x003C; 0.03), intermediate <italic>B. stacei / B. hybridum</italic> (&#x003C; 0.28), <italic>B. hybridium</italic> (&#x003C;0.34), intermediate <italic>B. hybridum / B. distachyon</italic> (0.94) and <italic>B. distachyon</italic> (&#x003E;0.94); an additional group consisted of low coverage samples (&#x003C;100000 reads in total). Samples from intermediate and low coverage groups were excluded, and only variants in the respective genomes were used to allocate the three species groups.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Population Structure of <italic>B. distachyon</italic></title>
<p>To determine the population structure of <italic>B. distachyon</italic> a pairwise Identity By State genetic distance was calculated to identify among 490 high quality samples a core diversity set of 72 distinct genotypes using 82,800 SNPs derived from GBS data and the SNPRelate package using a z-score of 3.5. Occasionally, when genotypes are closely related, noise between technical replicates of an accession will result in them being split across the related genotypes. Therefore, we keep replicate(s) from the genotype with the majority of replicates for that accession, breaking ties by keeping the replicate with the lowest missing data. In addition, 29 accessions whose geographic origin was suspect were also excluded.</p>
<p>To avoid bias from including up to 30 inbred accessions of the same genotype, a reduced set was input into STRUCTURE V.2.3.4 (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). A total of six replicates were run of population (K) 1-13 with a burnin setting of 10,000 sets, and 100,000 permutations per run (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, Supp. S04). The optimal K was determined as K=3 by Evanno&#x2019;s Delta K, processed via Structure Harvester and CLUMPP (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Barplots and pie charts were generated via in-house developed R scripts available through github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping-notes">https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping-notes</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For <italic>B. distachyon</italic> the pairwise distance between genotypes was also calculated in R and plotted as a dendrogram (Supp. S02). From this a set of 107 accessions were selected to represent the genotypic diversity of the species for whole genome sequencing to maximise SNP coverage across the genome.</p>

<title>Whole Genome Sequencing</title>
<p>For Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), sequencing libraries for individual samples were prepared from 6 ng genomic DNA with the Nextera DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries were enriched and barcoded with custom i5-, and i7-compatible oligos and Q5&#x00AE; High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Libraries were pooled and sequenced in one lane on a NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).</p>
<p>Trimit (<xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>) was used to clean WGS reads of adaptors, and merge overlapping read pairs. BWA MEM was then used to align these reads against the Bd21-1 reference genome (version 314_v3.1; 16). Variants were called using freebayes (<xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>) with default parameters. Variants were filtered such that only variants meeting the following criteria were kept: variant quality &#x003E;20, minor allele frequency &#x003E;= 2&#x0025;. Heterozygous variant calls were changed to missing; due to the inbred nature of these accessions, heterozygous calls were almost certainly erroneous. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping">https://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping</ext-link> Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) was calculated across the <italic>B. distachyon</italic> genome using consecutive windows of 2000 SNPs from the whole genome data of the HapMap 74 set (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping-notes">http://github.com/borevitzlab/brachy-genotyping-notes</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Plant Growth</title>
<p>Individual grain of each genotype were planted 2.5cm deep in square plastic pots (5cm width, 8cm deep) in a mix of 50:50 soil:washed river sand which had been steam pasteurised. Pots were then placed at 4oC in the dark for three days to stratify the seed before being moved to specially modified climate chambers (see 4). In brief, these chambers have been fitted with 7 LED light panels and are controlled to change the light intensity, light spectrum, air temperature and humidity every 5 minutes. Climatic conditions were modelled using SolarCalc software (<xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). The Wagga Wagga region was centred around -35S, 147E with an elevation of 147m. Plants were fertilised with Thrive (N:P:K 25:5:8.8 &#x002B; trace elements, Yates) and watered with tap water as needed. Growth stages were recorded based on the Huan developmental stage (<xref rid="c76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>) up until stem elongation and thereafter the Zadoks scale was used. Total leaf area was measured with a Li-1300 Area Meter (Li-COR). For dry weight, leaf tissue was dried in a paper envelope at 60oC for five days before weighing.</p>

<p>Several energy use efficiency formulas were calculated. These included a ratio of dark respiration to photosynthesis and measures of growth per unit dark respiration. These were as follows:

<title>GWAS analysis</title>
<p>In preparation for GWAS, the genotype data was filtered to remove non-variant SNPs and redundant SNPs (i.e. SNPs whose genotypes are not different from adjacent SNPs but have more missing data points). Then SNPs with a minor allele frequency of &#x003C; 3&#x0025; were filtered out. As there was 18.5&#x0025; missing data in the original data set, imputation was undertaken. First, if the observed genotypes of two adjacent SNPs were not different, then the missing genotype of one SNP was replaced by the observed genotype of the other SNP. Secondly, nearest neighborhood (NN) method was implemented to impute the remaining missing genotypes based on Huang et al (<xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>) with some modifications. The nearest 50 SNPs from each side of the SNP under imputation were selected to estimate similarity between each pair of accessions, and then the missing genotype of an accession was replaced by the observed majority genotype of the closest 5 accessions. These parameters were determined by simulations to achieve an optimal imputation success rate, which was 97.95&#x0025; for our data. Finally, SNPs with a minor allele frequency &#x003C;5&#x0025; were filtered.</p>
<p>Linear mixed-effect models were employed to identify genetic variants underlying phenotypes of interest
