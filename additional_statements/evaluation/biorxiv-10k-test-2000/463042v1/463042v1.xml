<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Hemodynamic recordings from visual cortex contain powerful endogenous task-related responses that may reflect task-engagement distinct from attention. We tested this hypothesis with hemodynamic measurements (intrinsic-signal optical imaging) from monkey V1, while the animals&#x2019; engagement in a periodic fixation task over several hours was varied though reward size, and as animals took breaks. With higher rewards, animals appeared more task-engaged; task-related responses were more temporally precise at the task period (&#x007E; 10-20 seconds), and modestly stronger. Surprisingly, 2-5-minute blocks of high-reward trials led to ramp-like decreases in mean local blood volume; these reversed with ramp-like increases during low reward. The blood volume increased even more sharply when the animal shut his eyes and disengaged completely from the task (5-10 minutes). We propose a mechanism that controls vascular tone, likely along with local neural responses, with phasic and tonic components tied to task-engagement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The use of fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in humans, complemented with electrode measurements from animal studies, has considerably advanced our understanding of cortical visual processing. This combination of tools has been particularly useful in understanding exogenous, stimulus-evoked responses. Models of neural responses in humans based on electrophysiological recordings in animals, combined with linear models linking neural to hemodynamic responses, have been effective in accounting for stimulus-evoked fMRI measurements in human subjects and in quantitatively predicting the corresponding sensory percepts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, fMRI measurements from subjects performing visual tasks also contain large endogenous hemodynamic responses in the absence of, or independent of visual stimuli, even at the earliest stages of visual processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. There are at least two types of endogenous response, &#x2018;attention-like&#x2019; and &#x2018;task-related&#x2019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Unlike the case with exogenous responses, there has been mixed success in interpreting these endogenous hemodynamic responses. Selective visual attention has been characterized extensively through studies in human fMRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> with close parallels seen in animal electrophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. While likely driven by a unified mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, attention can take different forms. It could be selective for stimulus location <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, or features (e.g. color vs. motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>) or timing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The related hemodynamic responses reflect corresponding attributes of the expected stimuli. Attentional responses also increase in strength along the visual cortical hierarchy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Much less is known about the task-related endogenous hemodynamic response, including whether it comprises one or multiple types. It appears to be distinct from selective attention. It entrains to task structure and extends over large sections of cortical areas (e.g. primary visual cortex, i.e. V1) independent of the stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, where it can even be substantially stronger than stimulus-selective responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. It is also strongest in V1 and progressively weaker in higher visual areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These difference may reflect distinct brain processes underlying these two endogenous responses. There is growing evidence of the importance of the task-related endogenous response. It may play a role in sensory processing, in temporally grouping otherwise unrelated sensory stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> or in switching between stimulus modalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. As yet relatively little is understood about the mechanism of the task-related response even though its presence has been known for over a decade <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. This is largely due to the paucity of studies comparing hemodynamics with electrophysiology in alert, behaving subjects.</p>
<p>The current work derives from a task-related hemodynamic response measured using intrinsic-signal optical imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> in V1 of alert macaques performing cued visual tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The observed task-related response entrained to task timing independent of visual stimulation, with amplitudes that could compare with or even exceed vigorous visually evoked responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. It appeared to be spatially non-selective, being homogeneous over the optical imaging window and presumably extending beyond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. It is thus likely a good model for investigating the mechanism underlying the task-related response seen in humans. Notably, concurrent electrode recordings showed it to be poorly predicted by changes in local firing rates or field potential (LFP) power at any frequency band<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, unlike stimulus-evoked hemodynamic responses that were well predicted by local electrophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Additionally, at a vascular level, this response corresponded to a coordinated contraction-dilation cycle engaging the arterial blood supply into the imaged cortical region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. These observations suggested an underlying mechanism distinct from exogenous, stimulus-evoked responses.</p>
<p>Here we explore the link between this task-related hemodynamic response and the level of engagement in a task. The link was suggested by earlier measurements showing correlations between the measured task-related response and task performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, as well as with sympathetic-like markers of mental effort in a task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> such as phasic pupil dilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and heart rate fluctuations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. To modulate the level of engagement, we changed reward size systematically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> while the monkeys performed a periodic visual fixation task over several hours. Using intrinsic-signal optical imaging and electrophysiology, we looked for effects on the measured task-related hemodynamic response at multiple time scales: of individual trials (<sup>&#x007E;</sup>10-20 seconds); of blocks of trials (150-300 seconds), and finally, of extended segments of task engagement vs. disengagement as the animal switched between working, as vs. resting with eyes closed (many minutes). Based on our results, we propose that the task related hemodynamic response reflects mechanisms that entrain brain processing more sharply to a task during periods of higher task engagement, possibly as a means of temporally filtering or binding components of a task. Additionally, we propose that the mechanism is accompanied by an overarching pattern of vascular control that enhances vascular tone over both phasic and tonic time scales during a task in coordination with ongoing changes in the level of engagement. Understanding these links would be an important step forward in understanding the dynamic allocation of brain resources in the context of a task.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>Two male rhesus macaques performed a cued, periodic visual fixation task, receiving juice reward following every correct fixation with no time out or other punishment for errors (see <bold>Methods</bold>). The task is known to evoke a robust task-related hemodynamic response in the monkeys&#x2019; V1 independent of visual stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Here we systematically manipulated the size of the reward per correct trial, as a means of modulating the animals&#x2019; level of engagement in the task. This was done either in alternating blocks of high and low reward, or in sequences of progressively changing reward (see <bold>Methods</bold>). We recorded V1 hemodynamics using intrinsic-signal optical imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, a high-resolution optical analog of fMRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. This technique deduces brain hemodynamic responses at the exposed cortical surface by measuring changes in reflected light intensity at wavelengths absorbed by hemoglobin. Here we used a wavelength tuned for imaging changes in blood volume (see <bold>Methods</bold>). Imaging was combined with concurrent extracellular electrode recording of multi-unit spiking and LFP. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute.</p>
<p>We observed distinct effects on the task-related V1 hemodynamic responses at the three different time scales tested. At the shortest time scale, of individual trials &#x2013; a few seconds &#x2013; higher reward led to crisper temporal alignment of the task-related response to each trial, accompanied by a significant if modest improvement in response amplitude. At a slower time scale of blocks of alternating high vs low reward (10 to 20 trials, i.e. 150 to 300 sec per block), we observed consistent alternating ramp-like changes in the mean local cortical blood volume. Notably, the sign of the ramps was such as to decrease blood volume for blocks of high reward while increasing it for low. Finally, periods of disengagement from the task where the animal shut his eyes and rested over many minutes led to further large, sustained increases in the mean local blood volume. None of these effects at any time scale could be accounted for by changes in local spike rate.</p>
<p>The majority of the reported results came from tasks performed in essentially complete darkness (&#x2018;Dark-Room Fixation&#x2019; <italic>N</italic> &#x003D; 30 sites, 3 hemispheres, 2 animals). This allowed measurement of the effects on the endogenous task-related hemodynamic response while minimizing exogenous visual confounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. A complementary section (<italic>N</italic> &#x003D; 33 sites, 2 hemispheres, 2 animals) confirmed that the observed results generalized to the presence of visual stimuli.</p>

<title>Time scale of single trials: higher reward leads to greater temporal precision</title>
<p>A section of recording made while the animal fixated periodically in the dark illustrates the pattern of task-entrained responses, as well as changes to these responses with reward size (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1a</xref></bold>). Despite the near total absence of visual stimulation, the V1 hemodynamic recording showed robust task-related fluctuations in local tissue blood volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. These were accompanied, as noted earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, by phasic sympathetic-like responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> i.e. phasic pupil dilation and heart rate fluctuations, also entrained to the task period. These sympathetic-like responses increased with higher reward. The pupils dilated more per trial, switching dilation size across single trials at block transitions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1b</xref></bold>). The mean heart rate fluctuations were stronger (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1c,e</xref></bold>). Further, animals made fewer errors (fixations broken or never acquired) in high-reward blocks (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1a, d</xref></bold>). Notably, the mean hemodynamic response also appeared to ramp slowly upwards during the high-reward block, i.e. reducing mean local blood volume, as indicated by the slope of a linear regression line (red, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1a</xref></bold>); this observation is addressed in a later section on slow changes. Parenthetically we did note a weak fluctuation in recorded spiking that was periodic in the mean and appeared to relate to hemodynamics in some data sets. However, the correlation was unreliable and did not generalize (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig 1</xref></bold>), consistent with our earlier findings that the task-related response is not predicted by local spiking or LFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>At the time scale of individual trials, the primary correlate of high reward on the task-related response appeared to be greater temporal precision, i.e. tighter alignment to trial timing. This was evident qualitatively in lower trial-to-trial temporal jitter for high reward (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2a</xref>,</bold> left panel). The mean of these trial-by-trial responses, averaged across all correct trials, was also higher for high-reward trials. But it was unclear how much of that was due to a true difference in amplitude, as opposed to better temporal alignment of individual responses. To resolve this issue, it was necessary to separately estimate the timing and amplitude of the task-related response for each trial.</p>

<p>We used a template matching approach based on the observation that, other than temporal jitter, Individual responses appeared similar to each other in shape independent of reward size (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2a</xref></bold>; also see ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>). The full hemodynamic recording was thus modeled implicitly as a sequence of task-related responses of stereotyped shape, one per trial, varying only in amplitude and timing from trial to trial. The template was defined to be the trial-triggered average response over all correct trials. This template was slid in a one-trial-long moving window over the recorded response, calculating the normalized local dot product at each time point (&#x2018;Template Match&#x2019;, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2b</xref>, Methods, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">3</xref></bold>). The dot product is closely analogous to Pearson&#x2019;s correlation (see <bold>Methods</bold>). We thus surmised that it would have maxima (peaks) at points of high correlation where the recorded hemodynamics locally matched the template in shape&#x2013; in effect, defining locations of putative task-related responses. But in addition, unlike Pearson&#x2019;s r which is scale-invariant, dot products scale linearly with the amplitude of their arguments and thus provide a measure of response strength (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2b</xref></bold>. Also <bold>Methods</bold>). We therefore defined our estimates of task-related response time and amplitude, per trial, to be the location and height of the corresponding template match peak.</p>
<p>After estimating response times and amplitudes as described above, we wanted to check our starting assumption that the measured hemodynamics are well modeled as a sequence of jittered but stereotyped shapes. If the assumption is valid the segments of recorded hemodynamics centered on each peak of the Template Match should match each other closely in shape. To test, we centered each putative task-related response, as picked out through template matching, by its response time as estimated from the same template match (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2c</xref></bold>). Indeed the realigned responses were strikingly well correlated with each other. This can be appreciated visually by normalizing realigned responses by their amplitudes to help compare shapes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2d</xref>)</bold>; and quantitatively by correlating realigned responses to the template used for matching (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2e,f</xref></bold>). The strength of this correlation supports our approach.</p>
<p>With the task-related response times and amplitudes thus quantified we confirmed that the primary effect of higher reward was greater temporal precision. Response times were better aligned to the task period, with consistently tighter distributions (quantified by the 2&#x03C3; width of the distribution). This was evident for the example data set (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3a</xref></bold>) as well as in essentially every other data set (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3c</xref></bold>). High reward also led to significantly higher response amplitude for the example data set (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3b</xref></bold>). However, that pattern was less consistent over the full set of experiments with only a relatively modest improvement in median response amplitudes overall (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3d</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We wondered if these results were due to our particular choice of template. We tested by repeating the analysis shown here across all datasets using a range of alternate templates. The alternate templates were also each one-trial long and constructed from measured responses, but using different criteria: for example, phase shifted in time; or using only &#x2018;high signal-to-noise&#x2019; responses with amplitudes exceeding a threshold. The task-related-response times and amplitudes estimated by matching to these alternate templates showed a strikingly similar overall relationship to reward size as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>. This is illustrated in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig 2</xref></bold> for a particular alternate template with timing and shape distinct from the one used in the main text. This result highlights the overall robustness of our findings. It also suggests that high reward leads to a state of greater temporal regularity and periodicity overall for the duration of the block, accounting for the higher temporal precision in estimated response times independent of the details of the template used.</p>

<title>Timing precision is robust to noise in template match</title>
<p>We were concerned that the apparently lower temporal precision with low reward could be an artifact of a noisier template match. When task-related responses had lower amplitudes, the template match could be poorer simply due to lower signal to noise. This could lead to noisier estimates of response time with wider distribution and thus apparently poorer precision, but due to the poorer signal to noise alone, independent of reward size (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4a</xref>.</bold> Also consider, e.g., the responses with poor shape match in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2d</xref>). Since lower rewards were associated with somewhat lower response amplitudes, this increased noise could make the low-reward responses appear artifactually less precise.</p>

If our concern about signal to noise in the template match were valid, high- and low-reward responses in each amplitude-matched subset should exhibit similar distributions of response times independent of reward size.

<title>Timing precision is independent of eye fixation timing and eye movements</title>
<p>We wondered if there were some simple oculomotor explanation or correlate of our observation. We considered two possible scenarios under which this could happen.</p>
<p>We considered the null hypothesis that the timing of the task-related response per trial is determined by fix onset, with a stereotyped response time course and hence constant delay following fixation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>). If that were the case, response times should be correlated to fix onset times, with unity slope and constant delay. The higher precision with high reward could reflect a behavioral pattern where the animal is more precise in its fix onsets prior to those trials (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref></bold>). This null hypothesis turned out not to be the case, and task-related response times were uncorrelated with fixation onset. Parenthetically, both animals&#x2019; fixation behavior changed over the many months that we tested them intermittently on this task. Initially, both animals tended to maintain fixation for long periods with very few breaks even during intertrial intervals. This led to extended periods of fixation prior to the start of each trial, or even across multiple trials, without any breaks, but unrelated to the timing of the task-related response or reward size (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3b</xref></bold>). Later, both animals showed a different behavioral pattern, moving their eyes around during inter-trial intervals and re-acquiring fixation shortly before trial onset. This led to a pattern of brief fixation periods prior to each trial (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3c</xref></bold>). Task-related hemodynamic response times remained more precise with high reward, independent of the changing pattern of fixation.</p>
<p>We next considered the possibility that animals may have steadier fixation or smaller eye movements during high-reward blocks, due to generally higher engagement in the task (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4</xref></bold>). We failed to see any consistent patterns. There were no consistent differences in fixational jitter between high&#x2013; and low-reward trials at the resolution of our measurements (60 Hz, 0.33 deg). There were also no consistent differences in eye movements during the intertrial periods where the animals were free to look around. Notably the animals also changed their patterns of intertrial eye movements over the many months of recording. In earlier sessions, they did move their eyes less during high-reward blocks (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4a1-3</xref></bold>). Later, however the animals adopted a behavioral pattern of greater intertrial eye excursions for high-reward trials (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4b1-3</xref></bold>). However, the task-related responses remained more precise for higher reward trials (smaller 2&#x03C3; width for task-related response time distributions), Independent of this changing pattern of eye movements.</p>

<title>Timing precision generalizes to the presence of visual stimulation</title>
<p>The question that remained was whether reward size affected task-related responses only in the unnatural circumstance of visual tasks in the near absence of all visual stimulation; or whether such effects generalized to the presence of visual stimuli. To test, we analyzed data from a separate set of experiments where the animals were passively shown visual stimuli &#x2013; gratings of different contrasts &#x2013; while performing the same cued, periodic fixation task. For this we first needed to estimate the task-related response from recorded hemodynamics by estimating and removing stimulus-evoked responses. We did so by modeling the overall measured hemodynamics as a linear sum of the stimulus-evoked and task-related components, which we fitted to get the optimal kernels for the two components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (<bold>Methods, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Fig 5</xref></bold>). The optimal HRF kernel thus obtained was then convolved with the recorded spiking to estimate the stimulus-evoked component of hemodynamics and regress it away from the full hemodynamics. The residual &#x2013; that was, by construction, the component of hemodynamics not predicted by local spiking &#x2013; was then defined to be the task-related component of the hemodynamic response, equivalent to the full hemodynamic response in the dark-room.</p>
<p>The task-related response thus estimated in the presence of visual stimuli was again temporally more precise with high reward, just as with the task undertaken in the dark room. This can be seen qualitatively after separating the estimated task-related response into individual trials and segregating trials by reward size. These trial-wise responses were visibly less temporally jittered for high reward (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5a</xref></bold>). The timing and amplitude of these task-related responses were quantified by matching to a template just as for recordings in the dark room; the template was taken to be the optimal mean kernel for the task-related component as estimated from the fit (<bold>Methods, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq 7</xref>,<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">8</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Fig 5</xref></bold>). The results of this template match closely paralleled those obtained in the dark room fixation task. The estimated response times were again more tightly clustered for high-reward trials, both for this specific dataset (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5a,c</xref></bold>) and over the set of visually stimulated experiments (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5e</xref></bold>). Response amplitudes showed only a modest improvement (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5d,f</xref></bold>).

<title>Time scale of blocks of trials: mean blood volume decreases for high reward, increases for low</title>
<p>Analyses up to this point were restricted to the scale of single trials, i.e. &#x007E;10 to 20 sec. However, we also noted slow ramp-like drifts in the mean local blood volume over blocks of ten to twenty trials of a given reward size, i.e. about 150 to 300 seconds (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref></bold>). Surprisingly, the ramps decreased blood volume for high-reward blocks while increasing it for low.

<p>These slow hemodynamic drifts were not driven by slow changes in spiking. Blocks of trials with alternating ramps of mean blood volume failed to show similar alternating ramps of mean spiking (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Supplementary Fig 6</xref></bold>). To test more quantitatively, we first simulated the spiking patterns required to generate the measured hemodynamic slopes on convolving with the corresponding optimal fitted HRF, per experiment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Supplementary Fig 6 e,f</xref></bold>). The slopes of the simulated spiking ramps alternated in sign with reward size, as expected. Each measured spiking slope was then divided by the slope of its corresponding simulation, to compare. If the measured slopes had the same sign as their simulations, these ratios would consist of positive numbers, with some magnitude reflecting a scale factor. This was not the case; the ratios were equally likely to be positive or negative, for both high and low reward. The measured spiking slopes were thus uncorrelated with those required to generate the measured hemodynamic slopes.</p>

<title>Switching from alert engagement to rest with eyes closed: further profound increases in blood volume</title>
<p>We wondered if the slow increase in mean local blood volume accompanying reduced reward could be part of a broader pattern of shifts in mean local blood volume accompanying shifts in the level of engagement. A potential clue was seen in the continuous measurements during long dark-room recording sessions lasting up to three hours. In these sessions, in between extended stretches of working well, the animals would take occasional breaks of many minutes where they stopped working and rested with their eyes shut. The mean local blood volume in V1 increased strikingly during these breaks, returning to baseline when the animal resumed working (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7a</xref></bold>). This pattern appeared to be an extreme manifestation of the ramp-like changes in blood volume with reward size where lower reward, with its lower level of engagement, (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref></bold>), led to increasing mean blood volume (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Before ascribing an association with reduced engagement in the task, we needed to test whether the increased blood volume could be accounted for simply by concurrent changes in neural or physiological drivers. As possible drivers we considered the mean heart rate, and the mean local multi-unit spike rate (recorded separately at two electrodes spaced 4 mm apart in the recording chamber). We also measured the pairwise noise correlation of spike rates between the two electrodes over a one-second sliding window since that was expected to increase at rest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. To focus on slow changes all recordings were downsampled to get, in effect, the smoothed average in a 60-sec window (see <bold>Methods</bold>).</p>
<p>We then assessed changes in these physiological and neural measurements as the animal switched state, marking the state based on the fraction of time within the 60-second window that the eyes were closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig <bold>7a</bold></xref>, top row, &#x2018;Eyes closed&#x2019;). Spontaneous eye closures in the dark have been shown to provide a useful measure of drops in vigilance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, correlating well with EEG and fMRI indicators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. For this study, epochs where the eyes were shut more than 60&#x0025; of the time were defined as &#x2018;rest&#x2019; while those with less than 5&#x0025; of eye closure were considered &#x2018;alert&#x2019;. To check, we compared with an LFP measure of alertness based on the ratio of power in the beta- and theta-range frequency bands (15-25 Hz, and 3-7 Hz respectively) as suggested by earlier studies (ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>; also, reviewed in ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>). To get a measure that was low when the animal was alert and high when at rest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, as with eye closure, we placed the theta power in the numerator. The square root of this ratio further compressed the dynamic range to roughly 0-1 as with eye closure. These two measures, based on eye closure and on the LFP were closely comparable (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7a</xref></bold>, upper two rows and inset), supporting the use of eye closure to segregate physiological measurements by alertness state.</p>

<p>The mean neural and heart rate measurements, thus segregated, showed systematic changes as the animal switched between states of rest and alert engagement, but in a direction opposite to that expected to increase blood volume at rest (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7a</xref></bold>). Thus the mean heart rate, averaged over the moving 60-sec window, reduced systematically relative to its local baseline value each time the animal disengaged from work and rested with eyes shut (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7a</xref>: bottom trace (&#x2018;HR&#x2019;)</bold>: see shaded areas indicating rest). This is consistent with the abrupt falls in mean heart rate and blood pressure seen at sleep onset in human subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. But it suggests that the concurrent increase observed in V1 local blood volume is not a passive consequence of cardiovascular changes as that would require an increase rather than a decrease in heart rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Similarly, the mean spike rate recorded at individual electrodes typically decreased as the animal rested. If the blood volume at rest were driven linearly by local spiking then the mean spike rate should have increased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Notably, although the mean spike rates at individual electrodes largely decreased, the pairwise correlation of spike rates over the pair of electrodes showed the expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, striking increases for the epochs of rest vs. alert engagement.</p>
<p>Comparing hemodynamics and spiking at the higher, imaging temporal resolution (15 frames/sec) supported our contention that the large blood volume increases at rest are not predicted from spiking. This conclusion was not immediately apparent on qualitative inspection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8a</xref></bold>). At this temporal resolution the spiking response showed expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> bursts of high instantaneous spike rate (red arrow, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8b</xref></bold>) that stood out despite the overall reduction in mean spike rate as the animal rested with eyes shut (see caption, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8a</xref>)</bold>. The corresponding blood volume measurements showed large swings in amplitude that appeared, qualitatively, to follow the bursts of spiking. Our earlier work showed that the recorded hemodynamics is poorly predicted by spiking when the animal is engaged in his task, due to the presence of the task-related response (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig 1</xref></bold>, refs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>). But there should be no task-related response, by definition, when the animal is disengaged from the task with his eyes shut and the hemodynamics could in principle be predictable from spiking. It was thus important to test the relationship between the two at this higher temporal resolution.</p>

<p>We tested using deconvolution, i.e. multi-linear regression (see <bold>Methods, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eq 9</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn12">12</xref></bold>), which has the advantage that it makes no assumptions about HRF shape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. The deconvolution was done over partially overlapping 150-sec windows (75-sec steps; 150 sec typically covered 10 trials) to get adequate temporal resolution for tracking rest states (e.g. the rest epoch in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8a</xref>, indicated by the red bar, lasts about 400 sec. Shorter deconvolution windows led to excessive noise). Importantly our design matrix contained not only the spiking regressor but also additional DC and slope terms. The DC term is analogous to the &#x2018;y intercept&#x2019; in 1-d linear regression, quantifying an inhomogeneous addition to a homogeneous linear equation. The prediction using the full deconvolved HRF kernels including the DC term matches measured hemodynamics very well overall (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8a</xref></bold>, compare &#x2018;<bold>Hemo, full pred</bold>&#x2019;, green with &#x2018;<bold>Hemo, meas</bold>&#x2019;, black).

However, they failed to account for the increase in the mean blood volume, predicting a decrease instead (prediction rising above baseline) which is consistent with the decrease in the local mean spiking. The measured increase in the blood volume was well accounted for, on the other hand, by the additional DC term in the deconvolved kernel (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8a</xref></bold>, &#x2018;<bold>Hemo, DC pred</bold>&#x2019;. The slope terms made only small contributions). The same pattern was seen over the full 2.5-hour recording (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8b</xref></bold>). Linear, phasic predictions from spiking matched the high-frequency fluctuations of hemodynamics during rest epochs, while the deconvolved DC tracked the mean measured hemo (compare <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8b</xref></bold>, &#x2018;DC pred&#x2019; with &#x2018;Hemo&#x2019; trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7a</xref>). This result supports the suggestion that the large changes in mean blood volume during rest were likely driven by a mechanism acting in addition to spiking. Similar results were obtained for all extended recording sessions, including ones where the mean spike rate increased during rest.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our goal is to understand the task-related endogenous component of hemodynamic responses recorded from visual cortex of subjects engaged in cued, predictable tasks. The existence of such responses has been known for more than a decade <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, their substantial strength relative to other brain hemodynamic components is well recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and recent studies suggest their relevance to sensory processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Yet they have not been adequately studied and little is known about their underlying mechanism or behavioral significance. We earlier reported one particularly prominent task-related response in V1 of alert macaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, which is likely closely related to responses seen in human visual cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Our work here suggests that this task-related response reflects brain mechanisms of task-engagement. On increasing reward size to get the animal more engaged, the most notable effect, trial by trial, was improved temporal precision: the response became consistently more crisply aligned to task timing. It also became modestly stronger. At a slower timescale, different levels of task engagement led to consistent DC shifts in the mean local blood volume. Notably, high-reward blocks led to consistent decreases in the mean blood volume while low-reward blocks led to corresponding increases. This effect was even more pronounced when the animal disengaged completely from his task and rested with eyes closed. The mean blood volume increased strikingly during these breaks, returning to baseline when the animal resumed working. None of these effects at any time scale could be accounted for by concurrent local spiking. On a methodological note, we recorded the hemodynamic response using intrinsic-signal optical imaging, at a wavelength tuned for measuring cortical blood volume. Such recordings have a much steadier and more reliable baseline than BOLD fMRI, suffering much less from instrumental noise and drift. This allowed us to monitor the response continuously over many hours thus obtaining the reported results, including the prominent DC shifts.</p>
<p>We propose that the task-related hemodynamic response and the effects reported in this paper are linked to brain states of vigilance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, in the sense of sustained attention during an extended and possibly repetitive task. This is to be distinguished, on the one hand, from selective visual attention (see the brief review in the Introduction) and, on the other, from non-specific arousal along the sleep&#x2013;wake axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Sustained attention is known to fluctuate between states of higher stability which are less prone to error (&#x2018;in the zone&#x2019;), and states that are more unstable and error-prone (out of &#x2018;the zone&#x2019;; see, e.g., ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>). Notably, the state of being &#x2018;in the zone&#x2019; is marked by higher regularity and temporal precision: responses &#x2018;in the zone&#x2019; show less variability in reaction time, trial by trial, even when the mean reaction time remains unchanged overall <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. The state is further enhanced by reward, which leads to even less variability in reaction times, in a manner that appears distinct from increased arousal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. This behavioral result may have a physiological analog in our finding of improved temporal precision or regularity of the task-related hemodynamic response during high reward (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref></bold> and accompanying text). Much remains to be done, to understand the function of the task-related hemodynamic response and its link, if any, to the behavioral correlates of sustained attention. An interesting opening is afforded by the finding that the task-related response may act as a temporally selective attention boost, filtering and binding together disparate sensory features that happen to be presented at the same time as the hemodynamic response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>What could be the underlying mechanism? Recall that the trial-by-trial response manifests as a coordinated cycle of constriction and dilation of the arterial system, entrained to task timing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. This response could be driven by mechanisms (neuromodulatory? feedback?) with both phasic and tonic components, that could modulate local neural responses while also heightening vascular tone by constricting blood vessels. During a task the phasic constriction could flush out the &#x2018;used&#x2019; blood allowing blood vessels to refill. As task engagement weakens, the tonic level of this driver could reduce, relaxing blood vessels passively and increasing the mean cortical blood volume. While there may be many candidate drivers (adrenergic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>? Astrocytic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>?) targeting different components of the local vascular network an important potential candidate is dopamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Visual cortex gets dopaminergic innervation even if it is weak compared to other cortical areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, and dopamine is proposed as a mediator of both constriction and dilation of cortical blood vessels through different receptor classes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Functionally, dopamine has also been proposed as a mediator of improved perceptual discrimination and response strength in sensory cortex following rewarded trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Exploring these issues through targeted experiments in alert animals would be crucial to understanding brain mechanisms of task engagement and vigilance.</p>

<title>EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS</title>
<p>Animal use procedures were in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Two male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were used in the study. Access to water was scheduled to training or recording sessions that occurred 3-5 hours per day. Eye fixation and pupil diameter were recorded using an infrared eye tracker (ISCAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">1</xref></sup>).. Before training, each animal was implanted with a stainless steel or titanium head post. After training, craniotomies were performed over the animals&#x2019; V1 and glass-windowed stainless steel or titanium recording chambers were implanted for subsequent Intrinsic Signal Optical Imaging (ISOI) in the alert animal (see below). The craniotomy exposed a 20-mm dia area of V1 covering visual eccentricities from &#x007E;1 to 10&#x00B0;. The exposed dura was resected and replaced with a soft, clear silicone artificial dura (GE Silicone RTV615 001). Recording chambers and artificial dura were fabricated in our laboratory following published designs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc3">3</xref></sup>. Chambers were opened regularly for cleaning and testing for infection and, if necessary, treating, following published protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc4">4</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Extracellular electrode recording was carried out simultaneously with intrinsic-signal optical imaging from V1 of alert monkeys performing a periodic visual fixation task. Task and recording methods, described below, are essentially identical to those in earlier papers from our lab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc8">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Task and reward schedules</title>
<p>All experiments were based on a simple fixation task, carried out either under essentially complete darkness or in the presence of visual stimuli. In both conditions, animals held fixation periodically, cued by the color of a fixation spot. (Fixation window: 1.0 to 3.5 deg. diameter, monitor distance: 133 cm; fixation duration: 3&#x2013;5 sec; trial duration: 9&#x2013;22 sec; all parameters fixed for a given experiment, but variable between experiments). A juice reward followed every correct (unbroken) fixation, with no time out or other punishment for errors. The primary behavioral manipulation consisted of systematically changing reward size.</p>
<p>For fixation trials in the dark room, the monitor was covered and the fixation point was presented behind a pinhole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc8">8</xref></sup>. Reward sizes were alternated between high (typically 0.45 ml per correct trial, ranging from 0.35 &#x2013; 0.6 ml) and low (typically 0.15 ml per correct trial, ranging from 0.1 &#x2013; 0.2 ml. High and low reward sizes were fixed for an experiment; they were selected per day based on the animal&#x2019;s willingness to work for the low reward). Rewards were alternated in blocks (typically 10 correct trials each; some experiments had longer blocks; some experiments had blocks of variable size. The animal had to correctly complete the full set of trials per block &#x2013; i.e. not counting error trials &#x2013; before the reward switched. Trials were grouped into &#x2018;high-reward&#x2019; and &#x2018;low-reward&#x2019; blocks for analysis. These experiments accounted for the majority of the reported results. For visually stimulated trials (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Fig 5</xref></bold>)., the animals were passively shown gratings of different contrasts while holding fixation (sine-wave gratings; contrasts doubled in steps ranging typically from 6.25&#x0025; to 100&#x0025;; mean luminance &#x003D; background luminance &#x003D; 46 cd/m<sup>2</sup>; spatial frequency: 2 cycles/deg; drift speed 4 deg/sec; diameter 2-4 deg; orientation optimized for the electrode recording site. These data are reanalyses of earlier experiments designed to relate hemodynamics to electrophysiology over a wide dynamic range of stimulated responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc7">7</xref></sup>). Reward sizes for these experiments increased progressively from a baseline (typically 0.2 ml per correct trial) to a maximum value (typically 0.6 ml per correct trial) for each successive correct fixation to keep the animals motivated. Again, the lowest reward size per day was chosen based on the animals&#x2019; willingness to work. For analysis, trials were grouped into &#x2018;high&#x2019; and &#x2018;low&#x2019; reward sets relative to the median reward.</p>

<title>Intrinsic-Signal Optical imaging (ISOI)</title>
<p>ISOI is based on the finding that in vivo, and in the visible spectrum, changes in light absorption in cortical tissue primarily measure changes in oxy and deoxyhemoglobin in the blood flowing through cortical blood vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc11">11</xref></sup>. ISOI deduces hemodynamic responses by imaging changes in light reflection at relevant wavelengths off the exposed cortical surface. In effect it is an optical analog of fMRI, albeit restricted to upper layers of exposed cortex. We imaged at 530 nm (green), an isosbestic wavelength that is equally absorbed by oxy and deoxyhemoglobin. Increased absorption of light at this wavelength thus measures increased cortical tissue fraction of hemoglobin, in effect local cortical blood volume, independent of oxygenation state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc12">12</xref></sup>. After the animals had recovered from surgery, we used this technique to image their V1 through the glass-window of the recording chamber, routinely, while they engaged in the fixation task. <bold>Imaging hardware.</bold> Consisted of the following: camera, Dalsa 1M30P (binned to 256 &#x00D7; 256 pixels, 7.5 or 15 frames per second); frame grabber, Optical PCI Bus Digital (Coreco Imaging). <bold>Imaging software:</bold> was developed in our laboratory in C&#x002B;&#x002B; based on a previously described system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc13">13</xref></sup>. <bold>Illumination,</bold> high-intensity LEDs (Agilent Technologies, Purdy Technologies) <bold>Lens:</bold> macroscope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc14">14</xref></sup> of back-to-back camera lenses focused on the cortical surface. Imaging, trial data (trial onset, stimulus onset, identity and duration, etc.) and behavioral data (eye position, pupil size, timing of fixation breaks, fixation acquisitions, trial outcome) were acquired continuously. All data analyses were performed offline using custom software in MATLAB (MathWorks; <bold>RRID:nlx_153890</bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c4">
<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Electrode recordings were made simultaneously with optical imaging. Recording electrodes (FHC, AlphaOmega; typical impedances &#x007E;600&#x2013;1,000 k&#x03A9;) were advanced into the recording chamber through a silicone-covered hole in the external glass window, using a custom-made low-profile microdrive. Recording sites were mostly, but not exclusively, confined to upper layers. Signals were recorded and amplified using a Plexon recording system (<bold>RRID:nif-0000-10382</bold>). The electrode signal was split into spiking (100 Hz to 8 kHz bandpass) and LFP (0.7&#x2013;170 Hz). Subsequently, an additional analog 2-pole 250 Hz high-pass filter was applied to spiking, effectively eliminating any spectral power overlap between LFP and spiking. No attempt was made at isolating single units and all measured spiking was multiunit activity (MUA) defined as each negative-going crossing of a threshold &#x003D; <sup>&#x007E;</sup>4&#x00D7; the r.m.s. of the baseline obtained while the animal looked at a grey screen. The LFP recording was analyzed to obtain two bandpass-limited measurements, in the beta- and theta-range frequency bands (15-25 Hz, and 3-7 Hz respectively; multi-taper spectral analysis using the Chronux MATLAB toolbox) This gave an LFP measure of (low) vigilance defined by the square root of the ratio of power in theta vs beta.</p>

<sec id="s4c5">
<title>Analysis: pre-processing</title>
<p>The imaging measurement was averaged over the imaged area, frame by frame (frame rate: 7.5 or 15 frames/sec), then divided by the mean value of this quantity for the given experiment (over all trials). This converted the measurement per image frame into <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="463042_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> i.e. the fractional change in light reflected off the cortical surface. At the particular imaging wavelength of 530 nm, the negative of this quantity, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="463042_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, is proportional to the fractional increase in local tissue hemoglobin, i.e. fractional increase in local cortical blood volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc12">12</xref></sup>. The <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="463042_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> was then detrended and a prominent pulse artifact was filtered out from the measured hemodynamics using Runline (Chronux) with a window of 2 sec. This filtered <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="463042_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> defined the measured hemodynamic response for all calculations.</p>
<p>The pulse artifact was used to estimate the instantaneous heart rate (HR) after upsampling 8x and identifying peak times and thus the local pulse rate. Both the estimated HR and the spiking measurements were then resampled and aligned to the imaging frames. Neither the imaging nor spiking nor estimated HR were further temporally filtered. Importantly, unlike in our earlier papers, we did not high-pass filter to remove slow fluctuations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc8">8</xref></sup>, specifically so as to be able to estimate fluctuations over slow time scales of many minutes.</p>

<title>Template matching (dark-room experiments: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>)</title>
<p>The amplitude and timing of the task-related response, per trial, were estimated as the height and location of the corresponding peak of a <italic>Template Match</italic>. This <italic>Template Match</italic> consisted of the continuous, normalized dot product of a template with the measured hemodynamic response. The calculation involved the following steps:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>The default template &#x2018;<italic>Tmplt</italic>&#x2019; was defined to be the one-trial-long mean hemodynamic recording (z-scored to give &#x2018;<italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)&#x2019;) aligned to trial onsets, averaged across all correct trials, and mean-subtracted.</p></list-item>
<list-item>
<p>This <italic>Tmplt</italic> was then slid over <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) in unit time steps (at the resolution of the imaging frame rate; e.g. 66.7 ms for 15 frames/s). At every time point <italic>t</italic> the <italic>Template Match</italic> was defined to be the local dot product over the one-trial-long section of <italic>H</italic> centered on <italic>t</italic>, normalized by the (fixed) sum of squares of the <italic>Tmplt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2b</xref>):
<disp-formula id="eqn1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="463042_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>This expression is identical in form to the Pearson&#x2019;s correlation between the <italic>Tmplt</italic> and the same one-trial-long segment of <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), other than the normalization. Thus, like Pearson&#x2019;s r, this expression would have local maxima where the local one-trial-long segment of <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) matched the <italic>Tmplt</italic> in shape (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2b</xref></bold>). The <italic>Template Match</italic> is also invariant to DC shifs in <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) since the <italic>Tmplt</italic> is mean-subtracted and thus integrates to zero over any constant DC. However, unlike Pearson&#x2019;s r, this expression carries scale information. Pearson&#x2019;s r has the standard deviation of both arguments in the denominator making it scale-invariant. The <italic>Template Match</italic> on the other hand, with its fixed normalization independent of <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), scales linearly with the amplitude of fluctuation in <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). Thus peaks of the <italic>Template Match</italic> carry information about both timing and amplitude of the task-related response per trial.</p></list-item>
<list-item>
<p>For computational efficiency in Matlab the above expression was rewritten as the normalized convolution of <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) with the time-reversed version of the template <italic>Tmplt</italic>:
<disp-formula id="eqn2"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="463042_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>TmpltTR</italic> is the time-reversed <italic>Tmplt</italic>, i.e. <italic>TmpltTR</italic> &#x003D; <italic>Tmplt</italic>(&#x2212;<italic>t</italic>) and the symbol &#x2018;&#x002A;&#x2019; denotes convolution. The denominator for normalization remains unchanged. This expression translated to the following script using Matlab functions <italic>conv</italic> and <italic>sum</italic>:
<disp-formula id="eqn3"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="463042_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Peaks of <italic>Template Match</italic> were then identified as zero crossings of the first derivative at points where the second derivative was negative (marked by red dots in Fig <bold>2b</bold>).</p></list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Alternate template matches used the same formalism but with different definitions of <italic>Tmplt</italic>. Thus the <italic>Tmplt</italic> in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold> was defined as the one-trial-long mean <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) aligned to a point one quarter trial ahead of trial onsets, averaged across all correct trials, and mean-subtracted. All other steps were the same</p></list-item></list></p>

<p>This involved two separate sets of steps.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Estimating the task-related response from the net recorded hemodynamic response</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>We modeled the net recorded response as a linear sum of stimulus-evoked and task-related components. The stimulus-evoked response was modeled as the convolution of concurrent spiking with an <italic>HRF</italic> kernel. The task-related component was estimated iteratively. Our earlier approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc6">6</xref></sup> had modeled it as a stereotyped task-related function (&#x2018;<italic>TRF</italic>&#x2019;) that was identical in timing and amplitude for each correct trial. Here, however, we specifically need to estimate trial-by-trial variations in response timing and amplitude. As a first step, we assumed that the <italic>TRF</italic> had a fixed shape that could be estimated from the mean across trials. Optimal mean <italic>HRF</italic> and <italic>TRF</italic> kernels were obtained by fitting the mean recorded responses, separated by contrast, with the following equation, identical to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq 1</xref> in ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc6">6</xref></sup>:
<disp-formula id="eqn4"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="463042_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p><italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the recorded hemodynamics and <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) the concurrently measured spiking, and <italic>HRF</italic> &#x002A; <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) models the stimulus-evoked response. The second term on the RHS models the task-related response as a <italic>TRF</italic> kernel convolved with the set of delta functions at trial onsets, <italic>&#x2018;Trl</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)<italic>&#x2019;</italic>. The symbol &#x2018;&#x002A;&#x2019; denotes convolution over time.</p>
<p>The <italic>HRF</italic> kernel was parametrized, as before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc8">8</xref></sup>, as a Gamma-variate function of time <italic>t</italic>:
<disp-formula id="eqn5"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="463042_eqn5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The <italic>HRF</italic> parameters fitted during optimization are the amplitude <italic>A</italic>, time to peak <italic>&#x03C4;</italic>, and full width at half maximum <italic>W</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc16">16</xref></sup>. The factor <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="463042_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The <italic>TRF</italic> kernel was parametrized as the finite sum of a Fourier time series:
<disp-formula id="eqn6"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="463042_eqn6.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Although the Fourier series was based on the trial period <italic>T</italic>, the fundamental Fourier period was allowed to vary as a fraction <italic>P</italic> of the trial period and optimized in the fit. The parameters <italic>a<sub>n</sub></italic> and <italic>b<sub>n</sub></italic>, (with <italic>n</italic> ranging from 1 to the total number of terms in the Fourier series, <italic>N</italic>) are the pairs of cosine and sine coefficients, respectively, for the <italic>n</italic>th Fourier term. We showed earlier that only the fundamental and first harmonic, i.e. <italic>N</italic> &#x003D;2, carry significant information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc6">6</xref></sup>. Thus there are 8 parameters in the model: 3 for the <italic>HRF</italic>, the 2 pairs of <italic>a<sub>n</sub></italic> and <italic>b<sub>n</sub></italic>, and <italic>P</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item>
<p>All parameters were optimized simultaneously by matching the predicted to the measured hemodynamics using a downhill simplex algorithm (<italic>fminsearch</italic>, MATLAB methods as in ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc7">7</xref></sup>). To keep contrast information, we made concatenated sequences of the mean response per distinct contrast, randomized per contrast (same random sequence for hemo, and spiking), and over multiple blocks (an arbitrarily large number 52, about 100x larger than a single <italic>HRF</italic> kernel convolution length, to minimize edge effects; we only matched traces two convolution lengths in from the edge). The error to be minimized was defined as the normalized sum squared error <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="463042_inline7.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> calculated separately per contrast and then averaged over all contrasts including the blank. This was intended to give equal weight to the fractional error at each stimulus contrast. The goodness of fit <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> for the optimal prediction was defined as the coefficient of determination <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="463042_inline8.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> calculated separately per contrast and then averaged across contrasts. This, again, was intended to give equal weight to errors at each contrast. In order to reduce the chances of getting caught in a local minimum we started with large sets of initial parameter values, independently covering an order of magnitude for each fitted parameter. The fits were robust and converged to the same optimal parameters from multiple starting values, giving us confidence that we had reached global and not local minima.</p></list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Next we used the optimal fitted <italic>HRF</italic> thus obtained from the mean hemo and spiking, averaged per contrast, to get a continuous estimate of the exogenous, stimulus-evoked component of measured hemodynamics. This was done by convolving the optimal <italic>HRF</italic> with the measured spiking:

<p>The estimate of the task-related response <italic>H<sub>TASK</sub></italic><sub>&#x2013;<italic>RELATED</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) as defined above was then used, exactly like the full hemodynamic response in the dark-room, to estimate response times and amplitudes trial by trial.

Sequences lasting &#x003E; 500 ms were categorized as eye closures and their durations were included in the moving average.</p></list-item>

<title>Deconvolution, i.e. multilinear regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8</xref>)</title>
<p>We started with the assumption that the measured hemodynamics <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) can be predicted from local spiking <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) using a homogeneous linear equation, along with two inhomogeneous terms: a DC offset, and a linear slope (in the vector space of each 150-sec window, at the resolution of the camera frame rate):
<disp-formula id="eqn9"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="463042_eqn9.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>There are no assumptions about the shape of the <italic>HRF</italic> other than that it does not extend more than 10 sec prior to time 0, and is back to baseline about 25 sec after time 0. Using the formalism of deconvolution, this expression can be rewritten as a matrix equation
<disp-formula id="eqn10"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="463042_eqn10.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Where <italic>H</italic> is a column vector of recorded hemodynamic responses (at the temporal resolution of the camera frame rate, 15 Hz), <italic>S</italic> is the spiking regressor expanded into a stimulus convolution matrix (SCM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc21">21</xref></sup>, the symbol &#x2018;&#x00D7;&#x2019; indicates matrix multiplication and <italic>HRF</italic>, <italic>DC</italic> and <italic>Lin</italic> here refer to the same terms as in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10">Eq 10</xref> but expressed as column vectors. The SCM was constructed as a Toeplitz matrix comprising a horizontal concatenation of spiking column vectors, with circular time shifts ranging from &#x2212;10 sec to &#x002B;25 sec relative to t&#x003D;0. Formally, the SCM <italic>S</italic> can be extended (&#x2018;<italic>S<sub>e</sub></italic>&#x2019;) to incorporate the <italic>DC</italic> and <italic>Lin</italic> by horizontally concatenating the two additional column vectors: a column of ones for the DC, a linear ramp from &#x2212;1 to 1 for the slope. The corresponding <italic>HRF</italic> can be formally extended (&#x2018;<italic>HRF<sub>e</sub></italic>&#x2019;) by two coefficients, one for the <italic>DC</italic> and another for the <italic>Lin</italic>.
<disp-formula id="eqn11"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="463042_eqn11.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Assuming that any noise is Gaussian and zero-mean, the optimal deconvolved <italic>HRF<sub>e</sub></italic> can then be estimated using a least-squares solution to the linear regression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc21">21</xref></sup>:

The full prediction using the optimal deconvolved <italic>HRF<sub>e</sub></italic> kernel is then computed using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Eq 11</xref>. Similarly, just the (linear, homogeneous) phasic prediction from spiking is obtained by taking the matrix multiplication over all column vectors of <italic>S<sub>e</sub></italic> save the last two, with all coefficients of the deconvolved <italic>HRF<sub>e</sub></italic> save the last two. Conversely, just the DC term or just the slope term are obtained by appropriately multiplying the last two column vectors of <italic>S<sub>e</sub></italic> with the corresponding last two coefficients of the deconvolved <italic>HRF<sub>e</sub></italic>.</p>

<title>Getting bootstrap estimates for significance (p values)</title>
<p>All comparisons between distributions of amplitudes or peak times were tested for significance by bootstrapping, typically using 10,000 resamples with replacement. In cases with different numbers of trials for high and low reward, the smaller number of trials was chosen to make the bootstrap comparison. For comparing response amplitudes (e.g. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3b</xref></bold>) we tested for the median of high-reward amplitudes being &#x003E; that for low-reward amplitudes over the set of all resamples, against the null hypothesis that this difference has zero mean. We also tested for the complement, i.e. that median of low-reward amplitudes &#x003E; that of high-reward amplitudes. For comparing widths of peak time distributions (e.g. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3a</xref></bold>) we first calculated the 2&#x03C3; width (specifically, the &#x002B;/- 34<sup>th</sup> percentile around the median, given the non-normal distribution) of each bootstrapped set of peak times, separately for high and low reward. We then tested for 2&#x03C3; for high reward &#x003C; for low reward over the set of all resamples, against the null hypothesis that the difference has zero mean. We also tested for the complement, i.e. that 2&#x03C3; for low reward &#x003C; for high reward.</p>

<title>Fitting spiking to dark-room hemodynamic response using gamma-variate <italic>HRF</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig 1</xref>)</title>
<p>To link to spiking, the dark-room response was modeled as a homogeneous prediction from spiking, fitted by optimizing a gamma-variate <italic>HRF</italic> kernel using <italic>fminsearch</italic> as described above:

The observed tighter clustering of response times for high reward could result from a corresponding clustering of fixation onsets (consider projection of red dots, vs. blue dots on the Response Time axis). <bold>b:</bold> Relationship between measured response time, estimated as usual with a template match, and fixation onset, in an early recording session. Animals tended to hold fixation for extended periods prior to trial onset, even across multiple trials. <bold>c:</bold> Relationship between response time and fix onset in a late recording session. Animals tended to move their eyes a lot during intertrial intervals, fixating shortly before trial onset. For both cases &#x2018;b&#x2019; and &#x2018;c&#x2019; response times were independent of fixation onset and very different from the pattern expected for the null hypothesis. In both data sets response times for high-reward trials showed visibly lower scatter independent of fix onset.</p>

<p>High reward does not correlate with tighter eye movements. <bold>a1</bold>: Mean radial eye movement per intertrial interval in an early recording session. Each dot represents a single trial (mean eye movement during 7-sec intertrial intervals per 9 sec trial.). Horizontal lines, median eye movement per block of high or low reward (blocks with varying numbers (13-31) of correct trials each). Intertrial eye movements were higher in low-reward blocks. <bold>a2:</bold> Histogram of mean eye movement per trial. <bold>a3:</bold> Relationship between response time and eye movement per trial, colored by reward size. <bold>b1:</bold> Mean radial eye movement in a later recording session (12-sec intertrial intervals in 16-sec trials; alternating blocks of 10 correct trials each; all other conventions as in panel a1). Eye movements were higher in high-reward blocks. <bold>b2:</bold> Corresponding histogram of mean eye movements per trial. <bold>b3</bold>: Response time vs eye movement, per trial colored by reward size. Low reward leads to wider scatter of response times in both panels (a3) and (b3) despite opposite effects on intertrial eye movement.</p>

<p>Estimating Task-Related Response and its Template Match in the Presence of Visual Stimulation (one example data set). <bold>a-c:</bold> Estimating optimal fitted parameters (see <bold>Methods, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">6</xref></bold>). <bold>a:</bold> The mean hemodynamic response per stimulus contrast (see key), averaged across trials. The response is modeled as the sum of: the stimulus-evoked component (b), and the task-related component (c). The stimulus-evoked component is modeled as the convolution <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="463042_inline9.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of the measured spiking with a gamma-variate HRF kernel (inset). The mean task-related component is modeled as the convolution of delta functions at trial onset with a &#x2018;Mean TRF&#x2019; kernel comprising a partial Fourier sum with its fundamental at the trial period (inset). Earlier work showed that the fundamental and the first harmonic terms of the Fourier series are adequate. Insets show the optimal fitted Gamma Variate HRF (in b) and optimal mean TRF (in c) respectively. <bold>d:</bold> Set of traces illustrating the process of estimating the residual task-related response, and then estimating its timing and amplitude per trial by matching to a template (see Methods, <bold><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq 7</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">8</xref></bold>). &#x2018;Spiking&#x2019;, &#x2018;Hemo&#x2019;: full measured responses, individually z-scored. &#x2018;Hemo (predicted from spiking):&#x2019; is the convolution of the spiking response with the optimal fitted HRF ((b), inset). Subtracting this from the measured Hemo gives the residual &#x2018;Hemo (Unpredicted by spiking)&#x2018; which we defined to be the task-related response. The moving-window dot product of this residual with the template (the optimal fitted mean TRF ((c), inset) gives the &#x2018;Template Match&#x2019; (shifted up for visibility). Timing and amplitude of task-related responses, per trial, are defined to be the location and height of each Template Match peak, as for the dark-room task. <bold>e:</bold> Set of all residual task-related responses, converted back from z-scored values, separated into trials grouped by reward size. The same data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5a</xref>.</p>
