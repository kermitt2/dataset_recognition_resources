<title>Summary</title>
<p>Bacteria have long been recognized to be capable of entering a phenotypically non-growing persister state, in which the cells exhibit an extended regrowth lag and a multidrug tolerance, thus posing a great challenge in treating infectious diseases. Owing to their non-inheritability, low abundance of existence, lack of metabolic activities, and high heterogeneity, properties of persisters remain poorly understood. Here, we report our accidental discovery of a hitherto unreported subcellular structure that we term the regrowth-delay body, which is formed only in non-growing bacterial cells and sequesters multiple key proteins. As of now, this structure, that dissolves when the cell resumes growth, is the most distinguishable subcellular structure marking persisters. Our studies also indicate that persisters exhibit different depth of persistence, as determined by the status of their regrowth-delay bodies. Our findings imply that suppressing the formation and/or promoting the dissolution of regrowth-delay bodies could be viable strategies for eradicating persisters.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>It has been well documented that, in a genetically homogeneous population of bacterial cells, a subset are able to enter a phenotypically dormant, non-growing (or, more precisely, of low metabolic activity) state. This state has been variably named as sporulation, latency, regrowth lag, persisters, or the viable but nonculturable, in laboratory, clinical, or environmental microbiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Burke et al., 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chesney, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kaprelyants et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lewis, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Monod, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roszak and Colwell, 1987</xref>). Although this state of bacterial cells has been recognized for more than 100 years, much remain unknown on its properties, such as how the bacterial cells enter, maintain and exit such a unique state, that is best known for its non-inheritable multidrug tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Balaban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kaldalu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lewis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pinto et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The regrowth lag phenomenon, initially recognized by Max Muller in 1895 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chesney, 1916</xref>), was observed as soon as bacterial culturing became feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coplans, 1910</xref>), but remains the most poorly understood stage of the bacterial growth cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Monod, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rolfe et al., 2012</xref>). In a related phenomenon, bacterial dormancy was defined as a state of certain bacterial cells that exhibits a long-lasting regrowth lag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Burke et al., 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chesney, 1916</xref>). Later, the term persister was coined to denote an extremely small subpopulation of dormant, non-dividing bacterial cells that are not killed by concentrations of antibiotics sufficiently high to kill the actively dividing ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bigger, 1944</xref>). The persisters were presumed to be responsible for the post-treatment relapse of bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bigger, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lewis, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mcdermott, 1958</xref>). It was emphasized that the persisters are not resistant to antibiotics, since they produce offspring that are as susceptible to antibiotics as their parent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bigger, 1944</xref>). More recently, it was unveiled that the bacterial cells in the natural environment are commonly in a viable but nonculturable dormant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayrapetyan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Xu et al., 1982</xref>), one that is highly similar to the persisters.</p>
<p>Although much effort has been made to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to the formation of persisters, and certain specific protein factors (like the Hip) or small molecules (like the pppGpp) have been claimed to be important for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Black et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Moyed and Bertrand, 1983</xref>), not much is certain up to now (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Balaban et al, 2013</xref>; Kaldalu et al, 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Korch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chowdhury et al., 2016</xref>). The slow pace of learning about this state of bacterial cells is apparently attributed to the great technical difficulty of unequivocally identifying them, which are presumed to exist in extremely small numbers in a genetically uniform population, often with no significant morphological distinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Balaban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kaldalu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kell et al., 2015</xref>). Because of this, persisters have been hitherto commonly perceived only on the basis of their lack of growth and multidrug tolerance. In particular, persisters have been conventionally detected by indirectly measuring the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) after treating the cell samples with a high concentration of a certain antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jiafeng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Orman and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>), or as cells that do not grow in the presence, but regrow after the removal, of antibiotics when monitored with a microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We have been trying to explore proteins when they are present in living bacterial cells, as by performing protein photo-crosslinking analysis mediated by genetically introduced unnatural amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). In one recent study, we examined the assembly patterns of the FtsZ protein, which plays an essential role by assembling into the Z-ring structure for each bacterial cell to divide into two via the cytokinesis process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dai and Lutkenhaus, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Erickson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Haeusser and Margolin, 2016</xref>), as well as for each mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beech et al., 2000</xref>) or chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">TerBush et al., 2013</xref>) to divide into two. In particular, we revealed hitherto unreported lateral interactions between the FtsZ protofilaments that are essential for FtsZ to assemble into the dynamic Z-ring structure in living bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Guan et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>As an exciting byproduct of that study, we accidentally revealed the presence of a novel reversible subcellular structure that we named it as the regrowth-delay body. This structure is formed in non-growing late stationary-phase bacterial cells and sequesters multiple proteins essential for cell growth. Remarkably, the regrowth-delay bodies become dissolved when a bacterial cell exits the regrowth lag and resumes growth, meanwhile releasing the sequestered proteins for re-functioning. We also demonstrated that a higher degree of regrowth-delay body formation is correlated to a longer duration of regrowth lag as well as a higher level of antibiotic tolerance, not only in <italic>E. coli</italic> but also in two bacterial pathogens. Therefore, the regrowth-delay body not only acts as a unique and highly valuable biomarker for distinguishing the non-growing dormant persister cells from the actively growing non-persister cells, but also acts as a dynamic biological timer for bacterial cells to exit the regrowth lag. Our studies also indicate that each persister exhibits a particular depth of persistence, which seems to explain the long-observed heterogeneous nature of the persister subpopulation. Our findings should be proven greatly valuable not only for specifically identify and explore the persisters in any cell population, but also for designing viable strategies to eradicate the formidable multidrug-tolerant pathogenic persisters.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>The cell division protein FtsZ no longer self-assembles but exists as an insoluble form in non-growing bacterial cells</title>
<p>In an attempt to unveil how FtsZ assembles into the dynamic Z-ring structure during the cytokinesis of bacterial cell division, we performed systematic protein photo-crosslinking analyses with FtsZ variants containing the genetically introduced photoactive unnatural amino acid pBpa (<italic>p</italic>-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chin et al., 2002</xref>) in living bacterial cells. This allowed us to uncover novel lateral interactions between the FtsZ protofilaments that were demonstrated to be essential for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Guan et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>During these studies, out of curiosity, we additionally examined the status of FtsZ in non-dividing/non-growing bacterial cells, as has never been addressed by people working with FtsZ. We revealed, as expected, that a FtsZ variant, though self-assembled into homo-oligomers in actively dividing cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A</xref></bold>, lanes 2 and 6), no longer does so (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A</xref></bold>, lanes 4 and 8) in the non-dividing/non-growing cells. Astonishingly, we observed that most of the free FtsZ monomers, together with almost all the photo-crosslinked products, were detected in the insoluble pellet fraction of lysates of the non-growing cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1B</xref></bold>, lane 8). By contrast, all the photo-crosslinked FtsZ dimers and the free FtsZ monomers were principally detected in the soluble supernatant fractions of lysates of actively dividing cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1B</xref></bold>, lane 3).</p>
<p>In light of this puzzling observation, we then examined the distribution pattern of the endogenous FtsZ (instead of the FtsZ variant we examined above) in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Likewise, we revealed that the endogenous FtsZ protein was largely detected in the soluble supernatant fraction of actively dividing cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>, lane 2), but in the insoluble pellet fraction of the non-dividing/non-growing cells (lane 6). As comparison, we demonstrated that EF-Tu (one of the most abundant proteins in bacterial cells) and GroEL (a molecular chaperone binding to misfolded client proteins) were both largely detected in the supernatant fraction (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>, lanes 2 and 5), with hardly any in the pellet fraction (lanes 3 and 6) of either actively dividing or non-dividing cells. Taken together, these results revealed for the first time that the FtsZ protein (as well as proteins interacting with it) exists as an insoluble form in non-dividing/non-growing bacterial cells.</p>

<title>The FtsZ protein exists in two cell-pole granules in each non-growing bacterial cell</title>
<p>We subsequently tried to monitor the status of FtsZ by performing live-cell imaging analysis. For this purpose, we started by heterologously expressing FtsZ-mNeonGreen, a form of FtsZ being fused to the green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen, in bacterial cells. Here, the fusion protein was expressed at a relatively low level, which was achieved via the leaky transcription of the Tet promoter (i.e., with no addition of the inducing agent), such that the fluorescent FtsZ fusion protein would be incorporated into, but not interrupt, the Z-ring structure that was largely formed via the assembly of endogenous wild type FtsZ. We first verified an effective incorporation of FtsZ-mNeonGreen into the Z-ring structure in actively dividing log-phase cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>, top), like what was reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ma et al., 1996</xref>). Remarkably, we then detected FtsZ-mNeonGreen as two cell pole-granules in each non-dividing cell (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>, bottom). As a control, the unfused fluorescent mNeonGreen protein was shown to be evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of either actively-dividing or non-dividing bacterial cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>For further systematic live-cell imaging analysis, we subsequently constructed a bacterial strain whose genome was modified to express FtsZ-mNeonGreen (rather than from a plasmid), in parallel with the normally expressed endogenous FtsZ. In particular, we integrated the <italic>ftsZ</italic>-<italic>mNeonGreen</italic> gene into the genomic rhamnose operon (as illustrated in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3A</xref></bold>) and demonstrated that the FtsZ-mNeonGreen protein would be produced only in the presence of rhamnose (the inducing sugar) in this <italic>ftsZ-mNeonGreen</italic> strain (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3B</xref></bold>), hardly affecting the growth of the cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3C</xref></bold>). We also verified the presence of FtsZ-mNeonGreen in the Z-ring structure in actively dividing log-phase but in the cell-pole granules in non-dividing late stationary-phase <italic>ftsZ</italic>-<italic>mNeonGreen</italic> cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Our live-cell imaging analysis employing this <italic>ftsZ</italic>-<italic>mNeonGreen</italic> strain revealed that the cell-pole granules seem to be closely associated with the inner membrane but not surrounded by it (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4A</xref></bold>, middle panel), as verified by results (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4B</xref></bold>) of staining with the membrane-specific dye FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fishov and Woldringh, 1999</xref>). These imaging results meanwhile demonstrated that the cell-pole granules occupy cytosolic locations that are hardly accessible to other cytosolic proteins (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4A</xref></bold>, bottom panel), suggesting a compact nature. In line with this, we observed that these granules were maintained intact even after the cells were broken (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4C</xref></bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>The FtsZ protein in cell-pole granules are apparently folded</title>
<p>Aggregates of misfolded proteins have been reported to exist at the poles in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, but only under heat shock conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lindner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Winkler et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, insoluble proteins, which were naturally assumed to be misfolded, have been reported to accumulate in stationary-phase <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kwiatkowska et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Leszczynska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Maisonneuve et al., 2008</xref>). In view of these reports, we then attempted to clarify the folding status of FtsZ in the cell-pole granules, despite the fact that FtsZ was demonstrated to exist in a soluble form when heterologously over-expressed in bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering that the molecular chaperones DnaK and ClpB, as well as the protease ClpP were reported to be associated with protein aggregates formed under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Winkler et al., 2010</xref>), we decided to analyze whether or not they are associated with the cell-pole granules. Our blotting analysis demonstrated that all these three quality control proteins were primarily detected in the supernatant (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5A</xref></bold>, lane 2) with hardly any detected in the pellet (lane 3) of non-growing late stationary-phase cell lysates. In line with this, our live-cell imaging data showed that neither DnaK nor ClpB, each being expressed as a form fused to the red fluorescent protein mCherry (by manipulating their endogenous genes on the genomic DNA of the <italic>ftsZ</italic>-<italic>mNeonGreen</italic> strain), was detected in the cell-pole granules (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>, bottom panels). The imaging data meanwhile revealed, interestingly, that both DnaK and ClpB, though being evenly dispersed in the cytosol of actively dividing log-phase cells, were concentrated near the two cell poles, at sites very close to but clearly separate from the FtsZ-containing cell-pole granules, but only in a small number of the non-growing late stationary-phase cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>, bottom panels). These subcellular sites, which might represent ones where DnaK and ClpB (themselves being in soluble forms, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5A</xref></bold>) were co-localized with certain form of protein aggregates, are worth further investigation in the future. Taken together, these results did not provide evidence to support the possibility that the cell-pole granules are typical aggregates formed by misfolded proteins.</p>
<p>As an attempt to further assess the folding status of FtsZ in the cell-pole granules, we examined whether inhibitor proteins that only bind to folded FtsZ could prevent FtsZ from entering the granules. For this purpose, we analyzed the CbtA and KilR proteins, each of which was known to bind to and to block monomeric FtsZ for assembling into the Z-ring structure in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Conter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Heller et al., 2017</xref>). Either CbtA or KilR was then expressed from a plasmid, under the control of an anhydrotetracycline-inducible promoter. We first verified their capacity to inhibit FtsZ from assembling into the Z-ring structure in actively dividing log-phase <italic>ftsZ-mNeonGreen</italic> cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We then showed that FtsZ was no longer able to enter the cell-pole granules when the CbtA expression was induced at the stationary phase (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>, left panel). A similar effect was not observed when KilR was induced (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5C</xref></bold>). In agreement with these findings, our immunoblotting analysis confirmed that FtsZ became undetectable in the pellet fraction but remained in the supernatant when CbtA was expressed (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>, right panel).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the conclusion that FtsZ in the cell-pole granules is folded was also supported by our <italic>in vivo</italic> protein photo-crosslinking analysis. Specifically, the data (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5D</xref></bold>) reveal that when the unnatural amino acid residue pBpa was placed at residue positions close to each other in space (e.g., positions 151, 166 and 174, or 31, 47, 51 and 54) according to the reported crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">L&#x00F6;we and Amos, 1998</xref>), similar patterns of photo-crosslinked products were generated. By contrast, when pBpa was placed at sites that were spatially distant (e.g., positions 61, 85, 299, and 340), different patterns of photo-crosslinked products were detected.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results strongly support the conclusion that FtsZ in the granules is folded, rather than misfolded.</p>

<title>The cell-pole granules become dissolved in cells exiting their regrowth lag and resuming growth</title>
<p>We next sought to decipher the fate of the cell-pole granules when the bacterial cells resume their growth. For this purpose, we re-cultured the non-growing late stationary-phase <italic>ftsZ-mNeonGreen</italic> cells in fresh culture medium lacking the inducer rhamnose to avoid the production of new FtsZ-mNeonGreen protein. Remarkably, we observed an effective relocation of FtsZ-mNeonGreen from the cell-pole granules to the Z-ring structure that was formed in cells ending their regrowth lag and resuming the growth (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>, exemplified by the cells circled with dashed pink or white lines). These newly assembled Z-ring structures seemed to be fully functional since they enabled the mother cells to split into two daughter cells (e.g., the cell circled with dashed pink lines at 80 min divided into two daughter cells at 120 min in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). Of equal importance, cells that remained in the regrowth lag state all retained their cell-pole granules (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>, exemplified by the cells circled with red dashed lines).</p>

<p>Worth of high attention, when the non-growing late stationary-phase <italic>ftsZ-mNeonGreen</italic> cells were recultured in fresh liquid medium lacking rhamnose to the log phase (with an OD<sub>600</sub> of &#x223C;0.5), we observed the maintenance of the cell-pole granules in an extremely small number of cells (as represented by the cell circled with red dashed lines in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>), with all other cells being actively dividing. In our opinion, there is little doubt that such an inert cell, which is resistant to antibiotic killing (as to be shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref>)</bold>, should represent the long-searched and elusive persisters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bigger, 1944</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess whether such dissolution of the cell-pole granules could occur in the absence of any new synthesis of proteins in the cells, we repeated the above analysis by adding chloramphenicol, a ribosome-binding antibiotic that is known to inhibit protein synthesis in bacterial cells, to the fresh culture medium. Interestingly, we still observed an effective dissolution of the cell-pole granules in cells exiting the regrowth-lag and resuming growth (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>, cells circled with white dashed lines), and we even occasionally observed the re-formation of Z-ring structures in certain cells (as indicated by the arrow). Of note, here the Z-ring structure would have to be formed mainly by using the FtsZ stored in and released from the cell-pole granules, but fluorescently labeled by a small amount of the incorporated FtsZ-mNeonGreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ma et al., 1996</xref>), also released from the granules. We again observed the cell-pole granules to be effectively retained in cells that remained in the regrowth-lag (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>, exemplified by the cell circled with red dashed lines). In agreement with these live-cell imaging data, our immunoblotting analysis verified a time-dependent decrease of FtsZ in the insoluble pellet (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig. S6</xref></bold>, lanes 3, 6, and 9), with a corresponding increase of FtsZ in the soluble supernatant (lanes 2, 5 and 8) when the non-growing wild-type late stationary-phase cells were re-cultured in fresh LB (Lysogeny Broth) medium containing chloramphenicol.</p>
<p>Importantly, the results displayed in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref></bold> also revealed that the cell-pole granules present in different individual cells seem to exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity. Specifically, the cell-pole granules became totally dissolved, partially dissolved, or remained almost completely unaltered depending on the particular cell (clearly shown by the cells viewed at 120 min in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref></bold> as well as those at 90 min in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). These data meanwhile suggest that an effective dissolution of the cell-pole granules is a prerequisite for a cell to end its regrowth-lag and resume growth, whereas the lack of their dissolution marks the maintenance of the non-growing persister state for a cell (as represented by the one shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>).</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>The cell-pole granules are formed in a highly heterogeneous manner in different individual cells and in a progressive manner in each cell</title>
<p>We next attempted to learn more about the nature of the manifested heterogeneity of the cell-pole granules (as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref></bold>), by examining their formation process in the non-growing bacterial cells. For this purpose, we initially planned to employ a microfluidic chip device to monitor both the formation, during the non-growing phase, and the dissolution, during the regrowth phase, of the cell-pole granules in single <italic>ftsZ-mNeonGreen</italic> cells. Unfortunately, our efforts were unsuccessful, mainly because we were unable to set up a culturing condition under which the cell-pole granules were formed in the bacterial cells being placed in the available microfluidic system (likely due to a lack of high cell density or other unknown factors). Given this failed attempt, we then decided to address this issue by analyzing the cell population.</p>
<p>We started by conducting a qualitative live-cell imaging analysis to assess how cell-pole granules are formed in the non-growing <italic>ftsZ</italic>-<italic>mNeonGreen</italic> cells along the culturing process. The data, displayed in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>, revealed that the formation of cell-pole granules appears to occur in a progressive manner in each individual cell, as the sizes of the cell-pole granules appeared to be different in different individual cells. Meanwhile, the data indicates a high heterogeneity in regards to the formation of cell-pole granules among the cell population. For instance, at 15 h of culturing, cell-pole granules are formed in some of the cells, while a small portion of other cells (indicated by the red arrow) were still dividing (i.e., with Z-ring structures remained visible).</p>
<p>Subsequently, we performed a quantitative live-cell imaging analysis to calculate the percentage of cells in which cell-pole granules were formed at the different culturing time points. As displayed in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>, the percentage of cells containing the cell-pole granules clearly increased along the culturing process (data being shown in an accumulative manner at each time point). Together, these results indicate that the cell-pole granules are formed in a highly heterogeneous manner among the individual bacterial cells and in a progressive fashion in each individual cell.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Bacterial cells containing more aged cell-pole granules stay in their regrowth-lag state for longer duration</title>
<p>To uncover the potential differences between the cell-pole granules present at different stationary-phase culturing time points, we measured the percentage of cells that retained their cell-pole granules (thus remaining in a regrowth-lag state) after being recultured in chloramphenicol-containing (and rhamnose-lacking) fresh medium for 30 min. This condition, being similar to that under which the 30 min imaging data shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref></bold> was obtained, represents one under which cells whose cell-pole granules become fully dissolved (thus exiting the regrowth-lag state) could be effectively distinguished from the cells whose cell-pole granules remained largely unaltered (thus remaining in the regrowth-lag state).</p>
<p>The data, shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref></bold> (red columns) clearly indicate that a higher percentage of cells remained in the regrowth-lag state when the non-growing cell samples were taken from a later stationary phase culturing point. A regression analysis revealed the best fit between the percentages of cells remaining in regrowth-lag state during reculturing and the percentages of cells whose cell-pole granules had existed for more than 3 hours during the stationary-phase (pink columns in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3C</xref></bold>). These data suggest that for each individual bacterial cell, the more aged its cell-pole granules, the longer its duration of regrowth lag.</p>
<p>This correlation between the duration of the regrowth-lag and the age of the cell-pole granules was further demonstrated by comparing the average re-division initial doubling times (re-division <italic>T</italic><sub>id</sub>) manifested by the cells that were taken from different stationary-phase culturing time points and recultured. Here, for each cell sample, the re-division <italic>T</italic><sub>id</sub> value was calculated based on its re-culturing growth curve (as displayed in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Fig. S7</xref></bold>), and reflects its duration of regrowth-lag. The data, presented in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>, clearly reveal a higher re-division <italic>T</italic><sub>id</sub> value for a cell sample taken from a later culturing point in the stationary phase. Collectively, these results suggest that for each bacterial cell the duration of its regrowth-lag is apparently related to the status of its cell-pole granules. In light of this, we hereafter designate the cell-pole granule as the regrowth-delay body.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Bacterial cells containing the regrowth-delay bodies are multidrug tolerant</title>
<p>We then assessed whether bacterial cells that contain regrowth-delay bodies are tolerant to multiple antibiotics, being a major feature attributed to persisters. To this end, we first compared the antibiotic tolerance capacity of the non-growing cells taken from different stationary-phase culturing time points. The data clearly show that the bacterial cells derived from a later culturing point, thus possessing a higher level of aged regrowth-delay bodies, exhibited a significantly higher level of tolerance towards the two examined antibiotics, either ofloxacin or ampicillin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>). More importantly, our live-cell imaging data provide direct evidence showing that bacterial cells retaining their regrowth-delay bodies would effectively survive the ampicillin treatment during the re-culturing process (as represented by the cell circled by red dashed lines in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref></bold>). By contrast, cells having their regrowth-delay body dissolved would be efficiently killed (eventually lysed) under the same reculturing condition (as represented by the cell circled by while dashed lines in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Collectively, our observations, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></bold>, strongly suggest that the regrowth-delay bodies serve as effectively markers for the non-growing and antibiotic-tolerant bacterial persisters. It follows that the presence of regrowth-delay bodies would help us to efficiently identify the tiny subpopulation of persisters present in a large population of actively growing bacterial cell (as exemplified by the data shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). Our data meanwhile implicate that persister cells are in different depth of persistence depending on the age of their regrowth-delay bodies.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>The formation of regrowth-delay bodies selectively sequesters multiple key proteins</title>
<p>We next attempted to characterize the composition of the regrowth-delay bodies to learn more about the properties of bacterial persisters. For this goal, we first tried to identify the proteins that are photo-crosslinked to multiple pBpa variants of the FtsZ protein in the non-growing late stationary phase cells. Specifically, we purified the photo-crosslinked products of five FtsZ variants with pBpa introduced at residue position 140 (lane 8 in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1B</xref></bold>), 47, 51, 61 or 166 (lanes 10, 12, 16 or 4, respectively, in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5D</xref></bold>), each representing a different pattern of photo-crosslinked products, by affinity chromatography via the Avi tag fused to the FtsZ protein. The proteins were identified via mass spectrometry analysis and are listed in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8A</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>In light that intact regrowth-delay bodies were present in the pellet fraction (as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4C</xref></bold>), we also performed mass spectrometry analysis on the collected pellet of the lysed wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, with the major proteins identified being also listed in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8A</xref></bold>. A functional annotation of these identified proteins revealed their key roles in cell growth (such as translation and transcription) and division, which in part explains why their sequestering in the regrowth-delay bodies could keep the bacterial cells in a non-growing state. Of note, some of the proteins (colored blue in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8A</xref></bold>) were identified by both mass spectrometry analyses.</p>
<p>We subsequently performed experiments to verify the presence of some of these identified proteins (other than FtsZ) in the regrowth-delay bodies. We first confirmed by live-cell imaging analysis that ZapC and FtsA (each being fused to mNeonGreen), two additional cell division proteins identified, were both clearly detected in the regrowth-delay bodies as present in the non-growing late stationary-phase cells, though in the Z-ring structure in actively dividing log-phase cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>). We also demonstrated that FtsA (as fused to the red fluorescent protein mCherry) co-localizes with FtsZ (as fused to mNeonGreen) in the regrowth-delay bodies present either in living cells or in the lysates (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8B</xref></bold>). By contrast, FtsL and ZapA, two non-identified cell division proteins, were neither detected in the regrowth-delay bodies, but evenly distributed in the cytosol in the non-growing late stationary-phase cells, while clearly detected in the Z-ring structures in actively dividing log-phase cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We then verified the apparent presence of five more identified proteins. In particular, they, each being expressed as an Avi-tagged form and under the control of a constitutive promoter, were detected to a significant degree in the insoluble pellet fraction of lysates of the non-growing late stationary-phase cells, though largely present in the supernatant of lysates of actively dividing log-phase cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). Interestingly, among these five proteins, the three that were known to be essential for cell growth (i.e., ribosomal protein S5, tryptophan-tRNA ligase, and transcriptional factor sigmaS) were almost fully detected in the pellet fraction (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). Of note, the sigmaS protein is known to be degraded in actively dividing log-phase cells and accumulates only in non-growing stationary-phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhou and Gottesman, 1998</xref>). Taken together, these protein characterization and verification studies clearly suggest that the regrowth-delay bodies sequester multiple important proteins that function in cell growth and division, which in turn conceivably keep the cells in the non-growing persister state.</p>
<p>Additionally, we demonstrated by performing live-cell imaging analysis that similar to FtsZ, FtsA was also reutilized in cells exiting the regrowth-lag and resuming growth (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). Specifically, the FtsA protein (fused to mNeonGreen) either reappeared in the Z-ring structure (shown by the arrow in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>) of cells that were in the process of re-dividing or in the inner membrane of cells whose regrowth-delay bodies were dissolved but not yet dividing as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2005</xref>) when the non-growing late stationary-phase cells were recultured in fresh medium containing chloramphenicol. Similarly, the FtsA protein was retained in the regrowth-delay bodies for cells remaining in the non-growing regrowth-lag state (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>, represented by the cell circled by red dashed lines). These results once again demonstrated that the proteins sequestered in the regrowth-delay bodies are released to resume their functions in cells exiting the regrowth-lag state and resuming growth.</p>

<title>Mutant bacterial cells with a reduced formation of regrowth-delay bodies exhibit a shorter duration of regrowth lag and a lower tolerance to antibiotics</title>
<p>To further examine the relationship between regrowth-delay body formation and regrowth lag time or antibiotic tolerance, we then attempted to generate mutant bacterial cells in which the formation of regrowth-delay bodies would be significantly reduced. Towards this goal, we referred to the list of proteins identified in the regrowth-delay bodies (as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8A</xref></bold>) and realized the presence of multiple subunits of the respiratory chain complexes. Furthermore, our live-cell imaging analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4A</xref></bold>) showed an apparent association of the regrowth-delay bodies with the inner membrane, where the respiratory chain complexes are located. In light of these observations, we then performed gene knockdown (or gene knockout) experiments to decrease or remove certain subunits of the respiratory chain complexes and analyzed whether the regrowth-delay body formation in the bacterial cells was significantly reduced. In particular, the <italic>nuoA</italic> gene (encoding a subunit of respiratory chain complex I) or the <italic>sdhC</italic> gene (encoding a subunit of respiratory chain complex II) in the <italic>ftsZ-mNeonGreen</italic> cells was subjected to knockdown manipulation using the CRISPRi technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Luo et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Our live-cell imaging analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>, left panel) demonstrated that the regrowth-delay body formation was significantly reduced in the non-growing late stationary-phase <italic>nuoA</italic>-knockdown cells and barely occurred in the <italic>sdhC</italic>-knockdown cells. In agreement with these imaging results, our immunoblotting analysis confirmed a significantly reduced amount of the endogenous FtsZ in the insoluble lysate pellet fraction of these cells, instead, much appeared in the soluble supernatant fraction (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>, right panel). We observed similar reduction in regrowth-delay body formation (shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Fig. S9A</xref></bold>) for the bacterial cells in which the <italic>nouAB</italic> (genes encoding two subunits of respiratory chain complex I) or <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> (genes encoding all the four subunits of the respiratory chain complex II) were knocked out.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Here, we reported our accidental discovery of a hitherto unreported bacterial subcellular structure that we designated as the regrowth-delay body. In retrospect, we made this revelation as a result of our initial <italic>in vivo</italic> protein photo-crosslinking and subsequent live-cell imaging analyses on the unique FtsZ protein, not only with actively dividing cells (as have been extensively examined by others), but also with the nondividing/non-growing cells (as have been rarely examined by others). We provided ample evidence to support our conclusion that the regrowth-delay bodies are formed by sequestering multiple key cellular proteins, which in turn enable bacterial cells to enter a persister state, which exhibits not only a regrowth lag but also a multidrug tolerance.</p>
<p>Regrowth-delay body represents a distinctive subcellular structure that allows the tiny subpopulation of persisters to be effectively identified in a large population of actively growing cells, a prerequisite for elucidating their physiological properties. Meanwhile, our demonstration that regrowth-delay bodies sequesters multiple key cellular proteins provides key mechanistic insights for explaining why persisters are able to maintain in a non-growing dormant state for an extended period of time, being an outstanding unresolved puzzle in microbiology.</p>
<p>Importantly, our findings imply that a bacterial persister is actually in a particular depth of persistence, as determined by the status of its regrowth-delay bodies. In other words, a persister whose regrowth-delay bodies are to be dissolved rather effectively is in a shallow persistent state, thus to exhibit a relatively short regrowth lag whenever as an optimal growth condition becomes available. Conversely, a persister whose regrowth-delay bodies are to be maintained for an extended period of time even when an optimal growth condition becomes available is in a deep persistent state. According to this, a conventional multidrug-tolerant persister represents a bacterial cell that is in deep persistence, or a metabolically inactive dormant state.</p>
<p>Having cells in different depths of persistence would conceivably allow certain number of persister cells to survive under any harmful condition. This explains how the formation of regrowth-delay bodies would provide an effective bet-hedging strategy for a bacterial species to maximize its possibility of survival in the highly unpredictable natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Maisonneuve and Gerdes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Veening et al., 2008</xref>). In a sense, the regrowth-delay bodies in a persister cell function as the biological timer that determines the particular duration of the regrowth lag for the non-growing bacterial cell to resume growth</p>
<p>Our revelations also explain why the formation of persisters has long been viewed as a stochastic or heterogeneous phenomenon occurring in the bacterial cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gefen and Balaban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amato and Brynildsen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dhar and McKinney, 2007</xref>). This is mainly due to the high heterogeneity of regrowth-delay body formation in different individual cells as well as the progressive nature of their formation in each single cell. Because of this, a bacterial cell sample taken from different culturing point would be highly heterogeneous in regards of the status of the cellular regrowth-delay bodies or depth of persistence in different cells. It follows that the duration of the regrowth lag, the level of drug tolerance, as well as the percentage of cells defined as persisters (by measuring the number of colony-forming units after treating an antibiotic) in the cell population, would most likely appear as inconsistent or stochastic values even in repeating experiments.</p>
<p>One difficulty in studying the persister cells is to unequivocally identify them, as they usually exist in extremely small numbers in a cell population that are actively growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Balaban et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of the distinctive regrowth-delay bodies in persisters would prove to be greatly helpful in overcoming this difficulty (as exemplified by the data shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). This meanwhile may allow us to conduct single cell biochemistry and cell biology studies on persisters, including a characterization of the transcriptomes, proteome and metabolome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Taniguchi et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of our findings described here, the &#x201C;viable but non-culturable&#x201D; bacteria, which is known to evade the conventional culture-based microbiological detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pinto et al., 2015</xref>), may represent persister cells whose regrowth-delay bodies could not effectively dissolve under the commonly applied culturing conditions. After we learn more about the conditions that will effectively promote the dissolution of regrowth-delay bodies, we may be able to make these bacterial cells culturable under particular conditions. By the same token, in clinics, we might be able to find ways to eradicate the multidrug tolerant recalcitrant pathogen persisters by promoting the dissolution of their regrowth-delay bodies in conjunction with an antibiotic treatment.</p>
<p>However, many questions remain unanswered concerning the biology of regrowth-delay bodies, as a new subcellular structure marking the non-growing persister bacterial cells. First, how are the components in the regrowth-delay bodies organized (to be revealed likely by high resolution electron microscopic analysis)? Second, what are the key signaling molecules that trigger their formation, and how are such signals sensed by cells? Third, how are the specifically sequestered proteins selected? Fourth, what signals trigger the regrowth-delay bodies to dissolve? Finally, do structures similar to regrowth-delay bodies exist in eukaryotes, especially those living as single-cell forms?</p>

<p>Positions of the FtsZ monomers and photo-crosslinked dimers are shown on the left of the gels, positions of the molecular weight markers are shown in the middle of the gels (in both <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>).</p>
<p>Here, to verify the reported <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly pattern of FtsZ protofilaments in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> protein photo-crosslinking analysis by replacing the amino acid residue K140, located at the longitudinal interface of the FtsZ protofilament, with the unnatural amino acid pBpa. This FtsZ-K140pBpa variant, which we demonstrated to be able to support cell division in the absence of wild type FtsZ, was then heterologously expressed in a strain whose own genomic <italic>ftsZ</italic> gene was modified to encode an Avi-tagged FtsZ variant (the Avi tag could be specifically probed with streptavidin). As shown by the blotting results displayed here in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A</xref></bold>, the FtsZ dimers were formed either between the FtsZ-K140pBpa and FtsZ-Avi monomers (thus detectable not only by streptavidin AP conjugate but also by antibodies against FtsZ; red arrows) or between two FtsZ-K140pBpa monomers (only detectable by antibodies against FtsZ; black arrows) in actively dividing log-phase cells (lanes 2 and 6). These observations confirmed the location of residue K140 at a self-assembling interface and that FtsZ assembles into homo-oligomers in actively dividing cells. By contrast, in non-growing late stationary-phase cells, the photo-crosslinked FtsZ dimers became no longer detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A</xref>, lanes 4 and 8), instead, multiple photo-crosslinked products between FtsZ-K140pBpa and other proteins were readily detected (lane 8). These results seem to indicate that residue K140 now mediate interactions with multiple other proteins in the non-growing bacterial cells.</p></caption>
