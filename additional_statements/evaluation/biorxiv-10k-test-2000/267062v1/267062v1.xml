<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We have performed <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of two Swedish genomes using long-read sequencing and optical mapping, resulting in total assembly sizes of nearly 3 Gb and hybrid scaffold N50 values of over 45 Mb. A further analysis revealed over 10 Mb of sequences absent from the human GRCh38 reference in each individual. Around 6 Mb of these novel sequences (NS) are shared with a Chinese personal genome. The NS are highly repetitive, have elevated GC-content and are primarily located in centromeric or telomeric regions. A BLAST search showed that 31&#x0025; of the NS are different from any sequences deposited in nucleotide databases. The remaining NS correspond to human (62&#x0025;) or primate (6&#x0025;) nucleotide entries, while 1&#x0025; of hits show the highest similarity to other species, including mouse and a few different classes of parasitic worms. Up to 1 Mb of NS can be assigned to chromosome Y, and large segments are missing from GRCh38 also at chromosomes 14, 17 and 21. Inclusion of these novel sequences into the GRCh38 reference radically improves the alignment and variant calling of whole-genome sequencing data at several genomic loci. Through a re-analysis of 200 samples from a Swedish population-scale sequencing project, we obtained over 75,000 putative novel SNVs per individual when using a custom version of GRCh38 extended with 17.3 Mb of NS. In addition, about 10,000 false positive SNV calls per individual were removed from the GRCh38 autosomes and sex chromosomes in the re-analysis, with some of them located in protein coding regions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Due to advances in DNA sequencing technologies, whole genome sequencing (WGS) has become an established method to study human genetic variation at a population scale. Large human WGS projects have been initiated in several countries and geographic regions<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, in some cases comprising 10,000 individuals or more<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. These genome projects will provide a wealth of information for future research on human genetics, evolution and disease. Today, the vast majority of human WGS is performed using short-read Illumina sequencing technology, and requires an alignment of the sequence reads to a human reference sequence. The gold standard reference is the GRCh38 release from 2013, which is based on DNA from multiple donors and intended to represent a pan-human genome, rather than a single individual or population group<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. However, the current GRCh38 reference might not be optimal in the context of population specific WGS projects, and more information could be gained from WGS data by instead using local references genomes, tailored to a specific country or population. For instance, the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of 150 Danish individuals based on Illumina mate-pair sequencing have strengthened the hypothesis that regional reference genomes can increase the power of association studies and improve precision medicine<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Since Illumina&#x2019;s technology is limited by short read lengths and amplification biases<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> it is not a viable alternative for creating human <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies comparable to GRCh38 in terms of completeness and contiguity.</p>
<p>A number of sequencing technologies have emerged that are capable of reading very long DNA molecules without prior amplification. These methods can resolve complex regions of the genome, such as GC-rich regions or repeats, which are difficult to determine with amplification-based and short-read approaches. In particular, PacBio&#x2019;s single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology has proven to be an excellent method for <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly. In 2015, the first human <italic>de novo</italic> SMRT sequencing project was reported; the assembly of the CHM1 cell line derived from a haploid hydatidiform mole<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Since then, a handful of human genomes have been assembled using combinations of long-read, linked-read and optical mapping technologies<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, including the AK1 cell line originating from a Korean individual<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and the HX1 genome originating from a healthy male Han Chinese<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. These personal genomes have been assembled to high level of completeness. For example, the AK1 assembly has a contig N50 size of 17.9 Mb and scaffold N50 size of 44.8 Mb, with 8 chromosome arms resolved into single scaffolds<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The contigs assembled from SMRT sequence data, as opposed to most assemblies based on Illumina data, are completely gap-free contain no unambiguous bases (represented by N&#x2019;s). Approximately 20,000 structural variations (SVs) are detected by SMRT sequencing of a human individual<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and a majority of these SVs are missed by analyses of short-read Illumina WGS data<sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The assemblies generated using SMRT sequencing have also indicated that a substantial amount of sequence is missing from the GRCh38 version of the human reference. For example, 12.8 megabases (Mb) of novel sequences (NS) were detected in the Chinese HX1 assembly<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Also, an average of 0.7 Mb per individual not present in GRCh38 were found among the 10,000 samples in a population-scale Illumina WGS project<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, showing that NS can to some extent be detected also in short read data.</p>
<p>The human <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies available based on long-read data thus indicate that each personal genome contains a significant amount of &#x201C;dark matter&#x201D; of structural variation that is not detected by short-read WGS, and several million bases of novel sequence that cannot be matched to GRCh38. At present, it is unknown how many of these SVs and NS are common to all humans, and thus represent errors in the GRCh38 reference, and how many of them are polymorphic between individuals. To address this question there is a need to assemble several personal genomes from different populations around the world to a high degree of completeness. Such a collection of <italic>de novo</italic> genomes would make it possible to improve on GRCh38, and eventually to construct complete new population-specific genomes. In this study, we performed <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of genomes from two individuals from the Swedish population, in order to investigate the missing pieces of GRCh38, and to evaluate the benefits using a local reference for single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling in population-based WGS data.</p>

<title>De novo assembly of two Swedish individuals</title>
<p>To construct two high quality genome references for the Swedish population, DNA was extracted from blood samples obtained from one male (Swe1) and one female (Swe2). The two individuals were unrelated and selected from the 1000 samples included in SweGen, which is a project where the genetic variation in a cross-section of the Swedish population was studied using Illumina WGS<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. A principal component analysis (PCA) shows that Swe1 and Swe2 are relatively distant from each other in the context of the genetic variation within Sweden (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). The two selected genomes should therefore contain a large portion of the common genetic variation in the Swedish population.</p>

<p>SMRT sequencing data was generated at an average coverage of 78.7X for Swe1 and 77.8X for Swe2 (<bold>supplementary Table S1</bold>). By <italic>de novo</italic> assembly<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, followed by two iterations of genome polishing, we were able to construct sequence assemblies of 2.996 Gb and 2.978 Gb for Swe1 and Swe2, consisting of 7,166 and 7,186 contigs, respectively (<bold>supplementary Table S2</bold>). Each of the assemblies contained about 3,000 primary contigs and an additional 4,000 alternative contigs originating from regions with high heterozygosity. The alternative contigs only cover a small fraction of the genome; about 115 Mb in each individual. N50 values for the primary contigs were 9.5 Mb for Swe1 and 8.5 Mb for Swe2. For both individuals, we also generated BioNano optical mapping data with two different labeling enzymes, at over 100X coverage per enzyme. A two-step hybrid scaffolding of the SMRT sequencing contigs together with the optical maps resulted in assemblies of size 3.1 Gb and scaffold N50 of 49.8 Mb (Swe1) and 45.4 Mb (Swe2) (<bold>supplementary Table S3</bold>). These numbers are similar to the 44.8 Mb scaffold N50 obtained for the first published Korean genome<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, and substantially larger than the median scaffold N50 of 21 Mb obtained for 150 Danish genomes<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. It is worth to note that the DNA samples used for optical mapping of Swe1 and Swe2 were extracted from blood collected in 2006. Our results thus demonstrate that it is possible to obtain very high-quality genome assemblies starting from frozen blood that has been stored in the freezer for over a decade.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Evaluating the quality of the de novo assemblies</title>
<p>To assess the quality of the two <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies, we aligned the contigs for Swe1 and Swe2 to the hg38 reference genome. Throughout this article, the abbreviation hg38 is used to denote a sequence that is identical to the full analysis set of GRCh38, which includes un-localized scaffolds and decoy sequences<sup><xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (see Methods). For Swe1 and Swe2 respectively, 2.971 Gb (99.14&#x0025;) and 2.956 Gb (99.24&#x0025;) of assembled sequence could be uniquely aligned to hg38 (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table S4</bold>). The slightly higher number of aligned bases for Swe1, who is a male, can be explained by sequences on the Y chromosome that are not present in the female Swe2 sample. The average identity between the contigs and hg38 was over 99.7&#x0025; for both genomes. Intriguingly, a higher fraction of the Swe2 sequence data can be uniquely aligned to the Swe1 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly (99.55&#x0025;) as compared to hg38 (99.24&#x0025;), thus suggesting that the hg38 reference does not contain all sequences present in these Swedish individuals. The corresponding analysis for Swe1 is not relevant in this context, since Swe1 is expected to contain sequence on the Y chromosome not present in the female Swe2.</p>
<p>In order to discover novel sequence (NS) missing from hg38, it is essential that Swe1 and Swe2 were assembled to a high degree of completeness and with as few gaps as possible. To evaluate this, we compared our Swedish <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies to results obtained for the Korean AK1<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, the Chinese HX1<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and 150 Danish genomes<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. As seen in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref></bold>, the primary contigs of Swe1 and Swe2 contain similar number of unambiguous (non-N) bases as the other SMRT sequencing assemblies (i.e. AK1 and HX1). Importantly, the assemblies obtained from SMRT sequencing contain over 100 Mb of additional sequence as compared to the Illumina mate-pair assemblies. The GRCh38 reference contains almost 3.1 Gb, which is significantly more as compared to the &#x007E;2.9 Gb for Swe1 and Swe2. To a certain extent, these differences can be explained by the fact that GRCh38 is based on a combination of DNA sequences and haplotypes from several individuals<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, which could lead to an inflated genome size, and also that primary contigs shorter than 20kb were excluded from the Swe1 and Swe2 assemblies. N50 scaffold values are highest for the Swe1, Swe2 and AK1 assemblies, which all used BioNano data from two labeling enzymes for hybrid scaffolding. A single enzyme was used for HX1 and this assembly has a scaffold N50 similar to those obtained for the Danish genomes.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Structural variation in Swedish genomes</title>
<p>Analysis of structural variation (SV) resulted in a total of 17,936 SVs for Swe1 and 17,687 SVs for Swe2 (<bold>supplementary Table S5</bold>). These numbers can be compared with the 20,175 and 18,210 SVs detected in the Chinese HX1 and in the Korean AK1 assembly, respectively. The SV length distribution shows an enrichment of ALU repeat elements at around 300 bp and of LINE elements at around 6100 bp, similar to what has been previously reported<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (<bold>supplementary Figure S1</bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Detection of novel sequences not present in the human reference</title>
<p>Even though most of the contigs in our assemblies were in good agreement with the human reference, we detected 25.6 Mb of sequences in Swe1 and 22.6 Mb in Swe2 that could not be aligned to hg38 (<bold>supplementary Table S4</bold>). To refine these sequences further, we performed a two-step re-alignment using more relaxed settings and removed duplicated sequences (see Methods). This resulted in 2859 NS in Swe1 of total length 13.8 Mb, and 2786 NS in Swe2 of total length 10.6 Mb (<bold>supplementary Table S6</bold>). The NS were required to be at least 100bp in length and have at most 80&#x0025; identity to hg38. They could either originate from contigs that could not be aligned to hg38, or from inserted elements in the aligned contigs. As seen in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>, most of the NS are relatively short (between 100bp and 5kb). However, 83&#x0025; of NS bases originate from sequences that are over 5kb in length.</p>

The &#x2018;No hit&#x2019; category (in white) contains NS where no E-value reached 1e-50 or lower. 72 of the NS are in the &#x2018;Other&#x2019; category, which includes matches to a number of parasitic worms (both for Swe1 and Swe2) and a complete HPV35 genome (only for Swe2).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="267062_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Repeat masking using sensitive settings, revealed an abundance of repetitive elements in the NS (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref></bold> and <bold>supplementary Table S7</bold>). For Swe1, 88.58&#x0025; of the NS bases were found to be repetitive. A slightly lower repeat content, 83.60&#x0025; was detected in the NS from Swe2. Since the repeat content is around 50&#x0025; among all Swe1 and Swe2 contigs, there is a high enrichment of repeats in the NS. Also, the GC level is slightly elevated, 42.68&#x0025; (Swe1 NS) and 43.45&#x0025; (Swe2 NS), as compared to 40.95&#x0025; in all contigs (<bold>supplementary Table S8</bold>). SMRT sequencing is known to perform well in repetitive regions and high-GC regions, and therefore these results are not unexpected. Annotation of all the repeats showed that satellites and simple repeats make up 82&#x0025; of the NS bases, but only 3&#x0025; of all of the primary contig sequences (see <bold>supplementary Table S7</bold>). Interestingly, all other groups of repeats are underrepresented among the NS. Even though a high proportion of the NS are repetitive, there is also a substantial amount of non-repetitive sequence. For Swe1 and Swe2, 1.58 Mb and 1.73 Mb of NS remained after the repeat masking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Origin of the novel sequences</title>
<p>To further investigate the contents of the novel sequences, we performed a BLAST search<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> against all sequences present in the NCBI database (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref></bold>, <bold>supplementary Table S9</bold>). Thirty-one percent of the NS did not produce a BLAST hit, implying that they have not been previously reported. For the remaining NS, the majority matched to human entries in NCBI, thereby suggesting that a majority of our NS have been detected in previously, but originate from regions or haplotypes that have not been included in the hg38 reference. We also detected 5&#x0025; non-human primate sequences, which most likely originate from regions missing in hg38 that have been sequenced in another primate. Nearly 1&#x0025; of the NS match to other, non-primate, species. Of note, several of the hits show high similarity to parasitic worms, including <italic>Spirometra erinaceieuropaei</italic>, <italic>Enterobius vermicularis</italic> and <italic>Dracunculus medinensis</italic>. Since it is highly unlikely that the two Swedish individuals indeed have DNA from these parasites present in their blood, a more plausible explanation is that the worm genome assemblies contain a fraction of human sequence. The initial worm assemblies were based on short-read sequencing of samples extracted from human patients<sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and contigs not aligning to GRCh38 may have been mis-annotated as worm sequence, thus explaining the overlap with our NS. Notably, the Swe2 sample also contained a complete human papilloma virus 35 (HPV35). This could either originate from an HPV35 infection in the blood of this individual, or from a contamination in the sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Comparing novel sequences between Swedish individuals and the Chinese HX1</title>
<p>To investigate whether the NS are individual-specific, population-specific or shared between different populations, we compared our results to those obtained for the Chinese HX1 genome<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The HX1 assembly was based on 103X genome-wide SMRT sequencing of DNA from a human blood sample, where 12.8 Mb of NS was found. Starting from the NS identified in Swe1 or Swe2, we determined whether the same sequences could be identified in the other Swedish assembly, or in HX1 (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref></bold> and <bold>supplementary Table S10)</bold>. For Swe1 and Swe2, 55&#x0025; (7.65 Mb) and 52&#x0025; (5.51 Mb) of the NS, respectively, could also be found in the other Swedish individual as well as in HX1. The higher overlap obtained when starting the analysis from Swe1 is explained by certain repetitive elements that occur with higher copy number in Swe1 as compared to Swe2. Our results also show the presence of over 5 Mb of NS in the 3-way overlap category, i.e. found in all three individuals. A smaller amount of NS (&#x007E;1.5 Mb) was common only between the two Swedish individuals, while not found in the Chinese HX1, thus representing possible population-specific sequence. We also identified a substantial amount of individual-specific sequences, 3.27 Mb for Swe1 and 3.22 Mb for Swe2. Interestingly, a much higher amount of NS were shared between Swe1 and HX1 (1.36 Mb) as compared to Swe2 and HX1 (0.29 Mb). Since Swe1 and HX1 are both males, while Swe2 is a female, the &#x007E;1 Mb of additional NS shared between Swe1 and HX1 may be explained by segments of the Y chromosome that are missing from the hg38 reference.</p>

<title>Anchoring novel sequences on human chromosomes</title>
<p>We next aimed to anchor the NS onto human chromosomes using information provided by the PacBio long-read data and BioNano optical maps (see Methods section). Only a minority of sequences could be placed into the human genome using this approach, but this analysis still provided valuable insights about the genomic localization of the NS (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>)</bold>. For Swe1 and Swe2, 2.08 Mb and 1.97 Mb of NS, respectively, could be uniquely anchored to a chromosome, while 1.70 Mb and 1.55 Mb were anchored to multiple chromosomes (see <bold>supplementary Table S11</bold>). This again shows that many NS contain repetitive or transposable elements. For the uniquely anchored NS, we observed an accumulation at certain chromosomes. The highest amount of 3-way overlap sequences is present on chromosome 21, while chromosomes 13, 14, and 22 also show enrichment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). The NS placed on these chromosomes are mainly localized to centromeric or telomeric regions, suggesting that placement of these sequences has previously been difficult to determine due to their repetitive content. Interestingly, we detected an accumulation of population-specific NS present in both Swedish individuals but not in the Chinese HX1 on chromosome 17. A relatively large amount of sequences (121 kb) shared only between the two male individuals (Swe1 and HX1) could be anchored to the Y chromosome. Surprisingly, we also noted an accumulation of NS shared between Swe1 and HX1 on chromosome 17.</p>

<title>Application of novel sequences for population scale WGS analysis</title>
<p>Having identified several megabases of DNA not present in the human reference, we were interested to see whether these NS would improve the results of whole genome re-sequencing of the Swedish population. We therefore created a new reference consisting of hg38 combined with all the NS detected in Swe1 and Swe2 (named hg38&#x002B;NS), after which we leveraged the Illumina WGS data from the SweGen dataset<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and aligned the reads from 200 individuals both to hg38 as well as to hg38&#x002B;NS.

<caption><title>Re-analysis of Illumina WGS data using a Swedish human reference.</title>
<p><bold>A)</bold> Overview of our method to evaluate the effect of NS on SNVs calls from Swedish Illumina WGS data. In the first step, reads from 200 SweGen samples<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> were aligned both to hg38 and to an extended reference (hg38&#x002B;NS) where 17.3 Mb of novel sequences detected in Swe1 and Swe2 were appended to hg38. In step 2, SNVs for each of the samples were sorted into three groups: i) SNVs found only in hg38, but not in hg38&#x002B;NS (named &#x2018;Lost&#x2019;, in green) ii) SNVs found both in hg38 and hg38&#x002B;NS (&#x2018;Both&#x2019;, in grey) and iii) SNVs found only in hg38&#x002B;NS but not in hg38 (&#x2018;Gained&#x2019;, in orange). After such SNV tables were generated for all 200 individuals, a summary file was created for the &#x2018;Lost&#x2019; and &#x2018;Gained&#x2019; group. The &#x2018;Lost&#x2019; SNVs were not allowed to be detected in any of the &#x2018;Gained&#x2019; or &#x2018;Both&#x2019; files. A similar filtering was performed also for the &#x2018;Gained&#x2019; group. In step 3, we further filtered the SNV lists by removing all centromeric regions (from file &#x2018;centromeres_UCSC_hg38.txt&#x2019;). The resulting &#x2018;Gained&#x2019; SNVs were separated into two distinct groups, those present in hg38 chromosomes (chr1-22, X or Y) and those present in the NS. <bold>B)</bold> Frequency distribution of the 736,488 SNVs that were gained in the NS. The x-axis shows the number of SweGen samples (out of 200), and the y-axis shows the number of gained SNVs for each number of samples on a log10-scale. Most of the gained SNVs are detected only in a few samples. The blue and red areas show the number of SNVs that are gained in at most 5&#x0025; and at least 95&#x0025; of samples, respectively. <bold>C)</bold> Frequency distribution of the SNVs that were lost in hg38 when adding NS to the hg38 reference. <bold>D)</bold> Frequency distribution of the gained SNVs on chromosomes 1-22, X or Y (i.e. not in novel sequences) when adding NS to the hg38 reference.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="267062_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>An average of 42.5 SNVs per kb was detected in the NS and their frequency distribution is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref></bold>. Some of these SNVs are likely to represent true novel genetic variation in the cohort, but a substantial fraction may also originate from errors in the Swe1 and Swe2 assemblies. Surprisingly, the addition of NS to the reference had a large effect on variant calls of the autosomes and sex chromosomes, where 134,851 SNVs disappeared (outside of centromeric regions) when the extended reference was used (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). These SNVs originate from reads that preferentially aligns to a novel sequence and can be considered as false positives in hg38. Interestingly, we also found a substantial number of SNVs (n&#x003D;72,157) which were gained on the hg38 chromosomes when using the extended reference. These gained SNVs in hg38 have overall lower allele frequencies compared to the lost SNVs (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated SNVs that were consistently lost or gained in hg38 for at least 5&#x0025; of the 200 SweGen samples when using the extended reference (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>)</bold>. Only a small number of SNVs (n&#x003D;823) were gained on the hg38 chromosomes in at least 5&#x0025; of the samples when using the extended reference. However, 26,724 SNVs were lost in at least 5&#x0025; samples when appending NS to the hg38 reference. These consistently lost SNVs have an uneven distribution over the genome with the highest peak on chrY and smaller peaks on several other chromosomes. Global annotation of the consistently lost SNVs showed that 7,130 (27&#x0025;) of these are present in version 147 of dbSNP. For the consistently gained SNVs, only 130 (16&#x0025;) are present in dbSNP, suggesting that these SNVs are more difficult to detect using the hg38 reference alone. A total of 109 consistently lost SNVs were located in a coding sequence of a gene, but none of the consistently gained SNVs were in coding regions. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref></bold> shows an example region on chr17 where the NS improved the alignment of Illumina WGS data for two SweGen individuals, resulting in the removal of around 100 false positive SNVs, and importantly, the discovery of seven novel SNVs that were previously masked by the mis-aligned reads. A second example is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref></bold> where a region on chrY with about 1000X coverage and many dubious SNVs is cleaned up when NS are appended to hg38. In a third example, as illustrated by the genome browser view of the <italic>FRG2C</italic> locus, the hg38&#x002B;NS reference improves alignments in coding regions (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Swe1 and Swe2 represent two of the most complete individual human <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies produced to date. On average, the primary contigs contains 2.87 Gb of unambiguous (non-N) sequence per individual, which is similar to the Chinese HX1<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and the Korean AK1<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> individuals, and 133 million more bases than what could maximally be assembled in any of the 150 Danish genomes<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the Swedish assemblies are still not entirely complete and they could be further improved by BAC sequencing of specific regions<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, by chromosome interaction mapping<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, by linked-reads from 10X Genomics<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, or long reads from nanopore-based sequencing<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Also, the new technologies make it possible to assemble human genomes starting directly from tissues or blood, instead of cell lines that were used for example for GRCh38. This should resolve the potential issue with genomic aberrations introduced during cell line transformation and long-term culturing<sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The Swedish <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies reveal a large amount of NS not present in the GRCh38 reference. Over 5 Mb of NS were overlapping between our two Swedish genomes and the Chinese HX1, and this likely represents valid human DNA sequence. In addition, 1.36 Mb of male-specific sequence was found (i.e. overlapping between Swe1 and HX1) and large fraction of these sequences could be anchored to the Y chromosome. We estimate the total amount of sequence missing from GRCh38 to be at least 6 Mb, which corresponds to about 0.2&#x0025; of the size of the human genome. Another interesting class of NS are the &#x007E;1.5 Mb found in Swe1 and Swe2, but not in HX1. Several of these potentially population-specific NS are clustered at certain genomic regions, such as chr17 (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). Some of these regions could have been targets for selection during human evolution, although this needs to be investigated further. In general, the NS are highly repetitive and have elevated GC-contents. At this point, there is no evidence for the presence of functional elements within the NS, although preliminary data suggest that some of them are actively transcribed (data not shown). A more thorough analysis is required to shed light on the functional relevance of these NS.</p>
<p>Our results show that the NS can be used to construct a new version of the human genome reference that improves the analysis of population-scale Illumina WGS data. On average 10,898 SNVs per individual were lost, and 75,035 SNVs per individual were gained in 200 SweGen samples<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> when appending the NS to GRCh38, with some of this variation affecting the coding sequences of known genes. Because of the stringent filtering options used in our analysis (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref></bold>) these numbers should be seen as a conservative estimate of the novel variation that could be resolved using an improved reference. In addition, since many regions still show poor alignments for SweGen data also when using hg38&#x002B;NS (data not shown), it is likely that our reference could be further improved and customized for the Swedish population. The benefits of an improved reference are likely to be even stronger for other, non-European, population groups that were poorly represented in the original assembly of GRCh38<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. In conclusion, despite all efforts to refine the human genome since its original release in 2001<sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, our results indicate that substantial improvements could still be made, not least to represent specific population groups, by <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of representative human genomes from different populations.</p>
