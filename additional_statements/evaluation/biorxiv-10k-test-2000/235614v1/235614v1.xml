<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In this work, we establish a role for the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptor S1PR3 in inflammatory thermal pain and itch. S1P injection elicited robust heat hypersensitivity, acute pain, and itch behaviors in mice, which were wholly dependent on S1PR3. S1P-evoked pain was entirely dependent on TRPV1 ion channels, whereas S1P-evoked itch was dependent on TRPA1. Consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, we found that S1P activated subsets of both heat- and itch-sensitive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and that activation was solely dependent on S1PR3, and not S1PR1. Our data support a model in which S1P elicits neuronal activation via two pathways in distinct subsets of somatosensory neurons. G&#x03B2;&#x03B3;-dependent activation of TRPA1 mediates S1PR3-evoked calcium responses in one subpopulation, whereas PLC-dependent activation of TRPV1 mediates S1PR3-evoked calcium responses in the other subpopulation. In the Complete Freund&#x2019;s Adjuvant (CFA) -induced inflammatory pain model, S1PR3-deficient mice failed to develop heat hypersensitivity, whereas mechanical hypersensitivity developed normally. Pharmacological blockade of S1PR3 activity or S1P production rapidly and selectively ameliorated heat hypersensitivity in wild-type mice treated with CFA. These data definitively identify S1PR3 as a mediator of thermal pain and itch, and, furthermore, demonstrate for the first time that elevated peripheral S1P is an essential driver of chronic inflammatory pain.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Chronic pain is a major health problem with few effective treatments. Here, we show that the pro-inflammatory lipid, S1P, and its receptor S1PR3 are essential for thermal hypersensitivity and acute itch. Our results suggest that S1PR3 inhibitors or S1P modulators may be of interest as powerful and heretofore untested treatments for inflammatory pain and itch.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hypersensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli is a hallmark of inflammatory pain. During inflammation, immune cells, skin cells, and neurons release a slew of small molecules, lipids, and proteins into the extracellular milieu collectively referred to as the &#x201C;inflammatory soup&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ji, Xu, &#x0026; Gao, 2014</xref>). A handful of these factors are known to directly modulate the activity of peripheral sensory neurons, resulting in thermal and/or mechanical hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chuang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tominaga, Wada, &#x0026; Masu, 2001</xref>). While several transduction channels and sensory neuronal populations mediating acute pain and itch have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Basbaum, Bautista, Scherrer, &#x0026; Julius, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Meixiong &#x0026; Dong, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pinho-Ribeiro, Verri, &#x0026; Chiu, 2017</xref>), the molecular factors that drive thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity under inflammatory states remains enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghasemlou, Chiu, Julien, &#x0026; Woolf, 2015</xref>). For example, it is known that mice lacking TRPV1 fail to develop thermal but not mechanical sensitization in a model of chronic inflammatory pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caterina et al., 2000</xref>), yet the physiologically relevant molecular pathways upstream of TRPV1 sensitization are not fully understood. And likewise, while the immune cells that promote mechanical hypersensitivity in chronic inflammatory pain have been identified, the signaling factors that promote that sensitization remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghasemlou et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid associated with asthma, neuropathic pain, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Checa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Donoviel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hou &#x0026; Fang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mysliwiec et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Patti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rivera, Proia, &#x0026; Olivera, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">F. Roviezzo et al., 2015</xref>). S1P signaling via S1P Receptor 1 (S1PR1) facilitates the migration, recruitment, and activation of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cyster &#x0026; Schwab, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Matloubian et al., 2004</xref>). Intriguingly, expression of both S1PR1 and S1PR3 has been reported in the somatosensory ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>), and S1P modulates sensory neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li, Li, Kays, Guerrero, &#x0026; Nicol, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). However, the role of S1P signaling in somatosensation remain unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of S1P signaling in pain and itch. While the subject of a number of previous studies, whether and how S1P signaling directly mediates acute and inflammatory pain remains enigmatic for several reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Canlas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Finley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Janes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Weth et al., 2015</xref>). First, and foremost, the S1P receptors in sensory ganglia involved in S1P-evoked heat hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mair et al., 2011</xref>) and spontaneous pain behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013</xref>) have remained controversial. While both S1PR1 and S1PR3 have been implicated in nociception, the aforementioned studies showed incomplete loss of S1P-evoked behaviors or partial phenotypes. Localization studies were performed with anti-S1P receptor antibodies that stain S1PR3-deficient sensory ganglia. As such, the sensory neuronal subtype(s) that participate in S1P signaling are unknown. Additionally, these studies were cursory and did not probe the downstream signaling pathways activated by S1P receptor(s) in sensory neurons. These studies also employed excessively high concentrations of S1P in behavioral experiments, two to three orders of magnitude higher than levels reported in mammals (0.1 nM &#x2013; 10 &#x03BC;M), and beyond the solubility limits of this lipid in saline (micromolar). Finally, no study has examined the role of S1P signaling in itch sensation.</p>
<p>Here, we aimed to perform a rigorous and systematic characterization of the behavioral effects and underlying mechanisms of S1P signaling in acute pain and itch and chronic inflammatory pain. We have found that elevated S1P triggers acute pain, heat hypersensitivity, and, surprisingly, itch behaviors that are wholly dependent on S1PR3. Intriguingly, S1PR3-deficient mice do not develop thermal hypersensitivity in the CFA model of inflammatory pain. In addition, acute pharmacological blockade of peripheral S1PR3 signaling or S1P production reverses CFA-evoked thermal hypersensitivity. Our findings define new roles for S1PR3 signaling in pain and itch and show that S1P itself is an essential contributor to inflammatory pain in the periphery.</p>

Wherever possible, wild-type (for <italic>Trpa1</italic> and <italic>Trpv1</italic> behavior) or wild-type/heterozygous (<italic>S1pr3</italic>) littermate controls were used in behavioral experiments. Mice (20&#x2013;30 g) were housed in 12 h light-dark cycle at 21&#x00B0;C. Mice were singly housed one week prior to all behavioral experiments and were between 8-10 weeks at the time of the experiment. All mice were acclimated in behavioral chambers on the 2 subsequent days for at least 1 hour prior to treatment for itch/pain behavior and radiant heat. Male mice were used for all behavioral studies, due to the effects of the female estrus cycle on itch and pain behaviors.</p>
<p>Itch and acute pain behavioral measurements were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). Mice were shaved one week prior to itch behavior. Compounds injected: 200 nM, 2 &#x03BC;M, 10 &#x03BC;M S1P (Tocris, Avanti Polar Lipids), 500 &#x03BC;M TY 52156 (Tocris), and 50 &#x03BC;M SKI II (Tocris) in PBS with either DMSO-or Methanol-PBS vehicle controls. Pruritogens were injected using both the neck/rostral back model (20 &#x03BC;l), and the cheek model (20 &#x03BC;l) of itch, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). Behavioral scoring was performed while blind to experimental condition and mouse genotype. All scratching and wiping behavior videos were recorded for 1 hour and scored for either the first 30 minutes (scratching) or the first five minutes (wiping). Bout number, time spent scratching, and bout length were recorded for scratching behavior. Wiping was recorded as number of wipes.</p>
<p>For radiant heat hypersensitivity behavior, S1P was injected intradermally into the plantar surface of the hindpaw (20 &#x03BC;l). Radiant heat paw withdrawal latencies, before and after application of compound or vehicle were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tsunozaki et al., 2013</xref>). Radiant heat assays were performed using the Hargreaves test system (IITC Life Science). Mice were injected with compound of interest into the hind paw, and their paw withdrawal latencies were measured 15 min pre- and 20 min-30 min post-injection. Valid responses for radiant heat included fast paw withdrawal, licking/biting/shaking of the affected paw, or flinching. Mice were allowed to acclimate on platform for 1 hour before injection.</p>
<p>For the CFA model of chronic inflammatory pain, 15 &#x03BC;l of CFA (Sigma-Aldrich) or PBS control was injected into either the left or right hindpaw of 8-9 week old mice briefly anesthetized with 2&#x0025; isoflurane. Experimenter was blind to genotype. Von Frey paw withdrawal latencies were recorded as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tsunozaki et al., 2013</xref>) using the up-down method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chaplan, SR, Bach, FW, Pogrel, JW, Chung, JM, Yaksh, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dixon, 1980</xref>) on a mesh grate (IITC Life Science) with calibrated filaments (Touch Test). Radiant heat withdrawal latencies were measured at baseline, 24-, and 48-hours post-injection for both paws. Paw swelling was measured using calipers while experimenter was blind to genotype. Photographs were taken after mice were euthanized using CO<sub>2</sub> while photographer was blinded to genotype.</p>
<p>All behavior experiments were carried out using age-matched or littermate cohorts of male mice. Mice were tested in 4-part behavior chambers (IITC Life Science) with opaque dividers (Tap Plastics). Itch and acute pain behavior was filmed from below using high-definition cameras. All experiments were performed under the policies and recommendations of the International Association for the Study of Pain and approved by the University of California, Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<title>Analysis of gene expression vs. itch correlation data</title>
<p>A previous study examined the correlation of transcript expression of individual genes in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons with itch behavior among BXD mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morita et al., 2015</xref>). One of the top correlated genes from the screen was <italic>Fam57b</italic> (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.57), a recently identified ceramide synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yamashita-Sugahara et al., 2013</xref>) and component of the S1P pathway that is robustly expressed in somatosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gerhold et al., 2013</xref>). To assess whether expression of the S1P pathway genes as a group was correlated with somatosensory behaviors across the mouse strains of the BXD population, we first tabulated the absolute value of the Pearson&#x2019;s correlation <italic>r</italic> between expression of each S1P pathway gene in turn (<italic>Fam57b</italic>, <italic>Ppargc1a</italic>, <italic>Spns1</italic>, <italic>Spns2</italic>, <italic>Sphk2</italic>, <italic>S1pr3</italic>, <italic>S1pr1</italic>, <italic>Esrrb</italic>, <italic>Esrrg</italic>, <italic>Lrp2</italic>) and itch behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morita et al., 2015</xref>), and calculated the median of these correlation values, <italic>r<sub>true</sub>.</italic> We then drew 10 random genes from the set of all 16,220 genes with detected expression and computed the median correlation as above using this null set, <italic>r<sub>null</sub></italic>. Repeating the latter 10,000 times established a null distribution of median correlations; we took the proportion of resampled gene groups that exhibited (<italic>r<sub>true</sub></italic> &#x2265; <italic>r<sub>null</sub></italic>) as an empirical p-value reporting the significance of enriched correlation between expression and itch in the genes of the S1P pathway.</p>

<title>In situ hybridization (ISH)</title>
<p>Fresh DRG were dissected from 8-12 week old mice, flash frozen in OCT embedding medium, and sectioned at 14 &#x03BC;m onto slides. ISH was performed using Affymetrix Quantigene ViewISH Tissue 2-plex kit according to manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions with Type 1 and Type 6 probes. The following probes against mouse mRNAs were created by Affymetrix and used for ISH: <italic>S1pr3</italic>, <italic>Mrgpra3</italic>, <italic>Trpv1,</italic> and <italic>Trpa1</italic>. Slides were mounted in Fluoromount with No. 1.5 coverglass.Imaging of ISH experiments and all other live- and fixed-cell imaging was performed on an Olympus IX71 microscope with a Lambda LS-xl light source (Sutter Instruments). Images were analyzed using ImageJ software. Briefly, DAPI-positive cells were circled and their fluorescence intensity (AFU) for all channels was plotted against cell size using IgorPro software. Co-labeling analysis was performed using ImageJ. Intensity thresholds were set based on the negative control staining slide. Cells were defined as &#x201C;co-expressors&#x201D; if their maximum intensities were greater than the threshold for both the Type 1 and Type 6 probe channels.</p>

<p>Cell culture was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, neurons from dorsal root ganglia of 2-8 week old male and female mice, or trigeminal ganglia from P0-P4 neonates were dissected and incubated for 10 min in 1.4 mg ml&#x2013;1 Collagenase P (Roche) in Hanks calcium-free balanced salt solution, followed by incubation in 0.25&#x0025; standard trypsin (vol/vol) -EDTA solution for 2 min with gentle agitation. Cells were then triturated, plated onto Poly D-Lysine coated glass coverslips and used within 20 h. (media: MEM Eagle&#x2019;s with Earle&#x2019;s BSS medium, supplemented with 10&#x0025; horse serum (vol/vol), MEM vitamins, penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine).</p>

<title>Calcium imaging</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> imaging experiments were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). DRG neurons from 2-8 week old male and female mice were used for all experiments. Where indicated, TG neurons were from P0-P4 neonates. When experiments were performed on non-wild-type mice, an age-matched wild-type control was also prepared and imaged the same day. Cells were loaded for 60 min at room temperature with 10 &#x03BC;M Fura-2AM supplemented with 0.01&#x0025; Pluronic F-127 (wt/vol, Life Technologies) in a physiological Ringer&#x2019;s solution containing (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2 and 10 D-(&#x002B;)-glucose, pH 7.4. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Acquired images were displayed as the ratio of 340 nm/ 380 nm. Cells were identified as neurons by eliciting depolarization with high potassium Ringer&#x2019;s solution (75 mM) at the end of each experiment. Responding neurons were defined as those having a &#x003E; 15&#x0025; increase from baseline ratio. Image analysis and statistics were performed using automated routines in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). Fura-2 ratios were normalized to the baseline ratio F340/F380 &#x003D; (Ratio)/(Ratio t &#x003D; 0).</p>

<title>Flow cytometry of CFA-treated paws</title>
<p>CFA injections were performed as described above. Briefly, hindpaw skin and underlying fascia of treated and PBS-injected paws were removed from freshly euthanized mice. Skin was placed in RPMI media (Gibco) on ice before mincing with dissection scissors. Digestions were performed for 90 minutes at 37&#x00B0;C on a rotating platform in 1 mL RPMI supplemented with 1:1000 DNaseI enzyme (Roche) and 1 unit LiberaseTM (Roche). Skin was then filtered through 70 &#x03BC;m nylon mesh (Falcon), washed in RPMI, and resuspended in PBS for Aqua Live-Dead staining. Samples were then transferred to FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5&#x0025; FBS and 2 mM EDTA), blocked, then surface stained with the following antibodies: cKit-Biotin, FceRI-PE, CD49b-PECy7, SiglecF-APC, SA-FITC, Ly6C-PerCP, CD11b-PB, Ly6G-780, CD45.2-AF700.Compensation tubes (single-stain) were prepared for each fluorophore using positive and negative control beads. A spleen from a wild-type animal was also prepared by crushing between frosted glass slides, straining through 70 &#x03BC;m nylon mesh, and lysing of erythrocytes in ACK (Gibco). A portion of spleen sample was heat-killed for 10 minutes at 65&#x00B0;C and stained with Aqua viability stain and set aside. The rest of the spleen was stained normally with the other skin samples. Samples were then run through a flow cytometer (BD Fortessa). Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Prism) and Microsoft Excel. Neutrophils were defined as live single cells with the following staining profile: CD45.2<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/CD11b<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/Ly6G<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/Ly6C<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. Inflammatory monocytes were defined as the following: CD45.2&#x002B;/CD11b&#x002B;/Ly6G<sup>-</sup>/Ly6C<sup>high</sup>. Total number of immune cells was reported since neither genotype differed significantly between total number of live cells or total number of CD45.2&#x002B; immune cells.</p>

<title>Experimental design &#x0026; statistical analyses</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using IgorPro software or Prism. Values are reported as the mean &#x00B1; SEM where multiple experiments are reported, and mean &#x00B1; SD where one experiment was performed with multiple wells (for calcium imaging) or mice (for behavior). For comparison between two groups, Student&#x2019;s unpaired 2-tailed t-test was used. For single-point comparison between &#x003E; 2 groups, a one-way ANOVA followed by the Sidak&#x2019;s, Dunnett&#x2019;s or Tukey&#x2019;s post hoc tests (where appropriate) were employed. For the time course comparison between 2 groups, 2-way ANOVA was used and single comparison p-values were derived using Sidak&#x2019;s multiple comparisons. For comparing distributions, a type 2 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. Number of mice or samples required to attain significance was not calculated beforehand and was based on numbers used in similar behavioral studies. Significance was labeled as: n.s., not significant, p &#x2265; 0.05; &#x002A;p &#x003C; 0.05; &#x002A;&#x002A;p &#x003C; 0.01 ; &#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;p &#x003C; 0.001.</p>

<p>Our group previously harnessed natural variation in somatosensory behaviors among genetically distinct mouse strains to identify candidate transducers in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morita et al., 2015</xref>). Analysis of this dataset revealed the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>) had transcript expression that was significantly correlated with increased itch behaviors (see Methods; p &#x003D; 0.0116; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We focused our study on S1PR3 because it was the most highly expressed S1P receptor in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>S1PR3 is the sole mediator of acute SIP-evoked pain and itch</title>
<p>A handful of previous studies have suggested that S1P may promote acute pain and/or thermal sensitization via various S1PRs in sensory neurons, neutrophils, and/or platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Finley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Weth et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we sought to address the specific contribution of S1PR3 signaling to S1P-evoked somatosensory behaviors using physiologically relevant concentrations of S1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Checa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">My&#x015B;liwiec et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sanna et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We first used the cheek assay, which allows for simultaneous discrimination of pain-evoked wiping and itch-evoked scratching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shimada &#x0026; LaMotte, 2008</xref>). We observed that S1P injection resulted in wiping behaviors in response to S1P concentrations at or above 2 &#x03BC;M in the first five minutes after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We also found that S1P elicited robust scratching behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>) that developed with an average latency of 4 minutes 29 seconds &#x00B1; 1 minute 37 seconds and persisted for at least 30 minutes. Scratching was elicited in response to a wider range of S1P concentrations than wiping (0.2-10 &#x03BC;M versus 2-10 &#x03BC;M). Furthermore, we did not observe scratching behaviors in response to the lowest tested dose, 50 nM S1P (data not shown). For all subsequent S1P scratching behavioral assays where wiping was not quantified, we injected 0.2 &#x03BC;M S1P into the rostral back and observed an average scratching time of 55.5 &#x00B1; 7.6 seconds (N &#x003D; 29 animals), which was significantly greater than scratching evoked by vehicle (0.1&#x0025; methanol-PBS; 11.1 &#x00B1; 3.3 seconds, N &#x003D; 23 animals). Our results from the cheek and rostral back models are consistent with a role for S1P in promoting both acute pain and itch. Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Finley et al., 2013</xref>), we observed robust heat hypersensitivity after injection of S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>). However, the concentration at which we observed hypersensitivity, 10 &#x03BC;M, is at least 20-fold lower than sensitizing or pain-inducing concentrations previously reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Finley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mair et al., 2011</xref>). Mechanical hypersensitivity was not observed (data not shown).</p>

<p>We next tested the requirement of S1PR3 to S1P-evoked itch and pain behaviors. <italic>S1pr3</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed significantly attenuated S1P-evoked scratching indistinguishable from vehicle injection (10.6 &#x00B1; 12.3 s versus 6.3 &#x00B1; 6.2 s, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e</xref>). <italic>S1pr3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice additionally lacked the robust heat hypersensitivity and cheek wiping in response to injection of 10 &#x03BC;M S1P we observed in both <italic>S1pr3</italic><sup>&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> and <italic>S1pr3</italic><sup>&#x002B;/-</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2d,f</xref>).

The complete loss of S1P-evoked behaviors in S1PR3-deficient mice suggests that S1PR3 is the sole receptor by which S1P signals in somatosensory neurons to drive heat hypersensitivity, pain, and itch.</p>

<title>S1PR3 is expressed and functional in subsets of TRPV1&#x002B; thermal nociceptors and TRPA1&#x002B; pruriceptors</title>
<p>Our acute behavioral data suggest that S1P-evoked behaviors are mediated by activation of thermal nociceptors and pruriceptors. We demonstrated by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) that 43&#x0025; of dorsal root ganglion cells express <italic>S1pr3</italic>. These neurons comprise two main populations: medium-to-large diameter mechanonociceptors as well as small-diameter neurons. Here, in order to address the role of S1PR3 in thermal pain and itch, we characterized the small-diameter <italic>S1pr3</italic>&#x002B; neurons by performing co-ISH of <italic>S1pr3</italic> with known markers of C-nociceptor populations. We found that 51&#x0025; of <italic>S1pr3</italic>&#x002B; cells express <italic>Trpv1</italic>, 34.3&#x0025; express <italic>Trpa1</italic>, and 11.6&#x0025; express <italic>Mrgpra3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

<p>We next employed whole cell current-clamp measurements to test whether S1P was sufficient for action potential firing. Indeed, 1 &#x03BC;M S1P evoked action potential firing in capsaicin-sensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). As an independent strategy to complement our ISH and electrophysiology studies, we employed an <italic>S1pr3</italic> mCherry reporter mouse, which produces functional S1PR3-mCherry fusion protein. Using sensory neurons this mouse in ratiometric calcium imaging, we found that 56.1 &#x00B1; 22.4 &#x0025; of mCherry-expressing neurons were activated by 1 &#x03BC;M S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c-d</xref> and these cells had a mean diameter of 22.4 &#x00B1; 1.0 &#x03BC;m. Furthermore, 51.1 &#x00B1; 16.8&#x0025; of capsaicin-responsive neurons were mCherry&#x002B;, indicating functional overlap with TRPV1&#x002B; thermal nociceptors. This suggests that only small-diameter thermal nociceptors and/or pruriceptors are activated by S1P.</p>
<p>Further characterization via calcium imaging in wild-type sensory neurons revealed that 1 &#x03BC;M S1P activates 34.2&#x0025; of neurons, which fall into two main populations: 22.6&#x0025; are TRPV1&#x002B;/TRPA1&#x002B; neurons, which are capsaicin- and AITC-sensitive, and 11.6&#x0025; are TRPV1&#x002B;/TRPA1- neurons, which are capsaicin-sensitive and AITC-insensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The complete overlap of S1P-responsive neurons with TRPV1&#x002B; neurons suggests a role for S1P in heat hypersensitivity. Previous studies have shown that the MrgprA3&#x002B; subpopulation of TRPA1&#x002B; neurons are required for many forms of non-histaminergic acute and chronic itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). In keeping with our hypothesized role for S1P in itch, 80&#x0025; of chloroquine-responsive MrgprA3&#x002B; neurons responded to S1P. Our findings are consistent with a role for S1P in activation of thermal nociceptors that express TRPV1 and pruriceptors that express TRPA1.</p>
<p>We thus sought to examine the contribution of S1PR3 to S1P-evoked neuronal activation, for which the literature is contradictory and suggestive of contributions of both S1PRs 1 and 3. Incubating cells with the S1PR3-selective antagonist TY 52156 significantly attenuated S1P-evoked calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3f</xref>). In contrast, the S1PR1-selective antagonist W146 had no effect on S1P responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that S1PR3 is required for S1P-evoked calcium signals. In support of our hypothesis, cultured DRG and TG neurons isolated from <italic>SlprS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited no calcium responses to 1 &#x03BC;M S1P, and displayed indistinguishable AITC- and capsaicin-evoked responses compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3g</xref>). These findings show that S1PR3, but not S1PR1, is required for neuronal activation by S1P.</p>

<title>S1P activates sensory neurons via distinct TRPV1- and TRPA1-dependent mechanisms.</title>
<p>We set out to identify the molecular pathway underlying S1P-evoked calcium transients in cultured mouse DRG sensory neurons. S1P responses were mediated solely by calcium influx, as chelation of extracellular calcium with 10 mM EGTA abolished all responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>), suggesting that S1P triggers the opening of plasma membrane cation channels. We also observed similar results with application of Ruthenium Red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>), a blocker of a number of calcium-permeable ion channels, including TRP channels.</p>

<p>Since TRPA1 and TRPV1 have been shown to mediate GPCR-dependent calcium signaling and activation in small-diameter sensory neurons, we asked whether either of these channels mediated S1P-evoked neuronal activation. We found that the percentage of sensory neurons exhibiting calcium transients in response to S1P application were reduced in neurons isolated from both <italic>Trpv1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (24.4 &#x00B1; 5.84&#x0025; vs. 34.8 &#x00B1; 6.25&#x0025;) and <italic>Trpa1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (8.6 &#x00B1; 4.3&#x0025; vs. 34.8 &#x00B1; 3.3&#x0025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c-d</xref>).</p>
<p>By ratiometric calcium imaging, we observed a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of DRG neurons activated by S1P, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 104 nM and maximal activation at 1 &#x03BC;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e</xref>). However, neurons which were responsive to both AITC and S1P exhibited a slightly lower EC<sub>50</sub> for S1P (102 nM), and were activated by lower S1P concentrations (10 nM) than neurons which were responsive to capsaicin and S1P (EC<sub>50</sub> : 155 nM). This supports the notion that S1P-evoked neuronal activation via TRPV1 and TRPA1 may occur in different populations of sensory neurons, rather than through A1/V1 crosstalk in the same cells.</p>
<p>We also performed ratiometric calcium imaging on wild-type DRG neurons treated with the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine (50 &#x03BC;M) or the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031 (50 &#x03BC;M). HC-030031 significantly reduced S1P responses by &#x223C;78&#x0025; (HC: 3.673 &#x00B1; 1.568&#x0025; vs. Veh: 17 &#x00B1; 2.19&#x0025;) whereas capsazepine significantly attenuated S1P responses by only &#x223C;50&#x0025; (8.69 &#x00B1; 0.865&#x0025; vs. 17 &#x00B1; 2.19&#x0025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Neurons isolated from mice lacking both TRPA1 and TRPV1 showed S1P responses similar to those evoked by vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4g</xref>).</p>
<p>We asked whether activation of sensory neurons by S1P/S1PR3 could be due to different G-protein coupled mechanisms in distinct neuronal subpopulations. We found that inhibition of PLC signaling using the drug U73122 blocked 42.4&#x0025; of S1P-evoked calcium responses, whereas the G&#x03B2;&#x03B3; blocker gallein attenuated 73.2&#x0025; of S1P responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4h</xref>). Further experiments showed that gallein and U73122 attenuate calcium responses to S1P in AITC-sensitive neurons (S1P &#x002B; vehicle: 22&#x0025; S1P&#x002B;/AITC&#x002B;; S1P &#x002B; Gallein: 6.2&#x0025; S1P&#x002B;/AITC&#x002B;; S1P &#x002B; U73122: 11.2&#x0025; S1P&#x002B;/AITC&#x002B;) with gallein causing much greater attenuation, whereas U73122 attenuates the majority of responses in capsaicin-sensitive, AITC-insensitive neurons (S1P &#x002B; vehicle: 14.5&#x0025; S1P&#x002B;/CAP&#x002B;; S1P &#x002B; U73122: 1.6&#x0025; S1P&#x002B;/CAP&#x002B;). Our results with the G-protein inhibitors mirror our observed proportions of TRPA1&#x002B; and TRPA1- S1P-responsive neurons, suggesting that S1PR3 may signal primarily via PLC to activate TRPV1 and via G&#x03B2;&#x03B3; and/or PLC to activate TRPA1, similar to the behavior of other excitatory GPCRs that signal via these channels in somatosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Imamachi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Morita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, our data suggest that S1PR3 signaling opens TRPA1 or TRPV1 channels in two distinct subpopulations of DRG neurons via canonical G-protein coupled mechanisms.</p>

<title>S1P elicits pain and itch via distinct molecular pathways</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the heat-sensor TRPV1 would be required for S1P-evoked acute pain and heat hypersensitivity; however, we could not predict whether S1P-evoked itch would be transduced via the TRPV1-dependent or TRPA1-dependent itch pathways. To this end, we tested the requirement of TRPA1 and TRPV1 to S1P-evoked itch and pain behaviors. In both the cheek wiping and radiant heat assays, S1P injection elicited robust acute pain and heat hypersensitivity behaviors in wild type and <italic>Trpa1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, but not in <italic>Trpv1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a,c</xref>).

Thus we concluded that S1P-evoked spontaneous pain behaviors and heat hypersensitivity are mediated by TRPV1 and that S1P-evoked itch is mediated by TRPA1, a known transducer of acute and chronic itchy stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2013</xref>). Overall, our results highlight a key role for S1PR3 signaling through distinct molecular pathways in S1P-evoked acute pain, heat hypersensitivity, and itch.</p>

<title>S1P and S1PR3 are essential for chronic thermal hypersensitivity</title>
<p>The Complete Freund&#x2019;s Adjuvant (CFA) model of chronic inflammatory hypersensitivity is widely used as a model of peripheral inflammation, but the molecular basis of pain hypersensitivity in this model is incompletely understood. Injection of CFA into the hindpaw causes significant thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity and swelling in wild type animals. In this model, thermal hypersensitivity is dependent on TRPV1 ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caterina et al., 2000</xref>), although the upstream mechanisms of TRPV1 sensitization in CFA are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boyce et al., 1996</xref>). Additionally, paw edema in this model is due to extensive plasma extravasation, in which soluble components of blood plasma are exposed to the skin. S1P, which is present at concentrations 10- to 100-fold higher in blood plasma than in peripheral tissue, presents itself as an attractive but unstudied component of the CFA inflammatory soup.</p>
<p>We therefore explored the role of S1PR3 in the CFA model of inflammatory pain. A variety of immune cells infiltrate into the hindpaw following CFA treatment, and a recent study has shown that myeloid cells are the principal driver of CFA-evoked mechanical but not thermal hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghasemlou et al., 2015</xref>). Because S1P plays a key role in immune cell migration, we asked whether <italic>S1pr3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> displayed normal CFA-evoked immune cell infiltration into the hindpaw. We observed no difference between <italic>Slpr3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <sup>&#x002B;/-</sup> animals among all immune cell subtypes quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a-b</xref>), in support of previous studies showing that S1PR1 is the primary mediator of S1P signaling in immune cells.</p>

We therefore hypothesized that S1P levels become elevated under inflammatory conditions, and that this promotes heat hypersensitivity via S1PR3-mediated sensitization of TRPV1. In support of our hypothesis, acute blockade of S1P production with SKI II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chiba, Takeuchi, Sakai, &#x0026; Misawa, 2010</xref>) rapidly reversed CFA heat hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Furthermore, acute S1PR3 blockade with TY elevated heat-evoked withdrawal latencies to pre-CFA, baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6e</xref>). These results demonstrate that peripheral S1P promotes CFA-evoked heat hypersensitivity via S1PR3 signaling and is a component of the inflammatory soup that actively signals to promote pain.</p>

<p>S1P is a bioactive signaling lipid best known for its essential roles in immune cell migration, maturation, and activation via S1PR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Matloubian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Roviezzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schwab et al., 2005</xref>). Recent studies have linked aberrant S1P signaling to a variety of diseases, including: asthma, multiple sclerosis, cancer, psoriasis, and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brinkmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Checa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">My&#x015B;liwiec et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Patti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rivera et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">F.

<title>S1P evokes pain and itch via S1PR3</title>
<p>The role of S1P in acute pain and pain hypersensitivity has been controversial. There are conflicting reports of whether S1P mediates acute flinching and licking pain behaviors, and/or thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Finley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Weth et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, these previous studies employed high-micromolar or millimolar concentrations of S1P in mouse behavioral experiments, leaving it unclear whether physiologically relevant S1P levels could contribute to somatosensation. Here we have shown that physiological levels of S1P (nanomolar to low micromolar) are sufficient to evoke somatosensory behaviors. We demonstrate that S1P triggers acute pain and heat hypersensitivity via the noxious heat-sensing ion channel TRPV1. Additionally, S1P promotes itch-evoked scratching that is dependent on the irritant-sensing ion channel TRPA1. While a number of previous studies have implicated both S1PR1 and 3 in somatosensory neuron function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mair et al., 2011</xref>), several lines of evidence unequivocally show that S1PR3 is the sole mediator of S1P-evoked pain and itch. First, DRG neurons isolated from S1PR3-deficient animals do not respond to S1P. Second, application of an S1PR3-selective antagonist, but not an S1PR1-selective antagonist, attenuates S1P responses in cultured DRG neurons. Finally, S1PR3-deficient mice display no S1P-evoked scratching, wiping, or heat hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>We also show for the first time that S1P acts as a pruritogen to evoke acute itch. Recent studies have shown that circulating S1P levels are increased in chronic itch patients (from &#x223C;0.1 to 2 &#x03BC;M in healthy versus chronic itch patients; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Checa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">My&#x015B;liwiec et al., 2016</xref>). S1PR3-deficient mice displayed a complete loss of S1P-evoked itch behaviors. Future studies will explore the role of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in chronic itch models to ascertain the pathological relevance of S1P-evoked itch.</p>

<title>S1PR3 mediates inflammatory thermal pain</title>
<p>In the CFA model of inflammatory pain, both mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity occur with distinct time courses, suggesting differential modes of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghasemlou et al., 2015</xref>). It is well-established that TRPV1 is required for CFA-evoked thermal hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caterina et al., 2000</xref>). We now show that S1PR3 activation can lead to opening of TRPV1 channels, and that both S1PR3 and elevated S1P are required for CFA-evoked thermal hypersensitivity. These data suggest that S1P may be an important contributor to inflammatory pain. Consistent with this hypothesis, S1PR3-deficient mice display partial attenuation of paw swelling, a hallmark of neurogenic inflammation, but still develop mechanical hypersensitivity, which has been previously been shown to depend on infiltration of myeloid cells which display normal infiltration in the S1PR3 knockout animals. S1PR3 signaling in neurons may generally contribute to pain under inflammatory conditions. Plasma extravasation and edema, common symptoms of inflammation, may increase local S1P concentrations and contribute to sensitization. Moreover, we use pharmacology to show that active S1P signaling is required to maintain chronic heat hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest sensory neuronal S1PR3 may play roles in a host of disorders linked to S1P signaling. Although S1P is produced by nearly every cell type, blood plasma contains the highest levels of S1P (low micromolar), and S1P is secreted in large amounts by activated mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Olivera, Allende, &#x0026; Proia, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">F. Roviezzo et al., 2015</xref>). Others have shown that sensory neurons innervating the lung express <italic>S1pr3</italic> and that administration of a non-selective S1P receptor agonist can enhance asthma-like airway hyperreactivity after acetylcholine challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Trankner, Hahne, Sugino, Hoon, &#x0026; Zuker, 2014</xref>). It is also well known that TRPV1 &#x002B; sensory afferents are required for airway hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rogerio, Andrade, &#x0026; Calixto, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, mast cells, which release S1P when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kalesnikoff &#x0026; Galli, 2008</xref>), play important roles in allergic asthma as well as itch, and we propose that S1PR3 may play an important role in mediating itch and/or airway hyperreactivity under these conditions.</p>
<p>Several S1PR modulators are currently in clinical trial for diseases linked to pain and/or itch, including multiple sclerosis, IBD, and psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brinkmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Degagn&#x00E9; &#x0026; Saba, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kunkel, Maceyka, Milstien, &#x0026; Spiegel, 2013</xref>). While these drugs are intended to target the immune system, we propose neuronal S1P/S1PR3 signaling as a potential target for the treatment of inflammatory pain and itch.</p>
