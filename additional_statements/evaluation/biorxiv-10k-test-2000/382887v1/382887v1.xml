<title>Summary</title>
<p>During human brain development the cerebellum and cerebral cortex fold into robust patterns that increase and compartmentalize neural circuits. Although differential expansion of elastic materials has been proposed to explain brain folding, the cellular and physical processes responsible at the time of folding have not been defined. Here we used the murine cerebellum, with 8-10 folds, as a tractable model to study brain folding. At folding initiation we considered the cerebellum as a bilayer system with a fluidlike outer layer of proliferating precursors and an incompressible core. We discovered that there is no obvious cellular pre-pattern for folding, since when folding initiates, the precursors within the outer layer have uniform sizes, shapes and proliferation, as well as a distribution of glial fibers. Furthermore, although differential expansion is created by the outer layer expanding faster than the core at folding initiation, thickness variations arise in the outer layer that are inconsistent with elastic material models. A multiphase model was applied that includes radial and circumferential tension and mechanical constraints derived from <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements. Our results demonstrate that cerebellar folding emerges from mechanical forces generated by uniform cell behaviors. We discuss how our findings apply to human cerebral cortex folding.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent work in brain folding has primarily focused on the cerebral cortex and involved models of differential expansion of elastic materials to drive mechanical instabilities that lead to folding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Current models are able to create three dimensional shapes strikingly similar to the folds seen in the human cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, the cell and tissue level mechanics actually present at the initiation of folding have not been considered or defined. The simple alignment of folds along the anterior-posterior axis of the murine cerebellum and the genetic tools available in mouse allow for precise developmental interrogation, to identify and analyze the cellular behaviors driving growth that could create differential expansion, and to reveal additional critical forces.</p>
<p>The developing cerebellum is distinct from the cerebral cortex, as it has an external granule cell layer (EGL) of proliferating precursors that covers the surface and generates growth primary in the anteriorposterior (AP) direction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. A bilayer system is therefore an excellent starting approximation for cerebellar folding. Here we show that cerebellar folding emerges from differential expansion between an un-patterned uniformly expanding fluid-like EGL and an incompressible underlying core. Additionally, we demonstrate that thickness variation in the EGL at the base of the forming fissures, termed anchoring centers (AC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, are inconsistent with traditional elastic wrinkling models driven by differential growth. We constrained a recent model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> that takes into consideration that tension could play an import role in the developing brain and used our in depth developmental data to capture the initiation of cerebellar folding.</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>No cellular pre-pattern at initiation of folding</title>
<p>To systematically determine the cellular behaviors underlying the initiation of cerebellar folding, we first tested whether regional differences in EGL proliferation rates are present that could influence the folding pattern of the cerebellum, since the EGL drives the majority of cerebellar growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Proliferation rates (S phase index) were measured in the EGL during folding initiation (E16.5 and E17.5) in the inbred FVB/N strain to reduce variation between samples. First we asked if the regions that will give rise to distinct sets of lobules have different rates of proliferation that could contribute to the larger and smaller sizes that the lobules ultimately attain. We focused on the anterior cerebellum that divides into a larger region with lobules 1-3 (L123) and smaller region (L45), as well as the central area that comprises lobules 6-8 (L678) of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a-b</xref>). The more posterior cerebellum does not consistently fold at this stage, thus measurements were not included. Interestingly, we found that the proliferation rates were the same in the three regions at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The EGL proliferation rate in L678 was slightly reduced compared to the L123 region at E17.5, but no other differences were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d1</xref>). Thus proliferation is uniform just before initiation of folding and the small difference found during folding does not correlate with lobule size. This result indicates that lobule size is not determined by modulating the levels of proliferation at the onset of folding. Rather, lobule size could be set by the timing of invagination and the distance between ACs as granule cell precursors do not cross ACs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Each AC is first detected by a regional inward thickening of the EGL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. We measured the proliferation of the EGL specifically within the forming AC regions to test whether altered proliferation rates could explain the thickenings and therefore the initiation of an AC. We found the rate of proliferation within each forming AC region at E16.5 and E17.5 was the same as in the surrounding EGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>), thus proliferation within all regions of the EGL at the initiation of folding is uniform. Furthermore, regional modulation of proliferation does not form or position the ACs.</p>
<p>At E18.5, after the initiation of folding, we found that the rate of proliferation was significantly lower in the L678 region compared with the L123 and L45 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Fig. 1a</xref>). However, proliferation within the ACs at E18.5 remained uniform with the surrounding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Fig. 1b</xref>). Therefore, as ACs compartmentalize the EGL, regional differences in proliferation rates can arise in lobule regions, which thus could be important for determining the ultimate shapes of the folds.</p>
<p>Changes in cell size and shape have been shown to induce morphological changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. To test if regionally specific regulation in cell shape or size directs folding, we fluorescently labeled cell membranes of scattered granule cell precursors (GCPs) in the EGL using genetics (<italic>Atoh1-CreER</italic>/&#x002B;; <italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>MTMG</italic>/&#x002B;</sup> mice injected with tamoxifen two days prior to analysis). We then segmented the cells in 3D and quantified their sphericity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1g</xref>). We discovered that GCPs in the EGL take on a large variation of shapes and sizes at E16.5 and E18.5. However, we found no difference in cell shape in the different lobule regions of the EGL or between the AC areas and the surrounding EGL at either age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>). Cell size was uniform at both stages except for a slight reduction in L678 at E16.5 when compared with L123 and the AC regions. However, cell size is reduced at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1 j,k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Fig. 1c</xref>). Thus, the proliferating GCPs that drive expansion of the EGL have similar shapes and sizes across the lobule regions defined by the first three ACs at folding initiation.</p>
<p>The EGL is traversed by fibers of Bergmann glial and radial glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. We tested whether the fibers are distributed in patterns that could locally change the physical properties of the EGL and induce invaginations. Genetics was used to fluorescently label cell membranes of scattered glial cells (<italic>nestin-creER</italic>/&#x002B;;<italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>MTMG</italic>/&#x002B;</sup> mice injected with tamoxifen at E14.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2a</xref>). Fibers crossing the EGL at E16.5 were counted in sagittal slices and aligned relative to the ACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This analysis showed that the Bergmann glial and radial glial fibers are distributed evenly along the AP axis of the EGL, and therefore are not directing the positions where folding initiates based on an uneven regional distribution.</p>

<p>Taken together, our results show that at the initiation of folding, the EGL has uniform cell behaviors and distribution of glial fibers, and thus has no evidence of any pre-patterning in the EGL. Other factors therefore must be guiding cerebellar folding. We chose to test whether there is an emergent tissue-level regulation of folding.</p>

<sec id="s1b">
<title>Tissue level mechanical forces drive folding</title>
<p>It is well known that differentially expanding bilayer systems can wrinkle to relax building stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We reasoned that in the cerebellum the EGL could behave as a quickly expanding outer layer and its attachment to a more slowly growing core could generate forces that result in a wrinkling-like phenotype. To test whether the cerebellum has differential expansion between the two layers, we measured the expansion of the EGL and the core during the time of initiation of folding from midline sagittal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3a-d</xref>). The length of the surface of the EGL was used as a measure of the cerebellum surface area and the area of the core as an approximation of cerebellum volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>), and measurements were made each day from E16.5 through P0. In cross-section the unfolded cerebellum approximates a semicircle, therefore we reasoned that if the cerebellum were to remain unfolded then the ratio of expansion between the length of the EGL and the area of the core should approximate the ratio of the circumference of a semi-circle to its area. Of significance, we found that at E16.5 and E17.5 the ratios of growth between the EGL and core closely approximated the expansion of a semi-circle. However, at E18.5 and P0 the expansion rate of the EGL was greater than the rate of core expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Thus we uncovered that the cerebellum does indeed go through a phase of differential expansion. We next determined whether differential expansion correlates with folding by calculating a folding index (the convex curvature of the EGL divided by the length of the EGL) at each stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Indeed, we found that the cerebellum remains unfolded during the initial proportional expansion between the EGL and core and only folds when the differential expansion is initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3f</xref>). These results provide physical evidence that cerebellar folding is derived from tissue level mechanical forces arising from differential expansion.</p>

<title>Elastic bilayer models do not account for shape change</title>
<p>Since cerebellar folding correlates with differential expansion, we tested an elastic bilayer model against our data for how the EGL grows faster than the core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The resulting wrinkling instability should set up a characteristic lengthscale of the distance between folds as the initial sinusoidal undulations increase in amplitude to ultimately turn into lobules. The folding wavelength will depend on the thickness of the external layer (EGL) and the ratio of the stiffness of the two layers (EGL/core). In particular, for a planar geometry, with the stiffness of the external layer defined as <italic>E<sub>o</sub></italic>, the stiffness of the core as <italic>E<sub>i</sub></italic>, and the thickness of the external layer denoted as <italic>t</italic>, the folding wavelength &#x03BB; is given by<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>

<graphic xlink:href="382887_ueqn2.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>In other words, the number of folds is inversely proportional to the thickness of the EGL.</p>
<p>To more closely model the geometry of the cerebellum, we explored a standard elastic bilayer model in a circular geometry using the observed ratio of thickness of the EGL to radius of the cerebellum near the onset of shape change (smooth to wrinkled after E16.5) and invoking a neo-Hookian elastic solid for both layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Previous work applied a tri-layer elastic model to the cerebellum, incorporating the molecular layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. We have not included the molecular layer in our model since it is not present when folding initiates. The resulting shape change was studied as a function of the ratio of the layer stiffness values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We found that to induce the observed number of folds at initiation of folding through wrinkling based models constrained by our measurements of the embryonic cerebellum, a large stiffness ratio was required of around 50. To map the stiffness contrast in the cerebellum we used scanning acoustic microscopy to measure the bulk modulus of the cerebellum daily from E16.5 to P18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). For small deformations, we expect the instantaneous bulk modulus to be linearly related to the stiffness and, therefore, the ratio of the instantaneous bulk moduli should scale similarly to the ratio of stiffnesses (assuming the same Poisson&#x2019;s ratio). We found that although the EGL has a higher instantaneous bulk modulus than the core at all stages measured, the ratio was not sufficient to produce a folding wavelength similar to that in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Small modulus contrasts have been reported for other brain regions with other test modes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup></p>

<graphic xlink:href="382887_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Wrinkling models predict compressive forces in the outer layer. Consistent with this prediction, simulations of cuts through the outer layer and into the inner layer predict that the outer layer should not open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Using surgical dissection blades we made radial cuts across the meninges, EGL, and into the core of live E16.5 tissue slices. Time-lapse imaging revealed that unlike the prediction, the EGL opens as well as part of the underlying cut in the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4f-h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplemental Fig. 4a-c</xref>, and Supplemental Movie 1). This result is consistent with there being circumferential tension within the outer layers of the cerebellum.</p>
<p>An additional aspect of the model that does not fit the biology of the developing cerebellum is that it requires the EGL to be thinnest at the base of each AC, which are the lowest parts of the cerebellar surface, and thus to have an &#x201C;in-phase&#x201D; thickness variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Without this feature, a purely elastic model cannot be in mechanical equilibrium (in the quasistatic limit). However, we previously noted that the EGL is thickest in the ACs when folding initiates, i.e., it has an &#x201C;out-of-phase&#x201D; thickness variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. To validate this observation, we quantified the thickness of the EGL and found it to be around 1.2 &#x2013; 1.4 times thicker in the ACs than in the surrounding EGL at E16.5 and 17.5 when folding initiates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a-d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>), and the thickness ratio increased to 1.7 times at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5d</xref>). It is of interest to note that the final thicknesses of the layers of the cortex of the mature cerebellum, just as in the cerebral cortex, are in-phase. These results further show that traditional wrinkling models cannot capture the initiation of cerebellum folding, and highlight the importance of making measurements at the time of folding rather than when it is complete.</p>

<title>A multiphase model approximates folding</title>
<p>We recently developed a model for folding from differentially expanding bi-layer brain tissues that takes into account the possible contribution of mechanical constraints present in the developing brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. We made five primary assumptions based on the measurements presented above. First, the core is an incompressible material (&#x03BC;), as indicated by our instantaneous bulk modulus measurements. Second we utilize a uniform expansion of the EGL (k<sub>t</sub>) as indicated by the proliferation rate. Third, we do not assume that the EGL is an elastic material. Forth, we assume an elastic component radially and circumferentially to the entire cerebellum (kr), possibly mediated by fibers spanning the cerebellum including those of the Bergmann glia and radial glia as well as the pial surface and meninges covering the cerebellum. And fifth, we posit that the EGL is constrained towards a uniform thickness by fibers spanning the EGL (&#x03B2;), possibly the Bergmann glia. Given the interplay between incompressible material, compressible fibrous material, and a proliferating fluid-like EGL, this model is multiphase.</p>
<p>We constructed an energy functional parameterized by both the inner and outer boundary of the EGL and incorporating the above five assumptions into three dimensionless parameters (&#x03BC;/k<sub>r</sub>, k<sub>r</sub>/k<sub>t</sub>, k<sub>t</sub>/&#x03B2;). We also constrained the parameters with our developmental data. Minimization of the energy functional yields an equation for a driven harmonic oscillator yielding sinusoidal shapes for both the inner and outer boundary of the EGL. In contrast with the elastic bilayer wrinkling model, EGL thickness oscillations are found to be out-of-phase with the surface height (radius) oscillations when 0 &#x003C; &#x03BC;/kr &#x003C; 1. The ratio of these two quantities, the measured surface height amplitude (A<sub>r</sub>) and the EGL thickness amplitude (A<sub>t</sub>) is given by

<p>Note that in contrast with elastic wrinkling, the number of initial folds does not depend on the thickness (a length scale) of the EGL, but only on material properties.</p>
<p>To test the model, we used the observed EGL thickness amplitude, average EGL thickness, average cerebellum radius, and the number of initial folds at E16.5 to constrain 3 of the 5 model parameters. A 4th parameter (u/k<sub>r</sub>, denoted as &#x03B5;) was assumed to scale linearly with time and thus generate predictions of cerebellum shapes at later developmental stages (E17.5 and E18.5). We indeed found that the model well-approximates the phase and amplitude behavior of EGL thickness and radius oscillations, during these stages.

<p>As the model requires radial tension in addition to the circumferential tension demonstrated above, we examined evidence of radial tension between the EGL and the ventricular zone (VZ) at the initiation of folding. Horizontal cuts were made across the core of live E16.5 tissue slices below the EGL and above the VZ that would cut across anterior radial fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5h</xref>). As predicted, after cutting, the tissue relaxed revealing tension directed radially within the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5i,j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref> and Supplemental Movie 2). Interestingly, quantification of how the radial and horizontal cuts open revealed that only the horizontal cuts opened along the full length of the cut although they opened more slowly than radial cutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplemental Fig. 4g-j</xref>), indicating different stress profiles in the two orientations.</p>

<title>Hierarchical folding involves differential growth</title>
<p>The cerebellum has hierarchical folding in which the initial folds become subdivided. Given that ACs hold their position during development and compartmentalize granule cells within lobules of the EGL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> we reasoned that the ACs could be acting as mechanical boundaries enabling similar mechanics to drive the secondary folding. To test this possibility we measured the expansion of the EGL and the core of the individual lobule regions from E18.5 to P3. We found that indeed in the lobule regions that undergo folding there is a temporal correlation between the onset of sub-folding and differential expansion occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a-d</xref>). In contrast, the region (L45) that does not fold during the same time period has a different, more rectangular shape, and the ratio of EGL growth to core growth is proportional for a rectangle during the time measured (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). We propose that ACs create mechanical boundaries that divide the cerebellum into fractal-like domains with similar physical properties to the initial unfolded cerebellum. Additionally, since ACs compartmentalize granule cells within the EGL lobule regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, once separated the lobule regions can develop distinct characteristics, like the observed differential proliferation rates. We speculate, therefore, that the folding patterns seen across cerebella in different species evolved by adjustment of global as well as regional levels of differential expansion and tension which ultimately mold the functionality of the cerebellum.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have provided the first evidence that brain folding emerges from a uniform expansion of cells without obvious pre-patterning. Thus, traditional morphometric cellular behaviors such as changes in cell shape, size and proliferation do not direct where cerebellar folding initiates. Furthermore, our developmental interrogation revealed that thickness variations arise in the EGL that are fundamentally inconsistent with traditional elastic bilayer wrinkling models. By applying a novel multiphase model based on the cellular structure of the cerebellum at the time of folding initiation we were able to capture the shape variations with the correct number of folds. The model accounts for: 1) a rapidly expanding fluid-like EGL, whose thickness is regulated by Bergmann glial fibers, 2) a slower growing incompressible core, and 3) fibrous material in the form of glial fibers (and possibly axons) as well as the meninges that provide radial and circumferential tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>). One prediction of the model is that adjusting the amount of tension spanning the cerebellum will change the degree of folding. Indeed, alterations of the cells that likely create tension-based forces could explain the dramatically disrupted folding seen in mouse mutants in which radial glia do not produce Bergmann glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Without Bergmann glia, the EGL would be expected to not form a layer with regular thickness and it should be more sensitive to variations in radial glial tension. Consistent with this prediction, mutants without Bergmann glia have more localized and less regular folds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Our combination of experimental studies and modeling thus provide new insights into brain folding, including an underappreciated role for tension.</p>
<p>For our multiphase model to predict the observed shape changes in the murine cerebellum from E17.5 to E18.5 the ratio of the core stiffness over the radial tension must increase. As the measured bulk modulus of the core shows no increase during development, our model predicts that the radial tension must decrease during development. While the cerebellum is crossed by many fibers at folding initiation, radial glial fibers are an attractive candidate to mediate this change in radial tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. First, they span from the VZ to the surface of the cerebellum at E16.5. Additionally, during folding initiation the radial glia undergo a transition into Bergmann glia where they release their basal connection to the VZ and the cell body migrates towards the surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This transition could lead to a reduction in the global radial tension and thus would be consistent with our model prediction.</p>
<p>Finally it is interesting to note the similarities between the developing cerebellum and the cerebral cortex. Radial glia span the entire cerebral cortex just as in the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Furthermore, species with folded cerebrums have evolved outer radial glial cells with cell bodies near the surface and fibers that are anchored on the surface, similar to Bergmann glia in the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Additionally outer radial glial cells proliferate, much like the EGL, to drive the expansion of the outer regions of the cerebral cortex at the time of initiation of folding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Moving the zone of proliferation out from the VZ gives more space for the increased proliferation required in folding systems. The cerebellum, housing 80&#x0025; of the neurons in the human may be an extreme example requiring the region of proliferation to be completely on the outer surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. While we have emphasized the notion of tension via glial fibers in the developing cerebellum, axonal tension has been discussed in the context of shaping the developing cerebrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Our work calls for a revival of the notion of how tension affects the shape of the developing cerebrum in model mammals like the ferret where experimental testing at the cellular and tissue level are possible. By constraining models with developmental data we will bring about a quantitative understanding of the shaping of the developing brain.</p>

<p>EGL Proliferation rate was calculated as EDU&#x002B;/(Dapi&#x002B;;P27-) cells. All cells were counted within the lobule region to the midpoint of the Anchoring Centers. For proliferation measurements through the ACs and the surrounding EGL at E16.5 and E17.5 a 50 &#x03BC;m window measured from the outer surface of the EGL was centered at the AC. The measuring window was centered at every 25 &#x03BC;m anterior and posterior to the EGL for a total distance of 250 &#x03BC;M anterior and posterior to the AC. At E18.5, when the AC is fully formed, everything proximal to the centroid of the cerebellum under the midpoint of the AC was counted as the AC. Non-overlapping regions of 50 &#x03BC;m also were measured in either direction for a total of 200 &#x03BC;M anterior and posterior to the AC.

<p>EGL length was measured from the outer surface of the EGL following the curvature of the EGL. Cerebellar area was calculated as the area within the outer surface of the EGL and the ventricular zone. A short strait edge was made perpendicular to the ventricular zone to close the area back upon to the anterior end of the EGL. The convex curvature of the cerebellum was measured by following only the positive curvature of the EGL. The folding index was determined as FI &#x003D; 1 - (Positive curvature/EGL length). Data collected for E16.5, E17.5, E18.5 and P0 came from 6,8,7, and 9 cerebella respectively. EGL thickness was measured by defining the outer and inner curvature of the EGL. The shortest distance lines were drawn to the outer curvature from discrete points distributed at every 12.5 &#x03BC;m along the inner curvature of the EGL. Nine ACs and surrounding regions from five cerebella were quantified at E16.5 and 13 ACs from five cerebellar were analyzed at E17.5. At E18.5 six ACs from two cerebellar were quantified.</p>

Neo-Hookean model was adopted to describe the elastic properties of both film and substrate, whose strain energy can be expressed as

<p>We defined a dimensionless &#x201C;shape factor&#x201D; as half of the perimeter divided by the square root of half of the area as appropriate for a semi-circle. To compare the model&#x2019;s predictive deviation of this quantity form the semi-circular value we assumed a linear relationship between e and time <italic>t</italic> measured in embryonic days: <italic>&#x220A;</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) &#x003D; 0.3(<italic>t</italic>-15.5).</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using Matlab software. Significance was determined at P&#x003C; 0.05. Twoway ANOVA was used for proliferation analysis as two variables were tracked, mouse and region. Cell shape, volume, fiber distribution, EGL thickness and bulk modulus were run under a standard ANOVA. After ANOVA analysis a multiple comparison was run with Tukey&#x2019;s honestly significant difference criterion. F-test for variance and two-tailed student&#x2019;s paired t-test were used for slice cutting and relaxation quantifications. The degrees of freedom, test statistics, and P values, are given in the figure legends, where appropriate. All error bars are standard deviations. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample sizes. We used sample sizes aligned with the standard in the field. No randomization was used nor was data collection or analysis performed blind.</p>
