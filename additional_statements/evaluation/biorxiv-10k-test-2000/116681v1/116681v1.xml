<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bacteria responsible for the greatest global mortality colonize the human microbiome far more frequently than they cause severe infections. Whether mutation and selection within the microbiome precipitate infection is unknown. To address this question, we investigated <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in 1163 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> genomes from 105 infected patients with nose-colonization. We report that 72&#x0025; of the infections emerged from the microbiome, with infecting and nose-colonizing bacteria showing systematic adaptive differences. We found 3.6-fold, 2.9-fold and 2.8-fold enrichments of protein-altering variants in genes responding to <italic>rsp</italic>, which regulates surface antigens and toxicity; <italic>agr,</italic> which regulates quorum-sensing, toxicity and abscess formation; and host-derived antimicrobial peptides, respectively. These adaptive signatures were not observed in healthy carriers and differed from prevailing species-level signals of selection, suggesting disease-associated, short-term, within-host selection pressures. Our results show that infection, like a cancer of the microbiome, emerges through spontaneous adaptive evolution, raising new possibilities for diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Communicable diseases remain a leading cause of global mortality, with bacterial pathogens among the greatest concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. However, many of the bacteria imposing the greatest burden of mortality, such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> are frequently found as commensal components of the body&#x2019;s microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. For them invasive disease is a relatively uncommon event that is unnecessary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and perhaps disadvantageous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, for onward transmission. Genomics is shedding light on important bacterial traits such as host-specificity, toxicity and antimicrobial resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. These approaches offer new opportunities to understand the role of genetics and within-host evolution in the outcome of human interactions with major bacterial pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence support a plausible role for within-host evolution influencing the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Common bacterial infections, including <italic>S. aureus,</italic> are often associated with colonization of the microbiome by a genetically similar strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Genome sequencing suggests that bacteria mutate much more quickly than previously accepted, and this confers a potent ability to adapt, for example evolving antimicrobial resistance <italic>de novo</italic> within individual patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Opportunistic pathogens infecting cystic fibrosis patients have been found to rapidly adapt to the lung environment, with strong evidence of parallel evolution across patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, the selection pressures associated with antimicrobial resistance and opportunistic infections of cystic fibrosis patients may not typify within-host adaptation in common commensal pathogens that have co-evolved with humans for thousands or millions of years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Candidate gene studies have demonstrated that certain regions, notably quorumsensing systems such as the <italic>S. aureus</italic> accessory gene regulator (agr), mutate particularly quickly <italic>in vivo</italic> and in culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The <italic>agr</italic> operon encodes a pheromone that coordinates a shift at higher cell densities from production of surface proteins promoting biofilm formation to production of secreted toxins and proteases promoting inflammation and dispersal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Mutants typically produce the pheromone but no longer respond to it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The evolution of <italic>agr</italic> has been variously ascribed to directional selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, balancing selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, social cheating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and life-history trade-off<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, the role of <italic>agr</italic> mutants in disease progression remains unclear, since they are frequently sampled from both asymptomatic carriage and severe infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Whole-genome sequencing case studies add weight to the idea that within-host evolution could alter disease propensity. In one persistent <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, a single mutation was sufficient to permanently activate the stringent stress response, reducing growth, colony size and experimentally measured disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In another patient we found that bloodstream bacteria differed from those initially colonizing the nose by several mutations including loss-of-function of the <italic>rsp</italic> regulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Functional follow-up revealed that the <italic>rsp</italic> mutant expressed reduced toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, but maintained the ability to cause disseminated infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, we found that bloodstream-infecting bacteria exhibit lower toxicity than nose-colonizing bacteria in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. These results raise the question: does <italic>de novo</italic> mutation and selection within the microbiome contribute systematically to severe infection?</p>
<p>We addressed this question by investigating the genetic variants arising from within-patient evolution of <italic>S. aureus</italic> sampled from 105 patients with concurrent nose microbiome colonization and blood or deep tissue infection. We annotated variants to test for systematic differences between colonizing and invading bacteria. We discovered several groups of genes showing significant enrichments of protein-altering variants indicating adaptive evolution. Similar enrichments were not observed in asymptomatic carriers, nor between unrelated bacteria, indicating they reflect disease-associated, within-host selection pressures. Our results reveal that adaptive evolution of genes involved in toxicity, abscess formation, cell-cell communication and bacterial-host interaction is associated with the transformation of commensal constituents of the microbiome into invasive infections, providing new insights into the mechanisms of disease in a major pathogen.</p>

<sec id="s2a"><title>Infecting bacteria are typically descended from the patient&#x2019;s microbiome</title>
<p>We identified 105 patients suffering severe <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections admitted to hospitals in Oxford and Brighton, England, for whom we could recover contemporaneous nose swabs from admission screening. Of the 105 patients, 55 had bloodstream infections, 37 had soft tissue infections and 13 had bone and joint infections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The infection was most often sampled on the same day as the nose, with an interquartile range of 1 day earlier to 2 days later (Table S1).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>To discover <italic>de novo</italic> mutations within and between the nose microbiome and infection site, we whole-genome sequenced 1163 bacterial colonies, a median of 5 per site. We detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short insertions/deletions (indels) using combined reference-based mapping and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We identified 35 distinct strains, defined by multilocus sequence type (ST), across patients (Table S1). As expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, colonizing and infecting bacteria were usually extremely closely related (95 patients), sharing the same ST and differing by at most 66 variants. Unrelated colonizing and infecting bacteria (10 patients) differed by at least 1104 variants &#x2013; usually many more &#x2013; and typically possessed distinct STs (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). After excluding variants differentiating unrelated STs, we catalogued 1322 <italic>de novo</italic> mutations within the 105 patients.</p>

</fig>
<p>In patients with closely related strains, the within-patient population structure was always consistent with a unique migration event from the nose-colonizing microbiome to the infection site, or occasionally, vice versa. Infecting and colonizing bacteria usually formed closely-related but distinct populations with no shared genotypes (74/95 patients, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>), separated by a mean of 5.7 variants. There was never more than one identical genotype between nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria, (21/95 patients, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>), indicating that the migration event from one population to the other involved a small number of founding bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In such patients, the shared genotype likely represents the migrating genotype itself. Population structure did not differ significantly between infection types (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.38, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Genetic diversity in the nose (mean pairwise distance, &#x03C0; &#x003D; 2.8 variants) was similar to that previously observed in asymptomatic nasal carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (Reference Panel I, &#x03C0;&#x003D; 4.1, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.13), but was significantly lower in the infection site (&#x03C0; &#x003D; 0.6, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 10<sup>&#x2212;10.0</sup>), revealing limited diversification post-infection.</p>
<p>In most patients the infection appeared to be descended from the nose microbiome. We used sequences from other patients and carriers (Reference Panel II) to reconstruct the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the 95/105 (90&#x0025;) patients with related nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria. We thereby distinguished wild type from mutant alleles). In 49 such patients, we could determine the ancestral population. The nose microbiome was likely ancestral in 39/49 (80&#x0025; of patients with related strains, or 72&#x0025; of all patients) because all infecting bacteria shared <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in common that distinguished them from the MRCA, whereas nose-colonizing bacteria did not. In 16 of those, confidence was high because both mutant and ancestral alleles were observed in the nose, confirming it as the origin of the <italic>de novo</italic> mutation (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Conversely, in 10/49 patients, bacteria colonizing the microbiome were likely descended from blood or deep tissue infections (20&#x0025; of patients with related strains, or 18&#x0025; of all patients) (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Confidence was high for just three of those patients, and they showed unusually high diversity, suggestive of persistent infections (Supplementary data, P063, P072, P093).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b"><title>Protein-truncating mutants are over-represented within infected patients</title>
<p>To help identify variants that could increase the propensity of bacteria colonizing the nose microbiome to infect the blood and deep tissue, we reconstructed within-patient phylogenies and classified variants by their position in the phylogeny. Sequencing multiple colonies per site enabled us to classify variants into those representing genuine differences <italic>between</italic> nose-colonizing and infection populations (<italic>B</italic>-class), transient variants within the nose<italic>-colonizing</italic> microbiome population (<italic>C</italic>-class) and transient variants within the <italic>disease-causing</italic> infection population (<italic>D</italic>-class). We hypothesized that B-class variants would be most enriched for virulence-altering variants, if such variants occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p>
<p>We cross-classified variants by their predicted functional effect: synonymous, nonsynonymous or truncating within protein-coding sequences, or non-coding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, Table S2). As expected, the prevailing tendency of selection within patients was to conserve protein sequences, with <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>s</sub></italic> ratios indicating rates of non-synonymous change 0.55, 0.68 and 0.63 times that expected under neutral evolution for B, C and D-class variants respectively.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label>
<caption><p>Cross-classification of variants within patients by phylogenetic position and predicted functional effect, and comparison to asymptomatic carriers. Neutrality indices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> are defined as the odds ratio of mutation counts relative to synonymous variants in patients versus asymptomatic carriers (Reference Panel I). Those significant at <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05 and <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.005 are emboldened and underlined respectively</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="116681_tbl2.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>In a longitudinal study of one long-term carrier, we previously reported that a burst of protein-truncating variants punctuated the transition from asymptomatic carriage to invasive infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Here we found a 3.9-fold over-abundance of protein-truncating variants of all phylogenetic classes in infected patients compared to asymptomatic carriers (Reference Panel I, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.002, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), supporting the conclusion that loss-of-function mutations are disproportionately associated with evolution within infected patients. This may reflect a reduction within patients in the efficiency with which selection removes deleterious protein-truncating mutations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c"><title>Quorum sensing and cell-adhesion proteins exhibit adaptive evolution between colonizing and infecting bacteria</title>
<p>We hypothesized that variants associated with differential propensity to cause or perpetuate invasive infection would be enriched among the protein-altering B-class variants between the nose and infection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Therefore we aggregated mutations by genes in our reference genome (MRSA252) and tested each gene for an excess of non-synonymous and protein-truncating B-class variants, taking into account the length of the gene. Aggregating by gene was necessary because 1318/1322 variants were unique to single patients. The two exceptions involved non-coding variants arising in two patients each, one B-class variant 130 bases upstream of <italic>azlC,</italic> an azaleucine resistance protein (SAR0010), and one D-class variant 88 bases upstream of <italic>eapH</italic>1, a secreted serine protease inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> (SAR2295).</p>
<p>We found a significant excess of five protein-altering B-class variants representing a 58.3-fold enrichment in <italic>agrA,</italic> which encodes the response regulator that mediates activation of the quorum sensing system at high cell densities (p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;7.5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The <italic>clfB</italic> gene encoding clumping factor B, which binds human fibrinogen and loricrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, showed an excess of five protein-altering B-class variants, representing a 15.9-fold enrichment that was marginally significant after multiple testing correction (p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;4.7</sup>).</p>

<p>Previously we identified a truncating mutation in the transcriptional regulator <italic>rsp</italic> to be the most likely candidate for involvement in the progression to invasive disease in one long-term nasal carrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Although we observed just one variant in <italic>rsp</italic> among the 105 patients (3.9-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic>&#x003D;0.27), we found it was a non-synonymous B-class variant resulting in an alanine to proline substitution in the regulator&#x2019;s helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain. In separately published experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, we demonstrated that this and the original mutation induce similar loss-of-function phenotypes which, like <italic>agr</italic> loss-of-function mutants, express reduced toxicity, but maintained an ability to persist, disseminate and cause abscesses <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>
<p>We found no significant enrichments of protein-altering variants among D-class variants, but we observed a significant excess of six protein-altering C-class variants in <italic>pbp2</italic> which encodes a penicillin binding protein involved in cell wall synthesis (19.0- fold enrichment, p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;6.0</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1a</xref>). Pbp2 is an important target of &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, revealing adaption - potentially in response to antibiotic treatment - in the nose populations of some patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d"><title>Genes modulated by virulence regulators and antimicrobial peptides show adaptive evolution between colonizing and infecting bacteria</title>
<p>To improve the sensitivity to identify adaptive evolution associated with invasive infection, we developed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach in which we tested for enrichments of protein-altering B-class variants among groups of genes. GSEA allowed us to detect signatures of adaptive evolution in groups of related genes that were not apparent when interrogating individual genes.</p>
<p>We grouped genes in two different ways: by gene ontology and by expression pathway. First, we obtained a gene ontology for the reference genome from BioCyc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, which classifies genes into biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. There were 552 unique gene ontology groupings of two or more genes. We tested for an enrichment among genes belonging to the ontology, compared to the rest that did not.</p>
<p>Second, we obtained 248 unique expression pathways from the SAMMD database of transcriptional studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. For each expression pathway genes were classified as up-regulated, down-regulated or not differentially regulated in response to experimentally manipulated growth conditions or expression of a regulatory gene. For each expression pathway, we tested for an enrichment in genes that were up-or down-regulated compared to genes not differentially regulated.</p>
<p>The most significant enrichment for protein-altering B-class variants between nose and infection sites occurred in the group of genes down-regulated by the cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) ovispirin-1 (p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;7.8</sup>), with a similar enrichment in genes down-regulated by temporin L exposure (p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;6.9</sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Like human CAMPs, the animal-derived ovispirin and temporin compounds inhibit epithelial infections by killing phagocytosed bacteria and mediating inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. In response to inhibitory levels of ovispirin and temporin, <italic>agr,</italic> surface-expressed adhesins and secreted toxins are all down-regulated. Collectively, down-regulated genes showed 2.7-fold and 2.8-fold enrichments of adaptive evolution, respectively. Conversely, genes up-regulated in response to CAMPs, including the <italic>vraSR</italic> and <italic>vraDE</italic> cell-wall operons and stress response genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, exhibited 0.4-fold and 0.7-fold enrichments (i.e. depletions), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Thus, genes undergoing adaptive evolution are strongly inhibited by the CAMP-mediated immune response.</p>
<p>Genes belonging to the cell wall ontology showed the second most significant enrichment for adaptive evolution (p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;7.0</sup>). Genes contributing to this 5.0-fold enrichment included the immunoglobulin-binding <italic>S. aureus</italic> Protein A (spa), the serine rich adhesin for platelets (sasA), clumping factors A and B (<italic>clfA, clfB</italic>), fibronectin binding protein A (<italic>fnbA</italic>) and bone sialic acid binding protein (<italic>bbp</italic>). The latter four genes contributed to another statistically significant 6.4-fold enrichment of adaptive protein evolution in the cell adhesion ontology (<italic>p</italic>&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;6.5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, there is a general enrichment of surface-expressed antigens undergoing adaptive evolution.</p>

</fig>
<p>The <italic>rsp</italic> regulon showed the most significant enrichment among gene sets defined by response to individual bacterial regulators (p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;6.4</sup>). Genes down-regulated by <italic>rsp</italic> in exponential phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, including surface antigens and the urease operon, exhibited a 3.6- fold enrichment for adaptive evolution, while up-regulated genes showed 0.6-fold enrichment. So whereas <italic>rsp</italic> loss-of-function mutants were rare <italic>perse,</italic> genes up-regulated in such mutants were hotspots of within-patient adaptation during invasion. Since expression is a prerequisite for adaptive protein evolution, this implies there are alternative routes by which genes down-regulated by intact <italic>rsp</italic> can be expressed and thereby play an important role within patients other than direct inactivation of <italic>rsp.</italic></p>
<p>Loss-of-function in <italic>agr</italic> mutants represent one alternative route, since they exhibit similar phenotypes to <italic>rsp</italic> mutants, with reduced toxicity and increased surface antigen expression, albeit reduced ability to form abscesses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We found significant 2.9-fold and 1.8-fold enrichments respectively of genes both up-and down-regulated by <italic>agrA</italic> during stationary phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, underlining the influence of adaptive evolution on both secreted and surface-expressed proteins during infection (p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;5.6</sup>). We further found 3.7 to 4.0-fold enrichment among genes - including agrA - up-regulated in expression changes induced by mutations conferring vancomycin-intermediate <italic>S. aureus</italic> (VISA) (p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;5.6</sup> and p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;5.2</sup>).</p>
<p>Several genes contributed to multiple evolutionary signals, particularly cell-wall anchored proteins involved in adhesion, invasion and immune evasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, including <italic>fnbA, clfA, clfB, sasA</italic> and <italic>spa.</italic> These multifactorial, partially overlapping signals suggest a large target for selection in adapting to the within-patient environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). The fact that we observed no comparable significant enrichments in C-class and D-class protein-altering variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>) indicates that these evolutionary patterns are associated specifically with invasion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e"><title>Adaptive evolution is evident in both the nose and infection site during severe infections</title>
<p>Having identified adaptive evolution differentiating nose-colonizing and disease-causing bacteria, we next asked whether the mutant alleles were preferentially found in the nose or infection site. We used sequences from other patients or carriers (Reference Panel II) to reconstruct the genotype of the MRCA of colonizing and infecting bacteria respectively in each patient. This allowed us to sub-classify B-class variants by whether the mutant allele was found in the nose-colonizing bacteria (B<sub>c</sub>-class) or the disease-causing bacteria (B<sub>D</sub>-class). <italic>A priori,</italic> we had expected the enrichments of adaptive evolution to be driven primarily by mutants occurring in the disease-causing bacteria (B<sub>D</sub>-class). But instead we found that the most significantly enriched gene sets were driven by mutant alleles occurring both in colonizing and infecting bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>). This indicates there are common selection pressures in the nose and infection site in severely infected patients, leading to convergent evolution across body sites.</p>
<p>The group of genes showing the strongest disparity in signal of enrichment among B<sub>D</sub>- class vs B<sub>C</sub>-class variants was the pathogenesis ontology. Genes involved in pathogenesis were near genome-wide significance in B<sub>D</sub>-class variants, showing a 3.1-fold enrichment (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 10<sup>&#x2212;4.6</sup>) and a statistically insignificant 1.7-fold enrichment in B<sub>C</sub>-class variants (p&#x003D;0.13). B<sub>D</sub>-class mutants driving this differential signal arose in toxins including gamma haemolysin and several regulatory loci implicated in toxicity and virulence regulation (<italic>rot, sarS</italic> and <italic>saeR</italic>). Therefore most, but not all, drivers of adaptive evolution within severely infected patients are as likely to favour mutants in nose-colonizing bacteria as infecting bacteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f"><title>Signals of invasion-associated evolution are specific to infected patients and differ from prevailing signatures of selection</title>
<p>Two lines of evidence show that the newly discovered signatures of within-host adaptive evolution are unique to evolution in infected patients. To test the robustness of our conclusions against the alternative explanation that our approach merely detects the most rapidly evolving proteins, we searched for similar signals in alternative settings: evolution within asymptomatic carriers, and species-level evolution between unrelated bacteria.</p>
<p>There was no significant enrichment of protein-altering variants in any gene, ontology or pathway among 235 variants identified from 10 longitudinally sampled asymptomatic nasal carriers (Reference Panel III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>, Table S3). To address the modest sample size, we performed goodness-of-fit tests, focusing on the signals most significantly enriched in patients. We found significant depletions of protein-altering variants in carriers relative to patients in the <italic>rsp, agr</italic> and <italic>sarA</italic> regulons (p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;4.0</sup>) and the pathogenesis ontology (p&#x003D;10<sup>&#x2212;3.2</sup>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS4">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Nor were the relative rates of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution (<italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub></italic>) higher between unrelated <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Reference Panel IV) in the genes that contributed most to the signals associated with invasion within patients: <italic>agrA, agrC clfA, clfB, fnbA</italic> and sasA. Although synonymous diversity was somewhat higher than typical in these genes, the <italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub></italic> ratios showed no evidence for excess protein-altering change in these compared to other genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>). Accordingly, incorporating this locus-specific variability of <italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub></italic> into the GSEA did not affect the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5</xref>). Taken together these lines of evidence show that the ontologies, pathways and genes significantly differentiated between colonizing and infecting bacteria are a signature specific to evolution within infected patients, and are not repeated in asymptomatic carriers or species-level evolution.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have discovered that common, life-threatening infections of <italic>S. aureus</italic> are frequently descended from bacteria colonizing the human microbiome. These infections are associated with repeatable patterns of bacterial evolution driven by within-patient mutation and selection. The strongest signatures of adaptation occurred in genes responding to cationic antimicrobial peptides and the virulence regulators <italic>rsp</italic> and <italic>agr.</italic> Such genes mediate toxicity, abscess formation, immune evasion and bacterial-host binding. Adaptation within both regulator and effector genes reveals that multiple, alternative evolutionary paths are associated with the transition from microbiome colonization to invasive infection.</p>
<p>The signatures of within-patient adaptation that we found differed from prevailing signals of selection at the species level. This discordance means that infection-associated adaptive mutations within patients are rarely transmitted, and argues against a straightforward host-pathogen arms race as the predominant evolutionary force acting within and between patients. Instead, it supports the notion of a life-history trade-off between adaptations favouring colonization and infection distinct from those favouring dissemination and onward transmission. As such, invasive disease may be analogous to cancer in multicellular organisms, representing an ever-present risk of mutations in the microbiome favoured by short-term selection but ultimately incidental or damaging to the bacterial reproductive life cycle.</p>
<p>The existence of signatures of adaptive substitutions associated with invasive disease raises the possibility of developing new diagnostic techniques and personalizing treatment to the individual patient&#x2019;s microbiome. The ability of genomics to characterize the selective forces driving adaption within the human body in unprecedented detail provides new opportunities to improve experimental models of disease. Ultimately, it may be possible to develop therapies that utilize our new understanding of within-patient evolution to target the root causes of invasive disease from the bacterial perspective.</p>

<sec id="s4a"><title>Patient sample collection</title>
<p>105 patients with severe <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections for whom the organism could be cultured from both admission screening nasal swab and clinical sample were identified from the microbiological laboratories of hospitals in Oxford and Brighton, England. This study design builds in robustness to potential confounders by matching disease-causing and nose-colonizing bacteria within the same patients. Clinical samples comprised blood cultures (<italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 55) and pus, soft tissue, bone or joint samples (n &#x003D; 50). The bacteria sampled and sequenced from one patient (&#x2018;patient S&#x2019;, P005 in this study) have been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Five individuals had both blood and another culture-positive clinical sample; we focus analysis on the blood sample. Nasal swabs were incubated in 5&#x0025; NaCl broth overnight at 37C, then streaked onto SASelect agar (BioRad) and incubated overnight at 37C. We picked five colonies per sample (twelve during the pilot phase involving nine patients), streaked each onto Columbia blood agar and incubated overnight at 37C for DNA extraction. Clinical samples were handled according to the local laboratory standard operating procedure for pus, sterile site and blood cultures. When bacterial growth was confirmed as <italic>S. aureus,</italic> the primary culture plate was retrieved, and multiple colonies were picked. These were streaked onto Columbia blood agar and incubated overnight at 37C for DNA extraction. Sequencing multiple colonies per site allowed us to distinguish genuine genetic differences between nose-colonizing and disease-causing bacteria from transient variants.</p>

A collection of 131 genomes capturing cross-sectional diversity in the noses of 13 asymptomatic carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, arising from the same Oxfordshire carriage study (BioProject PRJEB2881). II. A compilation of 95 unrelated samples from a carriage study of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in Oxfordshire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (BioProject accession number PRJEB255), 145 sequences from a study of within-host evolution of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in 3 individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (BioProject PRJEB2892) and 909 sequences from nasal carriage and bloodstream infection used in a study of whole genome sequencing to predict antimicrobial resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> (BioProject PRJEB6251). We used these samples to improve our reconstruction of ancestral genotypes in each patient. III.

We used these to compare evolution within patients and asymptomatic carriers. IV. A collection of 16 previously-published high-quality closed reference genomes, comprising unrelated isolates mainly of clinical and animal origin: MRSA252 (Genbank accession number BX571856.1), MSSA476 (BX571857.1), COL (CP000046.1), NCTC 8325 (CP000253.1), Mu50 (BA000017.4), N315 (BA000018.3), USA300_FPR3757 (CP000255.1), JH1 (CP000736.1), Newman (AP009351.1), TW20 (FN433596.1), S0385 (AM990992.1), JKD6159 (CP002114.2), RF122 (AJ938182.1), ED133 (CP001996.1), ED98 (CP001781.1), EMRSA15 (HE681097.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.

<sec id="s4d"><title>Variant calling</title>
<p>We used Velvet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> to assemble reads into contigs <italic>de novo,</italic> and Stampy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> to map reads against two reference genomes: MRSA252<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and a patient-specific reference comprising the contigs assembled for one colony sampled from each patient&#x2019;s nose. Repetitive regions, defined by BLASTing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> the reference genome against itself, were masked prior to variant calling. To obtain multilocus sequence types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> we used BLAST to find the relevant loci, and looked up the nucleotide sequences in the online database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://saureus.mlst.net/">http://saureus.mlst.net/</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Bases called at each position in the reference and those passing previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> quality filters were used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from Stampy-based mapping to MRSA252 and the patient-specific reference genomes. We used Cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> to identify SNPs and short indels. Variants found by Cortex were excluded if they had fewer than ten supporting reads or if the base call was heterozygous at more than 5&#x0025; of reads.</p>
<p>Where physically clustered variants with the same pattern of presence/absence across genomes were found, these were considered likely to represent a single evolutionary event: tandem repeat mutation or recombination. These were de-duplicated to a single variant to avoid inflating evidence of evolutionary events in these regions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e"><title>Variant annotation and phylogenetic classification</title>
<p>Maximum likelihood trees were built to infer bacterial relationships within patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. To prioritize variants for further analysis, they were classified according to their phylogenetic position in the tree: B-class (between colonization and disease), C-class (within colonizing population) and D-class (within disease population). Variants were cross-classified by their predicted functional effect based on mapping to the reference genome or BLASTing to a reference allele: synonymous, non-synonymous or truncating for protein-coding sequences, or non-coding.</p>
<p>Where variation was found using a patient-specific reference, these variants were annotated by first aligning to MRSA252 using Mauve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. If no aligned position in MRSA252 could be found, additional annotated references were used. Where variation was found using Cortex only, the variant was annotated by first locating it by comparing the flanking sequence to MRSA252 and other annotated references using BLAST. MRSA252 orthologs were identified using geneDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> and KEGG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f"><title>Reconstructing ancestral genotypes per patient</title>
<p>We constructed a species-level phylogeny for all bacteria sampled from the 105 patients together with Reference Panel II (unrelated asymptomatic carriage isolates and bacteraemia isolates) using a two-step neighbour-joining and maximum likelihood approach, based on a whole-genome alignment derived from mapping all genomes to MRSA252. We first clustered individuals into seven groups using neighbour-joining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, before resolving the relationships within each cluster by building a maximum likelihood tree using RAxML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, assuming a general time reversible (GTR) model. To overcome a limitation in the presence of divergent sequences whereby RAxML fixes a minimum branch length that may be longer than a single substitution event, we fine-tuned the estimates of branch lengths using ClonalFrameML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. We used these subtrees to identify, for each patient, the most closely related &#x2018;nearest neighbour&#x2019; sampled from another patient or carrier. We employed this nearest neighbour as an outgroup, and used the tree to reconstruct the sequence of the MRCA of colonizing and infecting bacteria for each patient using a maximum likelihood method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> in ClonalFrameML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. This in turn allowed us to identify the ancestral (wild type) and derived (mutant) allele for all variants mapping to MRSA252. For variants not mapping to MRSA252, we repeated the Cortex variant calling analysis, including the nearest neighbour, and identified the ancestral allele as the one possessed by the nearest neighbour. This approach allowed us to identify ancestral versus derived alleles for 97&#x0025; of within-patient variants. We used the reconstructions of the within-patient MRCA sequences and identity of ancestral vs derived alleles to subcategorize B-class variants into those in which the mutant allele was found in the colonizing population (B<sub>C</sub>-class) versus the disease-causing population (B<sub>D</sub>-class). 521 (97&#x0025;) of B-class variants were typeable, and in 281 (54&#x0025;) of these, the mutant allele was found in the disease population. This allowed us to test for differential enrichments in these two sub-classes.</p>

<sec id="s4g"><title>Mean pairwise genetic diversity</title>
<p>Separately for the nose site and infection site of each patient, we calculated the mean pairwise diversity &#x03C0; as the mean number of variants differing between each pair of genomes.

We compared B, C and D-class variants within patients to C-class patients within Reference Panel I (13 cross-sectionally sampled asymptomatic carriers).

<sec id="s4j"><title>Gene enrichment analysis</title>
<p>To test for significant enrichment of variants in a particular gene, we employed a Poisson regression in which we modelled the expected numbers of <italic>de novo</italic> variants across patients in any gene <italic>j</italic> as &#x03BB;<sub>0</sub><italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic> under the null hypothesis of no enrichment, where &#x03BB;<sub>0</sub> gives the expected number of variants per kilobase and <italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic> is the length of gene <italic>j</italic> in kilobases. We compared this to the alternative hypothesis in which the expected number of variants was &#x03BB;<italic><sub>i</sub>L<sub>i</sub></italic> for gene <italic>i,</italic> the gene of interest, and &#x03BB;<sub>1</sub><italic>L<sub>i</sub></italic> for any other gene <italic>j.</italic> Using R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, we estimated the parameters &#x03BB;<sub>0</sub>, &#x03BB;<sub>1</sub> and &#x03BB;<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> from the data by maximum likelihood and tested for significance via a likelihood ratio test with one degree of freedom. This procedure assumes no recombination within patients, which was reasonable since we found little evidence of recombination in this study or previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, including no within-host genetic incompatibilities, and we removed physically clustered variants associated with possible recombination events. We analysed all protein-coding genes in MRSA252, testing for an enrichment of variants expected to alter the transcribed protein (both non-synonymous and truncating mutations). These tests were also applied to synonymous mutations and no enrichments were found.</p>

<sec id="s4k"><title>Gene set enrichment analysis</title>
<p>Since the number of genes outweighed the number of variants detected, we had limited power to detect weak to modest enrichments at the individual gene level. Instead we pooled genes using ontologies from the BioCyc MRSA252 database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and expression pathways from the SAMMD database of transcriptional studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The BioCyc database comprises ontologies describing biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. The SAMMD database groups genes up-regulated, down-regulated or not differentially regulated in response to experimentally manipulated growth conditions or isogenic mutations, usually of a regulatory gene. After excluding ontologies or pathways with two groups, one involving a single gene, and combining ontologies or pathways with identical groupings of genes, we conducted 800 GSEAs in addition to the 2650 ontologies comprised of individual loci. The number of groupings of genes was always two for BioCyc (included/excluded from the ontology) and two or three for SAMMD (up-/down-/un-differentially regulated in the experiment). Again we employed a Poisson regression in which we modelled the expected numbers of variants in any gene <italic>j</italic> as &#x03BB;<sub>0</sub><italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic> under the null hypothesis of no enrichment where &#x03BB;<sub>0</sub> gives the expected number of variants per kilobase and <italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic> is the length of gene <italic>j</italic> in kilobases. We compared this to the alternative hypothesis in which the expected number of variants was &#x03BB;<sub>1</sub><italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic> &#x03BB;<sub>2</sub><italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic> or &#x03BB;<sub>3</sub><italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic> for gene <italic>j</italic> depending on the grouping in the ontology/pathway. Using R, we estimated the parameters &#x03BB;<sub>0</sub>, &#x03BB;<sub>1</sub>, &#x03BB;<sub>2</sub> and &#x03BB;<sub>3</sub> from the data by maximum likelihood and tested for significance via a likelihood ratio test with one or two degrees of freedom, depending on the number of groupings in the ontology/pathway. To account for the multiplicity of testing, we adjusted the <italic>p-value</italic> significance thresholds from a nominal <italic>&#x03B1; &#x003D;</italic> 0.05 using the Bonferroni method. This gave an adjusted threshold 10<sup>&#x2212;4.8</sup>.</p>

<sec id="s4l"><title>Longitudinal evolution in asymptomatic carriers</title>
<p>To test whether the patterns of evolution we observed between colonizing and invading bacteria in severely infected patients were typical or unusual, we analysed Reference Panel III (a collection of 10 longitudinally sampled asymptomatic carriers). Since natural selection is more efficacious over longer periods of time, the longitudinal sampling of these individuals gave us greater opportunity to detect subtle evolutionary patterns in asymptomatic carriers. We characterized variation in these carriers as in the patients. Given the modest sample size and smaller number of variants detected in these individuals (235), we performed GSEA to test for enrichments only in particular genes, ontologies and pathways that were significantly enriched within patients, requiring less stringent multiple testing correction.</p>

<sec id="s4m"><title>omegaMap analysis</title>
<p>We estimated <italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub></italic> ratios between unrelated <italic>S. aureus</italic> to characterize the prevailing patterns of selection at the species level. We used Mauve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> to pairwise align 15 reference genomes against MRSA252, i.e. Reference Panel IV. This allowed us to distinguish orthologs from paralogs in the next step in which we multiply aligned all coding sequences overlapping those in MRSA252 using PAGAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. After removing sequences with premature stop codons, we analysed each alignment of between two and 16 genes using a modification of omegaMap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>, assuming all sites were unlinked. We previously showed this assumption, which confers substantial computational efficiency savings, does not adversely affect estimates of selection coefficients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. We estimated variation in <italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub></italic> within genes using Monte Carlo Markov chain, running each chain for 10,000 iterations. We assumed exponential prior distributions on the population scaled mutation rate (<italic>&#x03B8;</italic>), the transition:transversion ratio (&#x03BA;) and the <italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub></italic> ratio (&#x03C9;) with means 0.05, 3 and 0.2 respectively. We assumed equal codon frequencies and a mean of 30 contiguous codons sharing the same <italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub></italic> ratio. For each gene, we computed the posterior mean <italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub></italic> ratio across sites. This allowed us to rank the relative strength of selection across genes in MRSA252, and to account for differences in <italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub>,</italic> as well as gene length, in the GSEA. We achieved this by modifying the expected number of variants in gene <italic>j</italic> to be &#x03BB;<sub>0</sub><italic>&#x03C9;<sub>j</sub>L<sub>j</sub></italic> under the null hypothesis of no enrichment versus &#x03BB;<sub>1</sub><italic>&#x03C9;<sub>j</sub>L<sub>j</sub>,</italic> &#x03BB;<sub>2</sub><italic>&#x03C9;<sub>j</sub>L<sub>j</sub></italic> or &#x03BB;<sub>3</sub><italic>&#x03C9;<sub>j</sub>L<sub>j</sub></italic> under the alternative hypothesis depending on the ontology or pathway, where <italic>&#x03C9;<sub>j</sub></italic> is the posterior mean <italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub></italic> in gene <italic>j</italic>.</p>

We counted the number of protein-altering variants in these genes within patients, and compared to the number in longAterm asymptomatic carriers. P values calculated using Fisher&#x2019;s exact test. &#x002A;Variant totals are different for SAMMD pathways (<italic>rsp, agrA, sarA</italic>) and Biocyc ontologies (cell wall, cell adhesion, pathogenesis) because pathway information is available for a different number of loci in each database.</title></caption>
