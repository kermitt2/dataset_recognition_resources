<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The temporal dynamics of rhizosphere and root microbiota composition was compared between healthy and infected Chinese cabbage plants by the pathogen <italic>Plasmodiophora brassicae</italic>. When inoculated with <italic>P. brassicae</italic>, disease was measured at five sampling dates from early root hair infection to late gall development. The first symptoms of clubroot disease appeared 14 days after inoculation (DAI) and increased drastically between 14 and 35 DAI. The structure of microbial communities associated to rhizosphere soil and root from healthy and inoculated plants was characterized through high-throughput DNA sequencing of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) molecular markers and compared at each sampling date. In healthy plants, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes bacterial phyla dominated the rhizosphere and root microbiota of Chinese cabbage. Rhizosphere bacterial communities contained higher abundances of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes compared to the roots. Moreover, a drastic shift of fungal communities of healthy plants occurred between the two last sampling dates, especially in plant roots, where most of Ascomycota fungi dominated until they were replaced by a fungus assigned to the Chytridiomycota phylum. Parasitic invasion by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> disrupted the rhizosphere and root-associated community assembly at a late step during the root secondary cortical infection stage of clubroot disease. At this stage, <italic>Flavisolibacter</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> in the rhizosphere, and <italic>Bacillus</italic> in the roots, were drastically less abundant upon parasite invasion. Rhizosphere of plants colonized by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> was significantly more invaded by the Chytridiomycota fungus, which could reflect a mutualistic relationship in this compartment between these two microorganisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All plant tissues including roots [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], leaves [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and seeds [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] are surrounded by a large diversity of microorganisms assembled in microbial communities or microbiota. These microbial assemblies represent a continuum of symbiosis with the plant ranging from parasitic to mutualistic interactions with complex microbe-microbe and microbe-plant interactions. Plant growth and health (including development, nutrition, physiology and defence) is influenced by these hosted complex microbial networks. Indeed, microbiota can stimulate seed germination and plant growth, help plants fight off disease, promote stress resistance, and influence plant fitness [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, the plant microbiota extends the capacity of plants to adapt to their environment and contribute in shaping the plant phenotype.</p>
<p>Among these plant compartments, root and rhizosphere are the most studied habitats for microbial communities owing to their great potential for plant nutrition and health [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These microbial communities are mainly recruited by the plant from the soil [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] which is considered as the main microbial seed bank [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Many of these microorganisms including Archaea-and Eubacteria, fungi, and oomycetes live in the rhizosphere, defined as the narrow zone of soil that is influenced by root secretions [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Microbial community assemblies in the rhizosphere are governed by both abiotic and biotic factors. Soil properties, geographical location and Corine Land Cover in interaction with agronomical practices are the main factors that structure these communities [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Plant species and plant genotypes also determine to a lesser extent which members from the soil pool of microorganisms can grow and thrive in the rhizosphere [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Plants may modulate the rhizosphere microbiota to their benefit by selectively stimulating microorganisms showing traits that are beneficial to plant growth and health [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Rhizodeposits released by plant are known to account for variations of the diversity of microbial communities in the rhizosphere [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The modifications of the diversity of microbial communities are then expected to mirror variations of the composition of rhizodeposits. These rhizodeposits include both water-soluble exudates and more complex organic compounds resulting from dead cells sloughed off roots [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The proportion of photosynthates released in the rhizosphere and composition of the corresponding rhizodeposits have been shown to vary during the plant&#x2019;s life cycle according to changes in plant physiology during the course of development and the level of symbiotic associations [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, the genetic structure of bacterial and fungal communities was shown to change significantly during the development of <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> in both vegetative and reproductive stages and the intensity of mutualistic symbiotic association with AM fungi and Rhizobia [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. By extension, changes in microbial diversity and composition following plant-bioagressor interactions is often hypothesized to be based on modifications of the plant chemistry, such as plant exudates [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or root metabolites [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Microorganisms that are able to penetrate and invade the plant root internal tissues form the endosphere or root microbiota. The roots of more than 80&#x0025; of plants are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and thus host symbiosis occurs with few dominant and well-known microorganisms. On the contrary, inside the Brassicaceae family, plants are believed not to form a strong symbiosis with few dominant microorganisms but hosts many types of microorganisms, including Archaea- and Eu-bacteria, fungi, and unicellular eukaryotes, such as algae and amoebae [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. So far, only few studies focused on the composition, the dynamics and the ecological functions of these microorganisms during the plant growth. In contrast to the rhizosphere, the plant roots feature highly specific microbial communities [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The diversity of these endophyte communities is much lower than that estimated for microbial communities outside the root [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. At the interface between the rhizosphere and the roots, the rhizoplane is often defined as a specific habitat of the rhizosphere because it is colonized by microorganisms that are firmly attached to the root surface. However, selective extraction and analysis of this compartment using culture-independent molecular methods and high-throughput sequencing are technically difficult and, consequently the role of the rhizoplane remains poorly understood [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Based on the composition of the rhizosphere and root microbiota, it has been proposed that the plants could assemble their microbiota in two steps, with the first one involving a rapid recruitment of microorganisms in the vicinity of the root and a second step being their entry inside the root [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the second step is more complex than the first one, with each root niche playing a selective role in microbiota assembly [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Even though the composition and recruitment mechanisms of these communities are being extensively investigated, only few studies dealt with the stability of these assemblies during the plant growth and under the effect of biotic stresses. Among biotic stresses, soil borne plant pathogens cause major economic losses in agricultural crops. Most of them are adapted to grow and survive in bulk soil but can also invade the root tissues to establish parasitic relationships with the plant. Since soil borne pathogens are already present in the soil before sowing, infections are usually early and occur during the vegetative stages of plant growth. To infect root tissues, pathogens have to compete with other microorganisms of the rhizosphere microbiota for available nutrients and microsites. One of the major roles of the rhizosphere microbial communities could to provide a frontline defence for plant roots against infection by soil borne pathogens [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This is valid not only for plant but also for animals and humans guts. Some of the mechanisms involved in the activity of these beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms are well studied and include several direct interactions with plant pathogens as well as indirect interactions via the plant by stimulating the plant immune system [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These mechanisms are well documented, using specific strains, for some rhizobacteria like <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. and <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp., and for some fungi like <italic>Trichoderma</italic> sp. and non-pathogenic <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. However, most of the responsible microbial networks underlying these defences&#x2019; mechanisms are currently largely unknown. Recently, some metagenomic approaches provide us new opportunities to enrich our knowledge about the strong interactions between telluric pathogens and their living environment.</p>
<p>In this study, we described the dynamics of the root and rhizosphere (including the rhizoplane) communities of a Brassicaceae species during its vegetative stages, and we analysed the effects of a parasitic infection by <italic>Plasmodiophora brassicae</italic> use as a model system, on the composition and dynamics of these microbial communities. This pathogen is responsible for clubroot disease, a serious disease for many members of the Brassicacae family. <italic>Plasmodiophora brassicae</italic> Woronin is a soil borne obligate protist within the class Phytomyxea (plasmodiophorids) of the protist supergroup Rhizaria [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The pathogen life involves three stages: survival in the soil as resting spores, root hair primary infection and finally secondary cortical infection [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This process is accompanied by the hyperplasia and the hypertrophy of infected roots, resulting in formation of club-shape galls on the root. The tissue disruption associated with large clubs reduces nutrient and water transport within the plant, and consequently reduces plant growth and yield. <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> subsp. <italic>Pekinensis</italic> (Chinese cabbage) was chosen as the plant model of Brassicaceae because the full <italic>P. brassicae</italic> life cycle was easily achieved under controlled conditions in this species. We specifically addressed the following questions: (i) what is the dynamics of root and rhizosphere communities of Chinese cabbage during the vegetative stages of plant growth? (ii) How does <italic>P. brassicae</italic> affect the composition of bacterial and fungal rhizosphere and root communities at each of its life cycle stages? and (iii) which microbial species are selected following the infection by <italic>P. brassicae</italic>? To address these questions, a time-series experiment was conducted under controlled conditions. First, bacterial and fungal metagenomes of root and rhizosphere communities from non-inoculated (also called &#x201C;healthy&#x201D;) plants were described at successive time points. Then, the trajectories of microbial communities from healthy and inoculated plants cultivated in the same conditions were compared over time to analyse the effect of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> on the composition and stability of community assemblies in <italic>B. rapa</italic> plant roots.</p>

<p>The experimental soil used for this study was collected at the INRA experimental site of La Gruche in Western Brittany (N: 48&#x00B0;08.44&#x2019;, W: 01&#x00B0;47.98&#x2019;). The topsoil (0-5 cm) was removed and the layer between &#x2212;5 and &#x2212;30 cm was harvested, homogenized, sieved at 4 mm and subsequently stored in 500 L containers at ambient temperature in the dark until further used. Physical and chemical properties of the soil were determined at the Arras soil analysis laboratory (F-62000, Arras, France). These properties were determined as: 13.3&#x0025; sand, 70.9&#x0025; silt, 15.8&#x0025; clay, pH 6.2, 12.0 g.kg<sup>-1</sup> of organic carbon, 1.2 g.kg<sup>-1</sup> of mineral N and 20.8 g.kg<sup>-1</sup> of organic matter.</p>

<title>Plant growth assay and inoculation</title>
<p>ECD5 plants were cultivated in pots filled with 400 g of the experimental soil mixed with sterilized sand in the ratio 2:1. The experiment was conducted under a randomized complete block design using three blocks consisting of three replicates of four plants each. In each block, replicates were randomly distributed and placed in a greenhouse under the following conditions: 16 hours light (day) at 22&#x00B0;C and 8 hours dark (night) at 19&#x00B0;C. A mean photosynthetically active photon flux density of 150 &#x03BC;mol.m<sup>-2</sup>.s<sup>-1</sup> at plant level during the 16 hours daylight was maintained. Some pots without plants were designated &#x201C;bulk soil&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Inoculum was prepared from three galls stored at &#x2212;20&#x00B0;C as described previously [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In brief, spores were extracted by thawing the frozen galls at room temperature, and then homogenizing in 100 mL of sterilized water at high speed for 2 min. The resulting spore suspension was filtered through two sieves (250 and 100 &#x03BC;m pore diameters). The spore concentration was determined with a Malassez cell and adjusted to 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>7</sup> resting spores.mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Ten-day-old seedlings were inoculated by pipetting 1 mL of spore suspension containing 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>7</sup> spores.mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> onto the soil surface at the base of each seedling. Non-inoculated plants and bulk soil were poured with sterile water. All pots, including bulk soil controls, were watered periodically every three days from the top with 8 mM Hoagland solution to maintain a water retention capacity between 70 - 100&#x0025;.</p>

<title>Quantification of plant traits</title>
<p>To follow the kinetics of plant growth, four plants per replicate were analyzed at 10 (T1), 17 (T2), 24 (T3), 33 (T4) and 37 (T5) days after sowing (DAS). Standard parameters were recorded: number of leaves per plant, shoot and root fresh weight, plant leaf areas, plant height and root length. Statistical analyses were performed using the R software [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Data were compared between healthy and diseased plants using linear models [LMM; function &#x201C;lmer&#x201D;, package &#x201C;lme4&#x201D;, [<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]]. Pairwise comparisons of least square means (LSMeans) were performed using the function &#x201C;lsmeans&#x201D; [package &#x201C;lsmeans&#x201D;, [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]] and the false discovery rate (FDR) correction for p-values [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Symptom development and clubroot severity measurement</title>
<p>Disease severity was assessed in inoculated plants during the vegetative stage of plant growth at 0 (T1), 7 (T2), 14 (T3), 23 (T4) and 35 (T5) days after inoculation (DAI) with <italic>P. brassicae</italic>, corresponding to 10, 17, 24, 33 and 45 DAS, respectively. Clubroot severity was recorded using the scale: 0, no visible swelling; 1, very slight swelling usually confined to lateral roots; 2, moderate swelling on lateral roots and taproot; 2&#x002B;, severe clubs on all roots, but some roots remain present; and 3, no root left, only one big gall. A disease index (DI) was calculated as described by [<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]: DI = (n1&#x002A;25 &#x002B; n2&#x002A;50 &#x002B; n2&#x002B;&#x002A;75 &#x002B; n3&#x002A;100)/N, where &#x201C;ni&#x201D; is the number of plants in the symptom class &#x201C;i&#x201D; and N is the total number of plants tested. Disease data were analyzed using a likelihood ratio test on a cumulative link model [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] [CLMM; function &#x201C;clmm&#x201D;, package &#x201C;RVAideMemoire&#x201D;, [<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]]. Pairwise comparisons of LSMeans were then computed. To measure the hypertrophy of infected root, taproot width was also assessed at each date of sampling at 1 cm under the soil surface. Taproot width data were compared between non-inoculated (or healthy) and inoculated (or diseased) plants using a linear model [LMM; function &#x201C;lmer&#x201D;, package &#x201C;lme4&#x201D;]. Pairwise comparisons of LSMeans [function &#x201C;lsmeans&#x201D;, package &#x201C;lsmeans&#x201D;] and FDR correction for p-values were then performed.</p>

<title>Sampling of &#x201C;rhizosphere&#x201D;, &#x201C;root&#x201D; and &#x201C;bulk soil&#x201D; compartments</title>
<p>Rhizosphere and root compartments from healthy and diseased plants were sampled at 10 (T1), 17 (T2), 24 (T3), 33 (T4) and 45 (T5) DAS. The &#x201C;rhizosphere compartment&#x201D; defined as the soil particles firmly attached to roots was collected by centrifugation of root washings. The &#x201C;root compartment&#x201D; was defined as the root tissues depleted of soil particles and epiphytic bacteria by sequential washing and sonication treatments and was therefore enriched in root-inhabiting bacteria.</p>
<p>Rhizosphere and root samples were collected from planted pots in a soil depth of &#x2212;1 to &#x2212;6 cm from the surface. Roots were separated from non-adhering soil particles, collected in 15 mL Falcon containing 20 mL sterile water and vortexed for 1 min. Seminal and nodal roots were included in the analysis. After vortexing, roots were transferred in a sterile Petri dish and subjected to a second washing treatment with 5 mL sterile water. Double washed roots were transferred in 5 mL sterile water and sonicated twice for 3 s at 40 Hz to detach microbes living in close association with root tissues. Roots were transferred in a Petri dish, cut into fragments smaller than 5 mm, ground to a powder with a pestle in liquid nitrogen-chilled mortar with Fontainebleau sand and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until further analysis. The soil suspensions collected in the Falcon tubes or in the Petri dishes after the first, the second washing treatments and the sonicated solution were pooled, centrifuged at 4,000 g for 20 min and the pellet, referred to as the rhizosphere, was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until further analysis.</p>
<p>Soil samples were collected from unplanted pots at T1, T3 and T5 in a soil depth of &#x2212;1 to &#x2212;6 cm from the surface. The soils from four pots were pooled, transferred in 10 mL sterile water and vortexed for 1 min. The soil suspension was centrifuged at 4,000 g for 20 min and the pellet, referred as the bulk soil, was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until further analysis.</p>

For root samples, five to 150 mg of each root sample were homogenized for 3 &#x00D7; 30 s at 4 m.sec<sup>-1</sup> in a FastPrep&#x00AE;-24 (MP-Biomedicals, NY, USA) in 2 mL of the &#x201C;lysing matrix E&#x201D; solution from MpBio containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 2&#x0025; (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulphate. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 70&#x00B0;C, and then centrifuged at 7,000 g for 1 min at 20&#x00B0;C. To remove proteins from the extracts, 1 mL of the collected supernatant was incubated for 10 min on ice with 1/10 volume of 3 M potassium acetate (pH 5.5) and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 5 min at 4&#x00B0;C. Finally, after precipitation with 900 &#x03BC;L of ice-cold isopropanol, the nucleic acids were washed with 70&#x0025; ice-cold ethanol and DNA was resuspended in 200 &#x03BC;L ultrapure sterile water. DNA was separated from the residual impurities, particularly humic substances, by centrifuging through two types of minicolumns. Firstly, aliquots (100 &#x03BC;L) of crude DNA extract were first loaded onto Microbiospin (Biorad, Hercules, California, USA) columns of PVPP (PolyVinyl PolyPyrrolydone) and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 2 min at 10&#x00B0;C. Secondly, the eluate was purified with the Geneclean turbo kit (Q-Biogene, Illkirch, France). DNA concentration and purity were determined with a Nanodrop (Agilent).</p>
<p>The same protocol was used to extract DNA from soil samples except that, before homogenization in the FastPrep &#x00AE;-24, 2 g of each soil sample were mixed with 5 mL of a solution containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 2&#x0025; (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulphate in a 15 mL &#x201C;lysing matrix E&#x201D; Falcon tube from MpBio.</p>

<title>Sequencing of 16S and 18S rDNA genes</title>
<p>The structure of microbial communities associated to soil and root samples collected during the experiments was assessed though amplification and subsequent sequencing of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) rDNA genes. PCR amplification and sequencing were performed at GenoScreen (Lille, France) using the Illumina Miseq platform to a 2 &#x00D7; 300 bases paired-end version with an adequate read assembly method. For soil and root DNA extracts, a 420 bp fragment of the V5-V7 region of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene was amplified using the universal bacterial primers 799F_16S (5&#x2019;-AACMGGATTAGATACCCKG-3&#x2019;) and 1223R_16S (5&#x2019;-CCATTGTAGTACGTGTGTA-3&#x2019;) [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Before sequencing, PCR products were purified to eliminate a 760 bp fragment corresponding to plant mitochondrial DNA amplification. A 530bp fragment of the fungal 18S rDNA that includes the variable regions V4 (partial) and V5 was also amplified using the primer pair NS22B (5&#x2019;-AATTAAGCAGACAAATCACT-3&#x2019;) and SSU0817 (5&#x2019;-TTAGCATGGAATAATRRAATAGGA-3&#x2019;) [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>

<title>Analysis of MiSeq sequencing data</title>
<p>After reads assembly, sequences were processed with GnS-PIPE bioinformatics platform developed by GenoSol platform and optimized for amplicons analysis [<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The reads were filtered and eliminated if they harbored one or more ambiguities (Ns) or an average quality score below 30. A PERL program was applied to obtain strict dereplication (i.e. clustering of strictly identical sequences). After this initial quality filtering step, the reads were aligned with INFERNAL alignments [<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and clustered at 97&#x0025; sequence similarity into operational taxonomic units (OTU) using another PERL program. All single-singletons (reads detected only once and not clustered) were then deleted in order to eliminate PCR chimeras and large sequencing errors. These final sequences were used to produce rarefaction curves. The retained high-quality reads were used for taxonomy-based analysis of each OTU using similarity approaches against dedicated reference databases from SILVA [<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The raw data sets are available on the European Nucleotide Archive database system under the project accession number PRJEB26948.

<title>Detection of differentially enriched OTUs</title>
<p>EdgeR is a workflow largely based on the free open-source R language and Bioconductor software [<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This workflow was originally used to analyze count-based differential expression of RNA sequencing as part of transcriptome studies [<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and was recently adapted to metagenomic data analysis [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. OTU counts without at least a mean of one read per sample were removed from the analysis. To normalize the data for each sample OTU count, the trimmed mean of M values normalization method (TMM) was used according to the method described by [<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A Log2-transformation was performed on the normalized data for statistical comparisons. Threshold, normalization and transformation steps were performed using a custom R script. To identify differentially abundant genus in bacterial and fungal communities between sampling dates and treatments (non-inoculated or inoculated) in root or soil samples, EdgeR was used to fit a model with treatment (non-inoculated or inoculated) &#x002A; sampling date (T1 to T5) terms to the count data in each compartment by using glmFit and glmLRT with tagwise dispersion and to test for significant effects of each term. EdgeR employs statistical methods supported on negative binomial distribution as a model for count variability. Data from root and rhizosphere soil were not analyzed together because composition biases between samples from these two compartments were not eliminated by TMM normalization. To examine whether having a diverged or conserved communities composition was associated with treatment &#x002A; time effect, the model was fitted to subsets of the normalized counts data and used &#x201C;contrasts&#x201D; to identify genera with significant differential abundances in pairwise comparisons. A likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed to specify the difference of interest and the resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction.</p>

<p>Chinese cabbage plants were cultivated in a greenhouse for 45 days. Ten days after sowing, the plants were inoculated or not with <italic>P. brassicae</italic>. The roots and rhizosphere soils from healthy (or non-inoculated) and diseased (or inoculated) plants were both sampled at 0 (T1), 7 (T2), 14 (T3), 23 (T4) and 35 (T5) days after inoculation (DAI) with <italic>P. brassicae</italic>, corresponding to 10, 17, 24, 33 and 45 days after sowing (DAS). Bulk soil was also sampled within non-cultivated plots at T1, T3 and T5. Microbial composition from each compartment and at each date of sampling was assessed through 16S and 18S high-throughput sequencing. No clubroot symptoms were observed and no <italic>P. brassicae</italic> DNA was detected in non-inoculated plants.</p>

<title>Comparison of communities from root, rhizosphere and bulk soils in healthy plants: the rhizosphere effect</title>
<p>In the samples collected at T1, T3 and T5 from healthy plants and bulk soil, the greatest numbers of bacterial/fungal OTUs were detected in bulk and rhizosphere soils (2,240/1,242 and 2,280/1,220 OTUs on average, respectively) and a significant reduction of richness was observed in root compartment (530/677 OTUs on average) (S1 and S2 Figs). A significant reduction of bacterial and fungal diversities in the root samples compared to bulk and rhizosphere soils was also observed at each sampling date (S1 and S2 Figs). A temporal effect on bacterial richness and diversity was measured but only in the root compartment where the number of OTUs and the Shannon index were higher at T3. In each compartment, no temporal variations of fungal richness and diversity was measured.</p>
<p>When looking at the microbial composition, we found that root bacterial and fungal communities were clearly distinct from rhizosphere and bulk soil communities at each sampling date (S3 Fig). A canonical analysis constrained by the variables of interest revealed that for bacterial communities, the compartment explained 52.5&#x0025; of the variance (p = 0.001; 95&#x0025; confidence interval (CI) = 24.5&#x0025;, 86.7&#x0025;) and the sampling date explained 5.5&#x0025; of the variance (p = 0.001, 95&#x0025; CI = 4.7&#x0025;, 6.4&#x0025;) (S4 Fig).

<title>In the rhizosphere of healthy plants</title>
<p>In the rhizosphere of healthy plants, the most heavily-sequenced bacterial phyla found were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, with 86&#x0025; to 90&#x0025; abundances at each sampling date between T1 and T5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Within the rhizosphere-inhabiting Proteobacteria, the &#x03B1;-Proteobacteria were over-represented compared to the &#x03B2;-, &#x03B3;- and &#x03B4;-Proteobacteria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Between T1 and T5, a significant increase of Proteobacteria (&#x03B1; and &#x03B3;) and a decrease of Firmicutes were measured while no temporal variation of bulk soil composition at phylum level was observed (data not shown). At T5, the enrichment of members from the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla significantly discriminated rhizosphere from bulk soil samples (data not shown). We tried to narrow down the bacterial community to those OTUs (&#x2265; 97&#x0025; sequence similarity), which showed a minimum relative abundance of 0.1&#x0025; at least in one of the rhizosphere samples. A total of 429 OTUs were identified in the rhizosphere of healthy plants (S1 Table). At the genus level, OTU1 assigned as <italic>Bacillus</italic> (Firmicutes) dominated these rhizosphere communities at each sampling date with 12 to 18&#x0025; relative abundances between T1 and T5. OTU4 (<italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, &#x03B1;-Proteobacteria), OTU7 (<italic>Pseudolabrys</italic>, &#x03B1;-Proteobacteria), OTU9 (<italic>Sporosarcina</italic>, Firmicutes), OTU6 (<italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic>, &#x03B1;-Proteobacteria), and OTU10 (<italic>Rhodopseudomonas</italic>, &#x03B1;-Proteobacteria) were also highly represented (S1 Table). No temporal variation of these dominant OTUs was observed between T1 and T5.

<p>The fungal rhizosphere communities from healthy plants were largely dominated by Ascomycota, with 64&#x0025; to 69&#x0025; relative abundances between T1 and T4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Three other phyla, Mucoromycotina (12&#x0025; to 16&#x0025;), Basidiomycota (3&#x0025; to 8&#x0025;) and Chytridiomycota (2&#x0025; to 10&#x0025;) were also detected but at lower frequencies. Until T4, the proportions of these four phyla compared to the whole fungal microbiota were relatively stable. From the 168 fungal OTUs identified with at least a relative abundance of 0.1&#x0025; in one of these rhizosphere samples, OTU2 and OTU4, assigned as two Sordariomycetes, were detected at high frequencies between T1 and T4, but no temporal variations of these dominant OTUs were observed. At T5, fungi from the Chytridiomycota phylum were drastically more abundant (47.5&#x0025;) than at the beginning of the kinetics and a decrease of Ascomycota (64.6&#x0025; at T4 to 37.9&#x0025; at T5) was measured (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). At this date of sampling, OTU1 and OTU16, assigned as two Chytridiomycota, were the most abundant OTUs with 18.3 and 16.4&#x0025; relative abundances, respectively (S1 Table). Variations of other less dominant OTUs were also observed between T1 and T5 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Inside the roots of healthy plants</title>
<p>In the roots of healthy plants, bacterial communities were also dominated by Proteobacteria (41&#x0025; to 51&#x0025; RA between T1 and T5) and Bacteroidetes (21&#x0025; to 33&#x0025;) as in the rhizosphere (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). They also contained Actinobacteria (1&#x0025; to 10&#x0025;) and Firmicutes (3&#x0025; to 7&#x0025;), although to a lesser extent than in the rhizosphere samples. In the root samples, the &#x03B1;- and &#x03B3;-Proteobacteria were over-represented compared to the &#x03B2;- and &#x03B4;-Proteobacteria. Cyanobacteria were also detected. Between T1 and T5, more important variations of phylum frequencies occurred in the roots of healthy plants than in their rhizosphere (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Actinobacteria increased significantly in frequencies while Proteobacteria decreased. A total of 202 genera were identified in these communities. The dominant OTUs were OTU2 assigned to a <italic>Flavisolibacter</italic> (Bacteroidetes) which relative abundances varied between 8&#x0025; and 17&#x0025;, OTU3 assigned to an unknown Cyanobacterium, OTU19 (<italic>Devosia</italic>, &#x03B1;-Proteobacteria), OTU12 (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, &#x03B3;-Proteobacteria) and OTU5 (<italic>Flavobacterium</italic>, Bacteroidetes) (S1 Table). While the proportion of OTU2 strongly increased in the rhizosphere compartment of healthy plants between T1 and T5, the proportion of OTU19 decreased from 4.2&#x0025; to 1.0&#x0025; and no temporal variations was observed for the other main OTUs. Several other bacterial OTUs with significant variations in abundances from one date of sampling date to another were also detected in healthy plant roots (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The root fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota (85.1&#x0025;) at T1 and replaced progressively by fungi from the Chytridiomycota phylum during the kinetics of plant growth. At T5, OTU1 which was assigned to the Chytridiomycota was detected in the roots of healthy plants at a very high frequency with a mean of 53&#x0025; relative abundance (S1 Table).

<p>To conclude, weak fluctuations were measured in the composition of rhizosphere and root communities of healthy plants before T4, whereas important changes occurred in these communities between T4 and T5.

<title>In the rhizosphere of diseased plants compared to healthy plants</title>
<p>In the rhizosphere compartment, no significant variation of bacterial richness and diversities was measured between healthy and diseased plants whatever the sampling date (T1 to T5) (S5 Fig). The same results were observed in fungal communities except that a reduction of diversity occurred in the rhizosphere of diseased plants at the end of the experiment at T5 (S6 Fig). In bacterial communities, the sampling date explained 21.2&#x0025; of the overall variance of the data (p = 0.001, 95&#x0025; CI = 19.5&#x0025;, 24.3&#x0025;) and the inoculation condition (I vs NI) 4.4&#x0025; of this variance. This proportion of the variation, albeit small, was found significant (p = 0.02, 95&#x0025; CI = 3.3&#x0025;, 5.3&#x0025;). The microbial dynamics of healthy and diseased plant communities clearly diverged from T3 to T5 as visualized in PCoA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).

At T5, Proteobacteria (&#x03B1;, &#x03B2; and &#x03B3;) and Bacteroidetes were consistently more abundant in the rhizosphere of diseased than healthy plants, while both Firmicutes and Acidobacteria were less abundant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).

Among these 28 rhizospheric OTUs, the more frequent ones were OTU1 (<italic>Bacillus</italic>) that decreased between T1 and T5 in the rhizosphere of all plants but more drastically in diseased plants especially at T5, and OTU5 (<italic>Flavobacterium</italic>), OTU14 (<italic>Dokdonella</italic>), OTU17 (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic>), OTU35 (<italic>Sphingopyxis</italic>), OTU54 (unknown &#x03B2;-Proteobacteria) which were all significantly more abundant in inoculated than non-inoculated samples at T5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). In fungal communities, the sampling date explained a higher proportion of the variance than in bacterial communities (35&#x0025;, p = 0.001, 95&#x0025; CI = 26.1&#x0025;, 49&#x0025;), while the inoculation condition (inoculated vs non-inoculated) had no significant effect (3.9&#x0025;, p = 0.077, 95&#x0025; CI = 2.8&#x0025;, 5.6&#x0025;). Until T4, no variation of fungal phylum frequencies was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). At T5, while Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mucoromycotina were less abundant in the rhizosphere of diseased than healthy plants, no significant variation of Chytridiomycota was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). However, the major OTU (OTU1) assigned to the Chytridiomycota phylum significantly increased in diseased plant, while four minor OTUs also varied: higher relative abundances for OTU55 and OTU60 but lower for OTU11 and OTU20 in diseased than healthy plant samples at T5 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Higher changes of OTU relative abundances occurred in diseased than healthy plant rhizosphere communities during the time-series experiment (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Inside the roots of diseased plants compared to healthy plants</title>
<p>In the root compartment, no clear significant differences of bacterial and fungal richness and diversity of communities from healthy and diseased plants were found at each date of sampling (S5 and S6 Figs). In bacterial communities, the sampling date explained 24.4&#x0025; of the overall data variance (p = 0.001, 95&#x0025; CI = 20.9&#x0025;, 28.1&#x0025;) and the inoculation condition (inoculated vs non-inoculated) 6.2&#x0025; of this variance (p = 0.002, 95&#x0025; CI = 4.4&#x0025;, 8.2&#x0025;). No significant differences in community composition between inoculated and non-inoculated root samples were observed until T4 when one bacterial OTU (OTU2) assigned to the <italic>Flavisolibacter</italic> genus decreased drastically in relative abundances, while six minor OTUs (OTU54, OTU151, OTU122, OTU150 and OTU422 and OTU440) were slightly more abundant in inoculated than non-inoculated samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). At T5, Actinobacteria were less abundant in the roots of diseased than healthy plants but &#x03B2;-Proteobacteria were more abundant at the phyla-subphyla level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). We observed significant differences in relative abundances of 28 OTUs between inoculated and non-inoculated root samples. Among these 28 OTUs, OTU2 (<italic>Flavisolibacter</italic>), OTU21 (<italic>Streptomyces</italic>) and OTU44 (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic>), were the main OTUs which relative abundances had decreased in diseased plants on one hand (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our study, the stability of assembled root and rhizosphere communities of Chinese cabbage was investigated by a time-series experiment, during the plant growth and under the effect of the parasitic invasion by <italic>P. brassicae</italic>. During the plant growth, for healthy plants, most of Ascomycota fungi previously recruited by the plant were replaced, mainly in the root compartment, by a Chytridiomycota fungus. The root and rhizosphere-associated community assemblies were also strongly modified by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> infection during the secondary cortical infection stage of clubroot disease.</p>
<sec id="s7a">
<title>A weak but significant rhizosphere effect</title>
<p>Clearly, the communities that assembled in the rhizosphere and bulk soils of healthy plants were very different from the communities found in the roots. These results are consistent with earlier findings on other plant species [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. We found a significant &#x201C;rhizosphere effect&#x201D;. Indeed, the alpha diversity analysis showed that the microbiota diversities of the bulk and rhizosphere soils were not distinct from each other. These observations are similar to the findings of several authors in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> who reported the resemblance of bacterial communities between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples in multiple soil types [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. At each sampling date, bulk soil and rhizosphere compartments shared a large proportion of OTUs. However, the enrichment of OTUs assigned to the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes bacterial phyla, but also to the Chytridiomycota fungal phylum, significantly discriminated rhizosphere from bulk soil samples at the end of the experiment.</p>

<sec id="s7b">
<title>The structure of microbial communities associated with the rhizosphere and roots of healthy plants evolved over time</title>
<p>Roots and rhizosphere of healthy plants were preferentially colonized by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes bacterial phyla. Rhizosphere bacterial communities also contained Actinobacteria and Firmicutes but to a higher extent than in the roots. This result was expected because Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria phyla were also highly abundant in the rhizosphere soil of many <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> species like <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and <italic>B. napus</italic> [<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>-<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], with the exception of Bacteroidetes being present at low frequencies in the rhizosphere of <italic>B. napus</italic> cultivated in a Podzol [<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and in a soil collected from an organically managed field [<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Furthermore, higher frequencies of Firmicutes were observed in rhizosphere communities of Chinese cabbage than in other <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> species. Actinobacteria were detected at lower frequencies in the roots of Chinese cabbage than in the roots of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and <italic>B. napus</italic> [<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. As in the roots of all Brassicaceae, Cyanobacteria were also abundant in the root of Chinese cabbage.</p>

<sec id="s7c">
<title>A fungus belonging to the Chytridiomycota phylum became dominant in the roots and rhizosphere of non-inoculated plants</title>
<p>The variations of fungal OTU frequencies in the communities of healthy plants were observed mainly at the two last sampling dates. The main changes in fungal communities concerned the relative abundances of an unknown Chytridiomycota which increased drastically at the end of the experiment in the two plant compartments, but especially in roots. This fungus replaced Ascomycota fungi that were previously dominant. In contrast to bacterial 16S sequences, fewer fungal 18S sequences were available to use in taxonomic assignment. However, [<xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] described the fungal rhizosphere microbiota succession of <italic>B. rapa</italic> plants in compost over three plant generations by sequencing of ITS regions. From the second generation, the Chytridiomycota fungus assigned as <italic>Olpidium brassicae</italic> became dominant in the rhizosphere fungal communities. The organism in our samples could be <italic>O. brassicae</italic> or a close relative, but ultimately this would require confirmation by culturing or more extensive sequencing. This fungus is considered as a soilborne obligate parasite that invades <italic>Brassica</italic> rhizosphere, infects roots and reduces production of pods and seeds [<xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Its resting spores can remain dormant in the soil for up to 20 years before infecting roots. However, no symptom was observed on non-inoculated plant roots in our study. For a non-mycorrhized plant, we wondered whether such an endophytic fungus could play a role in plant nutrition or protection against biotic or abiotic stresses as it was observed with <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> spp. [<xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s7d">
<title>Clubroot disease altered microbial community structure from the Chinese cabbage roots, then from its rhizosphere</title>
<p>To analyse how the soil borne pathogen affects bacterial and fungal root communities, Chinese cabbage seedlings were inoculated by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> resting spores ten days after sowing. Non-inoculated and inoculated plants were cultivated in controlled conditions for 45 days after sowing. The bacterial and fungal metagenomes from the roots and rhizosphere of heathy and diseased plants were compared at several sampling dates after inoculation. We demonstrated that the invasion by a soilborne parasite changed root and rhizosphere microbial communities already assembled from the soil. Such results about the impact of a soilborne pathogen on the indigenous plant-associated microbiome was also described for <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> on the lettuce microbiome [<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and for <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> on the tomato rhizosphere microbiota [<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p>
<p>After inoculation, resting spores of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> released zoospores, which invaded the plant rhizosphere, reached the surface of the root hair and penetrated through the cell wall inside root hairs to form primary plasmodia. After nuclear divisions, the primary plasmodia differentiated into zoosporangia and secondary zoospores were formed in each zoosporangium to be released into the rhizosphere soil [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. During this primary infection stage, <italic>P. brassicae</italic> was not detected in roots by quantitative PCR indicating that the amount of protist was very low. The interactions between the primary and secondary zoospores and the plant microbiota by direct or indirect mechanisms did not result in detectable changes in bacterial and fungal communities, neither in the roots, nor in the rhizosphere. After being released, the secondary zoospores penetrate the taproot cortical tissues. Inside invaded taproot cells, the pathogen develops into secondary plasmodia which are associated to cellular hypertrophy, followed by gall formation in the tissues [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This secondary infection stage was localized inside the roots. During this cortical infection, the amount of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> increased drastically and multiple direct interactions between the protist and the endosphere communities could occur.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that when <italic>P. brassicae</italic> developed inside the roots during its secondary infection stage, it strongly modified the endophytic bacterial communities and lightly the fungal communities. Then, probably as a consequence of the disturbances caused by the interactions between <italic>P. brassicae</italic> and the endophytic communities inside the roots, shifts in rhizosphere communities of diseased plants occurred only at the last date of sampling. Changes in plant microbiota probably occurred by direct microbe-microbe interactions, mainly in the root compartment and then by direct microbial exchanging between the two compartments. However, changes in microbial composition following plant-parasite interactions are often hypothesized to be based on some modifications of the plant chemistry. Salicylic Acid (SA) and Jasmonic Acid (JA) are important hormonal regulators of the plant immune signalling network in which it is commonly accepted that SA is effective against biotrophic and JA against necrotrophic pathogens. However, <italic>P. brassicae</italic> is a biotrophic parasite and both SA and JA signalling pathways could play a role in partial inhibition of clubroot development in compatible interactions between <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>P. brassicae</italic> [<xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The defence-related phytohormones SA and JA are also known to important modulators of microbiota assembly of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The accumulation of SA and/or JA or both in plant roots in response to <italic>P. brassicae</italic> infection could lead to modify the composition of plant rhizodeposits and to stimulate specific microbiota in the roots and rhizosphere.</p>
<p>These direct microbe-microbe or indirect microbe-plant interactions could drive the selection of a plant protective microbiome. In few situations, the competitive interaction between soil borne pathogens and root microbiota for available nutrients and microsites could lead to a strong restriction of the pathogen by the activities of specific microorganisms. These situations were already described in suppressive soils for soil borne [<xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and foliar parasites [<xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. A sequence of events taking place in the rhizosphere of sugar beet seedlings growing in a disease suppressive soil infected by <italic>R. solani</italic> was proposed as a model [<xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The fungus may induce, directly or indirectly via the plant, stress responses in the rhizosphere microbiome by the production of oxalic and phenylacetic acid and lead to shifts in microbiome composition by the activation of Oxalobacteraceae, Burkholderiaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae and Sphingomonadaceae families present in the suppressive rhizosphere microbiome. This stress in turn could trigger a response in these bacterial families, leading to the activation of antagonistic traits that restrict pathogen infection [<xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p>
<p>In light of our results, we also propose a model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>) in which <italic>P. brassicae</italic> during the first step of its life cycle crosses the plant rhizosphere and infect the root hair without inducing changes in microbiota composition as a consequence of plant metabolism modification. Then, the parasite penetrates inside the roots during the second step of its life cycle and induces due to gall growth strong modifications of the root microbiota. This invasion leads to modification of plant metabolites and root exudates, but also to induction of the plant immune system. As consequences of these trophic and defence modifications, we observed the selection in the root microbiota of specific microorganisms that could (i) use new metabolites, (ii) produce a signal triggering defense responses in plants and (iii) activate, directly or indirectly, other microorganisms in the root and rhizosphere microbiota to control the protist. Future studies will focus on investigating these hypotheses by, among others, selecting other soils and plant genotypes to promote the mechanisms that lead to the restriction of parasitic infection. We also want to develop more functional analysis of the plant-microbiota interactions to identify the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>The importance of microbiome for the functioning of plant has been widely recognized. Understanding the complex interactions between the pathogen or more generally biotic stress, the plant and its rhizosphere microbiome network are also key elements in shaping a plant-protective microbiome to improve the efficacies of biocontrol agents and partially resistant plants in controlling soil borne plant diseases. By this, plant microbiome is expected to have an important impact in biotechnology and will be a key point for the next Green Revolution as a harbinger to draw a new model for sustainable agriculture.</p>

<p><bold>S1 Fig. Alpha diversity of bacterial communities from non-inoculated (NI) plants.</bold> Richness (i.e. observed OTU) and diversity (i.e. Shannon index) of non-inoculated root (R), rhizosphere (RS) and bulk soil (BS) samples at different sampling dates are represented. Bacterial diversities were estimated with OTUs count data normalized by sample size and rarefied to 1,000 counts. Sampling date refers to 10 (T1), 24 (T3) and 45 (T5) days after sowing (DAS). For each sample, the number of replicates was n = 3. At each sampling date, lowercase letters indicate significant differences (p-values &#x2264; 0.05) between conditions, which were assessed by ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey&#x2019;s HSD test.</p>

<p><bold>S4 Fig. Constrained Principal Coordinate Analysis (CPCoA) of the bacterial and fungal communities from non-inoculated Chinese cabbage plants and bulk soil samples</bold>. Compartment refers to bulk soil (BS), rhizosphere soil (RS) and roots (R), represented by orange, brown and green colours, respectively. Sampling date refers to 10 (T1), 24 (T3) and 45 (T5) days after sowing (DAS), represented by crosses, triangles and squares respectively. The variances explained by CPCoA axes are given in parenthesis. For each CPCoA, variations between samples in Bray-Curtis distances were constrained by compartment (in the left column) or sampling date (in the right column) factor. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) was performed to quantify the influence of these factors on the &#x03B2;-diversity. The percentage of variation refers to the fraction of the total variance of the data explained by each constrained factor. The p-values indicate if the influence of each of these constrained factors on the &#x03B2;-diversity was significant (p-values &#x2264; 0.05).</p>

<p><bold>S1 Table</bold>. <bold>Comparison of bacterial (B) and fungal (F) OTUs relative abundances in the roots (R) and rhizosphere (RS) of healthy and diseased Chinese cabbage plants</bold>. This table is organized into four tabs corresponding to the description of bacterial OTUs i) from the roots, ii) from the rhizosphere, fungal OTUs iii) from the roots and iv) from the rhizosphere. Mean values of abundance (expressed in &#x0025;) were obtained from three replicates per condition and sampling date. Condition refers to non-inoculated (NI) and inoculated (I) plants. Sampling date refers to 0 (T1), 7 (T2), 14 (T3), 23 (T4) and 35 (T5) days after inoculation (DAI) by <italic>P. brassicae</italic>. OTUs with relative abundances below 1&#x0025; were not shown. Significant differences (p-values &#x2264; 0.05) of OTU frequencies between two samples are indicated by crosses. For example, T2 NI/I refers to the comparison of each OTU frequencies between NI and I plants at T2; NI T1/ I T2 refers to the comparison of each OTU frequencies in communities collected from NI plants at T1 and I plants at T2.</p>
<p><bold>S2 Table. Quantification of non-inoculated (NI) and inoculated (I) plant traits.</bold> The number of leaves per plant, the shoot and root fresh weight, the plant leaf areas, the plant height and root length were measured during the kinetics of plant growth at 10 (T1), 17 (T2), 24 (T3), 33 (T4) and 45 (T5) days after sowing, corresponding to 0 (T1), 7 (T2), 14 (T3), 23 (T4) and 35 (T5) days after inoculation. At each sampling date, numbers in bold and lowercase letters indicate significant differences (p-values &#x2264; 0.05) between inoculated (I) and non-inoculated (NI) plants. SEM: standard error of the mean; nd: not determined.</p>
