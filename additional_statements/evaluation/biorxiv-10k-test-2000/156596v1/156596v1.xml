<abstract>
<p>Multicellular development is largely determined by transcriptional regulatory programs that orchestrate the expression of thousands of protein-coding and noncoding genes. To decipher the genomic regulatory code that specifies these programs, and to investigate globally the developmental relevance of noncoding transcription, we profiled genome-wide promoter activity throughout embryonic development in 5 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. We show that core promoters, generally not thought to play a significant regulatory role, in fact impart broad restrictions on the developmental timing of gene expression on a genome-wide scale. We propose a hierarchical model of transcriptional regulation during development in which core promoters define broad windows of opportunity for expression, by defining a limited range of transcription factors from which they are able to receive regulatory inputs. This two-tiered mechanism globally orchestrates developmental gene expression, including noncoding transcription on a scale that defies our current understanding of ontogenesis. Indeed, noncoding transcripts are far more prevalent than ever reported before, with &#x223C;4,000 long noncoding RNAs expressed during embryogenesis. Over 1,500 are functionally conserved throughout the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup, and hundreds are under strong purifying selection. Overall, this work introduces a hierarchical model for the developmental regulation of transcription, and reveals the central role of noncoding transcription in animal development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Development in metazoans is orchestrated by complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the sequence of the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The expression of thousands of protein-coding and noncoding genes, in precise spatiotemporal patterns, progressively refines the organization of embryonic structures and specifies the differentiation of specialized cell types. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> many of the master genes governing early development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> encode regulators of transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and transcriptional regulation largely accounts for embryo patterning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The regulatory code that specifies these programs, however, remains poorly understood. Sequences that bind transcriptional activators and repressors, known as enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, are generally thought to be the primary determinants of gene expression specificity. Sequences that serve as docking sites for the basal transcription machinery, the core promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, are usually assumed to be structural elements that contribute little or no regulatory information.</p>
<p>Indeed, core promoters contain sequence motifs (<italic>e.g.,</italic> TATA boxes) that serve as a platform for RNA Pol II initiation at transcription start sites (TSSs), but are not by themselves sufficient to induce transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Sequence-specific activators and repressors, collectively designated as transcription factors (TFs), bind to enhancers and foster the assembly of the basal transcription machinery at associated core promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Beyond these general principles, the syntax of the code, and in particular the functional relationship between these two classes of elements, remains obscure. Interacting core promoter-enhancer pairs may be directly adjacent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, or may be located hundreds of kilobases apart in metazoan genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and the rules enforcing specific interactions are unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. There is evidence that core promoters can influence the expression specificity of some genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, but so far this has not been systematically studied in the context of development. Understanding the basis of transcriptional control requires parsing out these complex interactions.</p>
<p>In addition to delineating the rules of gene regulation, it is necessary to expand the concept of gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> to include all the noncoding loci that may control developmental processes. Indeed, it has become increasingly clear that noncoding transcription is very prevalent in Eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and both genetic and biochemical studies have unambiguously established long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as functional components of the cellular machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Exhaustively annotating noncoding transcripts, and identifying those with biologically relevant functions, is crucial to our understanding of development.</p>
<p>Deciphering the meaning of regulatory sequences, or assessing the biological relevance of lncRNA genes, are daunting tasks that require innovative strategies. The use of genome-wide functional assays in a phylogenetic framework is a powerful and general approach to such questions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Indeed, direct measurements of complex genome functions in multiple species provide a sort of genomic Rosetta Stone from which the underlying code can begin to be parsed out.</p>
<p>Here, we used high-throughput TSS mapping in tightly resolved time series to establish genome-wide promoter activity profiles throughout embryonic development in 5 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species spanning 2550 million years (MY) of evolution. Combining TSS identification at single-nucleotide resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> with quantitative measurements of developmental expression patterns, we uncovered unique features of expression timing and core promoter structure to generate novel insights into transcriptional regulation.</p>
<p>We report that distinct types of core promoters are selectively active in three broad phases of embryonic development: specific combinations of core motifs mediate transcription during Early, Intermediate and Late embryogenesis. Each individual class of core promoters is functionally associatedwith distinct sets of transcription factors. We propose a two-tier model of transcriptional control in which core promoters and enhancers mediate, respectively, coarse-grained and fine-grained developmental regulation.</p>
<p>We also show that noncoding transcription is far more widespread than anticipated in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> with 3,973 promoters driving the expression of lncRNAs during embryogenesis. The analysis of these core promoters, most of which are currently unannotated, shows that they largely share the structural and functional properties of their counterparts at protein-coding genes. Through the analysis of their fine structure and sequence conservation, we demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs promoters are under strong purifying selection at the levels of primary sequence and expression specificity. We functionally characterize the <italic>schnurri-like RNA</italic> (slr) locus, which expresses a lncRNA in a highly conserved spatiotemporal pattern suggestive of a role in early dorsoventral patterning.</p>
<p>In summary, these results uncover a major active role for core promoters in regulating transcription, by defining windows of opportunity for activation by enhancer sequences. They also reveal a vastly underappreciated aspect of developmental transcriptomes, by showing that noncoding transcription is extremely prevalent, tightly regulated and, crucially, deeply conserved.</p>

<title>Global multispecies profiling of developmental promoter activity</title>
<p>To explore the genome-wide dynamics of transcriptional regulation and their evolution, we generated developmental transcriptome profiles at both very high temporal resolution (1 hour) and high sequence coverage (137-180 million read pairs per species) for 5 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species spanning 25-50 million years of evolution: <italic>D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. erecta, D. ananassae</italic> and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; total of 120 samples). We focused on embryonic development, a crucial period during which the body plan is established and all larval organs are generated. This data allows direct, genome-wide comparisons of promoter activity in a phylogenetic framework (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In order to map transcription start sites (TSSs) with single-base resolution and accurately measure the activity of individual promoters, we used a high-fidelity method called RAMPAGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> based on high-throughput sequencing of 5&#x2019;-complete complementary DNA (cDNA) molecules. It offers unprecedented specificity and detection sensitivity for TSSs, and its multiplexing capabilities allow for the seamless acquisition of high-resolution developmental time series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Since eukaryotic promoters often allow productive transcription initiation from multiple positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, we use a dedicated peak-calling algorithm to group neighboring TSSs into TSS clusters (TSCs) corresponding to individual promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For each species, we identified 2.2x10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> to 2.7x10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> high-confidence TSCs. The narrow distribution of raw RAMPAGE signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> &#x0026; S1) and of TSCs (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>) over annotated loci confirms our very high specificity for true TSSs. The quantification of promoter expression levels is highly reproducible across biological replicates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>-E). Importantly, paired-end sequencing of cDNAs allows for evidence-based assignment of novel TSCs to existing gene annotations, and provides valuable information about overall transcript structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We can thus attribute 82&#x0025; of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> TSCs to annotated genes, the remaining 18&#x0025; potentially driving the expression of unannotated nonprotein-coding transcripts.</p>
<p>The comparison of biological replicates for the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> time series confirms our ability to quantitatively measure promoter expression dynamics throughout development. Indeed, this analysis (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>) shows excellent reproducibility (Pearson R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> = 0.95) for TSCs with maximum expression &#x003E;25 reads per million (RPM, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> &#x0026; <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>), and very good reproducibility (Pearson R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> = 0.92) with maximum expression &#x2265;10 RPM (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

<p>Post-synchronization of developmental series was achieved by global alignments of all time series to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reference to maximize the overall similarity between genome-wide expression profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The resulting alignments for well-known developmental genes, used here as diagnostic markers, confirm the very high quality of the global alignments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> &#x0026; S4). For all genes with one-to-one orthologs, the expression profiles are overall tightly conserved across species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> &#x0026; S5A), but with substantial gene-to-gene variability: <italic>hunchback,</italic> for instance, displays considerable conservation in the expression of both of its promoters (Pearson R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> of 0.88 and 0.97; <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>), whereas the <italic>RpL19</italic> promoter shows rapid divergence (R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>=0.08; <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>).</p>
<p>We found a strong relationship between selective constraints on expression specificity and gene function: indeed, the degree of expression divergence differs substantially between Gene Ontology (GO) annotation categories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Functions related to the regulation of transcription and splicing display the strongest conservation of expression, in accordance with the known molecular function of many master regulators of early development. Categories related to the core translational machinery and cytoskeletal structures display much more plastic expression specificities.</p>
<p>The high similarity of biological replicates, the accuracy of inter-species alignments for well-known developmental genes, and the biological features of evolutionary divergence patterns, together confirm our ability to accurately quantify promoter expression and its variation across species. Our observations also highlight the central importance of systems-level selective constraints, such as those acting on gene function and developmental stages, in shaping the evolution of gene expression.</p>

<title>Core promoter structure defines broad developmental phases of gene expression</title>
<p>We leveraged our multispecies expression data to study promoter structure-function relationships, and thus gain insights into the regulatory code that determines developmental gene expression. We focused on a set of 3,462 promoters functionally active in all species that we classified either as housekeeping (&#x003C;5-fold variation throughout development) or as developmentally regulated (&#x2265;60&#x0025; of total expression within an 8-hour window). The developmentally regulated group was further clustered based on temporal correlation, yielding a total of 9 distinct expression clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,</xref> see Methods). These thresholds were chosen to maximize the total number of promoters included and the similarity of profiles within each cluster, while still yielding clusters large enough for statistical analysis.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="156596_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>These 9 expression clusters fall into 3 main groups, defined by the core motif composition of the promoters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Indeed, we unexpectedly observed robust enrichments for specific sets of motifs in the promoters of all individual expression clusters. Three major classes emerge, within which motif enrichments are relatively homogeneous (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Remarkably, these three classes define distinct temporal phases of embryonic development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>-B). The Early expression class, enriched for DRE and Ohler-1/5/6/7 motifs, consists of the promoters for maternally deposited transcripts, including the housekeeping cluster. The Intermediate class, enriched for Initiator (INR), MTE and DPE motifs, mediates transcription throughout a broad phase of mid-embryogenesis, from the onset of zygotic expression to the end of organogenesis. The Late class, enriched for TATA boxes, drives transcription around the transition to the first larval stage. Notably, expression clusters with vastly different specificities (e.g., D1 and D2) share the same promoter structure trends.</p>
<p>Importantly, clustering core motifs by their tendency to co-occur within the same promoters, regardless of expression timing, recapitulates the same three main motif groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). It does, however, also uncover a finer data structure, which suggests that there are a variety of promoter subtypes. In addition, we were able to train a classifier with substantial predictive power to distinguish the three promoter classes based solely on core motif scores (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Taken together, our observations suggest that core promoter elements play a significant role in restricting windows of opportunity for expression during distinct periods of development.</p>
<p>Sequences proximal to the three core promoter classes are also enriched for different sets of TFBSs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The Early class preferentially harbors binding sites for Dref and Dfd, while the Intermediate class favors Trl (GAGA motif) and Adf-1. The Late class is enriched in pan, srp and pnr sites. The presence of most core promoter motifs and TFBSs is conserved between species far beyond random expectations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), which validates the overall quality of our motif predictions. Interestingly, TFBSs are often specific for only a subset of expression clusters within a class (e.g., Dfd or GAGA). This suggests a model in which core promoter structure defines broad developmental periods of expression potential, and precise expression timing is then refined by sequence-specific transcription factors. Combinatorial encoding through stereotypical sets of TFBSs is likely to sharpen expression patterns even further (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A-B</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of favored pairings between individual TFBSs and core promoter motifs suggests a possible mechanism to mediate this 2-step specification of expression patterns. Indeed, some TFBSs appear to be strongly associated with specific sets of core promoter motifs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Dref sites, for instance, are preferentially found along DRE and Ohler-1/6/7 core motifs. Likewise, twi and srp TFBSs, which often tend to be found together (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>), have a robust association with INR and MTE. These strong affinities suggest that core motifs may tune the ability of a promoter to respond to specific sets of transcription factors. They may do so by recruiting different sets of general transcription factors (GTFs) that functionally interact with distinct groups of activators. Such a mechanism may channel various regulatory inputs to limited subsets of promoters and thus limit crosstalk between parallel pathways.</p>
<p>We found that the three promoter classes display markedly different profiles of sequence conservation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> &#x0026; S6C). Importantly, this analysis only includes those promoters for which we have detected transcriptional activity in all 5 species, and we can therefore categorically rule out differences in rates of promoter gain/loss as an explanation. These observations suggest that the 3 promoter classes indeed have intrinsic structural differences that make them subject to distinct regimes of natural selection and sequence evolution.</p>

<title>Selection on expression specificity shapes promoter sequence evolution</title>
<p>To further explore the selective pressures acting on regulatory sequences, we investigated quantitative relationships between the evolution of promoter structure (primary sequence) and function (expression specificity). We report a subtle but highly significant correlation between the conservation of promoter sequence and that of expression profiles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>-B). This shows that the effects of selection on expression specificity are reflected in the evolution of promoter sequences. The main areas of differential sequence conservation overlap regions preferentially occupied by precisely positioned core promoter elements (TATA, INR, DPE) and transcription factor binding sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Importantly, this correlation does not hold for sequences &#x003E;50bp downstream of the TSS, which are likely subject to additional selective pressures on 5&#x2019;-UTR and protein-coding sequences. Promoters with highly divergent expression profiles are depleted of sites under purifying selection, and enriched for sites under positive selection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>-D).</p>

<p><italic>Ab initio</italic> motif discovery within the regions of differential sequence conservation returned the canonical consensus sequences for TATA, INR and DPE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). We found that promoters with highly conserved expression profiles tend to have core promoter elements whose sequence is closer to the motif consensus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>), and those in turn tend to be more conserved at the sequence level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Upstream flanking sequences also tend to show higher conservation of individual TFBSs (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>). Importantly, it is possible to detect such a correlation for the binding sites of some individual transcription factors (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B</xref>). This is a rather striking fact, considering that promoter-proximal enhancers generally bind more than one factor, and that many promoters are additionally regulated by distal enhancers not taken into account here. Finally, the conservation of promoter TFBS composition, as expected, also correlates with interspecific divergence (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C</xref>).</p>
<p>These observations establish a clear relationship between core promoter sequence and expression specificity. Selective constraints on developmental expression timing act particularly strongly on core promoter elements, most notably Initiator, DPE and TATA elements. This is consistent with the idea that core promoter motifs are indeed key determinants of this specificity. Together, our results further support the hypothesis that core motifs and general transcription factors play a crucial role in determining promoter expression specificity.</p>

<title>Promoter birth and death are widespread and dynamic</title>
<p>In addition to changes in the specificity of individual promoters, gene expression programs evolve through turnover of regulatory elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.

To rule out genome assembly artifacts, we restricted our analysis to those with syntenic alignments to other genomes, and measured a functional conservation rate of 75&#x0025; (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). As some peaks lack alignments owing to genuine insertions or deletions, we expect the true conservation rate to be within the 49-75&#x0025; range. Analyzing TSC conservation between species pairs, or from a <italic>D. simulans-centric</italic> perspective, yields similar conclusions (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>).</p>

<p>The analysis of replicates for the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> time series shows the false positive rate for gain/loss event detection to be under 0.1&#x0025; (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Although TSCs with lower expression levels tend to be less conserved, general trends are shared between TSCs of all expression levels (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>). Even though a gain/loss of expression during embryogenesis may reflect a shift in specificity rather than a complete gain/loss of function, the vast majority (91.4&#x0025;) of <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> TSCs that were inferred to be lost in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> based on embryo data are never expressed at any other stage of the life cycle (analysis of published data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>). Therefore, we conclude that our strategy accurately and robustly detects promoter gain and loss events. Consistent with this, we can reconstruct the known species phylogeny by treating the presence or absence of individual TSCs as binary discrete characters in a standard parsimony framework (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Functional conservation is reflected in sequence conservation: promoters active in all species display far higher sequence conservation than species-specific ones, which appear no more constrained than surrounding regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref> &#x0026; S10).</p>
<p>While purifying selection clearly plays a major role, a sizeable proportion of TSCs (25-50&#x0025;) are not shared between all species, underscoring the inherently fluid nature of the regulatory landscape. Comparison to published data on the evolution of Twist binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> revealed that overall, promoters evolve no more slowly, and possibly even faster, than TFBSs do (<xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref>). Although a rigorous comparison between such disparate data types is delicate, this shows that promoters and TFBSs do not turn over on vastly different timescales.</p>
<p>Our data also reveals the existence of several thousand novel promoters that cannot be assigned to any annotated genes. Many of those may drive the expression of long noncoding transcripts, and it has long been a matter of debate to what extent this transcriptional activity plays meaningful biological roles. Hence we analyzed their rates of gain and loss to explore the selective pressures they may be subject to. We found a stark contrast in the degree of functional conservation of the two classes, with novel non-genic promoters evolving at a substantially higher rate than genic ones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). There is, however, a very substantial proportion that is deeply conserved, suggesting the possibility of widespread functionality. The discrepancy between the classes may be due to a larger proportion of noncoding transcripts being devoid of biological roles and evolving neutrally. Alternatively, it may instead reflect a more pronounced tendency for noncoding transcription to take on lineage-specific roles and thereby be a driver of adaptation, as has been suggested before. To gain a better understanding of these questions, we sought to investigate in more depth the evolution of noncoding transcription.</p>

<title>Deep conservation of long noncoding RNA promoters</title>
<p>The prevalence and biological relevance of noncoding transcription have long been major areas of contention. Attempts at resolving these issues using genomic sequence conservation have been largely inconclusive, probably due to minimal selective constraints on the primary sequence of these transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> Studying promoter activity experimentally in a phylogenetic framework provides a unique opportunity to rigorously address the question of lncRNA conservation and functionality. Furthermore, our ability to pinpoint TSSs with single-nucleotide accuracy gives us unprecedented leverage to elicit elusive sequence conservation patterns. Furthermore, beyond sequence conservation, we are also in a position to assess selective constraints on the expression specificity of these promoters.</p>
<p>We found 3,682 embryonic TSCs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that could not be functionally linked to any annotated protein-coding or small RNA gene, and could therefore represent putative lncRNA promoters. We also identified TSCs for 291 annotated lncRNAs, bringing the total up to 3,973. Their developmental expression kinetics appear to be diverse and exquisitely stage-specific (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>The analysis of published genome-wide DNaseI hypersensitivity data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> confirmed that these putative lncRNA TSCs are likely to correspond to genuine promoters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> &#x0026; S12). In addition, to verify that the transcripts expressed from these TSCs are indeed independent and devoid of any significant protein-coding potential, we built transcript models from a recently published RNA-seq developmental time course<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We successfully generated transcript models for 16,105 TSCs, including 1475 lncRNA TSCs. Most of them appear to correspond to full-length transcripts, and the vast majority of putative lncRNAs do not overlap annotated protein-coding sequences (<xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Fig. S13</xref>). Analyses of protein-coding potential confirm that the overwhelming majority of transcripts are unlikely to encode proteins, or even peptides as short as 10 amino acids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> &#x0026; S13). Transcripts from 18 loci are likely to encode short open reading frames (sORFs, &#x003C;100 residues). We conclude that the vast majority of candidate transcripts are likely to be genuine lncRNAs.</p>
<p>The expression profiles of lncRNA promoters have unique properties that set them apart. As a class, they tend to be substantially more stage-specific than their protein-coding gene counterparts, as measured by the Shannon entropy of their activity profiles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Comparing their developmental expression timing to that of protein-coding gene promoters suggests a broad diversity of potential developmental functions (<xref rid="figS14" ref-type="fig">Fig. S14</xref> &#x0026; Table S1).</p>
<p>The detection of lncRNA TSCs is highly reproducible across <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> biological replicates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Of all <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lncRNA TSCs, 2,016 can be aligned to the <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> genome assembly and 1,111 are functionally conserved (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), suggesting that they have been maintained since the last common ancestor of these two species. In order to investigate whether lncRNA promoters are under purifying selection, we focused on an extremely stringently selected set of 631 TSCs that are active in all 5 species. This set includes well-known essential noncoding transcription units, such as <italic>bithoraxoid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup></italic> (<xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Fig. S15</xref>) and <italic>roXl</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Overall, the level of sequence conservation at these functionally preserved lncRNA promoters is similar to that observed at protein-coding gene promoters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Their developmental expression specificity is also more constrained than that of many protein-coding gene promoters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Both observations taken together argue strongly for sustained selective pressure on these 631 lncRNA promoters for 25-50 million years. Furthermore, many TSCs of interest were excluded from this analysis simply because of the poor quality of genome assemblies, and this is therefore an extremely conservative set. Therefore, to place a more reasonable lower bound on the true number of conserved lncRNA promoters, we focused on those shared between the 3 species of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup. These 1,529 promoters similarly display a high degree of sequence conservation within the subgroup, and their expression specificity also appears constrained (<xref rid="figS16" ref-type="fig">Fig. S16</xref>).</p>
<p>Still, it remains that lncRNA promoters as a class evolve much faster than those of protein-coding genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), and it has been a matter of debate whether this reflects lineage-specific functions or merely neutral evolution. To address this question, we focused on 195 lncRNA TSCs that are specific to the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup, despite the orthologous sequences being present in the genomes of the two outgroups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Surprisingly, they display the same degree of sequence conservation as the protein-coding gene promoters that are shared throughout the subgroup (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). The assessment of conservation at orthologous sequences in outgroup species confirms that the selective constraints are indeed lineage-specific (<xref rid="figS17" ref-type="fig">Fig. S17</xref>). This argues that these evolutionarily recent lncRNAs have come under purifying selection after acquiring lineage-specific functions.</p>
<p>Taken together, our observations show that a vast proportion of lncRNAs are indeed under purifying selection for biological functions relevant to embryonic development.</p>

<p>The body of the transcription unit displays hallmarks of robust purifying selection within the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). In addition, publicly available chromatin immunoprecipitation data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> reveals the binding of several transcription factors to the promoter region (<xref rid="figS19" ref-type="fig">Fig. S19</xref>), and their putative binding sites identified by sequence motif search also show evidence of purifying selection (<xref rid="figS21" ref-type="fig">Fig. S21</xref>).

<p>Fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) in early embryos revealed expression along the ventral and dorsal midlines at the late blastoderm stage, with the exclusion of lateral regions, the primordial germ cells and the prospective head (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Based on this distinctive expression pattern, highly reminiscent of the well-characterized <italic>schnurri</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, we renamed this lncRNA gene <italic>schnurri-like RNA</italic> (<italic>slr).</italic> This early expression domain subsequently evolves into a complex segmented pattern by the end of germband extension (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). In the late blastoderm, the RNA is found almost exclusively in the cytoplasm at the apical pole of the cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This work provides, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide overview of promoter evolution in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and we leveraged this comparative framework to study the sequence determinants of developmental expression specificity. Through nucleotide-resolution mapping of TSSs and quantitative measurements of expression kinetics, our study yields new insights into the transcriptional regulatory code. We find that distinct classes of core promoters drive transcription in three broad phases of embryonic development. Each class is defined by a characteristic set of core motifs, and is associated with regulation by specific groups of transcription factors. Of note, we successfully detected <italic>in vivo</italic> some functional associations between Dref and housekeeping promoters, and between Trl and some developmentally regulated promoters, that were recently described <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Our analysis generalizes the concept of specific interactions between core promoters and enhancer sequences, and demonstrates for the first time its global relevance in a developmental context.</p>
<p>We propose a hierarchical model for transcriptional regulation in which core promoter syntax defines broad temporal windows of opportunity for activation, and precise expression timing is subsequently refined by the binding of sequence-specific activators and repressors at enhancers. Core promoters may restrict regulatory inputs by recruiting different sets of general transcription factors (GTFs) that functionally interact with distinct groups of transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Some GTFs have been shown to shape the expression specificity of individual promoters, and it is known that different activators and repressors have distinct requirements for cofactors and GTFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Such a mechanism may channel regulatory inputs to limited subsets of promoters, and thus limit crosstalk between promoters and enhancers across the genome. Notably, what applies to time may also apply to space, and it is possible that similar core promoter/enhancer interplay hierarchically specifies gene expression in broad developmental lineages and individual cell types.</p>
<p>Evolutionary analysis of developmental expression specificity further supports this model. First, the three major classes of core promoters defined here show drastically different patterns of sequence evolution, suggesting substantial differences in their underlying structure and functional interactions with the transcriptional machinery. At a finer scale, the conservation of expression specificity across species correlates with the degree of sequence conservation at canonical core promoter elements, such as TATA boxes and Initiator motifs. This is highly suggestive of an instructive role for these sequence elements, once thought generic, in defining developmental gene expression patterns.</p>
<p>Approximately 4,000 promoters were found to drive the expression of lncRNAs during embryogenesis, a strikingly high number for this very brief developmental period. Our findings likely apply to other developmental stages as well, as we previously reported the existence of 7,421 putative lncRNA promoters in an analysis of the whole <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> life cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, we detected the expression of only 205 of 1,119 recently identified lncRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This suggests that we are only beginning to scratch the surface of lncRNA biology in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> Importantly, we show here that vast numbers of these promoters are under strong selective pressure, at the levels of both promoter sequence and expression specificity. A <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup core set of at least 1,529 is under substantial selective constraint, and most of those are therefore highly likely to have biologically relevant activities.</p>
<p>In agreement with previous reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, we find that lncRNA genes evolve faster than their protein-coding counterparts. It has been an unresolved debate so far whether this reflects neutral evolution or lineage-specific functions. Our observation that lineage-specific lncRNAs are also under substantial selective pressure reveals that noncoding transcription may be a major driver of phenotypic diversification and organismal adaptation. We recently showed that transposable elements play an important role in the evolutionary gain of promoters, and in particular of lncRNA promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We propose that transposon proliferation is a major mechanism favoring the neofunctionalization of intergenic regions as sources of biologically active noncoding transcripts.</p>
<p>To open a window into the biology of developmentally regulated lncRNAs, we focused on <italic>schnurri-like RNA,</italic> a deeply conserved yet never-before characterized gene. We experimentally validate the existence and expression kinetics of the slr transcript, and demonstrate that both its promoter sequence and its developmental expression specificity are deeply conserved across drosophilids. Interestingly, this lncRNA is expressed in a spatial profile highly similar to that of the <italic>schnurri</italic> gene, which is part of the Dpp (TGF-p/Smad) signaling pathway and plays an essential role in the establishment of dorsoventral embryo polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. The punctate cytoplasmic localization pattern of the slr lncRNA is reminiscent of the targeting of multiple Dpp pathway components to endosomes in larval wing discs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Endosomes localize apically in the late embryonic blastoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, and mutants for <italic>Sara</italic>, the Smad endosome-targeting factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, die early in embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, suggesting that endosome-based signaling is also essential at that stage. Taken together, our observations are suggestive of a possible role for the slr lncRNA in TGF-P signaling, a crucial pathway in all animals that plays a major role in human disease, including cancer.</p>
<p>In recent years, it has become clear that noncoding transcription serves a myriad of molecular functions in Eukaryotes, and plays a part in virtually every known biological process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. LncRNAs have been shown to regulate transcription and chromatin structure, as well as mRNA stability and protein localization. Sometimes it is the transcription of the locus itself that plays a mechanistic role, rather than the resulting transcript - as in the case of the upstream <italic>bxd</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, which has one of the most highly conserved expression profiles that we have observed. Our work unambiguously demonstrates the biological relevance of noncoding transcription to developmental processes, and establishes <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> as an excellent model for exploring the diverse functions of lncRNA genes. We expect that systematic efforts on a larger scale will illuminate the biology of a long-ignored class of genes that has proven its worth.</p>

<title>Fly stocks &#x0026; Embryo collections</title>
<p>All Drosophila strains were obtained from the Drosophila Species Stock Center at UC San Diego, CA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://stockcenter.ucsd.edu/info/welcome.php">https://stockcenter.ucsd.edu/info/welcome.php</ext-link>). For each species considered we worked with the reference genome strain. Stock numbers: <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> #14021-0231.36, <italic>D. simulans</italic> #140210251.195, <italic>D. erecta</italic> #14021-0224.01, <italic>D. ananassae</italic> #14024-0371.13, <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> #140110121.94. Stocks were maintained on standard cornmeal medium. Embryo collections were performed in population cages (Flystuff, #59-116). 2- to 7-day-old flies were left to acclimatize to the cage for at least 48h and regularly fed with grape juice-agar plates (Flystuff, #47-102) generously loaded with yeast paste. After two 2-hour pre-lays, embryos were collected in 1-hour windows and aged appropriately (24 time points, 0-24h). Embryos were washed with deionized water, dechorionated for 90 sec with 50&#x0025; bleach, rinsed abundantly with water, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>RNA Extraction &#x0026; RAMPAGE Library preparation</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from embryos using a Beadbeater (Biospec, Cat. #607) with 1.0 mm zirconia beads (Biospec, #11079110zx) and the RNAdvance Tissue kit (Agencourt #A32649) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions, including DNasel treatment. We systematically checked on a Bioanalyzer RNA Nano chip (Agilent) that the RNA was of very high quality. Libraries were prepared as described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. 5&#x2019;-monophosphate transcripts were depleted by TEX digest (Epicentre #TER51020). For every time series, each sample was labeled with a different sequence barcode during reverse-transcription, and all samples for the series were then pooled and processed together as a single library. Quality control and library quantification were carried out on a Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity chip. Each library was sequenced on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq 2000.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Genome references &#x0026; annotations</title>
<p>All reference sequences and annotations were obtained from Flybase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org">http://flybase.org</ext-link>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> release 5.49, <italic>D. simulans</italic> r1.4, <italic>D. erecta</italic> r1.3, <italic>D. ananassae</italic> r1.3, <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> r2.9.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Primary data processing</title>
<p>Reads were mapped to the appropriate reference genomes using the STAR aligner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Peaks were called on the pooled data from whole time series, using a custom peak-caller described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We used parameters optimized to yield good TSS specificity with respect to annotations and comparable numbers of peaks for all species. All peaks overlapping FlyBase-annotated rDNA repeats were filtered out.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>TSC conservation</title>
<p>Functional conservation was assessed for all peaks with &#x003E;15 RAMPAGE tags that did not map to heterochromatic regions or chr4 in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> or orthologous regions in other species. We translated the genomic coordinates of each peak in each species to coordinates in the multiple sequence alignment of all genomes (15-way MultiZ alignment from UCSC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/multiz15way">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/multiz15way</ext-link>). To be considered for analysis, each peak was required to have a unique syntenic alignment in all other species considered, defined as follows: both ends of an 800-bp window centered on the middle of the peak had to map to the same strand of the same chromosome or scaffold, 50&#x0025; of bases had to be aligned <italic>(i.e.,</italic> not in assembly gaps), and 25&#x0025; of bases had to align to orthologous bases (not alignment gaps). Raw 5&#x2019; signal for each genome was also translated into multiple alignment coordinates. For each peak from each species, functional conservation was assessed by counting the number of RAMPAGE tags in each species. A peak was considered absent in a target species if it had at least a 100-fold lower signal than in the reference species. Peaks with &#x003C;100 tags in the reference species were considered absent if they had no detectable signal in a target species.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Phylogeny reconstruction</title>
<p>The peaks from all species were merged and collapsed in multiple alignment space to generate a nonredundant set of all peaks in the clade. The conservation of these peaks was assessed as described above. The phylogenetic tree was inferred by treating the presence/absence of each peak as a 2-state discrete character, sequentially using the MIX and PARS program of the PHYLIP suite according to the recommendations of the software documentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html">http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html</ext-link>).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Sequence conservation</title>
<p>Per-base conservation scores were computed by running the phastCons and phyloP programs of the PHAST suite v1.1 on the MultiZ alignment according to the recommendations of the software documentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compgen.bscb.cornell.edu/phast">http://compgen.bscb.cornell.edu/phast</ext-link>). Depending on the subclade of interest, some species were excluded from the alignment for certain analyses. Pre-computed phastCons scores for the full 15-way alignment were downloaded from UCSC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/phastCons15way">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/phastCons15way</ext-link>).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Core promoter motifs</title>
<p>For analyses of motif composition, we only considered <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> TSCs that were functionally conserved across all 5 species. We used pairwise chained alignments downloaded from UCSC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.htmltffruitfly">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.htmltffruitfly</ext-link>) to align the most heavily used position of each TSC <italic>(i.e.,</italic> the main TSS) to all other genomes. Peaks for which the maximum position could not be aligned to all genomes were excluded from the analysis. A custom script was used to search for matches to previously characterized core promoter motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> within a 301-bp window centered on the main TSS. Consensus sequences for sets of peaks with matches to individual motifs were computed using MEME v4.9.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://meme.nbcr.net/meme">http://meme.nbcr.net/meme</ext-link>).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Time series alignment</title>
<p>Z-score transformed gene expression time series from all species were registered to one another using the GTEM suite <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> according to the recommendations of the software documentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flydev.berkelev.edu/cgi-bin/GTEM/index.htm">http://flydev.berkelev.edu/cgi-bin/GTEM/index.htm</ext-link>). One-to-one orthology calls from Flybase (2012 release 2) were used to match gene expression profiles between species. We pre-processed pairs of datasets <italic>(D. melanogaster</italic> and another species) to compensate for differences in annotation quality and peak calling between species. We identified orthologs of TSCs that had detectable expression (&#x003E;10 tags) but initially failed to be called in one species. In addition, when a functionally conserved TSC had been attributed to an annotated gene in one species but not the other, we corrected this discrepancy by attributing it to the gene in both species. For the <italic>D. ananassae</italic> dataset, the 8<sup>th</sup> time point failed to yield acceptable data, and was excluded from the analysis. All time series were upsampled 5-fold and smoothed with a 2-hour window size using RZ-Smooth v4.1. Optimal global alignment paths between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the other datasets were computed with T-Warp v3.2 with Pearson distance matrices (3-hour window). M-Align v2.8 was used to align each series to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reference and smooth the final aligned series (1-hour window). The expression profiles of individual TSCs were registered to one another with M-Align, using the optimal alignment path computed for gene expression profiles. Prior to alignment, we used the UCSC liftOver tool</p>
<p>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x8664/liftOver">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x8664/liftOver</ext-link>) to identify <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> TSCs that aligned well (&#x2265;50&#x0025; of bases aligned) to all other genomes. The temporal expression profiles of those orthologous genomic positions only were aligned.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Expression profile conservation</title>
<p>We defined the conservation of individual expression profiles (TSCs or genes) across a clade as the average Pearson R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> for all pairwise comparisons of species within the clade.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Clustering of TSC expression profiles</title>
<p>We classified all <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> TSCs with maximum expression &#x2265;10RPM (n=11,900) as either Housekeeping (&#x003C;5-fold variation throughout the time series, n=587) or Developmentally Regulated (&#x2265;60&#x0025; of total expression within an 8-hour window, n=6,015). We further selected TSCs functionally conserved in all 5 species (n=240 and n=3,824, respectively). Developmentally regulated TSC profiles were hierarchically clustered (R <italic>hclust,</italic> distance metric <italic>1 - cor(t(expr), method=&#x0022;pearson&#x0022;))</italic> and initially grouped into 12 clusters (R <italic>cutree,</italic> k=12). After filtering out excessively small clusters (&#x003C;200 TSCs, n=4), further analysis was conducted on the remaining 8 regulated clusters (n=3,222 TSCs). See <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> for clustering results.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>lncRNA transcript reconstruction &#x0026; phyloCSF ORF analysis</title>
<p>We ran Cufflinks (v2.2.1) independently on each dataset of a published RNA-seq developmental series. Cuffmerge was used to generate a consensus annotation set. Transcript models were attributed to a RAMPAGE TSC if their 5&#x2019; end lay within 150 of that TSC. Models without a matching TSC were excluded from further analyses. phyloCSF was run on these annotation sets and the 15-way multiZ whole-genome alignments.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Analysis of sequence motifs</title>
<p>We used the MEME Suite v4.9.0 (primarily FIMO and MAST) to search promoter regions for a previously published compendium of motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> corresponding to core promoter motifs and TFBSs. MEME was used to generate consensus motifs from specific subregions of RAMPAGE-defined promoters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Other software</title>
<p>Custom analysis scripts were written in Python 2.7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</ext-link>). R was used for graphics generation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title><italic>FBgn0264479</italic> promoter sequence analysis</title>
<p>We identified potential regulators of the FBgn0264479 promoter based on the BDTNP transcription factor ChIP-chip data available from the UCSC genome browser website<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. For 10 factors that bind the promoter in embryos (bcd, cad, D, dl, ftz, gt, h, hb, Kr, twi), we searched the 600bp upstream of the main TSS for Jaspar TFBS motifs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jaspar.genereg.net">http://jaspar.genereg.net</ext-link>), using FIMO. We identified 7 motifs at a p-value cutoff of 2x10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Northern-blot</title>
<p>We ran 8&#x03BC;g of total RNA per sample on an 8&#x0025; acrylamide 8M urea gel with a Invitrogen Novex minigel system. Transfer to a nylon membrane was carried out in 0.5X TBE in a Novex XCell II module, followed by UV-crosslinking (1,200J). For detection, we used a combination of 6 oligonucleotide probes targeting FBgn0264479 (5&#x2019;-gaacatcgcttgcagtgcag, 5&#x2019;-cgatggatgttgtcggtcgg, 5&#x2019;-ctctcgttctttgattcttc, 5&#x2019;-caggatgtgtggtgttccac, 5&#x2019;-agattggatccttatggttg, 5&#x2019;-atatgctgacactgcatggt). 30 pmol of oligo mix were radioactively labeled with &#x03B3;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>-ATP and PNK. Following phenol-chloroform extraction, the labeled probes were hybridized for 2 hours at 42&#x00B0;C in 40mL of ULTRAHyb buffer (ThermoFischer). After serial washes with decreasing concentrations of SSC buffer (final stringency 0.5X), the membrane was exposed on Kodak BioMax autoradiography film. After stripping and control re-exposure, a similar protocol was used to detect the 5S rRNA on the same membrane, using a single probe (5&#x2019;-caacacgcggtgttcccaagccg).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</title>
<p>Templates for probe synthesis were generated by amplification of FBgn0264479 cDNAs with primers 5&#x2019;-CGATGTTCTCCGACCGACAA and 5&#x2019;-TGCACTACTTAGACTAAATTGGCT. In separate reactions, a T3 promoter sequence was added at either one end or the other, for the generation of sense and antisense probes. Amplicons were cloned into a TOPO-T/A vector (Life Technologies #K4575-01) and checked by Sanger sequencing. RNA-FISH was performed on 0-5 hours AEL <italic>y; cn b sp</italic> embryos as described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, and imaged on a Perkin-Elmer UltraVIEW VoX confocal microscope. Biotin-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-DIG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., Cat. No. 200-062156) previously validated for this application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.</p></sec>

<title>Sample size estimates</title>
<p>In this work, relevant comparisons are between groups of promoters or groups of genes. All comparisons were designed to include all TSCs or genes of interest throughout the genome (e.g., all lncRNA TSCs <italic>vs.</italic> all genic TSCs), while applying expression level thresholds calibrated on the analysis of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> replicates to ensure measurement reproducibility.</p></sec>

The lines represent median profiles, the shaded areas cover &#x002B;/- 1 standard deviation as estimated by bootstrapping. When considering all peaks (top), lncRNA promoters show weaker DNase sensitivity than FlyBase-annotated controls, but the latter also have considerably stronger RAMPAGE signal. When matching RAMPAGE signal distributions (bottom), this trend is reversed. Shaded areas represent &#x002B;/-1 standard deviation, as estimated by downsampling and bootstrapping.</p></caption>
