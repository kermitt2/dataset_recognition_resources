<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) plays a crucial role in various aspects of metabolism, as well as in skeletal development. In the course of investigating metabolic defects in the <italic>Sik3</italic>-deficient mice (<italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic>), we observed that circadian rhythmicity of the metabolisms was phase-delayed. <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice also displayed other abnormalities in circadian rhythms, including lengthening of the period, impaired entrainment to the light-dark cycle, phase variation in locomotor activities, and aberrant physiological rhythms. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> suprachiasmatic nucleus slices from <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice exhibited destabilized and desynchronized molecular rhythms among individual neurons. In cultured cells, <italic>Sik3</italic>-knockdown resulted in cycle-to-cycle fluctuations of the circadian periodicity. Expression levels of PER2, an essential clock protein, were elevated in <italic>Sik3</italic>-knockdown cells but down-regulated in <italic>Sik3</italic>-overexpressing cells, which could be ascribed to a phosphorylation-dependent decrease in PER2 protein stability. Collectively, our results indicate that SIK3 plays key roles in murine circadian rhythms by facilitating phosphorylation-dependent destabilization of PER2.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Circadian rhythms in mammals are governed by the master oscillator located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). A growing body of evidence suggests that oscillation of the circadian clock is generated by the transcriptional-translational feedback loop composed of the circadian clock genes and their products, including the transcriptional activators CLOCK and brain/muscle ARNT-like protein 1 (BMAL1), and their negative regulators PERIODs (PER1/2/3) and CHRYPTOCHROMEs (CRY1/2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Takahashi, 2015</xref>). These factors and their modulators contribute to determination and fine-tuning of the circadian period and the phase. For example, <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic> knockout (KO) mice demonstrate respectively shortened and lengthened periods of the locomotor activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">van der Horst et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Tau</italic>, a constitutively-active casein kinase I epsilon (CKI&#x03B5;) mutation in hamsters and mice, resulted in shortened circadian periods and advanced the phase in behavioral and physiological rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ralph and Menaker, 1988</xref>). These lines of evidence suggest that the transcriptional-translational feedback loop mediated by the clock genes, and the post-translational modification of their products, are indispensable for the circadian clock machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the determination or stabilization of circadian period and phase remain to be investigated in mammals.</p>
<p>Previous reports have suggested that protein kinases play important roles in the regulation of circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Reischl and Kramer, 2011</xref>). For example, CKI&#x03B5;/&#x03B4; phosphorylates PER1 and PER2 proteins, and promotes their proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Eide et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meng et al., 2008</xref>). CRY1 and CRY2 is also phosphorylated by 5&#x2019; AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), and CRY2 is phosphorylated by dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3&#x03B2;), and AMPK, leading to degradation via a ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway as well as intracellular localization being altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kurabayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lamia et al., 2009</xref>). We have previously shown that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) contributes to robust circadian oscillation within individual SCN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akashi et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the significance of kinases in human circadian rhythms has also been studied. Toh <italic>et al.</italic> reported that a point mutation in a clock gene <italic>Per2</italic> results in familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS) in human kindred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Toh et al., 2001</xref>). FASPS is an inherited abnormal sleep pattern in which the circadian clock is phase-advanced by around four hours. The <italic>Per2</italic> mutation causes hypophosphorylation of PER2 protein by casein kinase I&#x03B5; (CKI&#x03B5;). CKI&#x03B5; requires another priming kinase for phosphorylation, which is yet to be identified. Overall, these data suggest that posttranslational modifications of clock proteins by a series of protein kinases play critical roles in regulation of the circadian clock. In the current study, we focused on salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) because we found abnormal circadian rhythmicity on metabolism while we were studying <italic>Sik3</italic> knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Uebi et al., 2012</xref>). SIK1&#x2013;3 are Ser/Thr kinase members of AMPK family, which is known as an energy sensor and regulates various aspects of metabolism in both vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies suggest critical roles of mammalian SIK3 in the metabolism of glucose, cholesterol and bile acid, and in retinoid metabolism and skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Sasagawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Uebi et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice exhibit severe metabolic symptoms such as hypolipidemia and hypoglycemia, and die very frequently on the first day after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Uebi et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, they exhibit severe defects in chondrocyte hypertrophy, expanded growth plate or cartilage, accumulation of chondrocytes, and impaired skull bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Sasagawa et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, we found that <italic>Sik3</italic> KO mice also demonstrate abnormal circadian phenotypes, which are similar in part, but distinct form those of CKI mutants.</p>

<title><italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice exhibit abnormal circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior</title>
<p>While studying metabolic phenotypes in <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>mice, we observed that average oxygen consumption rhythm, representing circadian rhythmicity of metabolism, was significantly phase-delayed by approximately 6 h as compared to wild-type (WT) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We also found that other physiological rhythms related to rectal temperature and food consumption were phase-delayed to similar degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>). These data raised the possibility that SIK3 plays a role in the circadian clock machinery. To examine whether <italic>Sik3</italic> mRNA is expressed in the hypothalamic SCN, the central circadian oscillator, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on mouse brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), and found that <italic>Sik3</italic> mRNA is expressed in the SCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>, arrowhead). SIK3 protein expression in the SCN was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). We then performed behavioral analysis of the <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice and WT (<italic>Sik</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup>) littermates. In 12-hour light-dark (LD) cycle conditions (LD 12:12), <italic>Sik</italic><bold><sup>&#x002B;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup></bold> mice displayed nocturnal activity profiles in which they were entrained to the LD cycle, with activity onset at light-off (ZT12, zeitgeber time representing light-on as ZT0 and light-off as ZT12 in LD 12:12 conditions) and the activity offset at light-on (ZT0). In stark contrast, <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice failed to become completely entrained to the LD cycle, although they did still retain nocturnality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>, upper panels). Their activity onset and offset in the LD cycle did not correspond exactly to the light-off and light-on times respectively, and they fluctuated significantly with regard to light-on/light-off. These data suggest that <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice have a defect in a light-input pathway. In constant dark (DD) conditions, the free-running period of the wheel-running activity rhythms of the <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice (24.17 &#x002B;/&#x2212; 0.09 h, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 13) was significantly longer than that of <italic>Sik</italic><bold><sup>&#x002B;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup></bold> mice (23.80 &#x002B;/&#x2212; 0.05 h, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d, e</xref>). The ability of <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice to entrain to a new LD cycle was examined by photic re-entrainment experiments, where mice kept in DD conditions were transferred to an LD cycle, the phase of which was shifted substantially from the free-running activity rhythm. While the free-running locomotor rhythms of <italic>Sik</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> mice rapidly reentrained to the new LD cycle, in contrast <italic>Sik3</italic><bold><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></bold> mice showed slower re-entrainment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>, lower panels). Even after 2 weeks in the new LD cycle, we still observed a component of the free-running rhythm formed under the DD condition (red dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>, lower right panel) although the majority of the locomotor rhythm components were entrained to the LD condition. We then compared the acrophase of the activities of individual <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Sik</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> mice in LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Acrophase means did not differ significantly between the two genotypes, but the individual variation (standard deviation) in the acrophase distribution in <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice was significantly greater than that of <italic>Sik</italic><bold><sup>&#x002B;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup></bold> mice (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001, F-test). These data indicated that SIK3 plays a crucial role in photic entrainment in addition to controlling and sustaining circadian behavioral rhythmicity. Notably, <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice were relatively less active at night than <italic>Sik</italic><sup>&#x002B;/</sup><sup>&#x002B;</sup> mice, and more active during the day, which resulted in lower amplitude in the locomotor activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d, g</xref>).</p>

<title>Molecular rhythms are desynchronized and circadian periods and phases are varied in <bold><italic>ex vivo</italic></bold> SCN</title>
<p>In order to explore how SIK3 deficiency affects the circadian clocks in the SCN and periphery, <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice were crossed with <italic>Per2::Luciferase</italic> knockin (KI) mice (<italic>Per2-luc</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup>) expressing PER2-luciferase fusion protein in place of PER2, which monitors the circadian oscillation of PER2-luciferase fusion protein both in SCN explants and in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>).

As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fukuda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Sik</italic><bold><sup>&#x002B;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup></bold> SCN explants exhibited robust circadian bioluminescence rhythms and the individual cells were well synchronized with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a, d</xref>, Supplementary video 1). In contrast, the circadian periods and phases of the individual cells in <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> SCN slices were varied and their bioluminescence rhythms became gradually desynchronized with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e, h</xref>, Supplementary video 2). To further evaluate the difference in the SCN rhythms between the two genotypes, we performed quantitative analyses on the periods and phases of the imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a&#x2013;h</xref>). The number of oscillating cells in <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> SCN, calculated as the percentage of oscillating pixels within the SCN, was significantly lower than that of <italic>Sik</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> controls (95.87&#x0025; in <italic>Sik</italic><bold><sup>&#x002B;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup></bold> SCN vs. 83.25&#x0025; in <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> SCN, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.1, chi-square periodogram).

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> Sik3-knockdown destabilizes circadian periods</title>
<p>Fluctuation of the circadian period and phase in <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> prompted us to examine whether alteration of SIK3 expression levels affected cellular circadian rhythms in culture. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with vectors expressing four different <italic>Sik3</italic> short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and cellular rhythms were monitored via a <italic>Bmal1-luc</italic> reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2k, l</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Unexpectedly, the average periods of all the <italic>Sik3</italic>-knockdown (<italic>Sik3</italic>-KD) cells were significantly shorter than those of WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Detailed period analyses revealed that all <italic>Sik3</italic><bold>-</bold>KD cells exhibited unstable circadian rhythms, in which sequential circadian periods varied on a day-to-day basis. In addition, half-periods, representing individual peak-to-trough or trough-to-peak periods, fluctuated in all the knockdown (KD) cells examined during 1 week of monitoring, with a characteristic of longer trough-to-peak period and shorter peak-to-trough period. These data suggest that cellular circadian rhythmicity is destabilized by <italic>Sik3</italic> deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2m</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Consistent with the <italic>ex vivo</italic> SCN explant data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2i, h</xref>), these results suggest that SIK3 is involved in circadian rhythm stability.</p>

<title>PER2 expression levels are altered in <bold><italic>Sik3-KD</italic></bold> cells and <italic>Sik3</italic>-overexpressing cells</title>
<p>Previous reports indicate that phosphorylation-mediated modulation of clock protein stability is mediated by multiple protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Reischl and Kramer, 2011</xref>). To explore whether SIK3 modifies the phosphorylation status of the clock proteins, we performed western blotting of cellular lysates with different expression levels of SIK3. We first examined PER2 clock protein because it has multiple phosphorylation sites. In <italic>Sik3</italic>-overexpressing (<italic>Sik3</italic>-OX) NIH3T3 cells, we found a significant reduction in PER2 protein levels in <italic>Sik3</italic>-OX compared to control cells (non-OX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Cells expressing the constitutive-active SIK3 mutant T163E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Katoh et al., 2006</xref>), exhibited significantly reduced PER2 protein level in HEK293T17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), whereas in cells expressing the kinase-deficient SIK3 mutant K37M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Katoh et al., 2006</xref>), PER2 protein levels were comparable to those of <italic>Sik3</italic>-OX cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Supplementary Fig3</xref>). This suggests that the kinase activity of SIK3 is required for PER2 destabilization. Remarkably, we observed that the relative level of the up-shifted PER2 band (relative to the total of the PER2 bands) was elevated in <italic>Sik3</italic>-OX cells as compared to non-OX controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Protein phosphatase (&#x03BB;PPase) treatment reduced these up-shifted PER2 bands, which confirmed that the shifted bands were phosphorylated forms of PER2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c</xref>). We further investigated whether <italic>Sik3</italic>-OX induced PER2 instability or degradation. When protein synthesis was inhibited by treatment with cycloheximide (CHX), we observed a rapid decrease in PER2 levels in SIK3-OX cells as compared to the control cells, suggesting that SIK3 accelerates PER2 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). To confirm SIK3-mediated phosphorylation-dependent degradation of PER2, we employed four different types of <italic>Sik3</italic>-KD cells, and examined both PER2 abundance and its phosphorylation status. All four <italic>Sik3</italic>-KD cell-types expressing different <italic>Sik3</italic> shRNAs exhibited elevated levels of PER2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Fig. 5a, b</xref>), and the relative levels of the up-shifted PER2 bands were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). &#x03BB;PPase treatment of these cells resulted in reduction of the up-shifted PER2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Degradation of PER2 protein levels in any of the <italic>Sik3-</italic>KD cells was significantly delayed, for as long as 6 h after CHX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3h</xref>). These data strongly suggest that SIK3 regulates PER2 abundance and stability through its phosphorylation.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, CKI is known to phosphorylate PER2 and induce PER2 degradation through proteasomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Eide et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meng et al., 2008</xref>). It has also been reported that CKI requires an unidentified priming kinase prior to phosphorylate its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gallego and Virshup, 2007</xref>). To address the question of whether SIK3 phosphorylation of PER2 is independent of phosphorylation by CKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Eide et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meng et al., 2008</xref>), NIH3T3 cells co-transfected with <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Sik3</italic> were incubated with the CKI inhibitor IC261, or the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Neither of the inhibitors affected PER2 degradation by SIK3, confirming that SIK3-dependent PER2 degradation is independent of CKI-mediated PER2 degradation through a proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Conversely, KD of <italic>Sik3</italic> had no significant effect on the CKI-mediated phosphorylation states of PER2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Taken together, these data indicated that PER2 phosphorylation via two different kinases, CKI and SIK3, are independent events.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, we found that SIK3-mediated phosphorylation of PER2 regulates the abundance of the protein by accelerating its degradation. Interestingly, while both CKI&#x03B5;/&#x03B4; and SIK3 phosphorylate PER2 and promote its degradation, the underlying mechanisms appear to differ from each other. However, two questions remain: how do they share or divide roles in terms of the regulation of PER2 stability and abundance, and why are two kinases that induce distinct degradation systems required for a common substrate? To address these questions, it is worth noting that <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice exhibit unique circadian phenotypes compared to those of <italic>Tau</italic> mutants, although both of these mutants also have features in common. While <italic>Tau</italic> mice, constitutively active <italic>CKI&#x03B5;</italic> mutants, demonstrate significant phase advance and shorter periods in physiological and behavioral rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ralph and Menaker, 1988</xref>), <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice, which are loss-of-function mutants, exhibit significant phase delay and longer circadian periods as shown in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). It has also been reported that <italic>CKI&#x03B4;</italic> KO liver exhibits significantly longer period in <italic>Per2-luc</italic> rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Etchegaray et al., 2009</xref>). These data suggest that both SIK3 and CKI contribute to precise circadian period determination, and that deficiency of either protein results in period shortening along with stabilization of PER2. On the other hand, unique circadian phenotypes observed in <italic>Sik3</italic><bold><sup>-</sup></bold><sup>/-</sup> mice included: (i) fluctuating circadian periods and phases both <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a&#x2013;f</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), (ii) impaired light-entrainment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>), (iii) reduced amplitude in locomotor activity rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1g</xref>), and (iv) desynchrony of rhythmicity among SCN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d, h</xref>, Supplementary video 1, 2), none of which have been reported in <italic>CKI</italic> mutants except that reduced amplitude in <italic>Per2-luc</italic> rhythms were observed in <italic>CKI&#x03B4;</italic> KO liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Etchegaray et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, our present. Thus, the data from the current study suggest that while CKI is involved in determination of precise circadian period length and phase, SIK3 is more important for stabilization of circadian periods and phase via intercellular coupling, as well as for photic entrainment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4f</xref>). In other words, while the two kinases may have an overlapping role or roles with regard to phosphorylating and destabilizing PER2, SIK3 and CKI contribute differentially to circadian clock regulation.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that the above-described phenotypic differences between <italic>Tau</italic> mutants and <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice may be at least partly explained by differential roles of the two protein kinases outside of the SCN. For example, SIK3 is expressed in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lizcano et al., 2004</xref>) as well as in the SCN, and hence disruption of this gene may affect the circadian light-input pathway involving the retina, which is critical for photic-entrainment. SIK3 is also known to play a role in various aspects of metabolism, and <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice exhibit significantly lower blood sugar levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Uebi et al., 2012</xref>). This could result in lower amplitude of behavioral rhythms, as they must feed intermittently even in the resting period (daytime).</p>
<p>It has previously been shown that constitutive expression of <italic>Per2</italic> causes arrhythmia <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Yamamoto et al., 2005</xref>). This might partly explain the aberrant rhythmicity in <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice due to accumulation of PER2 protein. Desynchrony among SCN cells, which has been observed in circadian rhythm mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Maywood et al., 2006</xref>), may lead to insufficient light-entrainment or inconstant behavioral rhythms. Lastly, the <italic>Sik3</italic> gene is highly conserved in evolution, from nematodes to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>), and <italic>Sik3</italic> deficiency results in severe phenotypes such as high lethality after birth and metabolic and skeletal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Sasagawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Uebi et al., 2012</xref>). These previous studies suggest that SIK3 plays an essential role in various tissues and organs. Considering that animal behavior is influenced by physiological states, we cannot exclude the possibility that behavioral and physiological abnormalities in circadian rhythms in <italic>Sik3</italic>&#x2212;/&#x2212; mice such as those observed in the current study are due to defects not only in the SCN, but in other parts of the brain or in other organs or tissues. Conditional <italic>Sik3&#x2212;/&#x2212;</italic> mice may be a suitable tool for addressing these questions in the future.</p>
<p>It has been reported that SIK1, another isoform of the SIK subfamily, is involved in photic entrainment of the master circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Jagannath et al., 2013</xref>), although its involvement in the central circadian clock remains uncertain. Notably, while the present study demonstrated that SIK3 regulates photic-entrainment, light responses in behavior observed in <italic>Sik1</italic>-KD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Jagannath et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Sik3<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice are contrary to each other: rapid vs. delayed re-entrainment, respectively. In addition, the SIK3 substrate clock protein PER2, which is involved in circadian regulation, differs from the SIK1 substrate CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Jagannath et al., 2013</xref>). Although further studies are necessary to elucidate the involvement of the two SIK isoforms in light-resetting mechanisms, the current study suggests that SIK3 contributes to the light-input pathway in addition to the circadian clock machinery in a manner that differs from SIK1, by regulating different substrates and signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Just recently, Funato <italic>et al.</italic> reported that, by large-scale forward-genetics screen in mice to seek dominant sleep abnormalities, a splicing mutation of <italic>Sik3</italic> (referred to as a <italic>Sleepy</italic> mutant) resulted in significant decrease in wake time caused by extended non-REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Funato et al., 2016</xref>). In the <italic>Sleepy</italic> mutants in which a point mutation resulting in a lack of a protein kinase A (PKA) recognition site of the SIK3 protein, the authors also indicated that locomotor activity rhythms in the mutants were normal. Although the results were in contrast with our present data, the discrepancy could be explained by difference in introduced mutations; i.e., a partial deletion in the <italic>Sleepy</italic> mutants versus null mutation in our <italic>Sik3</italic> KO mice.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>All animals were cared for in accordance with Law No. 105 and Notification No. 6 of the Japanese Government, and experimental protocols involving the mice were approved by the relevant ethics committees at Kindai University and Nagoya University. Mice were maintained at 23 &#x00B1; 1 &#x00B0;C under LD 12:12 or constant darkness (DD conditions). The derivation of the <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Uebi et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the PGK-neo cassette was inserted in place of exon 1 of <italic>Sik3.</italic> The successful targeting of embryonic stem cells was confirmed by Southern blot analysis, and the cells were injected into C57BL/6N blastocysts. To obtain <italic>Sik3</italic>-deficient embryos, <italic>Sik3</italic> heterozygous male and female mice were mated and WT littermates were used as controls. <italic>Per2-luc</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> mice were originally generated by Joseph Takahashi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>). All mice used in the experiments were mated with C57BL/6J mice (SLC Japan). Genotyping was performed using genomic DNA from a tail tip of each mouse via a standard protocol as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Sasagawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec>
<title>Behavioral analyses</title>
<p>Mice were individually housed in translucent polypropylene cages under 12:12 LD (200 lux) and DD conditions, and locomotor activity was assessed by an area sensor (infrared sensor, Omron). Activity was continuously monitored and analyzed using ClockLab software (Actimetrics).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation</title>
<p>Riboprobe was labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-UTP (Amersham/GE Healthcare) by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription using either T7 or SP6 polymerase (Promega). Frozen mouse brain sections (40 &#x03BC;m thick) were hybridized with riboprobe overnight, and exposed to Kodak film (BioMax MR). The <italic>Sik3</italic> cDNA (550 bp) was amplified via PCR and subcloned into a pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). The plasmids were linearized with NcoI to synthesize riboprobe.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Under deep pentobarbital anesthesia (100 mg/kg body weight, i.p.), mice were fixed transcardially with 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.2), and frozen sections (30 &#x03BC;m thick) were prepared. Immunohistochemical incubations were performed at 4 &#x00B0;C for 4 overnights using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 0.1&#x0025; TritonX-100 (PBS-T) with 5&#x0025; skim milk (Nacalai). For immunofluorescence, sections were incubated in a free-floating state with a mixture of primary antibodies for 4 overnights (1 &#x03BC;g/ml), then Alexa Fluor-488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200, Invitrogen; Jackson ImmunoResearch) overnight at 4 &#x00B0;C. For immunohistochemical analysis, we used affinity-purified primary SIK3 antibody (BD Bioscience).</p>

<title>Bioluminescence measurement, imaging, and quantitative analysis</title>
<p>For bioluminescence recording, NIH3T3 cell lines (Riken Cell Bank) transfected <italic>Bmal1-luc</italic> with were used. For SCN imaging, adult <italic>Sik3</italic>&#x2212;/&#x2212; <italic>Per2-luc</italic><sup>&#x002B;/</sup><sup>&#x002B;</sup> and <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>&#x002B;</sup> <italic>Per2-luc</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup><sup>/</sup><bold><sup>&#x002B;</sup></bold> mice were used. Cells were harvested in a 35-mm petri dish with DMEM culture medium including 10&#x0025; fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 nM DEX, and 0.1 mM luciferin, and circadian bioluminescence rhythm was monitored in Kronos (ATTO). For singlecell time-lapse imaging, LV 200 (Olympus) was used for cultured cells or SCN slices. SCN slices from adult <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> <italic>Per2-luc</italic><sup>&#x002B;/</sup><sup>&#x002B;</sup> and <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>&#x002B;</sup> <italic>Per2-luc</italic><sup>&#x002B;/</sup><sup>&#x002B;</sup> mice were prepared using a Microslicer (Dosaka Japan, 300 &#x03BC;m thick) and incubated on MilliCell membrane (Merck Millipore) in a 35-mm petri dish with culture medium (DEM-F12 supplemented with B27, Life Technologies). Exposure time for a single image was 55 min, and time-lapse images were captured for 5 consecutive days. Movies were produced using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices).</p>

<title>Analysis of period and acrophase in SCN slices</title>
<p>For each pixel of the bioluminescence movie, the time series was extracted. Each data-set was detrended and analyzed via the chi-square periodogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Sokolove and Bushell, 1978</xref>). Only periods with a significance level of less than 10&#x0025; were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). The acrophase was subsequently computed via Cosinor&#x2019;s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Halberg, 1967</xref>), which extracts a peak phase of the bioluminescence signal of each pixel. Each pixel&#x2019;s phase relative to that of the averaged signal over the whole SCN slice was plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell culture and plasmids for transfection</title>
<p>NIH3T3 and HEK293T17 cells were cultured and passaged under 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM (Sigma) containing 1.8 mg/ml NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x03BC;g/ml streptomycin, and 10&#x0025; FCS (Equitech Bio, Inc.). NIH3T3 and HEK293T17 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) respectively, in accordance with the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech) was used as a transfection control. A vector encoding 6xMyc epitope-tagged PER2 (termed myc-PER2 in the figures) was kindly provided by Dr. Louis Ptacek (University of California, San Francisco). For Flag-SIK3, an oligonucleotide encoding the FLAG epitope sequence was fused to the 5&#x2019;-end of full-length mouse <italic>Sik3</italic> (m<italic>Sik3</italic>) cDNA cloned into pcDNA 3.1. Mutations (Lys to Met at K37 or Thr to Glu at T163) were introduced into <italic>mSik3</italic> using site-directed mutagenesis. Flag-CKI&#x03B5; and Flag-CKI&#x03B5;-KN (Kinase Negative) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Doi et al., 2004</xref>). Several shRNA expression vectors targeting m<italic>Sik3</italic> gene and a control vector were obtained from QIAGEN. The following sequences were used: <italic>mSik3</italic> sh&#x0023;1 (5&#x2019;-CTGCA GGCAC AAGTG GATGA A-3&#x2019;), <italic>mSik3</italic> sh&#x0023;2 (5&#x2019;-AGCAG CAACC CGAGA ACTGT T-3&#x2019;), <italic>mSik3</italic> sh&#x0023;3 (5&#x2019;-CCCAA CTTTG ACAGG TTAAT A-3&#x2019;), <italic>mSik3</italic> sh&#x0023;4 (5&#x2019;-TGCCA CCACG TTCAG TAGAA A-3&#x2019;), and control sh (5&#x2019;-GGAAT CTCAT TCGAT GCATA C-3&#x2019;). The target sequences were inserted into a pGeneClip neomycin vector (Promega).</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were blocked in a blocking solution (1&#x0025; [w/v] skim milk in PBS-T [50 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.4]) for 1 h at 37 &#x00B0;C then incubated overnight at 4 &#x00B0;C with a primary antibody in the blocking solution. Signals were visualized via an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Science). The blot membrane was subjected to densitometric scanning, and the band intensities were quantified using Image Quant software (GE Healthcare). The primary antibodies used were anti-&#x03B2;-actin (Sigma), anti-Flag (Sigma), anti-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-PER2 (Alpha Diagnostic Inc.). Primary antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories).</p>
