<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The membrane attack complex (MAC) is one of the immune system&#x2019;s first responders. Complement proteins assemble on target membranes to form pores that lyse pathogens and impact tissue homeostasis of self-cells. How MAC disrupts the membrane barrier remains unclear. Here we use electron cryo-microscopy and flicker spectroscopy to show that MAC interacts with lipid bilayers in two distinct ways. Whereas C6 and C7 associate with the outer leaflet and reduce the energy for membrane bending, C8 and C9 traverse the bilayer increasing membrane rigidity. CryoEM reconstructions reveal plasticity of the MAC pore and demonstrate how C5b6 acts as a platform, directing assembly of a giant &#x03B2;-barrel whose structure is supported by a glycan scaffold. Our work provides a structural basis for understanding how &#x03B2;-pore forming proteins breach the membrane and reveals a mechanism for how MAC kills pathogens and regulates cell functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The multiprotein membrane attack complex is a bactericidal weapon of the innate immune system that also modulates inflammation and proliferation when formed on self-cells <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The MAC pore targets a wide range of pathogens, forming on and killing Gram negative bacteria <sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, enveloped viruses <sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, and parasites <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. This innate immune effector is essential for fighting bacteria of the genus <italic>Neisseria</italic> <sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>; with genetic deficiencies in component proteins leading to recurrent infections <sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Host cells are protected from bystander damage by the GPI-anchored receptor CD59, the only membrane-bound inhibitor of MAC <sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Deficiency of CD59 causes the lethal blood disorder Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, a disease characterized by thrombosis and chronic haemolysis <sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Complement activation and MAC formation also contributes to killing of cancer cells during immunotherapy treatments <sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, developing a molecular model of how MAC forms on target cells is essential for understanding the immune response to microbes and for the development of therapeutics that regulate complement activity.</p>
<p>MAC assembles from soluble complement proteins in an obligate sequential pathway <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In the presence of membranes, C5b6 (a complex comprised of C5b and C6 <sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>) binds C7 to form the lipophilic MAC precursor C5b7 <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. C8 irreversibly binds the nascent complex, resulting in the membrane-inserted C5b8 <sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. C9 molecules associate with C5b8 in the membrane to form C5b9 and polymerize to complete the MAC pore <sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Previous electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) reconstructions of the complex revealed that the final MAC is comprised of 6 polypeptide chains (C5b, C6, C7, C8&#x03B1;, C8&#x03B2;, C8&#x03B3;) together with 18 C9 monomers that are arranged in a &#x2018;split-washer&#x2019; configuration <sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Based on structural similarity with bacterial homologues, the giant (110 &#x00C5; diameter) &#x03B2;-barrel pore is formed when helical bundles in the Membrane Attack Complex-Perforin (MACPF) domains transform into transmembrane &#x03B2;-hairpins (TMH) <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, although a molecular mechanism for how this occurs is not currently understood.</p>
<p>In this study, we used cryoEM to determine the structures of two MAC conformations at near atomic resolution and derive a nearly complete atomic model for the pore. In combination with flicker spectroscopy, we show how MAC assembly impacts biophysical properties of the bilayer and resolve the mechanisms of membrane interaction and MAC activity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The human MAC pore was formed on liposomes from individual complement proteins, solubilized with detergent and purified for structural studies, as described previously <sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. By integrating newly collected data across multiple electron microscopes (Supplementary Table 1), we were able to improve the overall resolution of the MAC from 8.5 &#x00C5; <sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> to 4.9 &#x00C5;; however, density corresponding to the interface between C6 and the terminal C9 was still poorly resolved. We used 3D classification procedures to computationally isolate two stoichiometrically identical conformations, open and closed, which varied in the extent of &#x03B2;-barrel closure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1). 2D classification of negatively stained complexes inserted into a lipid monolayer confirmed the presence of these states in a membrane environment (Supplementary Fig. 2a), in agreement with cryo-tomography structures of MACs in liposomes <sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The maps were further subdivided into three components: an asymmetric region (C5b, C6, C7, C8), a hinge region (C7, C8, two C9 molecules) and a C9 oligomer. Using a masked refinement strategy coupled with signal subtraction <sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, we improved the resolution of the asymmetric regions for each conformation to 4.7 &#x00C5; and 5.9 &#x00C5; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, Supplementary Figs. 1, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The hinge region of the open conformation was resolved to 4.9 &#x00C5; (Supplementary Figs. 1 and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Masked refinement from signal-subtracted images followed by sub-volume averaging was used to resolve the averaged C9 monomer at 4.4 &#x00C5; (Fig.1a, Supplementary Figs. 1, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The new maps enabled us to build an atomic model that includes the irregular and asymmetric &#x03B2;-barrel pore (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Crystal structures for soluble components (C5b6 <sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and C8 <sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, a heterotrimeric complex consisting of &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;, and &#x03B3; polypeptide chains) together with homology models for C7 and C9 were fitted into the density and used as starting points for model refinement.</p>

<title>MAC is a flexible immune pore</title>
<p>We used 3D classification to resolve MAC conformational flexibility (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1). The open conformation is characterized by a 30 &#x00C5; wide chasm that runs the length of the complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The asymmetric region juts into the lumen of the barrel like a &#x201C;paddle&#x201D;, exaggerating the MAC&#x2019;s split washer shape (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and Supplementary Movie 1). C8&#x03B3; is wedged in the crease between the rotated asymmetric component and adjacent C9 oligomer, and may limit the rotation of the paddle. While curvature of C9 arcs vary at either end, the central section is near-circular with monomers equally spaced approximately 16&#x00B0; apart (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">c</xref>), reminiscent of the arrangement observed for a C9 homo-oligomer <sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Although the chasm is sealed in the closed conformation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), interfaces mediating the MACPF-rim and transmembrane regions are not flush. The asymmetric region swings back and meets C9 in a noncanonical MAPCF-thrombospondin (C6-TSP3) interaction with limited buried surface area (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Despite a contiguous extracellular &#x03B2;-barrel, there remains a gap within the transmembrane pore where the shorter hairpins of C6, C7 and C8 abut those of C9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>C5b6 is a spatial platform for MAC assembly</title>
<p>Limited resolution of previous MAC reconstructions <sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> prevented any structural analysis of rearrangements within C5b6 during pore formation. We therefore investigated how C7-binding to C5b6 triggers the lipophilic transition using our high-resolution maps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Our data reveal that the C5b6 complex serves as a spatial platform directing MAC assembly. C5b MG domains 1, 4, and 5, together with the &#x201C;link&#x201D; domain, bridge a cluster of arches comprised of the lipoprotein receptor class A (LDL) domains of C6, C7 and C8&#x03B2; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 3). While the core of C5b remains largely unchanged during the transition, C6 undergoes marked domain rearrangements upon integration into the MAC.</p>
<p>C6 is comprised of 10 individual domains that can be classified into three functional parts: 1) those that mediate the interaction with C5b, 2) regulatory auxiliary modules, and 3) the pore-forming MACPF domain. Large structural re-arrangements of C6 auxiliary domains accompany conformational changes within the pore-forming MACPF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Superposition of the soluble and membrane-associated forms of C5b6 show that although the relative orientation of the C5b thioester-like domain (TED) and C6 C-terminal complement control protein (CCP) domains remains unchanged, the C6 LDL is displaced by C7-binding. The two N-terminal TSP domains (TSP1 and TSP2) undergo a concerted rotation with respect to the core MACPF, resulting in a final position near-perpendicular to the plane of the membrane, stabilizing the newly formed &#x03B2;-sheet. Rotations of regulatory auxiliary modules coincide with an unbending and untwisting of the C6 MACPF &#x03B2;-sheet. Movement of the C6 epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain and MACPF helix-turn-helix (CH3) motif release the pore-forming TMH regions, in agreement with lower resolution structures of pore-forming toxin homologues <sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Auxiliary domains of complement proteins mediate the lipophilic transition</title>
<p>We next explored whether conformational changes incurred by C6 were conserved across complement proteins. N- and C-terminal TSP domains of C7, C8 (TSP1 and TSP2), and C9 (TSP1), overlay with those of C6 (TSP2 and TSP3) in its membrane-inserted &#x201C;active&#x201D; conformation (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the position of CH3 relative to the MACPF &#x03B2;-sheet is the same for all MAC components (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Although the core MACPF domains of all MAC components overlay well, the glycine-rich hinge enables a wide range of angles to accommodate the varied curvature of the barrel. Similar to the pore transition of C6, C8 regulatory auxiliary modules (EGF and TSP2) release TMH regions of both &#x03B1; and &#x03B2; chains (Supplementary Fig. 4c). However, unlike the dramatic C6 MACPF unbending, the angle of the C8&#x03B2; MACPF sheet remains constant (Supplementary Fig. 4d). Component strands untwist to align with the C7 &#x03B2;-sheet and pack against the C7 CH3 latch. Surprisingly, C8&#x03B2; CH3 does not undergo a lateral shift during pore formation, suggesting that the C8&#x03B2; MACPF is already primed for membrane insertion.</p>
<p>To investigate the molecular basis underpinning the directionality of MAC&#x2019;s sequential assembly, we compared charge complementarity between complement proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The interface between C6-C7 MACPF domains is formed mainly by electrostatic interactions. Incorporation of C8&#x03B1; exposes a negatively charged patch that drives the recruitment of the positively charged face of C9. C9 oligomerization is propagated by electrostatic complementarity between leading and lagging faces, consistent with CDC pore formation <sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Mutations that alter polymerization of C9 are implicated in some cases of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) <sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We are now able to assign disease-related variants on the human C9 structure, and find that three of these AMD-associated mutations (P146S, G105R, and T149I) would likely impact the negatively charged patch that drives oligomerization. G105R and T149I variants decrease polymerization of C9 <sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and would reduce the footprint of the negatively charged interface. By contrast, variant P146S increases self-polymerization of C9 <sup>25</sup> and may act by increasing polarity of the surface.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>MAC glycan scaffold</title>
<p>The MAC is a highly-glycosylated assembly with all complement components post-translationally modified <sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We observe additional density within the C9 CH3 loop, consistent with <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation of residue T427 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 5a). The CH3 latch of C8&#x03B1; is similarly glycosylated (N407) <sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. 5b), suggesting a mechanism whereby glycans may be involved in the release of transmembrane hairpins. Furthermore, we observe density for the three reported C9 N-glycans <sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, which arrange into concentric arcs that line the &#x03B2;-barrel&#x2019;s concave face (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1b-c</xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The position of the glycan at N394 is juxtaposed to the C-terminus of C9, which wraps across the &#x03B2;-hairpins of an adjacent monomer. The second glycan, N256, is near an intramolecular disulfide bond that restrains the C9 hairpin geometry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This band of alternating disulfide bridges is continued throughout the MAC, restraining the hairpins of C6, C7 and C8 at a similar position above the membrane. Finally, the C9 glycan, N215, is proximal to the outer leaflet of the membrane and may be involved in orienting the hairpin as it inserts into the bilayer. We map the N-linked glycan of C8&#x03B2; (N189) on the newly extended &#x03B2;-hairpins and find that it lies within the hinge mediating the open and closed conformations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3a-b</xref>). N324 of C6 is also within a flexible hinge of the MACPF domain (Supplementary Fig. 5c).</p>

<p>Our data suggest that glycans of complement proteins could play a key role in maintaining the structural integrity of a flexible giant &#x03B2;-barrel. To determine whether N-linked glycosylation of C8 and C9 affect curvature of the MAC &#x03B2;-barrel, we removed glycans by digestion with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Supplementary Fig. 5d). We mixed deglcosylated C8 and C9 with native C5b6 and C7 to form MACs on lipid monolayers and imaged them using negative stain electron microscopy. Glycan removal led to irregular pores with significantly distorted curvature (Supplementary Fig. 5f). We next used a liposome lysis assay to explore whether distorted pores impacted MAC ability to rupture lipid bilayers. MACs formed from deglycosylated proteins had similar lytic activity to wild type pores (Supplementary Fig. 5e). As a pore comprised of a single C9 is sufficient to lyse simple membranes<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, &#x03B2;-barrel shape may instead be important for passage of proteins that degrade the peptidoglycan layer of more complex prokaryotic targets <sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Interactions with the lipid bilayer</title>
<p>Complement proteins within the MAC interact with the lipid bilayer in two distinct ways. Transmembrane hairpins of MAC components vary in length and amino acid composition. C6 and C7 hairpins contain a single band of aromatic residues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). A patch of positively charged residues resides proximal to the tips of the short C6 and C7 &#x03B2;-hairpins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>), suggesting interaction with phospholipid headgroups of the outer leaflet. By contrast, two rings of aromatic residues separated by the width of the bilayer anchor C8 and C9 within the membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The longer hairpins of C8 and C9 expose hydrophobic residues on the &#x03B2;-barrel&#x2019;s outer surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), consistent with an interface with lipid tails.</p>
<p>To investigate how these two types of interactions impact mechanical properties of the target cell membrane, we performed fluctuation analysis (flicker spectroscopy) of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We used phase contrast light microscopy to track individual GUVs at each step of MAC assembly and confirmed the presence of functional pores by diffusion of sucrose across the bilayer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We recorded membrane fluctuations after the addition of C5b6, C7, C8, and C9, or when buffer replaced C5b6 in the sequence. When C5b6 was absent, the amplitude of the GUV membrane fluctuations remained constant throughout the experiment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4a-b</xref> and Supplementary Movie 2). The small increase in fluctuations observed at later time points is likely to be due to slight increases in temperature caused by lamp heating. By contrast, membrane fluctuations of GUVs that supported MAC assembly were reduced upon C8-binding and were diminished to negligible levels with the addition of C9 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4a-b</xref> and Supplementary Movie 2). These data suggest that large MAC lesions in cells may lead to rigidification of the membrane due to equilibration of the extracellular milieu across the pore.</p>
<p>Where fluctuation amplitudes could be parameterized, we analyzed changes in bending modulus and tension during MAC assembly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 6). Bending modulus is an intrinsic property of the membrane and describes the amount of energy required to change the mean curvature of a lipid bilayer. It can be affected by thickness of the bilayer <sup><xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, membrane asymmetry <sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, and lipid composition <sup><xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. C5b6 is a soluble complex that ionically associates with membranes <sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Upon C7-binding, the complex becomes lipophilic and is irreversibly tethered <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Although this study and previous work are consistent with an interaction of C7 with lipids <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, the ability of C5b6 to alter the biophysical properties of the membrane was unanticipated. C5b6 reduced the bending modulus of GUVs without affecting tension (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 6). The reduction in bending modulus was maintained upon C7 binding and anchoring of the C5b7 complex to the GUV. As C8 incorporates into the MAC to form C5b8, bending modulus increases (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). By comparison, tension remains largely unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Taken together, MAC specifically impacts the energy required to bend the membrane in a way that changes during the sequential assembly pathway.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have presented here cryoEM structures of two MAC conformations and derived an atomic model for the transmembrane complex. Furthermore, we have shown corroborating flicker spectroscopy data that explain how MAC assembly precursors alter physical properties of the membrane to prime the bilayer for attack. Our results provide a structural framework on which to interpret earlier biological data and inform future mechanistic models. Our structure has revealed a number of features that increase our understanding of the complement system, and informs a general mechanism for how &#x03B2;-barrel pore forming proteins rupture lipid bilayers.</p>
<p>Previous high resolution structures of &#x03B2;-pore forming proteins were based on the assumption that the oligomeric assemblies are both rigid and symmetric <sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, however we discovered that these proteins can be flexible within the membrane. Here we demonstrate that complement proteins within the C5b8 &#x2018;paddle&#x2019; rotate with respect to the nascent C9 oligomer, which in itself varies in curvature between the two observed MAC conformations (Supplementary Movie 1). A glycan scaffold that lines the inner wall of the giant &#x03B2;-barrel constrains the range of movement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Together with C8&#x03B3;, wedged between C5b8 and C9, this scaffold provides a structural support that maintains the curvature of an otherwise unsupported tall and flexible giant &#x03B2;-barrel pore. We propose that movement of pore &#x03B2;-hairpins within the bilayer could provide an additional level of membrane destabilization that contributes to lytic activity of &#x03B2;-pore forming proteins. Bacterial membranes are complex targets, densely packed with both polysaccharides and porins <sup><xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Flexibility of a growing MAC pore would allow short stretches of &#x03B2;-hairpins to move within the plane of the bilayer to accommodate the compositional complexity of its membrane environment.</p>
<p>One of the most striking observations from our structure is that the MAC pore is comprised of &#x03B2;-hairpins that differ in both length and charge properties. These differences provide the structural basis for how complement proteins interact with target cells. Partially inserted &#x03B2;-hairpins of C6 and C7 interact with lipid headgroups of the outer leaflet and decrease the bending modulus of the membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Subsequently, the increase in membrane stiffness we observe upon C8 addition could be attributed in part to the mechanical strain of distorting the bilayer. Membrane interacting &#x03B2;-hairpins of C6, C7 and neighboring C8&#x03B2; differ in length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) and likely bend the bilayer to form the non-lamellar edge of an arc-pore. Levels of MAC on the plasma membranes of self-cells are restricted by endocytic pathways mediated by changes in the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer <sup><xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. This mechanism plays an important role in cell activation pathways <sup><xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, but also in the immune response to cancer <sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. In our model, we propose that differences in charge and length of the pore &#x03B2;-hairpins impact physical properties of the lipid environment that could stimulate activity of mechanosensors, such as caveolin-1 to facilitate MAC removal and recovery from MAC attack. Similarly, membrane repair mechanisms triggered in response to bacterial pore forming toxins may rely on changes in mechanochemical properties of the plasma membrane caused by oligomerized prepores <sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Although pore forming hairpins of these bacterial homologues extend throughout the bilayer, we speculate that an auxiliary domain&#x2019;s cholesterol recognition loops that interact with the outer leaflet may serve a similar role as the partially-inserted MAC precursor.</p>
<p>Whereas this study focuses on how MAC interacts with the membrane, C8 and C9 also bind CD59 to block complement-mediated lysis. It will be interesting to understand the interplay between MAC components and its inhibitor within the context of the membrane. In addition to complement proteins, CD59 also acts as a co-receptor for the cholesterol-dependent &#x03B2;-pore forming toxin Intermedilysin <sup><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. CD59 binds a &#x03B2;-hairpin of the toxin&#x2019;s auxiliary domain that contains the partially-inserted cholesterol recognition loops <sup><xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, we have found that residues of MAC components that interact with CD59 <sup><xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> lie within leading &#x03B2;-hairpins of C8&#x03B1; and C9, each stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). As changes in membrane fluctuations impact diffusion of GPI-anchored proteins <sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, we speculate that CD59 may respond to changes in physical properties of the membrane and capture the newly formed &#x03B2;-hairpins of complement proteins during their helix-to-hairpin transition.</p>
<p>Our structural and biophysical data inform a general mechanism for &#x03B2;-pore forming proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Large-scale rotations of regulatory domains accompany the aqueous-to-transmembrane transition of soluble monomers. We propose that partially inserted proteins initiate interaction with the outer leaflet and prime the membrane for attack by lowering the energy for bending the lipid bilayer, a mechanism exploited by malarial parasites during cell invasion <sup><xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and by the insertion and folding of &#x03B2;-barrel proteins <sup><xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Subsequent protein conformational re-arrangements distort the lamellar structure of the bilayer, causing it to stiffen and ultimately rupture. Changes in mechanical properties of the lipid environment could explain the nuanced cellular response to membrane damage by both MAC and bacterial pore forming toxins.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we show that the MAC is a flexible immune pore that interacts with the lipid bilayer in two distinct ways. These interactions govern how MAC initiates membrane-binding and ultimate rupture. Our observations provide a general mechanism for pore formation and explain how MAC function can be tuned to different targets and cellular contexts.</p>

<p>Electron micrograph movie frames were aligned by MotionCor2 <sup><xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>, discarding the first and last frames. CTF parameters were estimated using CTFFIND4 <sup><xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Any movies containing low figure of merit scores, substantial drift, low contrast, thick ice, or crystalline ice were discarded from further analysis. Particles were manually selected and extracted from high-quality aligned movies using RELION<sup><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. Particles were subjected to iterative rounds of 2D classification to improve the homogeneity of the dataset. The published MAC reconstruction was strongly low-pass filtered (60 &#x00C5;) to prevent model bias and used as a starting model for a gold-standard 3D autorefinement of images. 231,767 selected particles contributed to a consensus MAC structure whose resolution was determined at 4.9 &#x00C5;. These orientations served as the starting point for tracking beam-induced movement of individual particles, which was corrected using particle polishing within RELION.</p>
<p>3D classification of images revealed conformational heterogeneity of the MAC (Supplementary Fig. 1). Particles containing an intact closed &#x03B2;-barrel (23&#x0025;) were grouped and subjected to an additional round of 3D autorefinement (5.6 &#x00C5; resolution). Those that were stoichiometrically identical to the closed conformation but had an open &#x03B2;-barrel (35&#x0025;) were grouped separately and independently refined (5.6 &#x00C5; resolution). It was not possible to improve the maps as a whole for the two conformations because of a continuous relative rotation between the asymmetric region (C5b6, C7, C8 and neighboring C9) and the C9 oligomer. We therefore solved the structures of the asymmetric region (4.7 &#x00C5; and 5.9 &#x00C5;, open and closed respectively), hinge of the open conformation (4.9 &#x00C5;), and C9 oligomer of the open conformation (4.4 &#x00C5;) separately. The global open and closed maps were used as a reference to assemble the parts together. To improve the alignment of the asymmetric and hinge regions, density corresponding to the C9 oligomer was subtracted from the original images. Orientation parameters for the asymmetric and hinge regions were refined from density-subtracted images by applying a mask based on its position in maps generated from the original images. Masks were optimized to include regions of the structure that moved together and were included in subsequent rounds of 3D autorefinement. A similar procedure was adopted to focus the refinement on the C9 oligomer. A final resolution of 4.4 &#x00C5; was achieved for the C9 oligomer within the open conformation by averaging density for 8 neighboring copies in Chimera <sup><xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. Resolution of all maps was determined using the masking-effect corrected Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) as implemented in RELION post-processing.</p>

<p>Crystal structures for soluble C5b6 <sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and C8 <sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, together with homology models for C7 and C9 were used as initial models for refinement into local resolution filtered maps. Due to differences in map quality between the two conformations, the asymmetric and hinge regions of the open state were used for refinement of C5b6, C7, and C8. C9 was refined into the locally averaged C9 oligomer of the open conformation, and placed as a single rigid body in the remaining 17 copies within the map. TMH regions of C6 and C8 were removed from the soluble structures prior to fitting, as these are known to undergo a structural transition to form &#x03B2;-hairpins. Domains of C5b (C345C and MG8), C6 (FIM1 and FIM2), and C7 (FIM1 and FIM2) for which there was weak or no density were also removed from the model. Truncated crystal structures for C5b6 and C8&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x03B3; were initially placed manually in to the map using Chimera followed by rigid body fitting using the &#x2018;Fit in Map&#x2019; tool. These atomic models were split into domains, which were real-space refined as rigid bodies in Coot <sup><xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. Domains that comprised the primary interaction interface between C5b and C6 were grouped as a single body (C6: CCP1, CCP2, TSP3, and C5b: TED) in the first instance. C5b MG domains were also grouped in the early stages of refinement. As there are no crystal structures available for C7 or C9, homology models were generated using MODELLER <sup><xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. C8&#x03B2; was chosen as template for C9 (26.76&#x0025; sequence identity), while the C7 model was based on the crystal structure of soluble C6 (31.87&#x0025; sequence identity) together with coordinates for the C7 Factor I-like domains (PDB:2WCY) <sup><xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. CH3 helices of MAC proteins were remodeled with MODELLER and the 15 C-terminal residues of C9 were manually built in Coot. For C9, the LDL, EGF and TSP domains were flexibly fitted in a stepwise, iterative process whereby large-scale movements were refined first using iMODFIT <sup><xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> followed by further local real-space refinement using Flex-EM <sup><xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. Here, segments of the structure were restrained based either on user-defined rigid bodies or those defined by RIBFIND <sup><xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>. The fitting progress was analyzed by local scoring using the Segment Based Manders&#x2019; Overlap Coefficient (SMOC) <sup><xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>, as implemented in the TEMPy software <sup><xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. Refinement was carried out iteratively until the CCC between the map and model stabilized. Once each component was fitted, interfaces were assessed for clashes with Chimera followed by further refinement of the sub-complexes, as necessary. Loops connecting domains were refined in Coot or removed if density was not apparent. Models were further optimized using PHENIX real-space refinement <sup><xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> with secondary structure element and disulfide bond restraints. Where crystal structures were available, reference-based restraints were also imposed. The MAC pore &#x03B2;-hairpins were extended with idealized &#x03B2;-strands, in which main-chain geometry was generated using an in-house program to set amino acid (phi, psi) angles to (&#x2212;140, 135). A full atomic model was then generated by adding side-chains to backbone atoms using the SCWRL4 program <sup><xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> Modeled strands were least squares-fitted onto existing &#x03B2;-strands of core MACPF domains and manually adjusted to minimize clashes using Coot. Overlapping residues were removed. Models were merged and linking residues were real-space refined in Coot. Known glycosylation sites were added to the extended model in Coot, with placement guided both by residue position and visible density. The final models were subjected to a final refinement using global minimization in PHENIX with secondary structure and di-sulfide bond restraints. The quality of the final fits between maps and models per residue was assessed using TEMPy SMOC score (Supplementary Fig. 2c).

<p>GUVs were imaged in CoverWell perfusion chambers (Grace Bio-Labs) attached to BSA-coated glass slides, allowing the sequential injection of MAC components while continuously tracking individual GUVs. Fluctuation videos were recorded on an Eclipse TE2000-E microscope (Nikon Instruments) at 30x or 60x magnification using a Zyla sCMOS camera (Andor) at a frame rate of approximately 30 frames per second and an exposure of 0.5 ms. MAC formation was achieved through sequential addition of C5b6, C7, C8 and C9 in 1:1:1:21 molar ratios allowing for a 5 minute incubation between each addition. 30 sec fluctuation videos were recorded prior to C5b6 addition and following the addition and incubation of each component. Loss of GUV contrast was used as an indicator of full MAC deposition and lysis of the GUV, and was observed 8-12 min post C9 addition. Only GUVs that lysed post-C9 addition were used for analysis (&#x003E; 95&#x0025; of GUVs). In control experiments, C5b6 was replaced by protein buffer (120 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4); the rest of the protocol was identical.</p>
<p>Analysis of bending modulus and tension variations was performed as described previously using a custom-built LabView program (National Instruments) <sup><xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>. Briefly, GUV contour coordinates were extracted with subpixel resolution from each video frame and Fourier transformed to extract fluctuation modes. The fluctuation mode amplitudes were averaged across all frames in a particular video to give mean square amplitudes at the GUV equator (h<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>(q<sub>x,</sub>y = 0)). These were plotted as a function of the mode wavenumber (q<sub>x</sub>) and the following model was fitted to the data to extract bending modulus (&#x25FB;) and tension (&#x25FB;) values:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="392563_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where k<sub>B</sub> is the Boltzmann constant, T temperature, and L the mean GUV contour circumference. Fluctuation data were fitted from mode 4 to mode 20 (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Failure of fits were mostly a result of contrast loss due to GUV lysis after C9 addition, bending modulus variations were hence never extracted for this step. In some cases, fitting was not possible at earlier steps of MAC formation as a result of poor contour extraction, due to image interference caused by neighboring GUVs or significant deformation of the GUV leading to unreliable contour tracking. For these GUVs, bending and tension were not extracted at the step of fit failure but were analyzed at previous steps and integrated into the data set. In addition, changes in the extent of fluctuation in each GUV were quantified following the addition of each MAC component by calculating the contour RMSD (averaged over all frames for each video).</p>
<p>For all flicker spectroscopy experiments, 18 individual GUVs were tracked through MAC formation over three independent experiments. Control experiments were performed on the same day and same batch of GUVs. All statistics were computed using Prism (GraphPad Software), figure plots were generated using DataGraph (Visual Data Tools).</p>
