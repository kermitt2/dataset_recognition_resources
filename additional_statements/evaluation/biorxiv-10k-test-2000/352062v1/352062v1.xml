<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Using an inducible, inflammatory model of breast cellular transformation, we describe the transcriptional regulatory network mediated by STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B, and AP-1 factors on a genomic scale. These regulators form transcriptional complexes that directly regulate the expression of hundreds of genes in oncogenic pathways via a positive feedback loop. This inflammatory feedback loop, which functions to various extents in many types of cancer cells and patient tumors, is the basis for an &#x201C;inflammation&#x201D; index that defines cancer types by functional criteria. We identify a network of non-inflammatory genes whose expression is well correlated with the cancer inflammatory index. Conversely, the inflammation index is negatively correlated with expression of genes involved in DNA metabolism, and transformation is associated with genome instability. Inflammatory tumors are preferentially associated with infiltrating immune cells that might be recruited to the site of the tumor via inflammatory molecules produced by the cancer cells.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Tumor-promoting inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and plays important regulatory roles during cell transformation, invasion, metastasis and treatment resistance (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Coussens and Werb, 2002</xref>; Mantovani et al., 2008; <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Grivennikov et al., 2010</xref>). An inflammatory reaction during tumor development occurs in near all solid malignancies (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">de Martel and Franceschi, 2009</xref>). Pre-existing inflammation promotes subsequent cancer development, accounting for 15&#x0025;&#x007E;20&#x0025; of cancer deaths (Mantovani et al., 2008). Tumor-promoting inflammation also plays critical roles in immunosuppression (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Grivennikov et al., 2010</xref>). For example, STAT3 promotes the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in cancer cells, suppressing immune cell activity (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Han, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Tumor-associated inflammation results from both an intrinsic pathway, in which mutations in cancer cells activate inflammatory gene expression, and an extrinsic pathway, in which cytokines and chemokines secreted by tumor-associated immune cells create inflammatory microenvironments (Mantovani et al., 2008). Oncogenes can trigger a gene expression cascade, resulting in activation or overexpression of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-&#x03BA;B, STAT3 and AP-1, with the resulting production of cytokines and chemokines (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Coussens and Werb, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Grivennikov et al., 2010</xref>). For example, NF-&#x03BA;B signaling pathway is activated upon activation of oncogenes RAS and MYC, through activation of IL-1&#x03B2; (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Shchors et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Guerra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>), and the proto-oncoprotein Src kinase can directly phosphorylate and activate STAT3 (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Turkson et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In previous work, we have described an inducible model of cellular transformation in which transient activation of v-Src oncoprotein converts a non-transformed breast epithelial cell line into a stably transformed state within 24 hours (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Hirsch et al., 2010</xref>). The stably transformed cells form foci and colonies in soft agar, show increased motility and invasion, form mammospheres, and confer tumor formation in mouse xenografts (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Hirsch et al., 2010</xref>). This epigenetic switch between stable non-transformed and transformed states is mediated by an inflammatory positive feedback loop involving NF-&#x03BA;B and STAT3 (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). By integrating motif analysis of DNase hypersensitive regions with transcriptional profiling, we found that &#x003E; 40 transcription factors are important for transformation and identified putative target sites directly bound by these factors (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>A few transcriptional regulatory circuits involved in this transformation model have been identified, and these are important in some other cancer cell types and human cancers (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Polytarchou et al., 2012</xref>). During transformation, STAT3 acts through pre-existing nucleosome-depleted regions bound by FOS, and expression of several AP-1 factors is altered in a STAT3-dependent manner (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). However, the connection between STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B, and AP-1 factors as well as the underlying transcriptional regulatory circuits has not been described on the whole-genome level.</p>
<p>Here, we define the transcriptional network mediated by the combined action of NF-&#x03BA;B, STAT3 and AP-1 factors (JUN, JUNB and FOS) on a genomic scale in this breast transformation model. In contrast to previous studies (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2018</xref>), this network is defined by genes that are induced during transformation by the binding of NF-&#x03BA;B, STAT3 and AP-1 factors to common target sites either through their cognate motifs or via protein-protein interactions. Based on this common NF-&#x03BA;B, STAT3 and AP-1 network, we develop a &#x201C;cancer inflammation index&#x201D; to define cancer types, both in cell lines and in patients, by functional criteria. As this inflammation index is based on the common regulatory network, it is distinct from and more specific than indices based simply on gene expression profiles that arise from multiple regulatory inputs. In addition, we identify many non-inflammatory genes whose expression is positively or negatively correlated with the cancer inflammation index, leading to the observation the inflammation is linked functionally to other aspects of cancer as well as genomic instability. Lastly, we show that inflammatory tumor samples preferentially contain contaminating immune and stromal cells from the tumor microenvironment, consistent with the idea that immune cells might be recruited to the site of the tumor via inflammatory molecules produced by the cancer cells.</p>

<sec id="s2a"><title>Co-localization of STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B and AP-1 factors on target sites <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>During transformation, NF-&#x03BA;B, STAT3, and AP-1 (JUN, JUNB and FOS) levels increase in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A</xref>). In accord with previous results using chemical inhibitors and siRNA knockdowns (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>), CRISPR-cas9-mediated knockouts of these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1B</xref>) cause decreased transformation as assayed by growth under conditions of low attachment (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Rotem et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1C</xref>). Our previous ChIP-seq analysis mapped protein-binding sites to nucleosome-depleted regions before and after (24 hours tamoxifen treatment) transformation (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>), but did not provide more detailed localization.</p>
<p>The ChIP-seq data reveals many target sites bound by STAT3 (89,764 sites), NF-&#x03BA;B (56,539 sites) and AP-1 factors (95,958 sites for JUNB, 152,443 sites for FOS and 118,245 sites for JUN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref>, S1D and S2A). Less than 17&#x0025; of factor binding sites are located in promoter regions, and the majority of sites are located in other regulatory regions, including &#x007E;30&#x0025; that are in active enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2A</xref>). As expected from the heteromeric nature of AP-1 factors, binding levels of JUN, JUNB and FOS are well correlated with each other (Pearson correlation coefficiencies &#x003E;&#x003D; 0.83), which are nearly comparable to biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2B</xref>). Based on this, we next grouped the AP-1 factors together to learn their binding features on the chromatin. Also as expected, STAT3 binding sites strongly overlap with FOS binding sites (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>) and with the other AP-1 factors (89&#x0025; of STAT3 binding sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>). In addition, 89&#x0025; of NF-&#x03BA;B binding sites overlap with AP-1 factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>). 38&#x0025; of STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B, and AP-1 sites are located in the same czs-regulatory regions (CRRs), which is far more frequent than expected by chance (<italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 10<sup>&#x2212;200</sup>; Chi-squared Test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>). Despite the strong co-localization, STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B and AP-1 factors can independently bind to specific sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>), and the pairwise correlation values are lower than the correlation values between biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Additional results suggest that STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B and AP-1 factors co-bind to target sites as a multiprotein complex. First, the median distance of peak summits for all pairwise combinations of AP-1 factors, STAT3, and NF-&#x03BA;B ranges between 15-30 bp, and these values are comparable to those obtained for biological replicates of the relevant individual factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Second, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B and AP-1 factors interact with each other in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b"><title>Sequence motifs associated with binding of STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;b and AP-1 factors</title>
<p>To address which factors are primarily responsible for binding site specificity, we performed motif analysis on 50 bp sequences around peak summits. As expected, 60&#x0025; of AP-1 factor binding peaks contain an AP-1 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3C</xref>). Interestingly, 38&#x0025; of STAT3 binding sites and 30&#x0025; of NFKB1 sites also have an AP-1 motif, while 24&#x0025; of STAT3 sites have a STAT motif and 16&#x0025; NFKB1 sites have a NF-&#x03BA;B motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3C</xref>). Furthermore, the AP-1 motif is well located in STAT3 and NFKB1 peak summits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We did not find significant co-localization of AP-1, STAT and NF-&#x03BA;B motifs in the same CRRs. These results indicate that a significant fraction of STAT3 and NF-&#x03BA;B binding is mediated through the interaction with AP-1 factors. In contrast, only a small minority of AP-1 binding sites contain a STAT or NF-&#x03BA;B motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and S3C), and STAT and NF-&#x03BA;B motifs show modest enrichment around AP-1 peak summits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, binding of AP-1 factors occurs predominantly via interactions with AP-1 motifs, presumably reflect a direct protein-DNA interaction. In contrast, in addition to directly binding via their motifs, STAT3 and NF-&#x03BA;B can also bind to AP-1 motifs, presumably via protein-protein interactions with AP-1 factors. However, we did not observed significant motif differences in AP-1 sites bound by AP-1 factors alone or those co-bound with STAT3 and/or NF-&#x03BA;B.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c"><title>STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;b and AP-1 factors co-regulate key genes in various oncogenic pathways</title>
<p>Co-binding of STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B and AP-1 factors regulates gene expression and chromatin status. Genes up-regulated during transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) tend to have increased binding of STAT3, NFKB1, JUN, JUNB and FOS at promoters/enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, D</xref>). Furthermore, isogenic cell lines lacking individual factors can block the up-regulation of a subset of genes during transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), with the STAT3 knockout showing the most drastic effects. As there are multiple members of the NF-&#x03BA;B and AP-1 families, it is likely that the weaker effect on transcription are due to redundancy among family members. With respect to chromatin structure, regions bound by increasing numbers of these factors tend to have higher accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4A</xref>) and acetylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4B</xref>). In addition, differential binding levels of STAT3, NFKB1 and AP-1 factors during transformation are positively correlated with dynamic chromatin accessibility (Pearson Correlation Coefficient &#x003E;&#x003D; 0.44) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4C</xref>), and open chromatin regions bound by more factors tend to show increased accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4D</xref>).</p>

<p>We identified 1,461 genes that are common targets of STAT3, NFKB1, JUN, JUNB and FOS and that show increased binding of at least four factors (&#x003E;1.5 fold) during transformation and downregulation upon at least four factor knockouts (Table S1). These genes are enriched (Benjamini&#x2013;Hochberg FDR &#x003C; 0.005) in cancer-related processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure S5</xref>), and they include genes involved in cell signaling cascades (e.g. RAB13, IF116, ZAK), inflammatory response (e.g. IL1B, IL1R1, SERPINA1), cell proliferation (e.g. CSF3, E2F7, E2F8) regulation of apoptosis (e.g. PIM1, CARD6, BCL2L1), angiogenesis (e.g. RHOB, CEGFC, EPAS1), and cell migration/metastases (e.g. LAMB3, CXCL3 and PLAU)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). Cancer stem cells are generated during the transformation process in our model (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2011a</xref>), and STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B and AP-1 factors activate key genes (e.g. CD44, CXCR1 and ITGA7) mediating cancer stem cell formation. Cancer metabolism is a key component of oncogenesis (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Pavlova and Thompson, 2016</xref>), and important metabolic enzyme genes (e.g. HK2 and NAMPT), are also regulated by these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). Thus, STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B, and AP-1 are the major factors involved in tumor-promoting inflammation, and they bind to and promote the expression of key genes in various oncogenic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d"><title>The positive feedback inflammatory loop that promotes transformation is extensive</title>
<p>In previous work, we described a few specific regulatory circuits that constitute an inflammatory positive feedback loop required for transformation in this experimental model (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that this positive feedback loop is far more extensive. In particular, during transformation, STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B (NFKB1 and NFKB2) and AP-1 factors (JUN, JUNB, FOS, FOSL1, FOSL2, and ATF3) are transcriptionally up-regulated as are many upstream regulators in the IL6/STAT3, IL1/NF-&#x03BA;B and TNF/AP-1 signaling pathways, including IL1 (IL1A and IL1B) and IL1 receptors (IL1R1, IL1R2, IL1RAP, and IL1RL1), IL6 (IL6 and LIF) and IL6 receptor, TNF and TNF receptors (TNFRSF10D, TNFRSF11B, and TNFRSF21), JAK2 and MAP kinases (MAP3K8 and MAP4K4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These genes are all common targets of STAT3, NFKB1, and AP-1 factors, with increased factor binding in promoters/enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, the essence of the loop is that STAT3, NFKB1, and AP-1 directly activate upstream regulators that trigger the activation of intra-cellular signaling cascades, phosphorylate the transcription factors, and promote their nuclear localization and transcriptional activation. In accord with previous studies on IL6 (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>), reducing the activation levels of JAK2, JNK, and IL1 receptor via inhibitors or antagonists results in decreased transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure S6</xref>). We define the 27 genes in the IL6/STAT3, IL1/NF-&#x03BA;B and TNF/AP-1 signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) as the core positive feedback loop that maintains the transformed state.</p>

<p>To measure the inflammation level for each cancer cell line, we developed a scoring system called the &#x201C;inflammation index&#x201D;, which is calculated as the expression values of 27 genes (normalized to the median expression levels in the 1,036 cell lines) in the positive feedback loop. Importantly, this index is not simply based on a subset of genes that are induced during transformation, but rather genes that are direct targets of the STAT3/NF-&#x03BA;B/AP-1 regulatory network. The inflammatory levels gradually increase during ER-Src transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and they are highly variable (&#x003E;5 fold) among different cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, in a fibroblast cell transformation model involving stepwise addition of the SV40 and RAS oncogenes to immortalized fibroblast, the inflammatory levels increase upon transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>On average, head and neck as well as pancreatic cancer cell lines are most inflammatory, while the autonomic ganglia and blood cancer cell lines are least inflammatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, cancer cell lines from the same developmental lineage can show high variance in inflammatory levels, which is correlated with their genetic subtypes. For example, cell lines from non-small cell lung cancers are more inflammatory than those of small cell lung cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), and triple negative breast cancer cell lines with p53 mutations are more inflammatory than other subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2f"><title>The inflammatory loop is active in tumors from cancer patients</title>
<p>Although cancer cell lines are derived from tumors, long-term propagation of cell lines under artificial conditions raises the possibility that cell line data might be misleading with respect to cancer. We addressed the relevance of the inflammatory loop in human tumors using RNA-seq data in the Cancer Genome Atlas database (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Cancer Genome Atlas Research et al., 2013</xref>). In accord with the results in cancer cell lines, genes in the IL6/STAT3, IL1/NF-&#x03BA;B and JNK/AP-1 inflammatory loop are co-expressed in human breast tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similarly, triple negative breast tumors are more inflammatory than other types of breast tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, the median inflammatory index value of all tumor samples from a given developmental lineage is highly correlated with that of cells lines from the same developmental lineage (Pearson correlation coefficient &#x003D; 0.82; <italic>P</italic>-value &#x003C; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As we combined all tumors for a given lineage, it seems unlikely that this analysis is significantly compounded by differences in the tumor microenvironment. These observations indicate that, with respect to inflammation and gene regulation profiles, cancer cell lines are good models for tumors, and the inflammatory loop is very relevant for many types of human cancer.</p>

<sec id="s2g"><title>Identification of other genes whose expression is correlated to the inflammation index</title>
<p>Previous analyses of the ER-Src model designed to identify oncogenically relevant genes have relied on differential gene expression upon transformation and/or direct regulation by NF-&#x03BA;B, STAT3, and AP-1 factors. However, it is highly likely that this approach will miss critical genes that are part of the tumor-promoting inflammation process. As an alternative approach, for every gene, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient between its expression level and the inflammation index across cancer cell lines for various developmental lineages. The correlation values are significantly conserved among developmentally distinct cancers, again indicating a widespread role of the inflammatory loop and it target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>Genes showing higher positive correlation with the inflammation index are more likely to be direct transcriptional targets of STAT3/NF-&#x03BA;B/AP1 and tend to be upregulated during transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, 6C</xref> and 6D). We identified 1,303 genes showing significant positive correlation of expression with the inflammation index (median Spearman&#x2019;s Rank Correlation Coefficient across cancer cell types &#x003E; 0.18, false discovery rate &#x003C; 0.005)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Aside from genes involved in the inflammatory response, these genes are enriched in biological pathways such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, intracellular signaling cascade and cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These pathways, which are defined by the inflammatory index and not transformation <italic>per se</italic>, are in excellent accord with the pathways accord with pathways activated during ER-Src transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), thereby providing independent evidence that the inflammatory loop and oncogenic pathways uncovered in the ER-Src cell transformation model are highly relevant for different types of human cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h"><title>A correlation between inflammation and genome instability in cancer cell lines</title>
<p>1,369 genes show negative correlation between expression levels and inflammation index, and these are enriched in pathways including DNA metabolic process, DNA replication, DNA repair and cell cycle (Benjamin FDR &#x003C; 10<sup>&#x2212;13</sup>). This observation suggests that oncogenic-associated inflammation is inversely related to genome stability, and indeed the genes showing most negative correlation (e.g. MSH2, FANCF, BRCA1) are regulators of genome instability. Interestingly, the genes related to genome instability are not transcriptionally regulated during ER-Src cell transformation.</p>
<p>To examine the link between inflammation and genome instability, we performed micronucleus staining of cells during ER-Src transformation. Indeed, more cells contain micronuclei as transformation processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G</xref>), with 2.2&#x0025; cells containing micronuclei after 72 hr after induction of transformation as compared to virtually no cells before transformation. Thus, the inflammation-mediated process of transformation is associated with decreased genome stability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i"><title>Inflammatory tumor samples contain increased levels of non-cancer cells</title>
<p>As shown above, the inflammation indices of cancer cell lines for a particular cancer type are highly correlated with the corresponding tumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, unlike samples from cancer cell lines, tumor samples not only contain the cancer cells, but also immune and stromal cells from the tumor microenvironment. Such tumor impurity complicates the analysis of gene expression profiles of tumor cells, particularly as immune cells are also inflammatory. We therefore took several approaches to disentangle the inflammatory nature of cancer cells from other cells in a tumor.</p>
<p>First, for numerous tumor samples we analyzed the relationship between the inflammatory index and tumor purity (fraction of cancer cells in a sample), which has been estimated from cancer-specific genetic mutations or cell type-specific gene signatures (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aran et al., 2015</xref>). In general, the inflammation level increases as the tumor purity decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A</xref> and S7A-D). However, triple negative breast tumors have higher inflammatory levels than those of other genetic subtypes, even though all of these forms of breast cancer have similar purity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7E</xref>). The higher inflammatory level of triple negative breast tumors is consistent with the results in the corresponding cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that it reflects the intrinsic properties of the cancer cells and not the degree of tumor purity.</p>

<p>(E)Correlation between tumor purity and cancer progression index.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="352062_fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>As an alternative approach, we selected breast patient samples with similar levels of tumor purity but different levels of inflammation (divided into 4 bins) and analyzed expression of non-inflammatory genes whose expression is strongly correlated with the inflammatory index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Expression of these transformation-related, but noninflammatory genes, which are direct targets of STAT3/NF-&#x03BA;B/AP1 and are involved in angiogenesis, apoptosis and cell migration, increases as the inflammation index increases. Similar results are observed in all other types of cancer we examined such as melanoma, lung, head and neck, and glioblastomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7C</xref> and S8). These results indicate that the inflammatory loop and associated network are active in various types of cancers, although we can&#x2019;t exclude the formal possibility that non-malignant cells in the various samples might be in different states.</p>
<p>Lastly, we created a &#x201C;progression index&#x201D; that is strongly correlated with the inflammatory index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), but is based on 98 genes that regulate &#x201C;migration/metastasis&#x201D;, &#x201C;apoptosis&#x201D; and &#x201C;angiogenesis&#x201D;, but are not currently annotated as inflammatory or part of the immune response. This progression index, should reflect the regulatory circuits involved in cellular transformation and tumor formation, but not normal immune cells. Indeed, across the large set of tumor samples, the score of non-inflammatory index inversely correlated with tumor purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). All of these observations indicate that tumors containing inflammatory cancer cells preferentially contain non-cancer cells. Thus, tumor-associated inflammation level is positively correlated with the complexity of microenvironment and the presence of immune cells.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="s3a"><title>NF-&#x03BA;B, STAT3, and AP-1 factors are the core of the positive feedback loop controlling tumor-promoting inflammation</title>
<p>In the ER-Src cellular transformation model, a transient inflammatory stimulus mediates an epigenetic switch from a stable non-transformed cell to a stable transformed cell (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). Epigenetic switches are the basis of multicellular development, and they occur by activating a positive feedback loop that maintains the altered state. In the ER-Src model, Src activates the inflammatory transcription factors STAT3 and NF-&#x03BA;B that form the basis of the inflammatory feedback loop that is required for maintenance of the transformed state (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Iliopoulos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we show that AP-1 factors play a critical role in the inflammatory feedback loop. AP-1 factors are not only important for transformation, but they form complexes with STAT3 and/or NF-&#x03BA;B that bind target sites. Specifically, these factors co-immunoprecipitate, and their binding profiles are coincident at many target sites. Most, and perhaps all, of the sites where co-binding occurs contain AP-1 motifs, suggesting that the AP-1 factors directly interact with DNA, whereas STAT3 and NF-&#x03BA;B are often recruited via interactions with the AP-1 factors. At some sites, STAT3 and NF-&#x03BA;B bind via their own motifs in the absence of AP-1 factors. At present, it is unclear whether AP-1, NF-&#x03BA;B, and STAT3 can form a ternary complex at individual sites or if NF-&#x03BA;B and STAT3 form independent complexes with AP-1 factors at these sites.</p>
<p>In addition to their roles in inflammation <italic>per se</italic>, STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B and AP-1 work together to regulate key genes in oncogenic pathways such as angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Expression of many genes in these pathways is induced upon transformation in a manner that is linked to increased binding of all these factors. Moreover, expression of many common genes is reduced upon knockouts of individual factors, indicating that all of these factors contribute to expression of these genes. Our identification of a common STAT3/NF-&#x03BA;B/AP-1 network is distinct from, but not inconsistent with, previous observations that STAT3 and NF-&#x03BA;B have different (i.e. non-overlapping) binding sites and gene expression effects during the transformation process (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The positive feedback loop elucidated here is considerably more complex than previously described, and it is maintained in two distinct ways. The key transcription factors directly bind and activate the expression of each other, thereby reinforcing the core transcriptional state. This mutual co-regulation of key transcription factors is similar to what occurs in muscle development (MyoD and related factors), embryonic stem cells (Nanog, Oct4), and presumably all epigenetic states. In addition, these transcription factors directly regulate nearly all upstream components in the IL6/STAT3, IL1/NF-&#x03BA;B and TNF/AP-1 signaling pathways, thereby maintaining the activity of the individual factors and hence the gene regulatory pattern. Thus, this extensive positive feedback loop represents a coherent regulatory system in which numerous interconnected components stably maintain a common, yet complex, transcriptional program</p>

<sec id="s3b"><title>The inflammatory gene signature as an approach to type human cancers</title>
<p>Historically, cancer types were classified by their developmental origin as well as by crude cellular phenotypes. More recently, cancers have been classified by the genetic mutations that drive the oncogenic state. Such classification, together with drugs targeted to specific mutations, has been the primary basis for the idea of personalized medicine approaches to cancer treatment. Here, we develop a functional approach to classify human cancers that utilizes gene expression signatures, specifically an inflammation index based on the STAT3/NF-&#x03BA;B/AP-1 network. Importantly, this index is based on an integrated regulatory network and hence is significantly different from indices based solely on transcriptional profiles that arise from multiple regulatory inputs.</p>
<p>Overall, expression levels of the 27 key genes in the IL6/STAT3, IL1/NF-&#x03BA;B and TNF/AP-1 transcription loop that make up the inflammation index are strongly correlated with each other. Not only does this observation provide further support for the coherence of the feedback loop, but it strongly suggests that the loop and associated network functions to various degrees in different cancer cell lines and tumors. Transformed cell lines have a higher inflammation index than observed with non-transformed cells, suggesting a general role of inflammation in cancer. However, there is a wide range of inflammation scores among various cancers that occurs in developmentally unrelated cancers and is not strictly linked to specific mutations. Importantly, the inflammation indices of cell lines and tumors are strongly related, indicating its relevance for human disease. We predict the existence of drugs whose efficacy correlates with the inflammation index (and by extension other gene expression indices). If so, the inflammation index of the tumor cells might be useful for choosing drugs for personalized cancer treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c"><title>Inflammatory cancers may recruit immune cells to the tumor site</title>
<p>Patient tumor samples contain cancer cells and immune (and other non-cancer) cells, all of which contribute to the transcriptional profile. Interestingly, over a large number of tumor samples, there is an inverse relationship between the inflammatory index and the estimated degree of sample purity. In principle, this relationship could merely reflect the fact that immune cells also express many inflammatory genes, which could significantly contribute to the observed inflammation index of the sample.</p>
<p>We attempted to distinguish the contributions of cancer and immune cells to the transcriptional profile by analyzing many non-inflammatory genes (either in specific pathways or as an overall index) whose expression is very strongly correlated with the inflammatory index and hence to the STAT3, NF-&#x03BA;B, AP-1 regulatory network. These observations suggest a dynamic interplay between cancer cells and immune cells that is linked to the inflammation index of the cancer cells in the sample. We propose that cytokines and chemokines secreted by the cancer cells attract immune cells to their vicinity of the tumor, thereby resulting in a less pure tumor sample. In addition, these cytokines and chemokines secreted by the cancer cells also help activate the inflammatory gene expression program in immune cells. Thus, we propose that the mutual and perhaps synergistic functional interactions between cancer cells and immune cells can create an inflammatory microenvironment in a manner that depends on the inflammatory properties of the cancer cells.</p>

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and 4E, we downloaded microarray data to from GSE17941 to examine gene expression dynamics during MCF10-ER-Src and fibroblast cell transformation (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Hirsch et al., 2010</xref>). The gene expression values were calculated by the RMA approach using Affymetrix Expression Console Software.</p>

<sec id="s4h"><title>CCLE and TCGA data analyses</title>
<p>The gene expression, genetic and lineage annotations of 1,036 cancer cell lines were downloaded from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>). The level 3 data showing clinical annotations and RNA expression of cancer patients were downloaded from TCGA database. The tumor purity estimations were obtained from (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aran et al., 2015</xref>), which estimated tumor purity using 5 different measurements: STIMATE, based on gene expression profiles of 141 immune genes and 141 stromal genes; ABSOLUTE, based on somatic copy-number data; LUMP, based on 44 non-methylated immune-specific CpG sites; IHC, based on image analysis of haematoxylin and eosin stain slides produced by the Nationwide Children&#x2019;s Hospital Biospecimen Core Resource; and the averaged values based on 4 methods above.</p>
<p><bold>Calculation of inflammation index.</bold> The 27 signature genes in the inflammatory loop include genes in IL1/NF-&#x03BA;B pathway (IL1A, IL1B, IL1R1, IL1R2, IL1RAP, IL1RL1, MYD88, IRAK2, NFKB1 and NFKB2), IL6/STAT3 pathways (IL6, LIF, OSMR, JAK2 and STAT3), TNF /AP-1 pathway (TNFSF10, TNFRSF10D, TNFRSF11B, TNFRSF21, ATF3, FOS, FOSL1, FOSL2, JUN and JUNB) and MAP kinases (MAP3K8 and MAP4K4). We calculated Spearman&#x2019;s rank correlation coefficient values between gene pairs using gene expression data from CCLE and TCGA. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, we randomly selected expressed genes and calculated Spearman&#x2019;s correlation as the background distribution. We grouped breast cancer patients based on their genetic subtypes as following: Triple Negative (ER-, PR-and HER2-), Luminal A (ER&#x002B;, PR&#x002B; and HER2&#x2212;), Luminal B (ER&#x002B;, PR&#x002B; and HER2&#x002B;), and HER2&#x002B; (ER&#x2212;, PR&#x2212; and HER2&#x002B;). To calculate the inflammation index based on these genes, we first normalized the log2 expression levels across all samples to their median values. Then for each sample, we calculated the median expression level of signature genes representing the inflammation index.</p>

<sec id="s4i"><title>Calculation of cancer progression index</title>
<p>We picked 98 genes showing significant positive correlation with inflammation index across different cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), are linked to &#x201C;cell migration&#x201D;, &#x201C;angiogenesis&#x201D; and &#x201C;apoptosis&#x201D;, and are not immune/inflammation related based on gene ontology definition. These genes include: ACTC1, ACTN4, ADAM10, ADAMTSL4, AHR, ANXA2, ARHGAP22, C8ORF4, CARD6, CAV1, CFLAR, CIB1, COL15A1, COL1A1, COL4A2, CSRNP1, CYP1B1, CYR61, DAB2, DAP, DFNA5, DLC1, DRAM1, ECE1, EDN1, ELK3, EPAS1, EPHB2, F3, FN1, GADD45A, GADD45B, HBEGF, HIPK3, HMOX1, HSPG2, HTATIP2, IER3, IGFBP3, ILK, ITGA5, ITGAV, JAG1, JUN, LAMB1, LAMC2, LEPR, LGALS1, MYADM, MYH9, MYO1C, NEK6, NFKBIA, NOTCH2, NRP1, NUMB, PEA15, PHLDA1, PHLDA2, PLAU, PLK3, PNPLA6, PPP1R13L, PPP1R15A, PRKCA, PTPRB, PTPRH, RALB, RHBDD1, RRAS2, RTN4, SDCBP, SEMA4B, SERPINB3, SGK1, SH3GLB1, SH3KBP1, SH3RF1, SHB, SHC1, SLC12A6, SQSTM1, SRPX2, STEAP3, STK17A, STK17B, STX4, TGFA, TGFBI, TGFBR2, TMEM214, TSPO, UBE2Z, VEGFA, WARS, WASF2, XAF1 and ZFP36L1. We used the same calculation steps described for the inflammation index to determine the cancer progression index.</p>
