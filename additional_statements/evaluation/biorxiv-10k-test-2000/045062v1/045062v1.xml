<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> fruit flies were placed into one end of a tube near to repellents (benzaldehyde and heat) and away from the other end containing attractants (light and a favored temperature). They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. Some possibilities for explaining the deficiency: They may be considered defective in decision making that results from faulty interaction with the sensing mechanism, or, alternatively, the mutants may be defective in executive function. The mutants failed at both 34&#x00B0;C and, in one case studied, at room temperature.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>To study the mechanism of behavior, one can isolate mutants and explore their properties. In this report we describe the isolation and study of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants that are motile and able to reproduce but they are poorly responsive to all stimuli tested, both external and internal stimuli. Some possibilities for explaining this deficiency (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>):</p>

<title>RESPONSE TO STIMULI USED TOGETHER</title>
<p>In a 34&#x00B0;C dark room flies were started near two repellents (0.1M benzaldehyde and 37&#x00B0;C) at one end of a tube, away from two attractants (light at 1000 lux and 27&#x00B0;C) at the other end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). The parent responded by going away from the repellents and to the attractants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>). Mutants that were not motile were rejected, only the motile mutants were studied. This consisted of five mutants, named 1 to 5. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref> shows that such a mutant (Mutant 2) failed to respond when the four stimuli are together. S3 Fig shows that the other four mutants (Mutants 1, 3, 4, and 5) also failed to respond to the four stimuli together.</p>

<p>When only light was presented to flies that were derived from ones that had already experienced the four stimuli used together, the parent went to the light source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>) while Mutant 1 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>).

<title>RESPONSE TO OTHER EXTERNAL STIMULI</title>
<p>These mutants were in addition tested with stimuli that were not among those four used to obtain the mutants.</p>
<p>In the case of the repellent quinine, flies were started in a 0.1M quinine half and then they had the opportunity to go into a non-quinine half (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">ref. 4</xref> for details of the method). The parent went into the non-quinine half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref>), but the mutant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). See S7 Fig for additional data.</p>

<p>These mutants were also tested for response to sucrose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Compared to the wild-type, both Mutants 1 and 2 consumed significantly less sucrose, about 30 to 40&#x0025; as much as the wild-type. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8</xref> for details.</p>

<p>Between 15 and 20 flies were starved per trial on agar for 17 to 20 hours and then transferred to a tube containing agar and food dye FD &#x0026; C Blue No. 1 solution for 5 minutes. These flies were homogenized and an absorbance was obtained. This was then compared to flies that were likewise starved on agar for 17 to 20 hours but were then transferred to a tube containing agar, food dye FD &#x0026; C Blue No. 1, and 0.1M sucrose. No sucrose: Mutant 1 (n=3), Mutant 2 (n=3), and CS (n=3). With sucrose: Mutant 1 (n=2), Mutant 2 (n=2), and CS (n=3). Data are mean&#x00B1;SEM.</p></caption>

<p>To test response to gravity, these flies were placed into a vertical tube and pounded down, then at every minute the flies in each third of the tube were counted (see ref. 4 for details of the method). The parent responded by climbing up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9A</xref>) while the mutant climbed up less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9B</xref>).

<p>In the absence of any stimulus added by the experimenters, the parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig 10A</xref>) and the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig 10B</xref>) moved similarly, indicating that motility alone is about the same in parent and mutant. This was found also for Mutant 4 (S10 Fig). Mutants 2, 3, and 5 showed a slightly slower motility (S10 Fig). These results tell that the mutants were motile.</p>

<title>EFFECT OF INCUBATION TEMPERATURE</title>
<p>All the work reported above was carried out in a 34&#x00B0;C room in order to allow, if necessary, isolation and study of conditional mutants, i.e. mutants defective at 34&#x00B0;C but not defective at room temperature. We found that at room temperature, when each stimulus was used together, there was substantial condensation along the interior of the tube, resulting in the flies becoming stuck when emptied into the test apparatus. Therefore we chose to measure response to light (1000 lux) at room temperature (21 to 23&#x00B0;C). The parent responded to light but all five of the mutants failed to respond to light or responded only 10&#x0025; as well as the parent (S11 Fig), just as they did at 34&#x00B0;C. Thus the mutations are likely not conditional.</p>
<p>Being defective to all stimuli tested at the usual growth temperature, how could the mutants survive and grow? We don&#x2019;t know, but it seems that due to the crowded conditions and rich medium found in the growth tube at room temperature this defect is compensated for somehow.</p>

<title>RESPONSES TO INTERNAL STIMULI</title>

<title>HUNGER</title>
<p>Here we focus on hunger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. To measure hunger we used an apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig 11</xref>), inspired by and modified from an earlier design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], described in Supplemental</p>

</fig>
<p>Methods (Supplement: C. How to study response to internal stimuli, 1. Measuring hunger). Briefly, in a dark room at 21-23&#x00B0;C male flies &#x2013; parent or mutants - were transferred into one end (tube 1) of a 5 &#x00D7; 140 cm apparatus containing throughout its length a 5 cm wide strip of wet paper to satisfy thirst but containing no food. Starvation for food began once the flies were put in. Every 10 hours up to 40 hours the location of the flies was measured with light on for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>At 20 hours the parent had largely left the origin (tube 1) and had begun to accumulate at the end (tube 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig 12A</xref>, solid bars), while the mutant had moved towards the end very little (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig 12B</xref>, solid bars). This is interpreted to mean that the parent is searching for food while the mutant is defective in searching for food. The flies at 40 hours had moved further than at 20 hours but this is not illustrated because by 40 hours the death of the flies, presumably due to starvation, had become a serious interference.</p>

<p>When food (0.1M sucrose) was added throughout the tube along with the wet strip of paper, the parent moved less far (rather than accumulating at the end) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig 12A</xref>, open bars), while the mutant remained mostly where placed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig 12B</xref>, open bars). Since sucrose inhibited the movement of the parent, it is supposed that movement without sucrose is due largely to hunger. From these results we conclude that the mutants are defective in hunger.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<label>2.</label>
<title>THIRST</title>
<p>To study thirst, flies were deprived of water by a procedure described in Supplemental Methods (Supplement: C. How to study response to internal stimuli, 2. Measuring thirst). The procedure is the same as for hunger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig 11</xref>) except that water was omitted and solid sucrose was layered throughout.</p>
<p>By 30 hours the parent had moved out, presumably to search for water since addition of water inhibited this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Fig 13A</xref>). The mutant moved out less well than the parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Fig 13B</xref>), so we conclude that the mutants are defective in thirst. Already by 30 hours dying, presumably from thirst, had become a problem; by 40 hours this had become severe, so those results are not illustrated.</p>

<title>MAPPING OF THE MUTANTS</title>
<p>We used recombination and deficiency kits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Mutants isolated were mated to attached-X females. When presented with the four stimuli (light, favorable and unfavorable temperature, and benzaldehyde) together, attached-X females behaved wild-type (S15 Fig), indicating that both Mutants 1 and 2 are X-linked. The mutants were then crossed to an X chromosome bearing <italic>y cho cv v f</italic>.</p>
<p>Mutant 1 was found to be between <italic>v</italic> and <italic>f</italic>, approximately in position 12 or 13. Of the deficiencies that can be found for this region, we found that <italic>Df(1)BSC705</italic> uncovered Mutant 1. We then tested two deficiencies that overlap <italic>Df(1)BSC705, Df(1)BSC628</italic> and <italic>Df(1)ED7229. Df(1)BSC705</italic> uncovered Mutant 1 but <italic>Df(1)ED7229</italic> did not. Therefore the mutation must lie within <italic>Df(1)BSC705</italic> but to the left of <italic>Df(1)BSC628</italic>. Of the genes that were found within this region, 12E3 to 12E5, and that we tested, all complimented. This would suggest that the gene may lie in a small gap between the deficiencies.</p>
<p>Mutant 2 was found to be between <italic>cv</italic> and <italic>v</italic>, approximately in position 8 or 9. Of the deficiencies tested in this region, <italic>Df(1)BSC539</italic> uncovered Mutant 2. Two deficiencies that overlap with <italic>Df(1)BSC539, Df(1)BSC754</italic> and <italic>Df(1)ED7005</italic>, did not uncover Mutant 2 and the mutation must then be in the <italic>Df(1)BSC539</italic> segment to the left of <italic>Df(1)BSC754</italic>. Of the genes that were found within this region and that we tested, CG1791 failed to compliment, so we conclude that Mutant 2 lies in the <italic>CG1791</italic> gene, which has been shown to be related to fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The <italic>CG1791</italic> gene has 3 transcripts: RA, RB, and RC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] but we do not yet know how <italic>CG1791</italic> is connected to decision making or executive function.</p>
<p>This new information can be used to go on to learn what the next steps are. Ultimately all the steps between sensory reception and response can be studied in mutants in order to define the entire sequence.</p>

<title>RELATION TO REPRODUCTION</title>
<p>Although the mutants reported here are defective in the responses to all external stimuli tested and all internal stimuli tested, nevertheless they are able to reproduce, so it must be that the mechanism for mating is still active in these mutants. In a normal fly, mating uses many systems: hearing, vision, smell, taste, and contact; mating can, however, take place without some of these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], but presumably contact is still required since the male must touch the female in mating. Contact may well be intact in the mutants isolated here and perhaps presence of the flies in crowded tubes might make some of the other requirements for mating not necessary.</p>
<p>In our previous work on isolating mutants such as these by G. Tang, V. Toniolo, Y. H. Ng, L. Vang, and J. Adler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], the mutants isolated failed to reproduce. Possibly they lacked mating due to lacking this contact. The procedure for isolating mutants was different from the procedure here: instead of using the four stimuli together (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>), the stimuli were used one at a time.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Here we describe the isolation and some properties of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants that are motile but yet they each fail in response to all external attractants and repellents tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) and also they are deficient in response to internal stimuli tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13</xref>). Thus, although the mutants are motile, they have</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>decreased responsiveness to light</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>decreased responsiveness to repulsive chemicals (like benzaldehyde)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>decreased responsiveness to heat and to favorable temperature</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>decreased responsiveness to bitter tastants (like quinine)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>decreased responsiveness to sweet tastants (like sucrose)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>decreased responsiveness to gravity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>decreased responsiveness to hunger</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>decreased responsiveness to thirst</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>abnormality in some sleep</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Because all of these different behaviors are defective in each of these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13</xref>), it seems reasonable to say that there is a central place which is responsible. This might possibly be decision making acting on sensory reception, or decision making acting on executive function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Decision making involves interaction with stimuli. The simple sensing-response relationships long assumed to underlie behaviors is actually more complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. When there are no stimuli added there is a resting state, called &#x201C;default&#x201D; or &#x201C;intrinsic&#x201D;, which yet allows many behaviors to occur, and when stimuli are presented there is an activated state, called &#x201C;reflexive&#x201D; or &#x201C;responsive&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Our mutants could be defective in making this relation between resting state and activated state so that responses to all stimuli are poor. Presumably some factor is needed for this coming together of the resting state and the activated state, and that factor may be deficient in the mutants.</p>
<p>An alternative is that the mutants are defective elsewhere, rather than in the interaction between decision-making and stimuli. What is defective may be the interaction between decision-making and executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. &#x201C;Executive functions are the high-level cognitive processes that facilitate new ways of behaving&#x2026;The operation of executive processes accompanies a very wide range of behaviours&#x2026;Similar progress has been made on work in animals&#x201D; not just in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. It may be that executive function responds to a hypothetical control of the organism called here &#x201C;The Boss&#x201D;, which is inside every organism in charge of it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The place where the consequences of action of these mutants appears is not known. Possibilities are: 1) Outside of known bodies but rather in the surrounding fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, p. 540]. 2) In the mushroom bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, pp. 523, 548; 30], but this is not likely because when we tested mutants in the mushroom bodies they had a normal response (see S16 Fig). 3) In the central complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref> pp. 521, 31].</p>
<p>In the case of insects, known parts of the central complex consist of the protocerebral bridge, the fan-shaped body, the ellipsoid body, and noduli (S1A Fig) and the central complex is involved in bringing about a behavioral response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In the case of vertebrates, it is the prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] (S1B Fig) plus the basal ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] (S1C Fig) that determines a behavioral response.</p>
<p>Some 30 different mutants of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have been isolated that have defects in various parts of the central complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. These mutants have been kindly given to us by Roland Strauss, Burkhard Poeck, and Douglas Armstrong. Now we have shown here (S17 Fig) that several of these mutants can block the parental response away from benzaldehyde plus heat and towards light plus a favored temperature that is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; these several mutants are <italic>cbd<sup>ks96</sup></italic>, <italic>nob<sup>ks49</sup></italic>, and c<italic>cb<sup>ks145</sup></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and <italic>EB1</italic> and <italic>62y</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. This result may suggest that the mutants we isolated and report here cause defects in the central complex.</p>
<p>Neusser, Triphan, Mrontz, Poeck, and Strauss found that <italic>D. Melanogaster</italic> mutants, unlike their parent, failed to remember where they were located just before they were moved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], see the diagram of this by Tomchik and Davis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] (S2 Fig). The Strauss et al. work suggested to them that this is related to the prefrontal cortex of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Our own work on decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] also describes mutants of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that appear to lack steps like those handled by the prefrontal cortex of humans and other vertebrates. It would seem that the insect brain and the brain of higher-order animals share many qualities.</p>
<p>According to Straussfeld and Hirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], there is behavioral homology between the response by insects and the response by vertebrates: see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> of ref. 49 (S1D Fig) and they propose that this homology originated in very early times. Studies by Arendt&#x2019;s group indicate that the responses by insects and the by vertebrates are descended from a common ancient ancestor that represents an early stage of evolution of the nervous system and muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Altogether, the mutants that we isolated and reported here may well have bearing for both insects and vertebrates.</p>

<title>RELATION TO CHARGE SYNDROME AND DEAF-BLIND CONDITION</title>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants isolated in this report seem related to a rare human genetic condition that occurs in roughly 1 per 10,000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], called CHARGE syndrome, reviewed recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. &#x201C;Children with CHARGE syndrome are truly &#x2018;multi-sensory impaired&#x2019;, having difficulties not only in vision and hearing but also with the senses that perceive balance, touch, temperature, pain, pressure, and smell, as well as problems with breathing and swallowing, eating and drinking, digestion, and temperature control&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. This syndrome was described independently in 1979 by Hall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] and Hittner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. The term CHARGE was then coined for the disease to cover its various symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], although not all symptoms are always present. A human gene, <italic>CHD7</italic>, is known to be associated with some 65&#x0025; of 379 published cases of human CHARGE syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>].</p>
<p>CHARGE syndrome is now being studied also in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], and <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. A number of genes have been identified that are closely related to the human gene. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, kismet <italic>(kis</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of human <italic>CHD7</italic>) is located in chromosome 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. In our own work on <italic>Drosophila</italic> (this report) the mutants described are located in the X chromosome, so the research here might deal with a different, additional gene for CHARGE syndrome, or else it deals with a different function altogether.</p>
<p>While in CHARGE syndrome the deaf-blind symptoms occur already at birth, in a different inherited disease, Usher syndrome, the deaf syndrome occurs at birth but the blind syndrome occurs years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. That defect is known to be caused by an abnormal autosomal gene as well as a number of still unidentified genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>].</p>

<title>SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS</title>
<sec id="s7a">
<title>A. ISOLATION OF MUTANTS</title>
<p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (strain Canton-S) and attached-X flies were provided by Robert Kreber.</p>
<p>Flies were maintained on standard cornmeal-molasses agar medium at room temperature (21-23&#x00B0;C) in a room that was light for 12 hours and dark for 12 hours. Male flies were mutagenized overnight with 25mM ethyl methane sulfonate in 1&#x0025; sucrose on Kimwipe paper (Kimberly-Clark, Roswell, GA). Then they were mated with virgin attached-X (<italic>y w f</italic> C(1)DX) females. At about six days the adult flies were removed. At around two weeks the F1 adults appeared and they were studied here.</p>
<p>At 2 to 5 days some 5300 of these F1 males plus females were screened about 500 at a time by a procedure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>. From 4-liter graduated cylinders (10.8 cm x 58 cm Nalgane polymethylpentene, Fisher, 08-572-5J, Hanover Park, IL) four 17.5 cm sections were cut (the end with the spout was not used) and labeled sections 1, 2, 3, and 4. (In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref> sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 are called &#x201C;origin&#x201D;, &#x201C;next to origin&#x201D;, &#x201C;next to furthest&#x201D;, and &#x201C;furthest&#x201D;, respectively.) At room temperature the right end of section 4 was filled with 40 ml of 1.5&#x0025; agar for control of the temperature-gradient described below. A 2-cm diameter hole was made in the middle of section 1 to be the point of entry for the flies. Then these four pieces were put into a 34&#x00B0;C room, where the experiments were to be carried out. Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 were each fixed together with a transparent connector (a 15x20 cm piece cut from a transparency film for copiers, 3M Company, St. Paul, MN). A 45 cm fluorescent light (15 watts, cool white, lamp VTU15RTCPCO used without plastic cover, obtained from American Fluorescent Corp., Waukegan, IL or local hardware store such as Mennards, Madison, WI) was placed perpendicularly 15 cm from the right end of section 4 to produce a light gradient (stimulus 1). A temperature gradient (stimulus 2) was generated by placing a 2 L beaker of ice 1 cm from the right end of section 4 and by placing a hotplate (Barnstead Thermolyne, 1900, Dubuque, IA) on its side at a setting of 150&#x00B0;C 10 cm away from the left end of section 1; this was ready to use in about 20 minutes, when the temperature at the cool end was about 29&#x00B0; and at the warm end 38&#x00B0; (but not greater, so as to avoid a block in motility), as determined with a digital thermometer (63-1032, RadioShack, Fort Worth, TX) inside each end of the tube. At room temperature 0.1M benzaldehyde in 5 ml of melted 1.5&#x0025; agar was pipetted onto the interior walls of a 5 cm-long cap (cut from a 17.5 cm section, see above) while rotating the cap until the agar hardened (cooler temperature may be needed). One end of the cap was then closed with Saran Wrap (S.C. Johnson Inc., Racine, WI). White tulle fabric or white organza fabric (Gifts International Inc., Ontario, CA, or local fabric store such as Hancock Fabrics, Madison, WI) was folded in half and taped to the other end of the benzaldehyde cap to provide a screen between section 1 and the cap in order to prevent the flies from making direct contact with this toxic benzaldehyde solution. Then the benzaldehyde cap was brought into the 34&#x00B0;C room and was affixed to the left end of section 1 with white label-tape (Fisher, 15-938). The benzaldehyde was allowed to diffuse for 30 minutes to provide a gradient of it (stimulus 4). (If a single stimulus had been used instead of four stimuli together, the resulting mutants would more likely be defective in a gene for sensing that single stimulus instead of in a gene for the final pathway.)</p>
<p>A previous attempt to produce such mutants (2005-2007) by Grace Tang, Victor Toniolo, Yi Hang Ng, Lar Vang, and Julius Adler used an alternative yet similar procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], but it failed. After initial mutagenization of males, about 33000 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> were tested, around 1500 males plus females at a time. Selected were those that failed in response to light, then those were tested in response to benzaldehyde, then those were tested in response to heat. After these three tests, finally 29 mutants resulted but they did not reproduce. Then we started over with the present procedure, which puts all the stimuli together for the isolation of mutants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7b">
<title>B. HOW TO STUDY RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL STIMULI</title>
<p>Flies were removed from their food vials into empty vials. The flies (about 500 flies for isolation of mutants, about 10 in later experiments) were then placed at 34&#x00B0;C in the dark for 30 minutes. They were added through the hole in section 1 by use of a funnel, and then the fluorescent lamp was turned on, which marked the beginning of the assay. Every minute for 20 minutes the number of flies in each quarter of the tube was counted, unless the number of flies was too large to easily count, in which case estimates were made. In cases where the flies were getting killed by the heat and/or benzaldehyde, the assays were run for a shorter time.</p>
<p>Parental flies went almost entirely to the attractant end (compartment 4). For isolation of mutants, those flies that failed to go to the attractant end (the ones in compartments 1, 2, and 3) were saved, placed in food vials, and retested in the same way one to two days later. Then each of those males that again failed was mated with virgin females, and the next generation (F2) of males was tested in the same way. This procedure yielded five mutants, called 1 to 5. Only males were used in all of the experiments presented in this article. (If a single stimulus had been used instead of four stimuli together, the resulting mutants would more likely be defective in a gene for sensing that single stimulus instead if in a gene for the final pathway.)</p>
<p>When light alone is used, the setup is the same as in the isolation of mutants but with only the light source used.</p>
<p>When heat alone is used, the setup is the same as in the isolation of mutants but with only the heat source used and with a light source placed parallel to the entire length of the tube.</p>
<p>When no stimuli was used, the setup is the same as in the isolation of mutants but with no stimuli present except for a parallel light source placed along the entire length of the tube.</p>
<p>See ref. 4 on testing for quinine and gravity. Each trial used about 10 male flies.</p>
<p>See ref. 5 on testing for sucrose. Each trial used about 10 male flies.</p>

<title>C. HOW TO STUDY RESPONSE TO INTERNAL STIMULI</title>
<sec id="s7c1">
<label>1.</label>
<title>Measuring hunger</title>
<p>The apparatus for measuring hunger consisted of four tubes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig 10</xref>. Tube 1 is 20 cm long and 5 cm wide, tubes 2, 3, and 4 are 40 cm long and 5 cm wide (cut from clear acrylic tubes 6 feet long and 2 inches wide, TAP Plastics <email>info@tapplastics.com</email>). Each of the four tubes was drilled with four rows of 1 mm holes every 2.5 cm to provide exchange of air (possibly these holes are not needed when only 50 flies are used). Each of the four tubes was saturated with water by adding a strip of Kimwipe (15 in x 17 in, Kimberly-Clark) 5 cm wide and 20 or 40 cm long to which 5 or 10 ml of distilled water was added, and then the excess water was poured off. Between each of the four tubes was placed a funnel (45 mm wide, Kimble Kimax 28950-45) with its stem cut off (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig 10</xref>), to direct flies from one tube into the next and to minimize movement backward. Then as connector to connect the tubes, transparent packaging tape (5 cm width, SureTech Brands, Avon, OH) was placed all the way around between tubes 2 and 3 and between 3 and 4; between 1 and 2 it was placed over only the bottom half because the gate is in the way elsewhere. Then a gate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig 10</xref>) (cut from transparency film for copiers, 3M, St. Paul, MN) was inserted between 1 and 2 (used only during the loading of the flies, then removed). The two open ends of the apparatus were capped with an acrylic cap we made, though Saran wrap (S. C. Johnson &#x0026; Sons, Racine, WI) would be perhaps as effective.</p>
<p>The apparatus was put into a dark room at 21 to 23&#x00B0;C. About 50 male flies per trial were placed from their growth medium into tube 1. After about 5 minutes to allow the flies to become quiescent, the gate was removed and replaced by putting transparent packaging tape over the top half. The apparatus was then covered with black garbage bags to ensure darkness. Then the number of flies in each tube was counted at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 hours by having lights on for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The effect of adding water plus sucrose was studied as above except that 0.1M sucrose was poured onto the strip of Kimwipe, 5 ml for tube 1 and 10 ml for tubes 2, 3, and 4, and then the excess was poured off at 10 sec.</p>

<title>Measuring thirst</title>
<p>The same apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig 10</xref>) and the same method was used for studying thirst as for measuring hunger except there was no water added and sucrose crystals were placed on the Kimwipe, 250 mg in tube 1 and 500 mg in each of tubes 2, 3, and 4.</p>
