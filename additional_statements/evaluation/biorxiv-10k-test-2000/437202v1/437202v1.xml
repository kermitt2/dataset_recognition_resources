<title>Abstract</title>
<p>DNA methylation of cytosine residues across the genome influences how genes and phenotypes are regulated in a wide range of organisms. As such, understanding the role of DNA methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms has become very much a part of mapping genotype to phenotype, a major question in evolutionary biology. Ideally, we would like to manipulate DNA methylation patterns on a genome-wide scale, to help us to elucidate the role that epigenetic modifications play in phenotypic expression. Recently, the demethylating agent 5-aza-2&#x2019;-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; commonly used in the epigenetic treatment of certain cancers), has been deployed to explore the epigenetic regulation of a number of traits of interest to evolutionary ecologists, including facultative sex allocation in the parasitoid wasp <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>. In a recent study, we showed that treatment with 5-aza-dC did not ablate the facultative sex allocation response in <italic>Nasonia</italic>, but shifted the patterns of sex allocation in a way predicted by genomic conflict theory. This was the first (albeit indirect) experimental evidence for genomic conflict over sex allocation facilitated by DNA methylation. However, that work lacked direct evidence of the effects of 5-aza-dC on DNA methylation, and indeed the effect of the chemical has since been questioned in <italic>Nasonia</italic>. Here, using whole-genome bisulphite sequencing of more than 4 million CpGs, across more than 11,000 genes, we demonstrate unequivocally that 5-aza-dC disrupts methylation on a large scale across the <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> genome. We show that the disruption can lead to both hypo&#x002D; and hyper-methylation, may vary across tissues and time of sampling, and that the effects of 5-aza-dC are context&#x002D; and sequence specific. We conclude that 5-aza-dC does indeed have the potential to be repurposed as a tool for studying the role of DNA methylation in evolutionary ecology, whilst many details of its action remain to be discovered.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The genomics revolution has transformed our understanding of how genomes build phenotypes. The extraordinary diversity of morphologies, behaviours, and physiological adaptations we see across the natural world are not necessarily the product of very different sets of genes, or very different numbers of genes in organisms, but rather differences in how, where and when genes are expressed during development. The genomics revolution has therefore been as much about understanding gene regulation as it has been about identifying allelic variants at genetic loci (Ashbrook <italic>et al.</italic> 2017, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Bi&#x00E9;mont <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). At the forefront of our growing knowledge of gene regulation has been the role of epigenetic modification of DNA, including DNA methylation. In the vast majority of cases, DNA methylation occurs at the C5 position of the cytosine ring in CpG dinucleotides and is catalysed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes (Dnmts). Three types of Dnmt are known in eukaryotes; Dnmt3 establishes DNA methylation patterns <italic>de novo</italic>, Dnmt1 maintains these patterns, and Dnmt2 is involved in tRNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lyko 2018</xref>). In mammals, broadly, DNA methylation is found throughout the genome (except at CpG islands near the promoters of genes) and is associated with transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Feng <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zemach <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). By contrast, in insects, DNA methylation is concentrated in gene bodies and is associated with more stable patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bewick <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). Notably, vertebrate and invertebrate DNA methylation varies greatly in its extent throughout the genome, with the proportion of methylated CpGs much lower in invertebrates; 0-14&#x0025; as compared to 60-90&#x0025; in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bewick <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Glastad <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). The evolutionary reasons for these differences are not yet clear, although it is thought that gene body methylation is an ancient feature of eukaryote genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zemach <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). However, DNA methylation status influences how genes (and phenotypes) are expressed in many organisms, including reproductive vs non-reproductive worker bumblebees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amarasinghe <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), caste differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kucharski <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lyko <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), and learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) in honey bees, and behavioural division of labour in ants (<italic>Pogonomyrmex barbatus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Smith <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Libbrecht et al. 2016</xref> for a robust critique of earlier studies of DNA methylation and caste determination in social insects). Therefore, DNA methylation patterns are very much part of mapping genotypes to phenotypes.</p>
<p>The flexible control of gene expression provided by mechanisms such as DNA methylation has also caught the interest of biologists interested in the underlying mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity, and indeed for evolutionary biologists interested in how such plasticity may evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonduriansky and Day 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2018</xref>). Moreover, there has also been great interest in the extent to which epigenetic modifications may be inherited across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lind and Spagopoulou 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burggren 2016</xref>, Bondurianksy and Day 2009). Transmission of epigenetic state allows transmission of parent-of-origin information, or so-called genomic imprinting, setting the scene for genomic conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patten <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haig 2002</xref>). Genomic conflict arises when maternally&#x002D; and paternally&#x002D; inherited alleles have different evolutionary optima for traits expressed in an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Haig 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2002</xref>). A classic example is the expression of maternally&#x002D; or paternally&#x002D; inherited alleles during embryonic development in mammals: paternally-inherited alleles are selected to extract more resources from the mother <italic>in utero</italic> compared to maternally-inherited alleles (Moore and Haig 1991). This conflict is now known to be, at least in part, facilitated by parent-of-origin specific gene expression of insulin-like growth factor II (Igf2) and Igf2r. In mammals, the Igf2 gene promotes growth and cellular differentiation during development and also regulates the placental supply of nutrients and the demand of nutrients by the foetus (Const&#x00E2;ncia <italic>et al.</italic> 2002).</p>
<p>To further understand the role epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation have in influencing phenotypes and their evolution, we need robust ways of manipulating them. Here we consider the efficacy of the chemical 5-aza-2&#x2019;-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) as a way of manipulating DNA methylation, using the parasitoid wasp <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>. The extent and nature of DNA methylation across the <italic>N</italic>. <italic>vitripennis</italic> genome has recently been characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pegoraro et al. 2016</xref>), and the presence in the genome of a full &#x201C;methylation toolkit&#x201D; has also been confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Werren et al. 2010</xref>). 5-aza-dC is well-known from the cancer literature as a hypomethylating agent, and is used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Seelan <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Momparler 2012</xref>). In cancer patients, many genes that suppress leukemogenesis in humans are silenced by aberrant DNA methylation. 5-aza-dC acts as a demethylating agent to reactivate these genes (see below for details of action). In recent years, 5-aza-dC has been used across a range of species as an experimental tool to explore how DNA methylation influences phenotypes including diapause in <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pegoraro <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>) and worker reproductive status in bumble bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amarasinghe <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Previously, we used 5-aza-dC to explore whether DNA methylation was involved in the control of facultative sex allocation in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>vitripennis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cook <italic>et al.</italic> 2015a</xref>).</p>
<p>Like all Hymenoptera, <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> is haplodiploid, with males arising from unfertilised haploid eggs and females arising from fertilised diploid eggs. Females have putative control over the sex of their offspring, releasing sperm to produce daughters or not to produce sons. Female <italic>Nasonia</italic> allocate sex broadly in line with the predictions of Local Mate Competition theory (LMC: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hamilton 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Taylor and Bulmer 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Werren 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shuker and West 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Burton-Chellew <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">West 2009</xref>). Females laying eggs alone on their blowfly pupae hosts produce very female biased offspring sex ratios to minimise competition amongst her sons for mating opportunities. As more females (foundresses) lay eggs on the same host(s) together, females produce less female-biased sex ratios, as LMC is reduced and the fitness gained through the production of sons and daughters moves towards equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hamilton 1967</xref>). When treated with 5-aza-dC, the facultative sex allocation response in female <italic>Nasonia</italic> was maintained, suggesting that this plastic behaviour in and of itself did not require certain patterns of methylation. Rather, the sex ratios (as proportion male) produced by females were shifted slightly upwards, with more sons produced by treated females than by controls. This subtle shift is as predicted by genomic conflict over sex allocation theory, which requires some form of genomic imprinting (Wild and West 2008). Assuming that DNA methylation is the mechanism by which parent-of-origin allelic information is carried in <italic>Nasonia</italic>, our data therefore provided the first (albeit indirect) evidence for genomic conflict influencing sex allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cook <italic>et al</italic>. 2015a</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ellers <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)</xref> challenged the effects of 5-aza-dC as a general modifier of methylation status, considering CpGs in ten genes in <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ellers <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)</xref> failed to find changes in methylation status across any of the 155 CpGs in their study, questioning the action of 5-aza-dC in <italic>Nasonia</italic>, and hence of course the interpretation of the effects of 5-aza-dC in our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cook <italic>et al.</italic> 2015a</xref>). Fully negative results are of course very hard to interpret, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ellers <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)</xref> nonetheless raised valid concerns of the efficacy of the chemical. As noted above, levels of methylation in insects is generally low, and a genome-wide study would provide greater resolution to explore the effects of this chemical in an ecologically valuable model system. Here we consider the effects of 5-aza-dC across the whole genome using a Bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) experiment. There is evidence to suggest that the effects of 5-aza-dC are unlikely to be random across methylated CpGs in a given genome. For instance, in mammals, genomic context can influence the extent to which 5-aza-dC is effective as a demethylating agent. DNA sequence context, the distribution of transcription factor binding sites, and chromatin structure are known to influence the DNA methylation patterns produced by 5-aza-dC exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ramos <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Mossmann <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hagemann <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Although patterns of methylation differ among eukaryotes, the epigenetic modification itself is chemically identical. Here, we verify that 5-aza-dC influences patterns of methylation across the genome in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic>. Altered methylation patterns produced by 5-aza-dC exposure were non-random, with enrichment in genes associated with transcription-factor activity and sequence specific binding.</p>

<title>Study species</title>
<p><italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> (Hymenoptera, Chalcicoidea) is a generalist parasitoid of large dipteran pupae including species of Calliphoridae. Females oviposit between 20 and 50 eggs in an individual host, with male offspring emerging just before females (after approximately 14 d at 25 &#x00B0;C: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Whiting 1967</xref>). Males are brachypterous and unable to fly, remaining close to the emergence site where they compete with each other for emerging females, including their sisters. Females disperse after mating to locate new hosts. The females used in this experiment were from the wild-type AsymC strain, originally isolated in 1986 by curing the wild-type strain LabII of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Wasps have been maintained on <italic>Calliphora vomitoria</italic> or <italic>C. vicina</italic> hosts at 25 &#x00B0;C, 16L:8D light conditions ever since, and AsymC is also the reference genome strain (<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Werren <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). The quantitative genetic basis of sex ratio variation has been repeatedly quantified (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pannebakker et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">2011</xref>) whilst whole-genome transcription studies have confirmed that facultative sex allocation takes place without discernible changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cook et al. 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2018a</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>5-aza-2&#x2019;-deoxycytidine</title>
<p>We used 5-aza-dC (Sigma Aldrich Company Ltd., Gillingham, UK) at a non-lethal concentration (10 &#x00B5;M). Widely used in epigenetic anticancer treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Seelan <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>), 5-aza-dC is a nucleoside analogue that works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Piskala and Sorm 1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones and Taylor 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Momparler 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Christman 2002</xref>). When initially introduced to a cell, 5-aza-dC is essentially inert but is then converted by processes inherent in the cell to its active form 5-aza-dCTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Seelan <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). This active form is readily incorporated into DNA during S-phase in the place of cytosine. In the daughter strands arising from a replication event, DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) will attempt to restore the patterns of methylation that were present in the parent strand. However, Dnmt1 becomes irreversibly bound to the 5-aza-dCTP residues in the daughter strands, resulting in a diminishing pool of Dnmt1. Thus, administering 5-aza-dC results in a passive loss of DNA methylation; the key effect of 5-aza-dC (for a fuller description, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al, 2018b</xref>).</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>To control for possible host and other maternal effects, experimental females were not drawn straight from stock populations. Instead, two-day-old, mated, wild-type AsymC females were isolated from the mass cultures into individual glass vials. Each female was provided with three hosts and allowed to oviposit. Experimental females were drawn from the F1 generation, two days after emergence, one female per &#x201C;grandmother&#x201D;. We then employed a three by three factorial design whereby females were allocated to one of three 5-aza-dC exposure regimes and were harvested post-feeding at three time points. Exposure regimes were a) 20&#x0025; sucrose for 24h, b) 20&#x0025; sucrose supplemented with 10 &#x00B5;M 5-aza-dC for 24h and c) 20&#x0025; sucrose supplemented with 10 &#x00B5;M 5-aza-dC for 48h. For each of the three regimes, females were harvested at 0, 24 or 48h post-exposure. Throughout the experiment, females were kept individually in glass vials and incubated at 25 &#x00B0;C, 16L :8D. Solutions (200 &#x00B5;l) were provided in the lid of a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. For individuals exposed to 5-aza-dC for 48 h, the solutions were topped up by 100&#x00B5;l half-way through the exposure period to compensate for evaporation. All solutions were stained green with food colouring such that a subset of 10 females from each treatment combination could be dissected to check that feeding had occurred. At the point of harvest, females were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x2212;80 &#x00B0;C prior to DNA extraction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>DNA extraction and bisulphite-conversion</title>
<p>Prior to DNA extraction, individuals were removed from &#x2212;80 &#x00B0;C storage and heads were quickly excised from bodies using a sterile scalpel and a cryloyser to keep samples cold. Heads (and likewise bodies) from the same treatment combination were randomly pooled into groups of 10 to give a maximum of 3 biological replicates for each treatment combination giving a total of 54 DNA samples. Briefly, tissue was homogenised using a micropestle in 350 &#x00B5;l CTAB (Hexadecyltrimethylammonium Bromide) buffer with subsequent overnight proteinase K digestion (400 &#x00B5;g) at 56 &#x00B0;C. Samples were cooled to room temperature prior to RNase A digestion for 1 hour at 37 &#x00B0;C. A chloroform: isoamyl-alcohol wash (300 &#x00B5;l) was performed twice before ethanol/sodium acetate precipitation of the DNA. DNA purity was analysed using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer with all samples having a 260/280 ratio of &#x2265;1.8. DNA integrity was confirmed using agarose gel electrophoresis.</p>

<title>Bisulphite sequencing</title>
<p>Bisulphite conversion, library preparation and sequencing were carried out by Edinburgh Genomics. Briefly, bisulphite conversion was carried out using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine USA), designed to reduce template degradation during the harsh bisulphite treatment whilst ensuring complete conversion of the DNA. Library preparation was carried out using the TruSeq DNA methylation Kit which takes the single-stranded DNA that results from bisulphite treatment and converts it into an Illumina sequencing library. Sequencing of bisulphite-treated DNA was carried out on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 in high output mode with 125bp paired-end reads. Library preparation failed for three of the samples due to low levels of input DNA, leaving only two biological replicates for three out of 18 treatment combinations and a total of 51 Bisulphite-sequenced samples (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Raw data processing</title>
<p>Initial data processing was carried out by Edinburgh Genomics. Briefly, reads were trimmed using Cutadapt version 1.12 removing any adapter sequences and for quality using a threshold of 30. After trimming reads were required to have a minimum length of 50 bp. <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> genome version 2.1 and the associated annotation, available for download at Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://metazoa.ensembl.org/Nasonia_vitripennis/Info/Index">http://metazoa.ensembl.org/Nasonia_vitripennis/Info/Index</ext-link>), were used as a reference. Reads were aligned to the reference genome using Bismark (version 0.16) with the parameter &#x201C;bowtie2&#x201D;. PCR duplicates were removed from the resulting BAM files using samtools with the parameter &#x201C;view-F 1024&#x201D;. Data for each CpG was then extracted from the BAM files using the Bioconductor package methylKit (version 0.99.3) with R (version 3.3.1). The methylation status of each CpG for all samples was calculated using the function &#x201C;processBismarkAln&#x201D; using the default parameters, except &#x201C;min.cov&#x003D;1 no;ap&#x003D;TRUE&#x201D;, which excludes CpG&#x2019;s not covered by any reads across all samples and does not count CpGs covered by overlapping ends of a paired read as covered twice. The 1&#x0025; of bases with the highest coverage were removed using the function &#x201C;filterByCoverage&#x201D; to eliminate potential PCR bias. After initial processing as outlined above, the raw data comprised percentage methylation at 4,150,376 CpG loci (no. of reads in which the CpG is methylated/total no. of reads covering the CpG) for each of 51 samples. CpG read counts were then summed by gene, (including 1Kb up and downstream) using gene annotation from Ensembl (version 2.1. available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/metazoa/release-40/gff3/nasonia_vitripennis">ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/metazoa/release-40/gff3/nasonia_vitripennis</ext-link>). Around half (2,119,643) of the CpG&#x2019;s in the full dataset fell within genic regions with 14,765/17,279 genes (85&#x0025;) having at least one CpG present.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The overall structure of our dataset in terms of the proportion of methylated reads per gene and per loci was visualised with two complementary analyses: a principle component analysis (PCA), which allows samples to be visualised in relation to the two major axes of variation in our experiment, and a T-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) analysis. t-SNE is a machine-learning algorithm for data visualisation well-suited for high-dimensional datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">van der Maaten and Hinton 2008</xref>). The PCA was conducted using the R base function prcomp with default values. To perform the t-SNE analysis we used the R package Rtsne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Krijthe 2015</xref>), with default values and perplexity set to 15. For the PCA and t-SNE analyses any genes or loci with 0 coverage in any one sample were discarded prior to analysis.</p>
<p>To examine the effect of 5-aza-dC exposure on individual genes, we modelled the number of methylated and unmethylated reads from a gene as a generalized linear model (GLM) with a binomial distribution with the following terms: exposure, tissue-type, collection time and their interactions. Genes with 0 coverage for all samples in any particular treatment group were excluded from our analysis (leaving a total of 11582 genes). Significance of each term was determined by a likelihood ratio test, which was corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini and Hochberg&#x2019;s algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benjamini and Hochberg 1995</xref>), with statistical significance set to 5&#x0025;. Coefficients (log odds of methylation) for each term were extracted from the full model. All statistical analyses were conducted in R (v. 3.4.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">R Core Team 2017</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>N. vitripennis</italic> GO-terms were downloaded from &#x201C;hymenopteramine&#x201D; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hymenopteragenome.org/hymenopteramine/begin.do">http://hymenopteragenome.org/hymenopteramine/begin.do</ext-link>) on 27<sup>th</sup> September 2018. In addition, we used hymenopteramine to firstly obtain <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologs for each <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> gene, from which we could then obtain the associated <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> GO terms. We used both of these GO-term sets for enrichment analyses (below). Some <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> genes had multiple <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologs. In these cases, all GO-terms from each <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ortholog were combined together. To ensure this did not bias our results we repeated our analyses, but instead of combining GO-terms we kept only GO-terms that were shared between all orthologs.</p>
<p>To examine which processes are most affected by 5-aza-dC exposure, we conducted gene set enrichment analyses using the R package TopGO (v. 2.28.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rahnenfuhrer 2016</xref>) using the elim algorithm to account for the GO topology. Gene set enrichment analyses identify enriched GO terms in a threshold-free way, by finding GO-terms that are overrepresented at the top of a ranked list of genes. Here we ranked genes by FDR for the exposure effect. GO terms were considered to be significantly enriched when p &#x003C; 0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Median coverage across the whole experiment (N &#x003D; 51 BS-seq libraries) was 916X, but coverage was heterogeneous between loci (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and samples (Table S1). Mean read coverage per sample ranged from 2.7X to 49.4X. Four samples had less than 10X mean coverage per CpG, however, these samples were distributed across treatment groups.</p>

<p>Treatment with 5-aza-dC had wide-ranging effects on DNA methylation across the genome. First, samples clustered strongly by exposure regime at the gene-level in both the t-SNE visualisation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and in the principle component analyses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that 5-aza-dC has a strong effect on the methylation of genes. Both analyses show the strong clustering at the gene loci, and that wasps exposed for 24 hours are more like controls than wasps treated for 48 hours. In addition, the PCA analysis showed clear separation along PCA1 (which presumably is heavily associated with exposure regime; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Importantly though, this analysis also emphasises the extent of variation in response across the three treatment regimes, which is smallest for the controls, and largest for the 48 hour-exposed wasps (note the spread along PCA axis 2 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, both cluster analyses placed the controls as some way intermediate between the two 5-aza-dC exposed treatments, which we consider further in the next two paragraphs. Both analyses also show that exposure regime dominated the clustering, over and above of any effects of either tissue-type or collection time, suggesting that this is the key effect. When we consider clustering at the level of individual CpG loci, clustering is much less obvious, using both t-SNE and PCA. However, the control treatment appears to cluster within the others in the t-SNE analyses, and the 24 hour and 48 hour treatments do separate to some extent, e.g. with the 24h samples more the bottom and left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1</xref> and the 48h samples more to the top and right (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figures S1</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). The differences between the individual CpG and gene-level cluster analyses are likely to be due to a combination of low coverage and a greater stochasticity of methylation at the individual CpG level (see discussion).</p>

<p>Second, a more in-depth examination of the data using a generalised linear modelling (GLM) approach to examine differential methylation at the gene level found that 5-aza-dC exposure had a significant effect on the methylation status of the majority of genes examined (exposure treatment was significant as a main effect at an FDR level of 0.05 for 8,556 out of 11,582 genes, or 73.9&#x0025; of genes). Moreover, both tissue-type and collection time also influenced methylation status across a large number of genes (significant as main effects in the GLMs for 3483 and 3134 genes respectively). Significant interactions between factors were also present for the majority of genes (exposure regime &#x002A; collection time &#x003D; 10,547 genes, exposure regime &#x002A; tissue type &#x003D; 9,042 genes, collection time &#x002A; tissue type &#x003D; 5,011 genes, and exposure &#x002A; collection time &#x002A; tissue type &#x003D; 10,234 genes), showing widespread evidence for significant interplay between these factors. These results emphasise the context-dependent nature of the action of 5-aza-dC. Full results from the GLMs are presented in Table S2.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it appears that methylation tends to increase initially in response to exposure to 5-aza-dC, an effect that is noticeable after 24h of exposure, before decreasing after 48h of exposure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This means that how long individuals are exposed to the chemical may well influence what kind of methylation changes are observed; in other words, both hyper&#x002D; and hypo-methylation can result from 5-aza-dC treatment. In terms of when wasps were collected after exposure, 3134 genes displayed significantly decreased methylation in association with collection time, with a more pronounced decrease in methylation in samples collected 48h post-exposure relative to 24h post-exposure (when compared to 0h post-exposure; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggests that the effect of 5-aza-dC persists at least 48h after exposure has stopped. Finally, 3483 genes displayed significantly altered methylation patterns in association with tissue type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), with lower methylation overall in the head. However, we re-iterate that these main effects need to be contextualised within the pattern of widespread interactions seen in the data, with 88&#x0025; of genes exhibiting a significant second-order interaction between exposure, tissue type and collection time.</p>

<p>Gene-set enrichment analysis, using <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> GO terms, when genes were ranked by their response to exposure regime is presented in Table S3. Broadly, we identified 129 significantly enriched GO terms, 52 of these terms fell under the &#x201C;Biological process&#x201D; (BP) category, 16 under &#x201C;Cellular component&#x201D; (CC) and 61 under &#x201C;Molecular function&#x201D; (MF). The top three enriched GO terms were &#x201C;sequence-specific DNA binding&#x201D; (GO:43565), &#x201C;regulation of transcription, DNA templated&#x201D; (GO:6355) and &#x201C;transcription factor activity, sequence-specific DNA binding&#x201D; (GO: 43565) (Table S3). When the analysis was repeated using GO terms for the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologs, a higher number of significantly enriched GO terms was obtained (686; 526 BP, CC 59, MF 89) of significantly enriched GO terms was obtained (Table S4). The top three GO terms for the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> analysis were &#x201C;nucleus&#x201D; (GO:0005634), &#x201C;positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter&#x201D; (GO:45944), and, making a reappearance, &#x201C;sequence-specific DNA binding&#x201D; (GO:43565). This analysis combined GO-terms when <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> genes had multiple <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologs, which could lead to bias, however, we retrieve very similar enriched terms when we used only the GO terms that were shared between the multiple orthologs (Table S5), suggesting any bias caused by this approach is small.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A genome-wide analysis of CpGs across more than 11,000 genes, using 51 biological replicates across our treatment combinations, has shown that the demethylating agent 5-aza-dC has very widespread effects on patterns of DNA methylation in the <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> genome. The methylome has been characterised in <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pegoraro et al (2016)</xref>, and in common with other insect species, DNA methylation appears to be primarily associated with gene bodies (including intron-exon boundaries), and a rather low proportion of CpGs are methylated. As mentioned above, previous work that has attempted to confirm the effects of 5-aza-dC on DNA methylation have had mixed results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pegoraro et al (2016)</xref> confirmed the effects of 5-aza-dC across five genes (four via a qPCR MethylQuant assay and one via cloning a fragment of the <italic>msn</italic> gene from treated versus untreated individuals), whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ellers et al (2018)</xref> have recently failed to show any effects of 5-aza-dC on the methylation status of 155 CpGs across ten genes (nine of which provided libraries; they used high-throughput bisulfite amplicon sequencing: BSAS; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Redshaw et al. 2014</xref> for a discussion of different methylation quantification assays). Our larger-scale study has both confirmed the action of 5-aza-dC as a disruptor of methylation in <italic>Nasonia</italic>, but also suggested why it might be so difficult to pin down those effects. In particular, we find that whilst we see statistically significant main effects of exposure regime on DNA methylation (which includes differences in length of exposure), we also see effects of tissue type (albeit at the crude level of heads versus bodies), and collection time. Moreover, we also see many statistically significant interactions between these factors; all told, the action of 5-aza-dC is likely to be context-dependent, both in terms of the sequences more likely to be targeted but also in terms of the experimental details, including target tissues. Nonetheless, our results strongly suggest that 5-aza-dC is not chemically inert in terms of influencing DNA methylation in <italic>Nasonia</italic> &#x2013; indeed, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>That the effects of 5-aza-dC are non-random in terms of the genes it influences are further confirmed by our gene ontology enrichment analyses. We see enrichment for genes associated with DNA binding, regulation of transcription, and transcription factor activity. These processes are of interest given that we might expect the regulation of transcription to be a crucial component of the epigenetic role of DNA methylation, given what we know from both mammals and insects, even though the targets (throughout the genome versus exons) and outcomes (transcriptional silencing versus stable gene expression) are typically different in the two taxa. Our analysis certainly confirms the sequence-specific action of 5-aza-dC seen in other species.</p>
<p>A further important effect we see is that 5-aza-dC exposure can result in hyper-methylation as well as hypo-methylation. This means that the characterisation of 5-aza-dC as a strictly demethylating agent may be somewhat misleading. The complexity of outcomes of 5-aza-dC in mammals, in particular in terms of trying to understand its action for cancer treatments, is becoming increasingly well-appreciated (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Seelan et al 2018</xref>). As such, our data confirm in an insect what is being seen in mammalian cells. We are not well placed to speculate on the mechanism(s) by which 5-aza-dC may lead to hyper-methylation (see instead <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Seelan et al. 2018</xref>), even though its hypomethylating effect is well characterised chemically (see Introduction). However, if 5-aza-dC disrupts the regulation of the DNA methylation machinery itself, for instance in terms of how the Dnmt genes are expressed and act, then the downstream outcomes could be both hyper&#x002D; and hypo-methylation. Perhaps related to this, in their study of DNA methylation and the control of the diapause response in <italic>Nasonia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pegoraro et al (2016)</xref> used both 5-aza-dC and RNA interference (RNAi) to manipulate methylation, in the latter case disrupting DNA methylation by knocking down both Dnmt1a and Dnmt3. Whilst both 5-aza-dC and the RNAi constructs influenced how diapause was influenced by exposure to short or long day length, they did so in different ways. Whilst both manipulations abolished the day-length response, the RNAi of Dnmt1a and Dnmt3 resulted in a change in how wasps responded to long-day length (increasing the diapause response), whilst 5-aza-dC led to a change on response to short-day length (decreasing the diapause response). As such, different manipulations of DNA methylation may lead to different phenotypic outcomes, depending on the regulatory causes and consequences of the methylation pattern itself. More generally then, it is clear that there is much that remains to be elucidated in how 5-aza-dC shapes methylation patterns, in both insects and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Seelan et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>On a more technical note, perhaps unsurprisingly we found more significant genes in the GO enrichment analysis using the GO terms for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> orthologs. This is perhaps because of the more detailed gene ontology information available for the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome. Nonetheless, the two analyses provide a similar story in terms of GO enrichment. In addition, the majority of our analyses were undertaken at the level of the gene. Perhaps given the variation in coverage at the level of individual CpGs, the clustering analyses were not by any means as clear cut as the gene-level results. However, in the t-SNE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1</xref>), the control replicates cluster together, albeit within the broader distribution of the other two exposure treatment groups. The effect of genomic and sequence context may be particularly relevant here: our analysis at the level of the gene (see Methods for details) brings together CpGs that share a lot of context, by virtue of being associated with a given genetic locus. The differences in the clustering at the individual CpG versus gene levels may therefore represent the fact that the action of 5-aza-dC does appear to be non-random, and that we gain clarity when we consider closely associated CpGs whose patterns of methylation, and responses to 5-aza-dC, are more similar than randomly chosen CpGs across the genome.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results suggest that 5-aza-dC remains a potential tool for evolutionary ecologists wishing to explore how DNA methylation influences phenotypic expression. As with all genomic approaches however, no one approach gives all the answers. 5-aza-dC may prove a very useful, if rather blunt, tool for first assessing the range of phenotypes that are influenced by methylation status, whilst no doubt more targeted knock-downs and genetic manipulations will be needed to link phenotypes to causal CpGs.</p>
