<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons migrate to form the laterally-located substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) and medially-located ventral tegmental area (VTA), but little is known about the underlying cellular and molecular processes. Reelin signaling regulates tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons, but whether Reelin acts directly on SN-mDA neurons and how it affects their cellular morphology and migratory behavior has not been explored. Here we visualize the dynamic cell morphologies of tangentially migrating SN-mDA neurons with 3D-time-lapse imaging and identify two distinct migration modes. Slow migration is the default mode in SN-mDA neurons, while fast, laterally-directed migration occurs infrequently and is strongly associated with bipolar cell morphology. By speci1cally inactivating Reelin signaling in mDA neurons we demonstrate its direct role in SN-mDA tangential migration. We show that Reelin signaling promotes laterally-biased movements in mDA neurons during their slow migration mode, stabilizes leading process morphology and increases the probability of fast, laterally-directed migration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain (mDA neurons) are the major source of dopamine in the mammalian brain. Dysfunction in the dopaminergic system is associated with schizophrenia, addiction and depression, and degeneration of mDA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) results in the motor symptoms of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grace and Bunney (1980)</xref></italic></bold>, <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Volkow and Morales (2015)</xref></italic></bold>, <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Przedborski (2017)</xref></italic></bold>. mDA neurons originate in the 2oor plate of the ventral mesencephalon, from where they migrate to cluster into the laterally-positioned SN, the medially-located ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the posterior retrorubral 1eld. SN-mDA neurons project predominantly to the dorsal striatum and modulate voluntary movement <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Weisenhorn et al. (2016)</xref></italic></bold>, while VTA-mDA neurons project to various forebrain targets, including the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala, and are important for the regulation of cognitive function and reward behavior <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Morales and Margolis (2017)</xref></italic></bold>. How this anatomy is set up during development remains unclear.</p>
<p>mDA neurons differentiation starts at embryonic day (E) 10.5 in the mouse, when the 1rst mDA neurons that express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis and a marker for differentiated mDA neurons, leave the ventricular zone of the ventral midbrain. Differentiated mDA neurons undergo a maturation process as they migrate to reach their 1nal positions <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaess and Ang (2015)</xref></italic></bold>. We have previously shown that both SN- and VTA-mDA neurons undergo radial migration into the mantle layer of the developing ventral midbrain where they remain intermingled until E13.5. Between E13.5 and E15.5, mDA neurons destined for the SN migrate tangentially to more lateral positions, resulting in the segregation of mDA neurons into the laterally-located SN and the medially-situated VTA <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bodea et al. (2014)</xref></italic></bold>. This particular migration pattern suggests that SN-mDA neurons have the speci1c molecular machinery to respond to cues in their environment that direct their lateral migration. As exempli1ed by migration studies in cortical brain areas, a comprehensive characterization of migratory modes and accompanying changes in cell morphology is indispensable for unraveling the molecular mechanisms by which cell-type speci1c migratory behavior is regulated <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kriegstein and Noctor (2004)</xref></italic></bold>. So far, a detailed understanding of mDA neuronal migratory behavior has remained elusive due to challenges in visualizing migrating mDA neurons in suZcient detail.</p>
<p>At the molecular level, Reelin, an extracellular matrix molecule and known regulator of neuronal migration in various brain areas, is essential for the correct lateral localization of SN-mDA neurons. Reelin binds to its receptors APOER2 and VLDLR, and induces the phosphorylation of the intracellular transducer DAB1 <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hiesberger et al. (1999)</xref></italic></bold>, <bold><italic>T<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">rommsdorff et al. (1999)</xref></italic></bold>. Phosphorylated DAB1 then mediates Reelin signaling by regulating cell adhesive properties or cytoskeletal stability <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chai et al.

In mice homozygous for null alleles of <italic>Reelin</italic> (<italic>reeler</italic>) or <italic>Dab1 (scrambler</italic> or <italic>Dab1null</italic>), in <italic>Vldlr/Apoer2</italic> double knockout mice, or in organotypic slices in which Reelin signaling is blocked, SN-mDA neurons do not reach their 1nal positions in the ventrolateral midbrain and accumulate instead in the area of the lateral VTA <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bodea et al. (2014)</xref></italic></bold>, <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Vaswani and Blaess (2016)</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kang et al.

(2013)</xref></italic></bold>. Whether Reelin affects tangential (lateral) mDA neuronal migration directly, or whether the failure of SN-mDA neurons to reach their 1nal position in Reelin pathway mutants is due to alterations in glia 1bers or neighboring neuronal populations has not been explored. Moreover, it is not understood how the loss of Reelin signaling alters dynamic migration processes of mDA neurons and which of the multiple signaling events downstream of Reelin plays a role in mDA neuronal migration.</p>
<p>Here, we dissect the complex dynamic morphological changes that underlie the tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons using 2-photon excitation time-lapse imaging and a semi-automated data analysis pipeline. We 1nd that mDA neurons migrate in two modes: infrequent laterally-directed fast migration and frequent slow movement. We demonstrate that migrating mDA neurons undergo dynamic changes in cell morphology and show that fast, directed migratory spurts are strongly associated with bipolar morphology. Combining conditional gene inactivation, genetic fate mapping and time-lapse imaging, we demonstrate that Reelin affects mDA neuronal migration in a direct manner and promotes fast, laterally-directed migration of mDA neurons and stabilizes their leading process morphology.</p>

To examine whether this phenotype is recapitulated in <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO mice, we compared the mediolateral distribution of TH<sup>&#x002B;</sup> mDA neurons in coronal midbrain sections of control, <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (genotype: <italic>Dab1</italic><sup><italic>del</italic>/<italic>del</italic></sup> <italic>)</italic> mice at postnatal day (P)21-P30 and embryonic time points (E15.5 and E18.5)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig1S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-Figure supplement 3</xref>). We focused our analysis on intermediate rostrocaudal sections of the TH<sup>&#x002B;</sup> mDA domain where the most severe defects in mediolateral distribution of mDA neurons are observed in <italic>reeler</italic> and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bodea et al.

In both the <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, mDA neurons failed to reach lateral positions in the SN and settled in more medial locations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-J</xref>; (<xref rid="fig1S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-Figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, a few mDA neurons were aberrantly located dorsal to the VTA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-E, G-I</xref>). As the shift in the mediolateral distribution of mDA neurons observed in <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brains was similar, we conclude that Reelin acts directly on SN-mDA neurons to regulate their lateral migration.</p>
<p>We then asked whether such a direct function of Reelin is consistent with the localization of Reelin protein. During the time window of SN-mDA tangential migration (before E15.5), <italic>Reelin</italic> mRNA is expressed in the red nucleus, which is located dorsomedial to SN-mDA neurons. Whether Reelin protein is localized close to migrating SN-mDA neurons during this period has not been investigated <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bodea et al.

Immunostaining for Reelin at E13.5 and E14.5 con1rmed strong expression of the protein in the region of the red nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C,E,F</xref>). At E13.5 and E14.5, Reelin protein, but not <italic>Reelin</italic> mRNA, was also observed ventral and lateral to the red nucleus, including the area where the most lateral mDA neurons are localized at these stages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-G</xref>). Thus, the localization of Reelin protein at E13.5-E14.5 is consistent with a direct role of Reelin signaling in SN-mDA neuronal migration.</p>

<title>Reelin signaling contributes to the segregation of SN- and VTA-mDA neurons into separate clusters</title>
<p>Given that SN-mDA neurons fail to form the lateral SN in the absence of Reelin signaling, we asked whether Reelin signaling is important for the segregation of SN- and VTA-mDA neurons into separate clusters.

Hence, the inactivation of Reelin signaling in mDA neurons results in an ectopic medial location of SN-mDA neurons and a partial mixing of the two populations at what would constitute the SN-lateral VTA border in control brains.</p>

<title>Time-lapse imaging of tangentially migrating mDA neurons reveals diverse migratory behaviors across a population of neurons, and in individual neurons across time</title>
<p>Having established the direct requirement of Reelin signaling in the tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons, we visualized their migration in the presence and absence of Reelin, thereby dissecting out the precise migratory behaviors regulated by Reelin signaling.

<p>To characterize the whole range of migratory behaviors within the time window of imaging, we acquired 3D volume images of slices every 10 minutes, and tracked soma positions of a large number of neurons (806 neurons from 3 control slices, 844 neurons from 3 <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> slices).

<p>The role of Reelin signaling has been studied extensively in the cortex and hippocampus. However, only few studies have examined Reelin function in regulating the speed of migrating neurons.

</fig>
<p>We then asked whether this shift towards lower max-speeds in <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> SN-mDA neurons was accompanied by other changes in migratory behavior, or whether the neurons simply displayed lower max-speeds while maintaining the same migratory, directional and morphological characteristics as control SN-mDA neurons. To answer this question, we compared variation in soma speed over time, migratory direction and cell morphology of control and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mDA neurons with similar max-speeds. For this analysis, we divided control and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neurons into four groups based on the lower and upper quartiles of the <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> max-speed distribution. We de1ned these groups in the following manner: non-migratory cells with max-speeds of less than 10 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr (control = 126/806, <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> = 205/844), &#x2018;slow&#x2019; cells with max-speeds from 10-30 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr (control = 355/806, <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> = 430/844), &#x2018;moderate&#x2019; cells with max-speeds from 30-60 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr (control = 186/806, <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>= 139/844) and &#x2018;fast&#x2019; cells with max-speeds &#x003E; 60 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr, control = 139/806, <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> = 70/844) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Non-migratory cells failed to move more than 1.7 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m in any two consecutive frames of analysis and were not included into the further analysis. Thus, a lower percentage of SN-mDA neurons reached moderate or fast migration speeds in Dab1-/- slices compared to controls, increasing the proportion of both non-migratory and &#x2018;slow&#x2019; cells.</p>
<p>Next, we asked how frequently migrating SN-mDA neurons moved with soma speeds comparable to their max-speeds and whether the fraction of total time-points spent in high migratory speeds was different in control and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> populations. To evaluate this, we used the criteria previously de1ned for max-speeds, but applied them to individual soma speeds for each cell at each time point. For example, we analyzed the fraction of time (percentage of total time-points) spent by each &#x2018;fast&#x2019; cell with a soma speed of more than 60 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr (fast migratory phase), 30-60 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr (moderate migratory phase), 10-30 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr (slow migratory phase) and less than 10 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr (resting phase). In control slices, &#x2018;fast&#x2019;, &#x2018;moderate&#x2019; and &#x2018;slow&#x2019; cells spent a predominant fraction of time at rest (62.6 &#x002B;/-20&#x0025;; 68.5 &#x002B;/-18.2&#x0025;, 85.7 &#x002B;/-11.1&#x0025;, respectively) and were frequently in a slow migratory phase (26.8 &#x002B;/-17.4&#x0025;, 25.1 &#x002B;/-16.3&#x0025;, 14.2 &#x002B;/- 11.1&#x0025;, respectively). &#x2018;Fast&#x2019; and &#x2018;moderate&#x2019; cells achieved the moderate migratory phase in only a few frames (5.5 &#x002B;/- 5.5&#x0025; and 6.3 &#x002B;/- 3.9, respectively), and the fast migratory phase (only in &#x2018;fast&#x2019; cells) was equally infrequent (5.5 &#x002B;/-2.2&#x0025;) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> B, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> - Figure supplement 1). The amount of time SN-mDA neurons of the same max-speed group spent in the resting phase or in the respective migratory phases was comparable between individual cells in control and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> slices (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> - Figure supplement 1D-F).</p>
<p>In summary, these results demonstrate that SN-mDA migration has two distinct modes: a frequent slow migration phase seen in all migrating SN-mDA neurons and an infrequent moderate-to-fast phase occurring in a subset of SN-mDA neurons. These phases are superimposed over frequent periods of rest. Reelin signaling increases the proportion of migratory mDA neurons and the likelihood of moderate-to-fast movements in migrating mDA neurons. As moderate-to-fast migratory phases are only attained in very few frames in our slices, the average speed distribution of SN-mDA neurons are however not changed in <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> compared to control slices.</p>

<title>directed cell displacements</title>
<p>We next asked whether max-speeds and directionality of migration were linked. We computed directionality as the ratio of total displacement (the 3D displacement between the initial and 1nal positions of the neurons) to path length (the distance travelled by each neuron summed up irrespective of direction) <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Petrie et al. (2009)</xref></italic></bold> for migrating SN-mDA populations in control and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> slices. A high value of directionality (maximum value = 1) indicates almost no change in migratory direction while low values indicate frequent changes in direction. We found that directionality as well as total displacement generally increased with increasing max-speeds in SN-mDA populations from both control and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> slices (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-F</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> - Figure supplement 2). These data indicate that the infrequent moderate-to-fast movements in SN-mDA neurons result in major contributions to the directed migration of these cells. Since Reelin signaling increases the fraction of SN-mDA neurons that are able to undergo moderate-to-fast movements, Reelin supports directed migration of mDA neurons on a population level.</p>

<title>Reelin promotes preference for laterally-directed migration in mDA neurons</title>
<p>As tangential migration ultimately results in SN-mDA migration away from the midline, we analyzed the trajectories of migratory SN-mDA neurons in the presence and absence of Reelin signaling.

We de1ned three morphological categories: a neuron was considered to be &#x2018;bipolar-unbranched&#x2019; when a maximum of two processes arose directly from the soma and the LP was unbranched. Bipolar cells that extended a branched LP were de1ned as &#x2018;bipolar-branched&#x2019;. Neurons with more than two processes arising from the soma were de1ned as &#x2018;multipolar&#x2019; (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A,C</xref>; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> &#x2013; Figure supplement 1).

<p>To investigate whether speci1c morphologies observed in SN-mDA neurons were associated with speci1c migratory speeds, we broke down the morphology of these cells into time points during which they were in bipolar-unbranched, bipolar-branched or multipolar phases (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> A,C, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> &#x2013; Figure supplement 1) and paired their morphology with soma speed (as calculated by change in soma position between the current and the subsequent time point). Bipolarity was predominant in all phases of migration, but in both control and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> SN-mDA neurons, fast and moderate migratory phases were almost exclusively associated with bipolar morphology.

<title>Reelin downstream signaling in the ventral midbrain</title>
<p>As it is not known which downstream components of the Reelin signaling pathway regulate SN-mDA tangential migration, we investigated Reelin signaling events that were previously shown to in2uence neuronal polarity in migrating neurons in the cortex, hippocampus or spinal cord.

PI3K activation results in phosphorylation (activation) of LIMK1 (Lim domain kinase 1) via Rac1/Cdc42 and PAK1.

However, it does not modulate tangential migration directly but rather acts as a detachment signal that regulates the switch form tangential chain migration to radial migration <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hack et al. (2002)</xref></italic></bold>. Evidence for a direct function of Reelin signaling in tangential neuronal migration comes from sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. In these neurons, Reelin has been shown to stabilize LPs via the phosphorylation of Co1lin 1 during tangential migration thereby preventing aberrant migration <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kr&#x00FC;ger et al.

<p>To explore whether Reelin has a direct role in tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons, we inactivated <italic>Dab1</italic> in SN-mDA neurons starting at the onset of their tangential migration without affecting their earlier radial migration step and without inactivating <italic>Dab1</italic> in other cell populations in the ventral midbrain. The similarity in mediolateral distribution of SN-mDA neurons in <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and in <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO implies that Reelin signaling has a direct effect on migrating SN-mDA neurons. We also con1rmed that the GIRK2-expressing mDA population, which consists of lateral VTA- and SN-mDA neurons was distributed in a similar manner than what we reported previously for <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bodea et al.

Investigation of additional markers that label SN-mDA neurons more speci1cally, such as <italic>Lmo3</italic> and SOX6, showed that the medially misplaced SN-mDA neurons were partially intermingled with VTA-mDA neurons. These results imply that in absence of Reelin signaling in mDA neurons, the separation of SN- and VTA-mDA neurons is not fully completed and SN-mDA neurons lose their ability to undergo the long-range tangential migration necessary to form the laterally-positioned SN. Thus, our 1ndings are the 1rst demonstration of Reelin as a direct regulator of tangential neuronal migration in the brain.</p>

<title>Reelin protein is localized in the lateral ventral midbrain</title>
<p>In the ventral midbrain, <italic>Reelin</italic> mRNA is restricted to the cells of the red nucleus at E13.5 and E14.5 <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bodea et al.

Thus, the Reelin protein distribution that we describe here is consistent with a direct role of Reelin in regulating SN-mDA migration. Whether the red nucleus is the only source for Reelin in the ventral midbrain or whether there are additional sources remains to be investigated.

<title>Reelin promotes the proportion of mDA neurons undergoing fast, directed migration</title>
<p>The visualization and tracking of a large population of migrating mDA neurons, and the subsequent categorization of the instantaneous soma speed of individual mDA neurons into slow, moderate and fast phases revealed that irrespective of their max-speed, mDA neurons spent a majority of their time at rest. During their migratory phase, mDA neurons move mostly at slow speed. Moderate-to-fast laterally-directed migration spurts that result in large displacements are infrequent and occur in only a subset of labeled mDA neurons during the time-window of imaging. Thus, mDA neurons migrate in two modes: in a frequent, slow mode and in infrequent, fast movements with a strong lateral orientation. A similar pattern of migration with variable instantaneous speeds and periods of rest has also been reported for newly generated granule cells in the dentate gyrus and for cortical projection neurons <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sim&#x00F3; et al. (2010)</xref></italic></bold>, <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al. (2018)</xref></italic></bold>.</p>
<p>Comparing mDA tangential migration in the presence and absence of Reelin signaling, we observed that the duration of the individual migratory phases as well as average speed distribution of mDA neurons was comparable between control and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> slices, while the likelihood of moderate-to-fast migration events was decreased in mDA neurons in <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> slices. In addition, a higher proportion of mDA neurons spent the entire imaging period at rest. Hence, Reelin promotes the likelihood with which moderate-to-fast migration spurts occur and increases the proportion of cells that enter a migratory phase.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the increased presence of activated DAB1 in cortical projection neurons as a consequence of reduced ubiquitylation and degradation in absence of the E3 ubiquitin Ligase Cullin-5 leads to the opposite effect in the migratory behavior of these neurons: periods of rest are decreased and average as well as instantaneous speed is increased at late stages of cortical migration (E16.5) <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sim&#x00F3; et al. (2010)</xref></italic></bold>. This would be consistent with the role of Reelin that we observe in the migration of mDA neurons.

(2016)</xref></italic></bold>. Observation of cortical projection neurons in their multipolar-to-bipolar transition phase at E15.5 suggests yet another effect of Reelin: at this stage cortical neurons were observed to migrate faster in the absence of Reelin signaling while addition of exogenous Reelin slowed down migrating neurons, but only within the subventricular zone <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Britto et al.

<title>Reelin signaling promotes stable morphologies in SN-mDA neurons</title>
<p>We show that moderate and fast movements of mDA neurons are strongly associated with bipolar morphologies both in control and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> slices. Bipolarity is still predominant in slow phases, but about a third of the slow phases are associated with a multipolar morphology. In control slices, more than half of mDA neurons maintain a bipolar morphology throughout the imaging period, while about 40&#x0025; transition between multipolar and bipolar morphologies. Only a small subset of cells (about 10&#x0025;) stays multipolar at all time points. In absence of Reelin signaling, the percentage of transitionary cells is signi1cantly increased, and the proportion of stable bipolar cells is decreased. Interestingly, the increase in the proportion of transitionary cells in <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> slices is particularly pronounced in the cell population that does not reach moderate-to-fast migration speeds and that is signi1cantly more isotropic (data not shown) suggesting a correlation between loss of anisotropy in these cells and increased transitioning between bipolar and multipolar morphology. In transitionary cells of <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> slices, there is a signi1cant increase in branch transitions at the soma and LP, a sign of decreased branch stability. Moreover, the length of the LP is signi1cantly more variable in <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> than in control neurons. Thus, Reelin signaling appears to promote stability of morphologies once they have been adopted at speci1c phases of migration in mDA neurons.</p>
<p>In cortical neurons, Reelin appears to have multiple effects on cell morphology. In dissociated cortical neuronal cultures, Reelin signaling results in an increase in 1lopodia formation, likely via activation of Cdc42 <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Leemhuis et al. (2010)</xref></italic></bold>.Moreover,in presence ofexogenous Reelin in organotypic slice cultures, projection neurons in the ventricular zone display a greater proportion of multipolar morphology, a phenotype concomitant with reduced migratory speeds (see above, <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Britto et al. (2013)</xref></italic></bold>). In contrast, LP morphology of migrating cortical neurons is comparable in presence and absence of Reelin signaling when these neurons 1rst contact the marginal zone of the cortex, but Reelin signaling is required to maintain this morphology and a stable LP during the 1nal somal translocation step of these neurons <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chai et al.

Finally, a recent study showing the phosphorylation of DAB1 via the Netrin receptor deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) has reported an increase in multipolar neurons in the subventricular zone of <italic>Dcc</italic> knockout cortex <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al. (2018)</xref></italic></bold>. In summary, depending on location, concentration, and sub-cellular localization, Reelin and DAB1 can have differing effects on the morphology of migrating neurons.</p>
<p>An indirect regulation of morphology by Reelin signaling has been reported in tangentially-migrating cortical interneurons. In interneurons, branching of LPs aids in precise sensing of the extracellular environment during chemotaxis <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Martini et al.

Since interneurons do not directly require Reelin signaling for their migration, it is likely that their aberrant morphology in the <italic>reeler</italic> cortex is an indirect effect of their altered position. As we observe similar effects on cell morphology in <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mDA neurons, the aberrant mDA neuronal morphology may be a consequence of an increased necessity to scan the environment for guidance cues in ectopic medial positions rather than a direct downstream effect of Reelin.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Here we provide a detailed characterization of the migratory modes and cellular morphologies underlying SN-mDA tangential migration to gain a detailed understanding of SN formation. We demonstrate that Reelin directly regulates lateral, tangential migration of mDA neurons by stabilizing the morphology of mDA neurons, by promoting lateral anisotropy in small, slow movements and by increasing the frequency of laterally-directed moderate-to-fast migration events that cover larger distances. We thus present new mechanistic insight into how Reelin signaling controls tangential migration and regulates the formation of the SN and open the door to further investigations of the molecular mechanisms of mDA migration.</p>

<p>Pregnant dams were sacri1ced by cervical dislocation. Embryos were dissected in ice cold PBS. Heads (E13.5 &#x2013; E15.5) or brains (E16.5 &#x2013; E18.5) were 1xed in 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 2 &#x2013; 3 hrs at room temperature (RT). Adult mice were anesthetized with iso2uorane, perfused transcardially with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by 4&#x0025; PFA. Tissue was cryopreserved in OCT Tissue Tek (Sakura), embryonic tissue was cryosectioned at 14 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m, adult brains were cryosectioned at 40 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m thickness. Immunostaining was essentially performed as previously described <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blaess et al. (2011)</xref></italic></bold>.</p>
<p>For immunostainings, sections were 1xed brie2y in 4&#x0025;PFA (5 min at RT), followed by 1 hr incubation in 10&#x0025; NDS in 0.1&#x0025; Triton in PBS (0.1&#x0025; PBT).

<title>Speed and trajectories of migrating mDA neurons</title>
<p>To prevent any bias in selection of cells for tracking, and to track a large number of neurons in 3D in our two-photon time lapse datasets, we used the semi-automatic plugin TrackMate in Fiji <bold><italic>T<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">inevez et al.

Soma detection was carried out using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) detector in TrackMate. The soma detected by the TrackMate plugin were automatically linked across time, in 3D, by using the linear assignment problem (LAP) tracker in TrackMate <bold><italic>T<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">inevez et al.

After automatic tracking, the track scheme view in TrackMate was used to check the accuracy of each track by eye. Spurious tracks were deleted and missed detections were added using the manual tracking mode in TrackMate. Excel 1les from the TrackMate plugin were imported into MatLab <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wu et al. (2015)</xref></italic></bold>. 3D soma velocity was obtained at every time point (in units of <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr) of the analysis (starting t = 10 min) as the change in soma position vector between the previous frame and the current frame, divided by the time duration (0.167 hr) between frames (code modi1ed from <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wu et al. (2015)</xref></italic></bold>). This data was used to generate probability histograms for average soma speed, maximum soma speed, time spent at rest (de1ned as soma speed &#x003C; 10 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/ hr), time spent in slow migration (soma speed between 10 and 30 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/ hr), time spent in medium-fast migration (30-60 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr) and time spent in fast migration (soma speed &#x003E; 60 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/ hr). Categories for rest, slow, medium-fast and fast speeds were de1ned for the purpose of easy visualization of data, and were based on 25&#x0025; percentile (10 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr) and 75&#x0025; percentile speeds (30 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr) of <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> population.</p>
<p>Cell trajectory angles were measured in 2D as the angle between midline (positive y-axis in the image) and the line joining the 1rst and 1nal soma positions. Cells that moved with maximum speeds of less than 10 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>m/hr were excluded from the trajectory analysis as they were categorized as being at rest. Statistics on trajectory angles were performed with CircStat: a MatLab toolbox <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berens (2009)</xref></italic></bold>.</p>
<p>Only cells for which the soma were detected at all time points of imaging were included in the analysis.

<title>Morphology analysis of migrating mDA neurons</title>
<p>We restricted our morphological analysis to n= 150 control (70 fast, 40 medium-fast and 40 slow cells), and 129 <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>(49 fast, 40 medium-fast and 40 slow) cells. We observed that <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells continuously extended neurites in slices and this made it diZcult to unambiguously assign processes to individual cells as imaging progressed. Hence, we examined the morphology of each cell, in 3D, for the 1rst 18 frames of imaging. Cell soma was de1ned as the spot detected/assigned to the cells in the TrackMate plugin. Analysis was done manually, by rendering individual neurons in 4D (3D projection over all time frames) in ImageJ, and recording the number of primary processes (arising from the soma) and secondary processes at each time point. A cell was de1ned as bipolar when fewer than two processes were observed arising directly from the soma. The appearance/ disappearance of any branch was regarded as a branch transition. At each time point, the morphology of the cell, and the number of branch transitions, was manually annotated to the spot position data of the cell in excel sheets exported from TrackMate. In addition, 20 control and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells were randomly chosen for tracing in 3D. These neurons were traced manually in simple neurite tracer (SNT) plugin of Fiji <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Longair et al. (2011)</xref></italic></bold>. Tracings were carried out, at each time point individually, for the 1rst 18 frames of imaging. Fills of traced neurons were generated semi-automatically in the SNT plugin. Fill thickness was decided by eye but was maintained across all time points for a cell. Maximum intensity projections were also generated for the 3D segmentation 1lls. SNT traces were also used to measure length of the leading process in 3D.</p>

<p><bold>Movie 1. Time lapse imaging with 2 photon excitation of <italic>ex vivo</italic> embryonic slices of the ventral midbrain.</bold></p>
<p>Time-lapse imaging of control (left) and <italic>Dab1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> (right) organotypic slices with mosaic labelling of SN-mDA neurons reveal aberrant orientation and slower migration of <italic>Dab1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mDA neurons.</p>
<p><bold>Movie 2. SN-mDA neurons display dynamic cell morphology.</bold></p>
<p>3D projection of a transitionary mDA neurons at t = 0 min (360&#x00B0; rotation) followed by MIP frames of the same neuron at subsequent time-points. Migratory spurts only occur in bipolar morphology while cell remains stationary or displays slow migration during multipolar phase.</p>
<p><bold>Movie 3. Morphology as detected by YFP mosaic labelling is similar to morphology detected by TH antibody.</bold></p>
<p>Example SN-mDA neuron from fixed, cleared whole-mount embryonic brain of the same age as used in me-lapse experiments (E14.5) shows similar morphology with YFP (green) and TH (magenta) immunostaining.</p>
