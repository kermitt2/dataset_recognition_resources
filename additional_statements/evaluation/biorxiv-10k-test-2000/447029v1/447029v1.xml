<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Clinical observation shows emergence agitation and hyperactivity during the induction and/or recovery of anesthesia. However, an animal model to illustrate this clinical phenomenon has not been established. We therefore set out to investigate whether sevoflurane, a commonly used anesthetic, could alter locomotion in the mice during the induction and recovery of anesthesia. The activity of mouse was recorded 5 minutes before, during (for 30 minutes) and 40 minutes after the administration of anesthetic sevoflurane [1-, 1.5- and 2-fold minimum alveolar concentration] at 37&#x00B0; C. The total walking distance and velocity of movement were measured and quantified as the indexes of locomotion. We found that the anesthetic sevoflurane increased the locomotion of the mice during the induction of the anesthesia. During the recovery phase after anesthesia, the mice exhibited increased locomotion for a short period of time (about 5 minutes) and then displayed a sharp decrease in mobility for up to 60 minutes following the end of anesthesia administration. The anesthetic sevoflurane did not significantly alter the food intake and body weight of the mice. Furthermore, we found that Alzheimer&#x2019; s disease transgenic mice exhibited a greater sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity than the wild-type mice did. Our results showed that inhalation of the anesthetic sevoflurane induced an acute hyperactivity in mice, particularly among Alzheimer&#x2019; s disease transgenic mice. These findings from the pilot studies established an animal model to promote further studies into postoperative emergence agitation, hyperactivity and the underlying mechanisms of these conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sevoflurane is one of the most commonly used general anesthetics. Despite its merits, several clinical studies have reported the emergence agitation and hyperactivity after the administration of sevoflurane, particularly for pediatric patients who exhibit the incidence of emergence agitation up to 80&#x0025;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, the transient state of marked irritation and disassociation was observed during the transition from unconsciousness to complete wakefulness or following discontinuation of anesthesia in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Specifically, clinical investigations have shown that sevoflurane can induce hyperactivity during mask induction, even causing body movements, epileptiform electroencephalographic activity, seizure-like movements and actual seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Such events pose a risk of injury and potential postoperative complications. However, the causes, underlying mechanisms and targeted intervention(s) of such clinical observations remain unknown.</p>
<p>Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have showed that, particularly during the early stages of AD, neuronal circuits are hyperactive instead of hypoactive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, which could lead to key changes in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Interestingly, sevoflurane has been shown to promote AD-associated apoptosis, Tau protein phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and &#x03B2;-amyloid protein accumulation (A&#x03B2;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, the major pathological hallmarks of AD neuropathogenesis, in cultured cells and in animals. Previous studies have assessed the effects of sevoflurane on neurotoxicity in wild-type (WT) and AD transgenic (Tg) mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, the acute behavioral change in locomotion following the administration of the anesthetic sevoflurane has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to establish a system to assess the acute effects of sevoflurane on locomotion in mice. The hypothesis in the current studies was that the anesthetic sevoflurane increased locomotion in mice. We further compared the effects of the sevoflurane-induced changes between the WT and AD Tg mice.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Animal use was conducted in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines and regulations. The Massachusetts General Hospital Standing Committee on the Use of Animals in Research and Teaching (Boston, Massachusetts) has approved the animal protocol. Animals were kept in a temperature-controlled (22&#x2013;23&#x00B0;C) room under a 12-h light/dark period (light on at 7:00 AM); standard mouse food and water were available ad libitum. Housing was provided with appropriate tactile, olfactory, visual, and auditory stimuli. Every effort was made to minimize the number of mice that were used in experiments. The study was performed on WT C57BL/6J and AD Tg 9 month-old female mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME). The AD Tg mice were purchased from Jackson Lab (B6SJL Tg APPSwFlLon,PSEN1&#x002A;M146L&#x002A;L286V)6799Vas/Mmjax; Stock Number: 006554), and maintained in our own laboratory. Standard genotyping techniques were used to confirm the condition of AD Tg mice. All efforts were made to minimize suffering of the animals.</p>

<title>Anesthesia in mice</title>
<p>Prior to carrying out the experiments, we familiarized the mice to the transparent gas-tight plastic chamber (20 &#x00D7; 20 &#x00D7; 15 cm) by placing each of them, without anesthesia, into the chamber for 10 minutes once per day for 3 consecutive days. The experiments were conducted between 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. Then, the mice were placed into the chamber and exposed to sevoflurane for 30 minutes (for locomotion activity assessment), for 4-hours (for food intake and gain weight assessment) or to the control condition. We used air containing 40&#x0025; O<sub>2</sub>/60&#x0025; N<sub>2</sub> as a carrier, the total gas flow was 2 1/min. During the exposure to anesthesia, the mice were kept warm on a plate heated to 37&#x00B0;C with a white colored background. Control and experimental animals were exposed to the same environmental conditions except that the control animals were exposed only to air. The Dash 4000 monitor (GE Medical Systems information technologies INC., Wisconsion, USA) was used to determine the concentrations of sevoflurane.</p>

<title>Locomotion measurement</title>
<p>While their horizontal ambulatory activity was measured with the aid of a video-tracking system, the animals were allowed to move freely in the transparent gas-tight plastic chamber. This allowed us to measure all the required parameters offline in simple blind conditions using ImageJ Plugin. The mouse activity was recorded before (5 minutes in air as baseline tracks), during (30 minutes) and after the sevoflurane anesthesia (40-minutes recovery). Here, we used 1, 1.5- and 2-fold minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC), which correspond to 2, 3, and 4&#x0025; of sevoflurane respectively at 37&#x00B0; C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The total walking distance (in cm) and velocity (in cm/min) of movement were measured and quantified as indexes of hyperactivity.</p>
<p>Following the experimental session, the mice were carefully removed from the chamber, and returned to their home cage. The test equipment was cleaned with 50&#x0025; ethanol solution and dried between subjects in order to avoid olfactory cuing. A sample size of 4-9 mice was used for each group and all the mice were used only once.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Food intake and body weight</title>
<p>The food intake and body weight were measured after daily anesthesia exposure between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. Food and body weight were weighed from days 1 to 4 post-anesthesia. Food intake was calculated as the amount of food removed from the feeding bowl.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data are presented as mean values with standard error of the mean. The number of samples varied from 14 to 16 in each group for the measurement of food intake and weight changes. The number of mice used for measuring locomotion ranged from 3 to 7 in each group. Data analysis was conducted using the Origin 8.0 software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA). A student&#x2019; s t-test was used to determine the difference between the mice in anesthesia and control condition in terms of the walking distance and velocity. A one-way ANOVA was used to analyze the difference in food intake and weight change between mice in the control group and mice in the anesthesia group. Statistical significance was determined as p&#x003C;0.05.</p>

<title>Sevoflurane induced hyperactivity in mice</title>
<p>Sevoflurane has been reported to induce hyperactivity during the time of anesthesia induction and recovery from the anesthesia in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. To assess whether sevoflurane would induce hyperactivity in animals, we tracked the horizontal ambulatory activity before and during the induction of the sevoflurane anesthesia as well as after the sevoflurane anesthesia in each of the mice. The total walking distance (in cm) and velocity (in cm/min) of movement were measured offline in a simple blind condition using ImageJ Plugin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>, all the mice tested had similar baseline levels of velocity ranging from 100 to 130 cm/minute. However, the sevoflurane anesthesia markedly increased the locomotion during the time of the anesthesia induction compared with the control condition as evidenced by the 76&#x0025; increase in the velocity (194.42 &#x00B1; 47.23 versus 110.33 &#x00B1; 21.64 cm/min) and 45&#x0025; increase in the walking distance (447.95 &#x00B1; 58.26 versus 309.25 &#x00B1; 49.25 cm). During the recovery time of the anesthesia, however, there were short periods (within 5 minutes) of increased locomotion, which was followed by decreases in locomotion during the next 20 minutes in terms of velocity (45.86 &#x00B1; 14.38 versus 99.29 &#x00B1; 15.52 cm/min) and walking distance (165.91 &#x00B1; 49.26 versus 270.91 &#x00B1; 39.26 cm). The activity of mice recovered to the baseline level 60 minutes after the end of the sevoflurane anesthesia (data not shown).</p>

<p>Next, we tested the effect of sevoflurane on the locomotion at different concentrations ranging from 2, 3 to 4 &#x0025; (1-, 1.5- and 2-fold MAC). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that sevoflurane increased locomotion at all of the concentration levels tested. However, we did not observe a statistically significant difference among the different concentrations of sevoflurane on the hyperactivity in the induction phase or hypoactivity in recovery phase of the anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We noted that the higher concentrations of sevoflurane the mice received, the faster they fell asleep, shortening the duration of their hyperactivity and potentially preventing the possible concentration-dependent effect of sevoflurane on hyperactivity observed during the induction of the anesthesia.</p>

<title>The sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity was greater in AD Tg mice</title>
<p>Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence from mouse models and human patients have indicated that, particularly in early stages of AD, neuronal circuits are hyperactive instead of hypoactive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, which could lead to key complications in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, we questioned how sevoflurane-induced movement in AD Tg mice.</p>
<p>To answer this question, we performed further experiments using AD Tg mice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that the sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity in AD Tg mice was greater than that of the WT mice (342.60 &#x00B1; 42.43 cm/min for AD Tg mice versus 247.94 &#x00B1; 36.83 cm/min for WT mice). Given the findings that the baseline velocity of mice was different, we calculated the ratio of locomotion of 2&#x0025; sevoflurane to baseline levels in each mouse, graphing out the normalized parameters to show the results of locomotion in AD Tg mice and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). We found that the ratios of velocity and walking distance were still significantly higher in AD Tg mice as compared to those in WT mice (velocity: 3.30 &#x00B1; 0.37 versus 1.76 &#x00B1; 0.34; walking distance &#x003D; 2.92 &#x00B1; 0.47 versus 1.63 &#x00B1; 0.48, p &#x003C; 0.05, student&#x2019; s t-test). Taken together, these data showed that the exposure to sevoflurane increased the locomotion in WT and AD Tg mice, with a greater increase in the AD Tg mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By measuring the velocity and walking distance at baseline levels, we examined the locomotion of the mice under sevoflurane-induced anesthesia. The data showed that sevoflurane, at clinically-relevant concentrations, induced hyperactivity during the induction phase and hypoactivity during the recovery phase of the anesthesia in the WT mice. Moreover, AD Tg mice showed greater hyperactivity following the sevoflurane anesthesia.</p>
<p>Our finding is also in line with the clinical observation that several general anesthetics, especially sevoflurane, induce emergence agitation and hyperactivity in patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, previous studies showed sevoflurane at 1&#x0025; had the ability to activate hippocampal CA3 kainate receptors to induce neuronal hyperactivity, which was measured by electrophysiology, during induction and recovery of the anesthesia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Whether the sevoflurane-induced activation of hippocampal CA3 kainate receptor contributes to the sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity, however, is not known. The future studies to test this hypothesis are warranted.</p>
<p>Moreover, the data showed that the sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity in AD Tg mice was greater than that observed in WT mice. Hyperactivity has been reported in patients with AD, which is associated with functional and structural alterations in a distributed network of brain regions supporting memory and other cognitive domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Evidence that brain hyperactivity occurs in early or pre-symptomatic AD has also been reported. Bookheimer et al., for example, noted that middle aged and elderly people who were carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele, the genetic risk factor of AD, showed abnormally high activation in the hippocampus and other memory-related brain regions that are typically affected in AD during memory tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Putcha et al. found hyperactivity in the hippocampus among patients with mild cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, the paradox is that higher levels of hippocampal activity may drive AD disease progress and may be early indicators of AD-related neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Our data showed that sevoflurane induced greater hyperactivity in AD Tg mice than in WT mice. However, the exact the mechanism and the clinical relevance of such findings need to be further investigated.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. First, we did not demonstrate the concentration-dependent effects in the sevoflurane-induced hyperactivities. The exact reason is not clear at the present time. Our anesthetic delivery system did not allow the gas to immediately reach the expected concentrations (i.e. 2, 3 or 4&#x0025;). Therefore, there was a time of delay (&#x223C;40s) which could prevent the observation of the possible concentration-dependent effect of sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity. Second, the data were obtained in mice, and the clinical relevance of the sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity in the mice remains to be determined.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have provided the initial evidence that inhalation of the anesthetic sevoflurane induced an acute hyperactivity in the mice, particularly in the AD Tg mice. This novel observation of sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity would be helpful in the design of an animal model for future studies looking at emergence agitation and postoperative behavioral changes. Ultimately, these studies may promote further research into the mechanisms of anesthesia action and anesthesia neurotoxicity.</p>
