<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Microbial communities can perform biochemical activities that monocultures cannot. Controlling communities requires an understanding of community dynamics. Here, we mathematically predict the growth rate of an engineered community consisting of two <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, each releasing a metabolite required and consumed by the partner. Initial model parameters were based on strain phenotypes measured in batch mono-cultures with zero or excess metabolite, and failed to quantitatively predict experimental results. To resolve model-experiment discrepancy, we chemically identified the correct exchanged metabolites, but this did not improve model performance. We then re-measured strain phenotypes in chemostats mimicking the metabolite-limited community environments, while mitigating or incorporating effects of rapid evolution. Almost all phenotypes we measured varied significantly with the metabolite environment. Once we used parameters measured in community-like chemostat environments, prediction agreed with experimental results. In summary, using a simplified community, we uncovered, and devised means to resolve, modeling challenges that are likely general.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multi-species microbial communities are ubiquitous. In a community, member species <italic>interact</italic> in that one species alters the physiology of another species. Consequently, communities often display community-level properties not achievable by member species in isolation. For example, a community assembled from six intestinal bacterial species, but not any of the individual species alone, clears <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. As another example, a two-species community is required for efficient industrial production of Vitamin C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Thus, even simplified communities of a small number of species can be useful for biotechnology applications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>An important community-level property is community dynamics, including how species abundance changes over time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Community dynamics can be predicted using statistical correlation models. For example, community dynamics observed over a period of time can be used to construct a model which correlates the abundance of one species with the growth rate of another, and the model can then be used to predict future dynamics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However even for two-species communities, statistical correlation models might generate false predictions on species coexistence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, mathematical models based on species interaction mechanisms should avoid the pitfalls of statistical correlations, but species interactions are generally difficult to identify <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Genome-scale metabolic models use genome sequences, sometimes in conjunction with RNA and protein expression profiles, to predict metabolic fluxes within species as well as metabolic fluxes among-species (i.e. metabolic interactions) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, these models face multiple challenges including unknown protein functions or metabolic fluxes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Even when interaction mechanisms are known <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, often a fraction of model parameters are &#x201C;free&#x201D; (unmeasured) due to difficulties in measuring parameters. The values assigned to free parameters are generally &#x201C;guesstimates&#x201D; or literature values &#x201C;borrowed&#x201D; from a different strain or even a different species, and can vary by orders of magnitude <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Using free parameters may work for qualitative modeling, but often not for quantitative modeling. If there are no free parameters, then model-experiment disagreements would suggest that important pieces are missing in either the model or the experiments.</p>
<p>Previously, we have constructed and mathematically modeled an engineered yeast community CoSMO (<underline>Co</underline>operation that is <underline>S</underline>ynthetic and <underline>M</underline>utually <underline>O</underline>bligatory) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. CoSMO consists of two differentially-fluorescent, non-mating haploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>; Fig 1-Table Supplement 1). One strain, designated <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, cannot synthesize adenine because of a deletion mutation in the <italic>ADE8</italic> gene, and over-activates the lysine biosynthetic pathway due to a feedback-resistant <italic>LYS21</italic> mutation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The other strain, designated <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, requires lysine because of a deletion mutation in the <italic>LYS2</italic> gene, and over-activates the adenine biosynthetic pathway due to a feedback-resistant <italic>ADE4</italic> mutation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Overproduced metabolites in both strains are released into the environment, which are consumed by the partner. In minimal medium lacking adenine and lysine supplements, the two strains engage in obligatory cooperation. Released metabolites are rapidly consumed and thus are present at very low concentrations in CoSMO.</p>

<caption><title>Model-experiment discrepancy in CoSMO growth dynamics</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) CoSMO comprises two non-mating, cross-feeding yeast strains expressing different fluorescent proteins. Here, we use the lysine-mediated interaction as an example to illustrate interaction-initiating and interaction-responding phenotypes. (<bold>B</bold>) A mathematical model of well-mixed CoSMO. For example, [<italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>], the density of <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, increases due to cell birth (which is a function of lysine concentration <italic>L</italic>) and decreases due to cell death. Lysine concentration <italic>L</italic> increases due to release by <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, and decreases due to consumption coupled to <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> birth. (<bold>C</bold>) Model-experiment discrepancy. In experiments (squares; data listed in Fig 1-Table Supplement 2), <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> and <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> growing exponentially in excess lysine or adenine were washed and preconditioned (&#x201C;Strain culturing and preconditioning&#x201D; in Methods). They were mixed at 1:1 in SD at time zero to form CoSMO, which was then cultured in a well-mixed environment and diluted as needed to ensure that no other nutrients were limiting. Population dynamics were tracked using flow cytometry (&#x201C;Flow cytometry&#x201D; in Methods), and dilutions were taken into account when calculating accumulative cell densities. CoSMO initially grew slowly (prior to grey dotted line), and then grew faster. We simulated CoSMO population dynamics (dotted lines; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Fig 1-Code Supplement 1</xref>) using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref>-4 (<bold>B</bold>) where parameters were measured in batch cultures (Fig 1-Table Supplement 2). Models i and ii differed in that the release rates of the two strains were &#x201C;borrowed&#x201D; from our previous measurements in the S288C background (Model i) or directly measured in the RM11 background (Model ii).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>We have formulated a differential equation model of the CoSMO dynamics (e.g. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref>-4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Population growth is dictated by cell birth (which in turn depends on the concentration of the required metabolite) as well as cell death, while metabolite concentration is dictated by release and consumption. Model parameters correspond to strain phenotypes including metabolite release rate, metabolite consumption per birth, and cell birth and death rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Even though these phenotypes reflect strain interactions (&#x201C;interaction phenotypes&#x201D; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>), we measured them in mono-cultures to eliminate partner feedback. In our earlier studies, we quantified some of these phenotypes and borrowed other from literature values <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Our models correctly predicted various properties of CoSMO, including the steady state strain ratio <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> as well as qualitative features of spatial patterning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the current study, we aim to predict CoSMO growth rate (the rate of total population increase), a measure of how likely the community can survive periodic dilutions such as those in industrial fermenters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Our initial model predictions of CoSMO growth rate significantly deviated from experimental measurements. In the process of resolving this model-experiment discrepancy, we have uncovered and overcome multiple challenges. Since these challenges are likely general, our work serves as a &#x201C;roadmap&#x201D; that can be applied to quantitative modeling of other simplified microbial communities.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Experimentally, CoSMO growth followed a reproducible pattern: after an initial lag marked by slow growth, the two populations and thus the entire community grew at a faster rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>, &#x201C;Experiment&#x201D;). The latter growth rate eventually reached a steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7d">Fig 7-Figure Supplement 4A</xref>, bottom panels). We wanted to quantitatively predict CoSMO&#x2019;s post-lag steady state growth rate (&#x201C;growth rate&#x201D;), with the criterion that model prediction should fall within experimental error bars. To predict community growth rate, we either quantified it from simulated community dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>, dotted lines), or calculated it from an analytical formula (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Eq. 15</xref> or 16 in Methods &#x201C;Calculating steady state community growth rate&#x201D;), with similar results (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Fig 1-Figure Supplement 1</xref>). The analytical formula suggests that community growth rate is affected by metabolite release rate, metabolite consumption per birth, and death rate.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Initial models based on batch-culture parameters poorly predict community growth rate</title>
<p>Our first model (Model i) under-estimated community growth rate. Unlike the published strains of <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> and <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> in the S288C background <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, strains in this study were constructed in the RM11 background to reduce mitochondrial mutation rate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, we had to consider re-quantifying strain phenotypes. For each RM11 strain, we measured death rate during starvation using a microscopy batch culture assay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We also quantified the amount of metabolite consumed per birth in batch cultures grown to saturation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref> for details), similar to our earlier work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Since release rates were tedious to measure, we &#x201C;borrowed&#x201D; published release rates of <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> and <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> in the S288C background in batch starved cultures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Predicted community growth rates were much slower than experimental measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref> &#x201C;Model i&#x201D;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref> grey).</p>
<p>A revised model (Model ii) without any borrowed parameters over-estimated community growth rate. For this model, we directly measured the release rates of RM11 <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> and <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> in batch starved cultures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref> and B for details). The release rates of both strains in the RM11 background were &#x007E;3-fold higher than those in the S288C background (Fig 1-Table Supplement 2). Concomitantly, the predicted community growth rate greatly exceeded experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1 C</xref>, &#x201C;Model ii&#x201D;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref> blue).</p>

<title>Identifying interaction mediators</title>
<p>One possible cause for the model-experiment discrepancy could be that cells engineered to overproduce adenine or lysine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> might instead release derivatives of adenine or lysine. Consequently, when we quantified phenotypes such as metabolite consumption, we could have supplemented the wrong metabolite and been misled. A genome-scale metabolic model of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> predicted that although <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> likely released lysine, <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> likely released hypoxanthine or adenosine-(3,5)-biphosphate instead of adenine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (nanoDESI MS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> performed by Julia Laskin lab revealed a lysine gradient emanating from <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> and hypoxanthine and inosine gradients emanating from <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, although the signals were noisy (data not available, but see below).</p>
<p>Indeed, lysine mediates the interaction from <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> to <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>.

In HPLC, a compound in <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> supernatant eluted at the same time as the lysine standards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>), and its concentration could be quantified by comparing the peak area against those of lysine standards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref> inset). In bioassay, we quantified the total lysine-equivalent compounds in an <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> supernatant by growing <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> in it and comparing the final turbidity with those of minimal medium supplemented with lysine standards. HPLC quantification agreed with the yield bioassay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). Thus, lysine-equivalent compounds released by <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> were primarily lysine.</p>

<title>Rapid evolution during chemostat measurements of strain phenotypes</title>
<p>Model-experiment discrepancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>) could be caused by phenotypes being quantitatively different when measured in batch cultures containing zero or excess metabolite versus in the metabolite-limited CoSMO-like environments. Thus, we re-measured strain phenotypes in chemostats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> that mimicked CoSMO environments. Specifically in a chemostat, fresh medium containing the required metabolite (lysine or hypoxanthine) was pumped into the culturing vessel at a fixed rate (&#x201C;dilution rate&#x201D;), while cell-containing medium exited the culturing vessel at the same rate (Methods, &#x201C;Chemostat culturing&#x201D;). After an initial adjustment stage, live population density reached a steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>) which meant that the population grew at the same rate as the dilution rate (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 5</xref>-9 in Methods) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. By setting chemostat dilution rate to various growth rates experienced by CoSMO (i.e. 5.5&#x007E;8 hr doubling), we mimicked the environments experienced by CoSMO and measured strain phenotypes. However, as we demonstrate below, rapid evolution occurred during measurements and needed to be mitigated or incorporated in experiments and in modeling.</p>

<title>Live L-A&#x002B; releases hypoxanthine upon lysine limitation</title>
<p>Metabolites can be released by live cells or leaked from dead cells. We want to distinguish between live versus dead release for the following reasons. First, if death rate were to evolve to be slower, then live release would predict increased metabolite supply whereas dead release would predict the opposite. Second, dead release would imply non-specific release and thus cell-cell interactions may be highly complex. Finally, leakage from dead cells is thermodynamically inevitable, whereas active release of costly molecules would require an evolutionary explanation.</p>
<p>Hypoxanthine is likely released by live <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>.

If live cells released hypoxanthine, then hypoxanthine should increase linearly with live cell density integrated over time (i.e. the sum of live cell density&#x002A;hr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref> Left), and the slope would represent the live release rate (fmole/cell/hr). If cells released hypoxanthine upon death, then hypoxanthine should increase linearly with dead cell density, and the slope would represent the amount of metabolite released per cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref> Right). Since the live release model explained our data better than the dead release model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>), hypoxanthine was likely released by live cells during starvation. In lysine-limited chemostats, we could not use dynamics to distinguish live from dead release (note the mathematical equivalence between <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4a">Eqs. 8a</xref> and 8b in Methods &#x201C;Quantifying phenotypes in chemostats&#x201D;). Instead, we harvested cells and chemically extracted intracellular metabolites (Methods, &#x201C;Extraction of intracellular metabolites&#x201D;). Each <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> cell on average contained 0.12 (&#x002B;/&#x2212;0.02, 95&#x0025; CI) fmole of hypoxanthine (Methods, &#x201C;HPLC&#x201D;).

Spatial CoSMO growth rates measured under a variety of experimental setups (e.g. agarose geometry and initial total cell density) remained consistent (0.11&#x00B1; 0.01/hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref> purple; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7d">Fig 7-Figure Supplement 4</xref>).

<p>Steady state growth rate of well-mixed CoSMO was calculated from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Eq. 15</xref> or <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn12">Eq. 16</xref> (with nearly identical results) when we &#x201C;borrowed&#x201D; release rates from a different strain background in starved batch culture (grey; Model i in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>), when all parameters were measured from the correct strain background in starved batch cultures (blue; Model ii in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>), and when all parameters were measured from the correct strain background in chemostats (green; Model iii). A partial differential equation model (i.e. the spatial version of Model iii) was simulated for spatial CoSMO under various experimental configurations, yielding similar predictions on spatial CoSMO growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7c">Fig 7-Figure Supplement 3</xref>). The average value was plotted here (brown). In simulations, CoSMO grew at a similar rate in a spatially-structured environment as in a well-mixed environment. This is because in spatial CoSMO, concentrations of metabolites eventually became uniform in the agarose and in the community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7e">Fig 7-Figure Supplement 5</xref>), and because the two strains formed small (tens of microns) patches that were inter-mixed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussions</title>
<p>Microbial communities are often complex, and thus it is difficult to understand how community-level properties emerge from interactions among member species. Here, using a highly simplified community growing in a well-controlled environment, we illustrate challenges in quantitative modeling and means to overcome them.</p>
<p>Even when interactions are engineered and thus genetic determinants are known, interaction mediators can be non-trivial to identify. In CoSMO, we previously thought that adenine was released by <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, whereas in reality, hypoxanthine and inosine are released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). Fortuitously, hypoxanthine but not inosine affects <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2a">Fig 2-Figure Supplement 1</xref>). Otherwise, we might be forced to quantify how hypoxanthine and inosine, in isolation and in different combinations, might affect <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>. Even though faster growth of <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> in adenine than in hypoxanthine does not affect our prediction of CoSMO growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2b">Fig 2-Figure Supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1a">Fig 1-Figure Supplement 1</xref>), it could affect predictions on other community properties.</p>
<p>Another obstacle for model building and testing is rapid evolution during quantification of species phenotypes and community properties. For <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, mutants pre-exist at a low frequency, but they can grow several-fold faster than the ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3b">Fig 3-Figure Supplement 2</xref>). Consequently, a population will remain largely (&#x003E;90&#x0025;) ancestral only for the first 24 hours in the well-mixed chemostat environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>). A short measurement time window poses additional challenges if, for example, the released metabolite has not accumulated to a quantifiable level. Takeover by fast-growing mutants can be impeded by growing cells in a spatially-structured environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7b">Fig 7-Figure Supplement 2</xref>). For <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, mutants are generated from ancestral cells at an extremely high rate during phenotype quantification (Methods, &#x201C;Evolutionary dynamics of mutant <italic>A-L</italic>&#x002B;&#x201D;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3d">Fig 3-Figure Supplement 4</xref>). Since similar levels of mutants also accumulate in CoSMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3d">Fig 3-Figure Supplement 4B</xref>), we can account for evolutionary effects by using similar quantification time windows for <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> phenotypes and for CoSMO growth rate. Thus, unless we are extremely careful, we may not even know what we are measuring. The evolutionary phenomena here are likely common: Given the large population size of microbial populations, pre-existing mutants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> could quickly take over upon drastic environmental shifts. Eventually, evolving communities could be modeled, although replicate communities could evolve divergently <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Many mathematical models &#x201C;borrow&#x201D; parameters from a different strain or even a different species. This practice can work for qualitative models or even quantitative models where parameter variations do not affect predictions. In the case of CoSMO, release rates from two genetic backgrounds differed by several-fold (Fig 1-Table Supplement 2). Thus, borrowing parameters could be problematic for quantitative modeling.</p>
<p>Most mathematical models assume invariant parameters. As we have demonstrated here, phenotypes (e.g. metabolite consumption per birth, metabolite release rate, and death rate) measured in zero or excess metabolite can differ dramatically from those measured under metabolite limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig 4-Figure Supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7a">Fig 7-Figure Supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, even within the range of metabolite limitation experienced by CoSMO (doubling times of 5.4&#x007E;8 hrs), lysine release rate varies by as much as two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>), which could be caused by variable intracellular metabolite concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). Based on parameters measured in chemostats (including variable lysine release rate), Model iii prediction quantitatively agrees with experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Our work illustrates how a mathematical model can synergize with quantitative measurements. A model suggests which parameters need to be carefully measured. For example for spatial CoSMO growth rate, parameters such as diffusion coefficients are not critical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7c">Fig 7-Figure Supplement 3</xref>), but release rates and consumption are (Methods, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Eq. 15</xref>). Once key parameters have been measured, model-experiment discrepancy suggests important missing pieces. When predicting CoSMO growth rate, a missing piece is how phenotype parameters are affected by the growth environment.</p>
<p>Physiology, ecology, and evolution are clearly intertwined. Physiology impacts not only organisms&#x2019; evolutionary success, but also their ecological interactions with other community members. For example in quorum sensing, bacteria at a high cell density enter a different physiological state and release new chemical compounds or enzymes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. As another example, computational work suggests that metabolite secretion can be costly or costless to the secretors depending on the environmental context <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, it is not surprising that quantitative differences in physiology (e.g. growth rate) can impact the strength of an ecological interaction (metabolite release and consumption). Moreover, evolutionary changes and ecology affect organismal physiology. Thus, extending the &#x201C;ecology-evolution feedback&#x201D; concept <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, we advocate an integrated view of evolution, ecology, and physiology.</p>

Strains were stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C in 15&#x0025; glycerol.</p>
<p>We used rich medium YPD (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 20 g/L glucose) in 2&#x0025; agar plates for isolating single colonies. Saturated YPD overnight liquid cultures from these colonies were then used as inocula to grow exponential cultures.

We sterilized YPD media by autoclaving. YPD overnights were stored at room temperature for no more than 4&#x007E;5 days prior to experiments.</p>
<p>We used defined minimal medium SD (6.7 g/L Difco&#x2122; yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids, 20 g/L glucose) for all experiments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, with supplemental metabolites as noted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. To achieve higher reproducibility, we sterilized SD media by filtering through 0.22 &#x03BC;m filters. To make SD plates, we autoclaved 20 g/L Bacto&#x2122; agar or agarose in H2O, and after autoclaving, supplemented equal volume of sterile-filtered 2XSD. CoSMO steady state growth rates on agar (which contains trace contaminants of metabolites) and agarose generate similar results.</p>

<p>All culturing, unless otherwise noted, was performed at 30&#x00B0;C in a well-mixed environment where culture tubes were inserted side-ways into a roller drum (New Brunswick Scientific, Model TC-7). <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> cells were pre-grown to exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> generally less than 0.4 in 13mm culture tubes, or &#x003C; 2.8&#x00D7;10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml) in SD supplemented with excess (164 &#x03BC;M) lysine and washed 3&#x007E;5 times with SD.

<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>We prepared fluorescent bead stocks (ThermoFisher Cat R0300, 3 &#x03BC;m red fluorescent beads). Beads were autoclaved in a factory-clean glass tube, diluted into sterile 0.9&#x0025; NaCl, and supplemented with sterile-filtered Triton X-100 to a final 0.05&#x0025; (to prevent beads from clumping). We sonicated beads and kept them in constant rotation to prevent settling. We quantified bead concentrations by counting beads via hemacytometer and Coulter counter. Final bead stock was generally 4&#x007E;8&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup>/ml.</p>
<p>Culture samples were diluted to OD 0.01&#x007E;0.1 (7&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup>&#x007E;7&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup>/ml) in Milli-Q H2O in unautoclaved 1.6ml Eppendorf tubes. 90 &#x03BC;l of the diluted culture sample was supplemented with 10 &#x03BC;l bead stock and 2 &#x03BC;l of 1 &#x03BC;M ToPro 3 (Molecular Probes T-3605), a nucleic acid dye that only permeates compromised cell membranes (dead cells). Sample preparation was done in a 96-well format for high-throughput processing.</p>
<p>Flow cytometry of the samples was performed on Cytek DxP Cytometer equipped with four lasers, ten detectors, and an autosampler. Fluorescent proteins GFP, Citrine, mCherry, TagBFP-AS-N (Evrogen), and ToPro are respectively detected by 50 mW 488 nm laser with 505/10 (i.e. 500&#x007E;515nm) detector, 50 mW 488nm laser with 530/30 detector, 75 mW 561nm Laser with 615/25 detector, 50 mW 408nm laser with 450/50 detector, and 25mW 637nm laser with 660/20 detector. Each sample was run in triplicates and individually analyzed using FlowJo<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> software to identify numbers of events of beads, dead cells, and various live fluorescent cells. Densities of various populations were calculated from the cell:bead ratios.

<title>HPLC</title>
<p>All HPLC measurements were done on a Shimadzu Nexera X2 series Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system. All supernatant samples were filtered (0.22 &#x03BC;m filter). For standards, we made a high-concentration solution, filtered it, and stored it at &#x2212;80 &#x00B0;C. Prior to an HPLC run, we diluted the stock to various concentrations in filtered H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p>To quantify lysine, 100 &#x03BC;l sample was loaded into an Agilent 250 &#x03BC;l pulled point glass small volume insert (Part No: 5183-2085), which was then placed inside a Shimadzu 1.5 ml 12&#x00D7; 32 mm autosampler vial (Part No: 22845450-91). This vial was then placed into an autosampler (Nexera X2 SIL-30AC). Prior to injection into the column, samples were derivatized at 25&#x00B0;C with freshly-made derivatization reagents in the autosampler using a programmed mixing method as following. 7.5 &#x03BC;l of sample was removed and placed into a separate reaction small volume insert and vial. Next, 45 &#x03BC;l of mercaptopropionic acid (10 &#x03BC;l per 10 ml 0.1 M sodium borate buffer, pH 9.2) and 22 &#x03BC;l of o-phthaladehyde (10 mg per 5 ml 0.1 M sodium borate buffer, pH 9.2) were added to this vial, mixed, and incubated for 1 minute. 10 &#x03BC;l of 9-fluorenyl methyl chloroformate (4 mg per 20 ml acetonitrile, HPLC grade) was then added and the sample was re-mixed and incubated for 2 minutes. Finally, 10 &#x03BC;l of the reaction mixture was injected onto Phenomenex Kinetex<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> 2.6 &#x03BC;m EVO C18 100 A LC Column (150 &#x00D7; 3.0 mm, Part No: 00F-4725-Y0) fitted with a SecurityGuard&#x2122; ULTRA Holder for UHPLC Columns (2.1 to 4.6 mm, Part No AJ0-9000) and a SecurityGuard&#x2122; ULTRA cartridge (3.0 mm internal diameter, Part No: AJ0-9297). SecurityGuard&#x2122; ULTRA cartridge (pre-column) was periodically replaced in the event of pressure reading exceeding the manufacturer&#x2019;s specifications.</p>
<p>Compounds were eluted from the column using a gradient of HPLC-grade Solution A (73 mM Potassium Phosphate, pH 7.2) and Solution B (50:50 acetonitrile/methanol). Solution A was filtered through a 0.2 &#x03BC;m filter prior to use. The &#x0025; solution B follows the following program: 0-2 minutes 11&#x0025;, 2-4 minutes 17&#x0025;, 4-5.5 minutes 31&#x0025;, 5.5-10 minutes 32.5&#x0025;, 10-12 minutes 46.5&#x0025;, and 12 - 15.5 minutes 55&#x0025;. The flow rate is maintained at 0.1 ml/minute. The column was then flushed with 100&#x0025; solution B for 5 minutes, and re-equilibrated for 5 minutes with 11&#x0025; solution B at 0.8 ml/min. The column was maintained at a running temperature of 35 &#x00B0;C in a Nexera X2 CTO-20A oven. Absorbance measurements at 338 nm were measured using a high sensitivity flow cell for a SPD-M30A UV-Vis detector.</p>
<p>For purines, we used the above protocol without the derivatization steps. Instead, 5&#x007E;10 &#x03BC;l sample was directly injected onto the column.</p>

<title>Bioassays</title>
<p>We used a yield bioassay for relatively high metabolite concentrations (&#x2265; 5 &#x03BC;M for lysine and &#x2265;2 &#x03BC;M for hypoxanthine). For lower concentrations, we used a rate bioassay with a sensitivity of 0.1 &#x03BC;M for both lysine and hypoxanthine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3a">Fig 3-Figure Supplement 1</xref>). When necessary, we diluted the sample to get into the assay linear range.</p>
<p>In the yield bioassay, 75 &#x03BC;l sample filtered through a 0.2 &#x03BC;m filter was mixed with an equal volume of a master mix containing 2&#x00D7; SD (to provide fresh medium) as well as tester cells auxotrophic for the metabolite of interest (&#x007E;1&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml, WY1335 for lysine or WY1340 for hypoxanthine) in a flat-bottom 96-well plate. We then wrapped the plate with parafilm and allowed cells to grow to saturation at 30&#x00B0;C for 48 hrs. We re-suspended cells using a Thermo Scientific Teleshake (setting #5 for &#x007E;1 min) and read culture turbidity using a BioTek Synergy MX plate reader. Within each assay, SD supplemented with various known concentrations of metabolite were used to establish a standard curve that related metabolite concentration to final turbidity (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2b">Fig 2-Figure Supplement 1A</xref>). From this standard curve, the metabolite concentration of an unknown sample could be inferred.</p>
<p>The rate bioassay was used for samples with low metabolite concentrations. For example, to measure lysine concentration in a lysine-limited chemostat, we mixed 150 &#x03BC;l filtered sample with an equal volume of master mix containing 2&#x00D7; SD and <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> tester cells (&#x007E;1&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml) in a flat-bottom 96-well plate. As our tester strain for lysine, we used an evolved clone (WY 2270) isolated after <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> had grown for tens of generations under lysine limitation. This clone displayed increased affinity for lysine due to an <italic>ecm21</italic> mutation and duplication of Chromosome 14. Growth rates of the tester strain in SD supplemented with various known concentrations of lysine and in the unknown sample were measured using a microscopy assay (Methods, &#x201C;Microscopy quantification of growth phenotypes&#x201D;). The growth rate of WY 2270 tester cells scaled linearly with lysine concentrations up to 1 &#x03BC;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3a">Fig 3-Figure Supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, for hypoxanthine, we used an evolved <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> strain (WY1600) as the tester strain. The linear range was up to &#x007E;0.3 &#x03BC;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3b">Fig 3-Figure Supplement 1B</xref>). From the standard curve, we could infer the metabolite concentration of a sample.</p>

<title>Extraction of intracellular metabolites</title>
<p>To extract intracellular metabolites, we poured a cell culture onto a 0.45 &#x03BC;m nitrocellulose membrane filter (BioRad, Cat# 162-0115) in a reusable filtration device (Southern Labware Product FHMA25, glass microanalysis 25mm vacuum filter holder with 15mL funnel), applied vacuum to drain the supernatant, transferred the filter into extraction solution (40&#x0025; acetonitrile, 40&#x0025; methanol, 20&#x0025; water), vortexed to dislodged cells, and then removed the filter. This sequence was carried out as rapidly as possible (&#x003C;10 seconds). We then flash-froze the extraction solution in liquid nitrogen, and allowed it to thaw at &#x2212;20&#x00B0;C. After thawing, we subjected the solution through 5 rounds of the following: vortexing for 1 minute, and incubating on ice for 5 minutes between each vortexing. We then spun down the solution in a refrigerated centrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 rpm to pellet ghost cells as well as any membrane filter bits that may have disintegrated into the extraction solution. We transferred the supernatant containing soluble cell extract to a new tube. In order to make sure that all soluble components were extracted, we re-suspended the cell pellet in a half-volume of fresh extraction solution and subjected cells through another round of the same procedure (flash-freezing, five rounds of vortexing-ice incubation, and centrifugation). We then removed the supernatant, and added it to the original supernatant. We then dried off the extraction solution in a centrifugal evaporator and re-suspended soluble components in water. This resultant solution could then be assayed for metabolite concentrations. When properly dried, extracts did not contain inhibitors that might interfere with bioassays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2c">Fig 2-Figure Supplement 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Microtiter plates were imaged periodically (every 0.5&#x007E;2 hrs) under a 10x objective in a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000U inverted fluorescence microscope. The microscope was connected to a cooled CCD camera for fluorescence and transmitted light imaging. The microscope was enclosed in a temperature-controlled chamber set to 30&#x00B0;C. The microscope was equipped with motorized stages to allow z-autofocusing and systematic xy-scanning of locations in microplate wells, as well as motorized switchable filter cubes capable of detecting a variety of fluorophores. Image acquisition was done with an in-house LabVIEW program, incorporating bright-field autofocusing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and automatic exposure adjustment during fluorescence imaging to avoid saturation. Condensation on the plate lid sometimes interfered with autofocusing. Thus, we added a transparent &#x201C;lid warmer&#x201D; on top of our plate lid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and set it to be 0.5&#x00B0;C warmer than the plate bottom, which eliminated condensation. We used an ET DsRed filter cube (Exciter: ET545/30x, Emitter: ET620/60m, Dichroic: T570LP) for mCherry-expressing strains, and an ET GFP filter cube (Exciter: ET470/40x, Emitter: ET525/50m, Dichroic: T495LP) for GFP-expressing strains.</p>
<p>Time-lapse images were analyzed using an ImageJ plugin Bioact2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Bioact2 measured the total fluorescence intensity of all cells in an image frame after subtracting the background fluorescence from the total fluorescence. A script plotted background-subtracted fluorescence intensity over time for each well to allow visual inspection. If the dynamics of four positions looked similar, we randomly selected one to inspect. In rare occasions, all four positions were out-of-focus and were not used. In a small subset of experiments, a discontinuous jump in data appeared in all four positions for unknown reasons. We did not calculate rates across the jump. Occasionally, one or two positions deviated from the rest. This could be due to a number of reasons, including shift of focal plane, shift of field of view, black dust particles, or bright dust spots in the field of view. The outlier positions were excluded after inspecting the images for probable causes. If the dynamics of four positions differed due to cell growth heterogeneity at low concentrations of metabolites, all positions were retained.</p>
<p>We normalized total intensity against that at time zero, and averaged across positions. We calculated growth rate over three to four consecutive time points, and plotted the maximal net growth rate against metabolite concentration (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2b">Fig 2-Figure Supplement 2</xref>). If maximal growth rate occurred at the end of an experiment, then the experimental duration was too short and data were not used. For <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, the initial stage (3&#x007E;4 hrs) residual growth was excluded from analysis. For <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, since cells had already been pre-starved, fluorescence intensity did not continue to increase in the absence of supplements.</p>
<p>For longer <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> imaging (30&#x002B; hr), we observed two maximal growth rates at low hypoxanthine concentrations (e.g. &#x007E;0.4 &#x03BC;M) possibly due to mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3c">Fig 3-Figure Supplement 3</xref>). We used the earlier maximal growth rate even if it was lower than the later maximal growth rate, since the latter was probably caused by faster-growing mutants.</p>

<title>Chemostat culturing</title>
<p>We have constructed an eight-vessel chemostat with a design modified from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. For details of construction, modification, calibration, and operation, see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>, due to rapid evolution, we tried to devise experiments so that live and dead populations quickly reached steady state. Two conditions seemed to work well. In both, we first calculated the expected steady state cell density by dividing the concentration of lysine in the reservoir (20 &#x03BC;M) by fmole lysine consumed per new cell. Condition 1: Wash exponentially-growing cells to completely remove any extracellular lysine and inoculate the full volume (19 ml) at 100&#x0025; of expected steady state density. Start chemostat to drip in lysine at the pre-specified flow rate. Condition 2: Wash exponentially growing cells to remove extracellular lysine and inoculate 50&#x0025;&#x007E;75&#x0025; of the volume at 1/3 of the expected steady state density. Fill the rest of the 19ml vessel with reservoir media (resulting in less than the full 20 &#x03BC;M of starting lysine, but more than enough for maximal initial growth rate, &#x007E;10-15 &#x03BC;M). The two conditions yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>). We predominantly used Condition 2.</p>
<p>We set the pump flow rate to achieve the desired doubling time <italic>T</italic> (19ml&#x002A;ln(2)/T). We collected and weighed waste media for each individual culturing vessel to ensure that the flow rate was correct (i.e. total waste accumulated over time <italic>t</italic> was equal to the expected flow rate&#x002A;<italic>t</italic>). We sampled cultures periodically to track population dynamics using flow cytometry (Methods, &#x201C;Flow cytometry&#x201D;), and filtered supernatant through a 0.45 &#x03BC;m nitrocellulose filter and froze the supernatant for metabolite quantification at the conclusion of an experiment (Methods, &#x201C;Bioassays&#x201D;). At the conclusion of an experiment, we also tested input media for each individual culturing vessel to ensure sterility by plating a 300 &#x03BC;l aliquot on an YPD plate and checking for growth after two days of growth at 30&#x00B0;C. If a substantial number of colonies grew (&#x003E;5 colonies), the input line was considered contaminated and data from that vessel was not used.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> cells exponentially growing in SD&#x002B;100 &#x03BC;M hypoxanthine were washed and prestarved for 24 hrs. We then filled the chemostat culturing vessel with starved cells in SD at 100&#x0025; of the expected starting density and pumped in fresh medium (SD&#x002B; 20 &#x03BC;M hypoxanthine) to achieve the desired doubling time.

<title>Quantifying phenotypes in chemostats</title>
<p>We illustrate how we quantify release rate, consumption amount per birth, and death rate in chemostats, using <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> as an example.

<disp-formula id="eqn1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="356519_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>

<p>Dead cell density [<italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup> <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>]<sub><italic>dead</italic></sub> is increased by death and decreased by dilution
<disp-formula id="eqn2"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="356519_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<italic>L</italic>, lysine concentration in the culturing vessel, is increased by the supply of fresh medium (at concentration <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub>), and decreased by dilution and consumption (with each birth consuming <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> amount of lysine).
<disp-formula id="eqn3"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="356519_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Finally, hypoxanthine concentration <italic>A</italic> is increased by release (either from live cells at <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> per live cell per hr or from dead cells at <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>A</italic>,<italic>d</italic></sub> per death), and decreased by dilution.

</disp-formula></p>
<p>Note that at the steady state (denoted by subscript &#x201C;<italic>ss</italic>&#x201D;), net growth rate is equal to dilution rate (setting <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 5</xref> to zero):
<disp-formula id="eqn5"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="356519_eqn5.gif"/></alternatives>

<p>To measure metabolite consumed per cell at steady state, we set <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 7</xref> to zero
<disp-formula id="eqn6"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="356519_eqn6.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Here, the approximation holds because the concentration of lysine in chemostat (<italic>L</italic>) is much smaller than that in reservoir (<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) and because birth rate <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> is similar to dilution rate <italic>dil</italic>.</p>
<p>To measure death rate at steady state, we set <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 6</xref> to zero, and get
<disp-formula id="eqn7"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="356519_eqn7.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Thus, we can measure death rate by measuring the steady state dead and live population densities averaged over time.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can use both the pre-steady state and steady state chemostat dynamics to quantify release rate and death rate if these rates are constant.

The value of integral is always zero at <italic>t</italic>&#x003D;0.

<p>The two methods (using only the steady state data versus performing linear regression on the entire data range) yielded similar results. We have opted for the latter method since it takes advantage of pre-steady-state data.</p>

<p>To detect evolved clones in an <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> culture, we diluted it to &#x003C;1000 cells/ml and plated 300 &#x03BC;l on YPD plate and allowed colonies to grow for 2&#x007E;3 days. We randomly picked 20&#x007E;50 colonies to inoculate into YPD and grow saturated overnights.

We washed cells 3x with SD, starved them for 4-6 hours to deplete vacuolar lysine stores, and diluted each culture so that a 50 &#x03BC;l spot had several hundred cells. We spotted 50 &#x03BC;l on SD plate supplemented with 1.5 &#x03BC;M lysine (10 spots/plate), and allowed these plates to grow overnight.

Occasionally an intermediate phenotype was observed where smaller microcolonies with variable sizes formed, and this phenotype was counted as evolved as well. For a high-throughput version of this assay, we diluted YPD saturated culture 10,000x into SD and waited for 3 hrs at room temperature. We then directly spotted 50 &#x03BC;l on SD plates supplemented with 1.5 &#x03BC;M lysine.

<p>To detect evolved clones in an <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> culture, we took advantage of the observation that evolved clones with improved affinity for hypoxanthine grew slowly when hypoxanthine concentration was high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3c">Fig 3-Figure Supplement 3A</xref>).

We took an initial cell density reading of each sample by flow cytometry, wrapped tube caps in parafilm to limit evaporation, and incubated in a rotator at 30&#x00B0;C. Prep time (from the start of washing to the initial cell density reading) took approximately two hours, during which time the majority of residual growth had taken place. At each time point we measured live and dead cell densities by flow cytometry, and froze an aliquot of supernatant where supernatant had been separated from cells by filtering through sterile nitrocellulose membrane. We concluded the assay after approximately 24 hours, generally aiming for time points every six hours. At the conclusion of the assay, we quantified hypoxanthine concentration for each sample using the yield bioassay (Methods, &#x201C;Bioassays&#x201D;).

Libraries were pooled and multiplexed on a HiSeq2000 lane (Illumina) for 150 cycle pairedend reading. A custom analysis pipeline written in Perl incorporated the bwa aligner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> and samtools <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> for alignment file generation, GATK for SNP/indel calling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, and cn.MOPs for local copy-number variant calling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Finally, a custom Perl script using vcftools <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> was used to automate the comparison of an evolved clone with its ancestor. All called mutations were validated by visual inspection in the IGV environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Ploidy was calculated using custom python and R scripts. Read depth was counted for each base, and averaged within consecutive 1000-bp windows. Then, the average coverage of each 1000-bp window was normalized against the median of these values from the entire genome, and log<sub>2</sub> transformed. Transformed data were plotted as box-plots for each chromosome/supercontig.

<title>Calculating death rate in non-limited batch culture</title>
<p>We grew cells to exponential phase in SD &#x002B; excess supplements. While still at a low density (&#x003C;10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml), we measured live and dead cell densities using flow cytometry to yield <italic>dead/live</italic> ratio. Since the percentage of dead cells was small, we analyzed a large volume of sample via flow cytometry to ensure that at least 400 ToPro3-stained dead cells were counted so that the sampling error <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="356519_inline7.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> was no more than 10&#x0025;.

where <italic>b</italic> and <italic>d</italic> are respectively birth and death rates of cells.</p>

<p>Thus, the ratio of dead to live cells is the ratio of death rate to net growth rate.

<title>Quantifying spatial CoSMO growth dynamics</title>
<p>In all experiments, <italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> cells were grown to exponential phase in SD plus lysine, and washed free of lysine. <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> cells were grown to exponential phase in SD plus hypoxanthine, washed, pre-starved in SD for 24 hrs, and washed again. Pre-starvation was intended to deplete cellular hypoxanthine storage and to shorten CoSMO growth lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1b">Fig 1-Figure Supplement 2</xref>). We grew spatial CoSMO in two configurations: &#x201C;column&#x201D; versus &#x201C;spotting&#x201D;.</p>
<p>In the column setting, to prevent potential metabolite cross-contamination, we over-filled non-neighboring wells (i.e. 24 wells per deep 96-well plate) with 2&#x00D7;SD&#x002B;2&#x0025; agar, and covered the surface with a sterile glass plate to form a flat agar surface with no air bubbles. After solidification, we removed the glass plate and removed extra agar between filled wells using sterile tweezers. This results in agar depth of 3 cm. For the rest of the experiment, when not setting up or sampling, we covered the plate with a sterile lid, suspended above wells by thick toothpicks. We wrapped plates with parafilm to reduce agar drying. We mixed strains at a 1:1 ratio and filtered them through MF membrane (HAWP04700 from Millipore, Billerica, MA) to achieve 3000 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> density on the filter (see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> for details). We then punched 8 mm diameter disks and transferred one disk to each agarose well, resulting in &#x007E;1.5&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/disk. For each time point, we used tweezers (ethanol-flame sterilized between samples) to pick 2&#x007E;3 disks, and suspended each in water prior to flow cytometry measurements.</p>
<p>In the spotting setting, in an 85 mm petri dish we poured &#x007E;25ml 2&#x00D7;SD &#x002B; 2&#x0025; agarose &#x002B; a small amount of lysine (generally 0.7 &#x03BC;M to minimize the lag phase during CoSMO growth) to achieve an agar/agarose depth of 5mm. After solidification, we used a sterile blade to cut and remove &#x007E;2mm strips out of the agar to create six similarly sized sectors on the plate with no agarose connections between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7d">Fig 7-Figure Supplement 4A</xref>). We inoculated plates by spotting 15&#x03BC;l of strains at a 1:1 ratio onto plates to result in &#x007E;4&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/patch (4 mm inoculum radius). Cells were grown and sampled as in the column setting, except that we cut out the agarose patch containing cells, submerged it in water, vortexed for a few seconds, and discarded agarose.</p>
<p>For both setups, we used 9&#x00D7;10<sup>7</sup> total cells as a cutoff for CoSMO growth rate calculation. We used this cut-off because exponential CoSMO growth rate was observed beyond 9&#x00D7;10<sup>7</sup> total cells, suggesting that no other metabolites were limiting by then.</p>

<title>Simulating spatial CoSMO growth</title>
<p>We modified our previous individual-based spatial CoSMO model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> so that in each time step, metabolite consumption and release of each cell scaled linearly with cell&#x2019;s biomass to reflect exponential growth. The model used parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The release rate of lysine for each <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup> cell at each time-step was linearly interpolated based on the local concentration of hypoxanthine (Table 1-Table Supplement 4). We simulated CoSMO growth in two different settings: (1) cells were initially uniformly distributed on the surface of an agar column; (2) cells were initially spotted in the middle of an agar pad according to the experimental setup. The simulation domain used for setting (1) was 500 &#x03BC;m &#x00D7; 500 &#x03BC;m in the lateral x and y dimensions; for setting (2), the agarose domain was 800&#x007E;960 &#x03BC;m on each side (5 &#x03BC;m/grid), and the size of the inoculation spot was &#x00BC;&#x00D7;&#x00BC;&#x003D;1/16 of the agarose domain. In both (1) and (2) settings, the z dimension in simulation varied according to the experimental setup (5 mm &#x007E;3 cm). For metabolite diffusion within the community, we used either a single diffusion coefficient (D &#x003D; 360 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/s; Fig 7-Code Supplement 1) or two diffusion coefficients (<italic>D</italic> &#x003D; 360 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/s measured in agarose and <italic>D</italic> &#x003D; 20 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/s measured in yeast community <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7b">Fig 7-Code Supplement 2</xref>). Both codes are for spotting inoculation, but the inoculation spot can be increased to cover the entire surface. Regardless of the simulation setup, we obtained a similar steady state community growth rate.</p>

When we focus on doubling times between 5.5 to 8 hrs, a range experienced by CoSMO, then we arrive at the following correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref> green dotted line): <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> &#x003D;1.853-11.388<italic>g</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> where <italic>gA</italic> is the net growth rate of <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>&#x2212;</italic></sup><italic>L</italic><sup><italic>&#x002B;</italic></sup>.</p>

</disp-formula>
corresponding to a doubling time of 6.9 hrs.</p>
<p>To estimate the uncertainty in our prediction of <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>comm</italic></sub>, we use the variance formula for error propagation. Specifically, let <italic>f</italic> be a function of <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (<italic>i</italic>&#x003D;1, 2,&#x2026;, <italic>n</italic>).

<p>Thus, for each of the six parameters in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn12">Eq. 16</xref>, we divide its 95&#x0025; confidence interval (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) by 2 to obtain error <italic>s</italic>.

<p>Summing all terms and taking the square root, we have an error of 0.004 for <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>comm</italic></sub>. Thus, the 95&#x0025; confidence interval is &#x002B;/&#x2212; 0.01.</p>
<p>We did not calculate the uncertainty of our spatial simulation prediction, since we did not solve the spatial model analytically.

Dynamics of live and dead populations (left) and of released lysine (right) were plotted (squares, circles, and diamonds representing three chemostats). Model (dashed lines; Fig 6-Code Supplement 1) was based on parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, except for a lysine release rate of 0.99 fmole/cell/hr which was averaged among the three chemostats. The initial decline in live cell density in experiments was presumably due to a growth lag when cells transitioned from starvation to chemostats, which was not modeled. The initial decline in extracellular lysine concentration in experiments is consistent with the live release model: reduced live cell density leads to reduced extracellular lysine.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Spatial CoSMO eventually resembles well-mixed CoSMO.</title>
<p>Metabolite concentrations in the agarose and the community eventually reach a nearly uniform state. Plotted are top views of lysine (<italic>L</italic>) and hypoxanthine (<italic>A</italic>) concentrations in a CoSMO community at the agarose surface 120 hrs after being spotted in the middle of an agarose pad. Since the populations were fairly intermixed within the community <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, the overall metabolite distributions remained fairly uniform within the community. The spatial averages of <italic>L</italic> and <italic>A</italic> in the community were 1.35 &#x03BC;M and 0.79 &#x03BC;M, respectively. The average concentrations in the agarose (1.31 &#x03BC;M for <italic>L</italic> and 0.73 &#x03BC;M for <italic>A</italic>) closely matched those inside the community. Thus, CoSMO growth rate in a spatially-structured environment is similar to that in a well-mixed environment. Here, the diffusion coefficients inside CoSMO and agarose were 20 and 360 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/sec, respectively.</p></caption>
