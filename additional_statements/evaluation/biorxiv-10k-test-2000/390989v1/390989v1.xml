<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Cystic echinococcosis is caused by the metacestode of the zoonotic flatworm <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic>. Within the viscera of the intermediate host, the metacestode grows as a unilocular cyst known as hydatid cyst. This cyst is comprised of two layers of parasite origin: germinal and laminated layers, and one of host origin: the adventitial layer, that encapsulates the parasite. This adventitial layer is composed of collagen fibers, epithelioid cells, eosinophils and lymphocytes. To establish itself inside the host, the germinal layer produces the laminated layer, and to continue its life cycle, generates protoscoleces. Some cysts are unable to produce protoscoleces, and are defined as infertile cysts. The molecular mechanisms involved in cyst fertility are not clear, however, the host immune response could play a crucial role.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal fidings</title>
<p>We collected hydatid cysts from both liver and lungs of slaughtered cattle, and histological sections of fertile, infertile and small hydatid cysts were stained with haematoxylin-eosin. A common feature observed in infertile cysts was the disorganization of the laminated layer by the infiltration of host immune cells. These infiltrating cells eventually destroy parts of laminated layer. Immunohistochemical analysis of both parasite and host antigens, identify these cells as cattle macrophages and are present inside the cysts associated to germinal layer.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>This is the first report that indicates to cell from immune system present in adventitial layer of infertile bovine hydatid cysts could disrupt the laminated layer, infiltrating and probably causing the infertility of cyst.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cystic echinococcosis is caused by the zoonotic flatworm <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic>. Within the viscera of the intermediate host, mainly liver and lungs of herbivores such as cows and sheep as well as human beings, the parasite grows as a unilocular cyst known as hydatid cyst. These cysts develop in their inner chamber a structure known as protoscolex, when consumed by the definitive host (e.g. dogs), it grows into a worm that resides in the small intestine and produces eggs that contaminate the environment. In cattle, most hydatid cysts are unable to produce protoscoleces, and thus are termed infertile hydatid cysts. The molecular mechanisms that explain the causes of hydatid cyst infertility remain unknown. We routinely collected cattle hydatid cysts from both liver and lugs and processed them for histological analysis. We found that there is a subset of fertile hydatid cysts that have low protoscolex viability and high immune infiltration surrounding the cyst. All infertile cysts have high immune infiltration, and many of them show disruption of the laminated layer and immune cells of host origin inside the cyst. This is the first report that shows that the cyst can be infiltrated by the host immune system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a major zoonotic disease caused by infection with the metacestode stage (hydatid cyst) of the flatworm <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic>. It has a worldwide distribution with an estimated 4 million people infected and another 40 million at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. High parasite prevalence is found in Eurasia, Africa, Australia and South America. CE affects more severely South American countries characterized by extensive grazing livestock farming including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The life cycle of this parasite includes two mammal hosts. The definitive hosts are dogs and other canids; while ungulates and other mammals act as intermediate hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] such as sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, buffaloes, horses and camels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The most common infection targets are the liver and lungs because they are highly irrigated. Within these viscera, a unilocular cyst forms, that will grow gradually from 1 cm to 5 cm a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The hydatid cyst is circumscribed by a layer generated by the intermediate host in response to the parasite, named adventitial layer, which mainly consists of epithelial cells and connective tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The adventitial layer can have variable thickness and may present some focal fibrosis as result of host immune response that considers the cyst a foreign body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The lumen of the hydatid cyst is filled with the so called hydatid fluid and is surrounded by two layers of parasite tissue; the innermost layer is called germinal layer is cellular and is intimately attached to an acellular layer called laminated layer, the latter is in close contact with the adventitial layer. The germinal layer is composed by embryonic cells whose function is to elaborate the different elements of hydatid cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. These embryonic cells differentiate into buds that finally generate protoscoleces (PSC), the infectious parasite form for the definite host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The laminated layer is generated by the germinal layer and is described as a specialized extracellular matrix that is found only in the genus <italic>Echinococcus</italic>. Macroscopically, it is seen as a whitish membrane, formed by various layers of mucopolysaccharides and keratin, evolutionarily adapted to maintain the physical integrity of metacestodes and to protect the cells of the germinal layer from host immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In the intermediate host, it is possible to find two different types of hydatid cysts: fertile cysts, in which PSC are attached to the germinal layer and free into the hydatid fluid; and infertile cysts, without PSC. Infertile cysts are unable to continue with the parasite life cycle. The reason behind why two types of cysts are present remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. In many geographical areas, including Chile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], cattle has been associated with low fertile hydatid cysts counts (&#x003C;30&#x0025;) in both <italic>Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and <italic>Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], so it is a suitable model to study cyst infertility mechanisms. Our research team, so far has been working in understanding the causes of infertile hydatid cyst in cattle, identifying both higher apoptosis levels in germinal layer of infertile cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and different immunoglobulin profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Possible relations of the laminated and adventitial layers with fertility or infertility, however, have never been addressed. In this work, we present a systematic comparative study of both the laminated and adventitial layer in fertile and infertile hydatid cysts obtained from naturally infected cattle. Their morphohistological characteristics were described and compared, demonstrating the infiltration of host immune cells and providing evidences of their effect on and contribution to cyst integrity and fertility.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Sample collection, classification and genotyping</title>
<p>All bovine hydatid cyst samples were obtained at an abattoir in Santiago, Chile, as part of the normal work of the abattoir and with consent from both the veterinarians and the owners of the abattoir for sample collection. Both lung and liver samples were manually inspected by the official health office veterinarian and afterwards by our research team. This protocol study was approved by the Universidad Andres Bello Bioethics Board (protocol number 016/2016). For each positive viscera, the hydatid cysts were removed and placed in a sealed plastic bag and were stored at 4&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>In the laboratory, each hydatid cyst was assigned a number, the hydatid fluid was aseptically aspirated and the cyst was opened along the longer axial plane. A sample of the germinal layer was observed in a conventional light microscope to determine if the cyst was either fertile or infertile. PSC viability was determined with trypan blue staining, and samples with viability lower than 90&#x0025; were classified as low viability. Since smaller cysts (&#x003C;1 cm in diameter) are still developing and have not started producing PSC, they were classified as &#x201C;small cysts&#x201D;. After the cyst fertility assessment, a sample of the cyst wall containing all three layers was fixated in Glyo-Fixx&#x2122; and embedded in paraffin. All samples were processed within 24 h of their procurement.</p>
<p>All hydatid cyst samples were genotyped using the method described by Bowles et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] in combination with sequencing of PCR products. Only samples from <italic>Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto</italic> were used in this study.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Haematoxylin-eosin morphohistological analysis</title>
<p>Paraffin blocks were cut to obtain 5 &#x03BC;m thickness sections and were stained with haematoxylin-eosin (H&#x0026;E). Using an Olympus FSX100 microscope, each slide was examined to confirm that the three cyst layers were present. All infertile and small cyst samples that lacked the laminated layer were excluded from the analysis, however, all fertile cysts were studied due to the small sample size.</p>
<p>A seasoned pathologist examined blindly each slide, describing the germinal, laminated and adventitial layer features. For the adventitial layer, a score index from 0 to 3 was assigned to each cell type and inflammatory features grading its severity.</p>
<p>The thickness of the laminated layer was evaluated with the FSX-BSW software package that is included with the FSX100 microscope. The laminated layer length was measured in 20 consecutive areas in &#x03BC;m, obtaining both an average and its standard deviation.</p>
<p>For statistical analysis, Data was recorded in Excel 2010 datasheet and analyzed using RStudio IDE version 1.0.136 with R version 3.3.3. Outliers were identified using ROUT method with Q &#x003D; 1&#x0025; and differences were calculated using a two-way ANOVA with Tuckey&#x2019;s post hoc analysis using. Statistical significance was considered with a P-Value &#x003C;0.05.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis</title>
<p>To differentiate between parasite and host cells, we used two antibodies: one that targets <italic>Echinoccocus granulosus</italic> aldolase and another that targets host macrophages (Invitrogen S100A9 Monoclonal Antibody [MAC387]). Briefly, paraffin blocks were cut to obtain 3 &#x03BC;m thickness sections, and after deparaffinization and rehydration, for <italic>E. granulosus</italic> aldolase, antigen retrieval was performed with Citrate Buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0,05&#x0025; Tween-20, pH 6.2), the primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4&#x00B0;C at a dilution of 1:1000. For cattle macrophages, antigen retrieval was performed by incubating slides with a 0.05&#x0025; trypsin solution at 37&#x00B0;C for 15 minutes, the primary antibody was incubated 1 hour at room temperature at a dilution of 1:200. HRP-Conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) anti-Rabbit (<italic>E. granulosus</italic> aldolase) or anti-mouse (cattle macrophages) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature at a dilution of 1:1000. Finally, DAB-Plus Substrate Kit (Life Technologies) was used for detection and slides were counterstained with haematoxylin.</p>

<title>Bovine hydatid cyst sample distribution</title>
<p>From 2,961 bovines examined, 558 were positive to <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> infection. After the paraffin embedding process and microscopic examination, 144 samples were obtained with the three layers in succession; 9 fertile (4 in lungs, 5 in liver), 129 infertile (91 in lungs, 38 in liver) and 16 small cysts (10 in lungs, 6 in liver). Fertile cyst viability ranged from 1&#x0025; to 99&#x0025; of viable PSC.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>The laminated layer thickness varies according to cyst location and type</title>
<p>Gross hydatid cyst examination of the laminated layer between fertile and infertile cysts was verified with microscopic measurement; fertile cysts have almost a six-fold thicker laminated layer than infertile and small cysts, 217 &#x03BC;m (&#x00B1; 18,4 &#x03BC;m) vs 33 &#x03BC;m (&#x00B1; 5,4), this difference is statistically significant (p &#x003C;0.05). Conversely, small cysts have the laminated layer thickness similar to infertile cysts. There are also differences between cyst location; whereas fertile and infertile cysts have overall thicker laminated layers when found in the lungs (36 &#x03BC;m in lungs vs 29 &#x03BC;m in livers), small cysts have thicker laminated layers when found in the liver (26 &#x03BC;m in lungs vs 49 &#x03BC;m in liver), these differences are not statistically significant (p &#x003E; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). The complete laminated layer measurements are available as S1 Table.</p>

<title>Fertile, infertile and small hydatid cysts present hallmark histological features in the adventitial layer</title>
<p>Fertile hydatid cysts with high PSC viability percentage, have germinal layer with PSC attached, cells in different developmental stages and thick laminated layers (&#x003E;100 &#x03BC;m) that easily detach from the adventitial layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>); this adventitial layer is composed mainly of collagen fibers and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). Inflammatory cells, when present, are found beneath the collagen and fibroblast layer. There is a subset of fertile cysts that have low viability percentages (&#x003C;10&#x0025;) or zero viable PSC. When analyzed, these cysts have thinner laminated layers (&#x003C;100 &#x03BC;m), and while the collagen and fibroblast layer is present in the adventitial layer, the inflammatory cells are found beneath the laminated layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Conversely, infertile hydatid cysts all share common features: the laminated layer is very thin, sometimes thinner than 5 &#x03BC;m. Beneath the laminated layer, all infertile cysts have palisading foamy macrophages. Supporting these macrophages, there are lymphoid follicles and multinucleated giant cells throughout the adventitial layer, with little presence of collagen fibers or fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). Likewise, small hydatid cysts share the same histological features of infertile cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2G and 2H</xref>). The inflammation score is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref> and full score data is available as S2 table.</p>

<title>Infertile and small hydatid cysts present host immune cells inside the germinal layer</title>
<p>While analyzing the germinal layer of infertile cysts, there are many cells that have big nuclei, suggesting a mammalian rather than parasite origin. Sometimes these cells are present in big sheets or as single cells and resemble macrophages in the H&#x0026;E analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>). To corroborate these results, IHC analysis of both host immune cells and parasite cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>), demonstrates that these cells are not of parasite origin, as they are not detected by aldolase antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6C</xref>), but are positive for macrophage antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> infection elicits a granulomatous tissue reaction; characterized by the accumulation of cells of monocytic origin and are thought to be directed both at walling off and at eliminating the persistent foreign body. The hallmarks of granulomatous reactions are special types of activated macrophages called epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The adventitial layer is usually described as a fibrous layer due to the host&#x2019;s reaction to the parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], and several studies have described the cell composition of this layer. A study with fertile hydatid cysts found in the liver, showed that the adventitial layer has a significant amount of B lymphocytes, occasional polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes, however, they did no correlate this data with PSC viability, as the study was done in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Another study compared the differences in the adventitial layer between ovine and macropod hydatid cysts, with the adventitial layer of fertile cysts consisting of palisading macrophages with foamy cytoplasm and multinucleated giant cells or with granulation-type fibrous tissue devoid of a discernable covering epithelial layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]; and although the authors ponder whether cysts will develop and become fertile under inflammatory conditions, they do not correlate PSC viability with the characteristics they describe. The most complete study of the adventitial layer of bovine hydatid cysts was done by Sakamoto and Cabrera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], where they describe that infertile cysts have lymphocytes, macrophages, granulocytes and polynuclear giant cells infiltrating the adventitial layer, with the smaller infertile cysts being surrounded by macrophage derived cells while eosinophils are involved in the response against larger cysts, and although they did exhaustive IHC analysis of the adventitial layer, surprisingly they did not report positive staining in the germinal layer of infertile cysts.</p>
<p>In this study, we analyzed both fertile and infertile hydatid cysts from liver and lungs of naturally infected bovine to identify characteristic histological features.</p>
<p>The thickness of the laminated layer was different between fertile and infertile hydatid cysts and also between liver and lungs tissue. It has been described that the parenchyma of these organs limits the growth rate of the hydatid cyst, with the lung being less dense that the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], so it makes sense that the laminated layer is thicker in the lung cysts compared to liver cyst; small cysts on the other hand, had an inverse tendency; however, these differences were not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Although a fertile cyst is defined by the presence of PSC, we propose that a more complete definition should include viable PSC; as shown in this study, fertile cysts with low viability or dead PSC have adventitial layer characteristics of infertile cysts, and if sampled later, they possibly would be classified as such. However, because we work with natural infection samples, we are not able to confirm when the animals acquired the infection.</p>
<p>Many small hydatid cysts samples had adventitial layer characteristics similar to those of fertile cysts with dead PSC and infertile cysts. There is evidence that cysts from the same parasite strain, in the same organ and host can have differences in size, viability and fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. After examining 16 small hydatid cysts, all of which had adventitial layers with a strong immune reaction, we propose that small hydatid cysts with adventitial layer featuring palisading foamy macrophages, lymphocytes arranged in follicles, multinucleated giant cells, thin (&#x003C;50 &#x03BC;m) laminated layer and host immune cells inside the germinal layer, should be regarded as infertile; while small cysts without these characteristic histological features could develop into either fertile or infertile cysts.</p>
<p>The laminated layer, which is secreted by the parasite contains mucins with O-type glycosylations and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6); these features are related to the parasite survival inside large mammals, and it has been proposed that the laminated layer is involved in down-regulating the local inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Also, it has been shown in mice that both macrophages and dendritic cells are activated by portions of the laminated layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In our results, many infertile and small hydatid cysts samples have clear signs of the host immune cells infiltrating the laminated layer and disorganizing it; with the eosin staining being more intense were this is happening; this could be due to the host macrophages secreting a combination of cathepsin K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], although further experiments are needed to corroborate this.</p>
<p>Our results show that the bovine immune response, which is represented by the adventitial layer, is able in both lungs and liver, to disrupt the laminated layer of the hydatid cyst, and in many cases infiltrate the lumen, probably causing the destruction of the germinal layer promoting its infertility.</p>
