<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Processing bodies (PBs) are cytoplasmic mRNP granules that assemble via liquid-liquid phase separation and are implicated in the decay or storage of mRNAs. How PB assembly is regulated in cells remains unclear. We recently identified the ATPase activity of the DEAD-box protein Dhh1 as a key regulator of PB dynamics and demonstrated that Not1, an activator of the Dhh1 ATPase and member of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex inhibits PB assembly <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>]. Here, we show that the PB component Pat1 antagonizes Not1 and promotes PB assembly via its direct interaction with Dhh1. Intriguingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> PB dynamics can be recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic>, since Pat1 enhances the phase separation of Dhh1 and RNA into liquid droplets, whereas Not1 reverses Pat1-Dhh1-RNA condensation. Overall, our results uncover a function of Pat1 in promoting the multimerization of Dhh1 on mRNA, thereby aiding the assembly of large multivalent mRNP granules that are PBs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells are often subjected to severe environmental fluctuations such as nutrient deficiency, temperature changes or osmotic shock. To cope with stresses, a variety of mechanisms have evolved allowing cells to respond acutely and survive. These include changes in the gene expression program, which are often driven by robust transcriptional responses. Yet cells must also inactivate old mRNAs that may interfere with adaptation to the new condition, and therefore, post-transcriptional regulation and RNA turnover are critical to enable rapid changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mager and Ferreira, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The post-transcriptional fate of eukaryotic mRNAs is tightly linked to the complement of proteins that associate with it to form mRNPs (messenger ribonucleoproteins). For example, the presence of the m<sup>7</sup> G cap structure at the 5&#x2019; end is crucial for eIF4E binding, while Pab1 binds the 3&#x2019; poly-A tail, both of which protect the mRNA against degradation and promote translation initiation. On the other hand, mRNA turnover is thought to initiate via deadenylation by the Ccr4/Pop2/Not1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Muhlrad and Parker 1992</xref>; Meyer et al., 2004; Sheth and Parker, 2004), followed by cap removal by the decapping enzyme Dcp1/2 and 5&#x2019;-3&#x2019; degradation of the transcript by the exonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coller and Parker 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Larimer and Stevens, 1990</xref>). Thus, the processes of mRNA translation and decay are coupled and act antagonistically (Radakrishnan et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beelman and Parker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schwartz and Parker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schwartz and Parker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sun et al,. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chan et al., 2018</xref>)</p>
<p>The balance between mRNA translation and decay is not only temporally but also spatially controlled. For instance in yeast, upon glucose starvation, the majority of cellular translation halts and untranslated mRNA as well as many factors of the RNA decay machinery concentrate in large cytoplasmic mRNP granules, so called processing bodies [PBs] (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Brengues et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>). PBs contain major components of the 5&#x2019;-3&#x2019; RNA decay pathway, e.g. Dcp1/2 and Xrn1, as well as activators of decapping -namely, the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1, Pat1, Edc3 and the Lsm1-7 complex. PBs presumably form around mRNAs sequestered away from active translation, and in support of this, inhibition of translation initiation leads to induction of PBs (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Frank and Anderson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>; Lui et al., 2010). On the contrary, inhibition of translation elongation, for example by the drug cycloheximide which traps mRNA on ribosomes, and prevents their influx into PBs, has the opposite effect and leads to PB disassembly (Texeria et al., 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In consequence, PBs have been implicated in a variety of post-transcriptional processes such as translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>), mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>; Cougot et al., 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>), mRNA storage (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Brengues et al., 2005</xref>; Bhattacharya et al., 2006), and in higher eukaryotes, micro RNA-mediated repression (Liu et al., 2005; <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Pillai et al., 2005</xref>). PBs and related mRNP granules such as stress granules, P granules in germ cells, neuronal granules etc. form in a number of different species from yeast to mammals, and in a variety of cell types and biological contexts, suggesting that these structures are crucial for cellular function or survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barbee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Seydoux and Braun, 2006</xref>). Indeed, there is evidence that PBs can be essential for cell survival under stress. For instance, cells unable to form PBs show a drastic loss in viability in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shah et al., 2013</xref>). However, the precise role of PBs in the regulation of gene expression is a matter of debate and in order to understand PB function it is critical to examine how PBs assemble and are regulated.</p>
<p>Numerous recent studies have shown that PBs are dynamic, membraneless organelles that assemble from a variety of multivalent but weak RNA-protein, protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions; a phenomenon called liquid-liquid phase separation [LLPS]. The resulting granules are liquid-like, spherical, dynamic and are dissolved by the alcohol 1,6-hexanediol, all key features of LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Decker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fromm et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guo and Shorter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Although PB formation occurs via a plethora of multivalent protein-RNA interactions in a redundant fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rao and Parker, 2017</xref>), there are key players whose deletion drastically attenuates PB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Decker et al., 2007</xref>; Pilkington and Parker, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Scheller et al., 2007</xref>). One such component is the highly abundant DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 (DDX6 in humans). Dhh1 is an enhancer of decapping and is involved in the translational repression of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>, Coller and Parker 2001). We recently showed that Dhh1 undergoes phase separation <italic>in vitro</italic>, and controls PB dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic> via its RNA-stimulated ATPase activity whereas the ATPase activator Not1 dissolves Dhh1 droplets <italic>in vitro</italic> and inhibits PB formation <italic>in vivo.</italic> However, whether additional factors assist Dhh1 in promoting PB formation remains to be determined and is the focus of this study.</p>
<p>One such candidate is the eukaryotic PB component Pat1, an evolutionarily conserved multi-domain RNA binding protein that, like Dhh1, functions in both translational repression and mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pilkington and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>). In yeast, Pat1 acts as a scaffold that brings together repression and decay factors (Dhh1, Edc3, Lsm1-7, Dcp1/2 etc.) via direct and/or indirect interactions with mRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>). Dhh1 for example directly binds acidic residues in the N-terminal domain of Pat1, an interaction that is conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>; Conti; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ozgur and Stoecklin, 2013</xref>). Deletion of <italic>PAT1</italic> in yeast alters the localization of PB components, whereas its overexpression induces the formation of constitutive PBs even in unstressed cells (Pilkington and Parker, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, it was shown that phosphorylation of Pat1 by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) inhibits PB formation, and cells expressing a phospho-mimetic mutant of Pat1 are defective in PB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>). However, the mechanism by which Pat1 regulates PB assembly is unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that Pat1 promotes PB formation via Dhh1, and we show that the interaction between Pat1 and Dhh1 is critical for robust PB assembly <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using a liquid phase separation assay we can recapitulate this function of Pat1 <italic>in vitro</italic> as addition of recombinant Pat1, but not of a Pat1 variant that cannot bind Dhh1, enhances phase separation of Dhh1 and RNA. Overall, our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggests that during stress Pat1 antagonizes the inhibitory effect of Not1 on PB assembly and promotes the multimerization of Dhh1 on mRNA, leading to the formation of PBs.</p>

<title>Constitutive PB formation upon Pat1 overexpression is Dhh1 dependent</title>
<p>The PB components Pat1 and Dhh1 were each previously shown to be required for PB formation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pilkington and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). To understand the relationship between Pat1 and Dhh1 in the regulation of PB assembly, we took advantage of the observation that overexpression of Pat1 leads to constitutive PB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker 2005</xref>). This allowed us to characterize their respective regulatory contributions without external influences such as nutrient starvation signals. As expected, Pat1 overexpression from its endogenous locus using the galactose promoter in the presence of Dhh1 led to the formation of constitutive PBs, as visualized by co-localization of Dhh1-GFP and Dcp2-mCherry foci (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). No foci were formed when Pat1 was not overexpressed or when we overexpressed the human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A</xref>). Notably, when Pat1 was overexpressed in cells that lack Dhh1, a drastic reduction in the number of PBs was observed, as visualized by the <italic>bona fide</italic> PB marker Edc3-GFP and its co-localization with Dcp2-mCherry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 A, B</xref>). This demonstrates that formation of constitutive PBs upon Pat1 overexpression requires Dhh1.</p>

<title>Pat1 and Dhh1 interaction is essential for PB assembly</title>
<p>Pat1 is an 88 kDa protein that consists of an N-terminal un-structured domain (Pat1-N) followed by a proline-rich stretch plus middle domain and a C-terminal globular fold (Pat1-C). The N-terminal domain of Pat1 directly binds Dhh1&#x2019;s RecA2 core via a conserved DETF motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ozgur and Stoecklin, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, Pat1&#x2019;s C-terminus harbors two serine residues that are phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) negatively regulating the interaction with Dhh1 and PB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to understand how these Pat1 domains influence liquid-liquid phase separation and PB assembly, we wanted to characterize various Pat1 mutants both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Unfortunately, we were unable to recombinantly express functional, full-length Pat1. Based on the structures published, we therefore developed a minimal Pat1 construct encompassing both N-and C-terminal domains that we refer to as Pat1-NC [amino acids: 5-79 (N) and 456-787 (C) connected with a (GGS)<sub>4</sub>linker](<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The expression of this <italic>PAT1-NC</italic> construct rescued the <italic>pat1&#x0394;</italic> growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1B</xref>) and upon glucose starvation, induced PBs to a similar level as wild-type <italic>PAT1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>) indicating full functionality <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, upon re-addition of glucose, PBs in the <italic>PAT1-NC</italic> expressing cells rapidly dissolved demonstrating that they are reversible and dynamic rather than anomalous granules. In addition, Pat1-NC-GFP itself localized to PBs upon stress in a reversible manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1C</xref>). Finally, when we overexpressed Pat1-NC using a GAL promoter, robust PBs were induced in the absence of stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, G</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined whether Pat1-NC can interact with Dhh1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and as expected, Pat1-NC displayed strong binding to full-length Dhh1 in a GST pull down assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). However, this interaction was completely abolished for a Pat1-NC variant in which the N-terminal DETF motif was mutated to four alanines [Pat1<sup>4</sup>A-Dhh<sup>1</sup>, see supplemental table S2B for a list of all mutants used in this study] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

In order to investigate PB formation independently of carbon starvation stress, we therefore treated cells with the drug hippuristanol, which inhibits the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4A (Bordeleau, M.E., et al., 2006). In consequence, hippuristanol prevents translation initiation and robustly induces PB formation within minutes in cells expressing wild-type <italic>PAT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chan et al., 2018</xref>) [<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, Movies 1 and 2]. Cells expressing <italic>pat1<sup>4</sup>A-Dhh<sup>1</sup></italic> however, did not show PB formation until 2hrs after hippuristanol addition.

<title>Pat1 phosphorylation status influences RNA binding</title>
<p>Pat1 is a target of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphorylation of two serines (amino acids 456/457) in the C-terminus of Pat1 under glucose-rich conditions was previously shown to negatively regulate PB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>).

<p>Pull-down experiments from cell extracts previously suggested that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Pat1 diminishes its interaction with Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>). To test whether this effect is direct, we performed pull-down assays with recombinant Pat1-NC protein and the Pat1-NC<sup>EE</sup> variant. However, in this assay there was no significant difference in Dhh1 binding between Pat1-NC and Pat1-NC<sup>EE</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Since the strong DETF binding site in Pat1-N might mask any weaker interaction in Pat1-C, we also tested for direct binding of Pat1-C to Dhh1 but were unable to detect any interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that the DETF-motif in Pat1-N provides the major interaction surface for Dhh1.</p>
<p>Pat1-C was previously shown to bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pilkington and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore tested whether RNA binding is regulated by PKA-dependent phoshphorylation by performing RNA oligo gel shift assays using recombinant proteins. Whereas wild-type Pat1-C robustly binds the RNA oligo and shifts it to higher molecular weight in a native PAGE gel, Pat1<sup>EE</sup> displayed a significantly reduced RNA shift (quantified in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> results on the phospho-mimic Pat1<sup>EE</sup> mutant suggest that in addition to Pat1-Dhh1 binding, also the interaction between Pat1 and RNA is important for PB formation.</p>

<title>Pat1 and Not1 act antagonistically <bold><italic>in vivo</italic></bold></title>
<p>Our lab previously showed that Not1 promotes PB disassembly by activating the ATPase activity of Dhh1, and cells expressing a Not1 mutant that cannot bind to Dhh1 (<italic>not1<sup>9</sup>X-Dhh<sup>1</sup></italic>) form constitutive PBs in non-stressed cells. Yet these PBs are less intense and fewer in number than those formed upon glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that additional mechanisms prevent PB formation in glucose-replete conditions.</p>
<p>Since in glucose-rich media PB assembly is also inhibited by the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Pat1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>), we wanted to test whether expression of the non-phosphorylatable <italic>pat1AA</italic> variant enhances PB formation in the <italic>not1<sup>9</sup>X-Dhh<sup>1</sup></italic> strain background.

<p>Overall, this suggests that there are at least three determinants that act cooperatively to enhance the formation of PBs: (a) direct interactions between Pat1-Dhh1 and Pat1-RNA; (b) lack of Not1 binding to Dhh1 and in consequence low Dhh1 ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>); and (c) the availability of PB client mRNAs that are not engaged in translation. Furthermore, our results suggest that Pat1 and Not1 act antagonistically on PB dynamics. Whereas Pat1 binding to Dhh1 enhances the assembly of PBs, the interaction of Not1 with Dhh1 promotes PB disassembly, likely through activation of the ATPase activity of Dhh1.</p>

<title>Pat1 promotes PB assembly by enhancing the phase separation of Dhh1 and RNA</title>
<p>At least two mechanisms of how Pat1 promotes PB formation via Dhh1 could be envisioned: first, Pat1 could slow the ATPase cycle of Dhh1, for example by preventing Not1 binding and/or inhibiting ATP hydrolysis, second, Pat1 could directly promote oligomerization and condensation of Dhh1 on RNA.</p>
<p>To test the first hypothesis, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> ATPase assay using purified protein components in which Not1 robustly stimulates the ATPase activity of Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>). However, we did not observe a significant inhibition of the Not1-stimulated ATPase activity upon addition of Pat1-NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4A</xref>), suggesting that Pat1 does not directly interfere with the mechanism of ATPase activation.</p>
<p>We had previously shown that PB dynamics are regulated by the ATPase activity of Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>). To test Pat1&#x2019;s effect on the Dhh1 ATPase cycle <italic>in vivo,</italic> we therefore also examined the turnover of PBs that form upon Pat1 overexpression. The drug cycloheximide (CHX) traps mRNAs on polysomes and thereby stops the supply of new RNA clients to PBs. Since active Dhh1 constantly releases mRNA molecules from PBs, a lack of mRNA influx eventually leads to their disassembly and in consequence the catalytic dead mutant of Dhh1 that is locked in the ATP-state (Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup>) inhibits PB disassembly and was shown to have negligible turnover rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>). We observed that PBs formed upon Pat1 overexpression were more dynamic than PBs formed in the presence of Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> and their dis-assembly kinetics was comparable to PBs formed upon stress in a wild-type <italic>DHH1</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4B, C</xref> and Movies 3,4,5). Thus, overall, our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> findings are not consistent with the conclusion that Pat1 blocks the ATPase activation of Dhh1.</p>
<p>The second hypothesis is that Pat1 promotes higher-order mRNP assembly by directly or indirectly promoting Dhh1 oligomerization, thereby acting as a scaffold and providing additional protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; Roy and Parker, 2017). We have previously shown that recombinant Dhh1 can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the presence of RNA and ATP, and that these Dhh1 droplets can recapitulate aspects of <italic>in vivo</italic> PB dynamics. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore utilized this <italic>in vitro</italic> system to test Pat1&#x2019;s impact on the phase separation behavior of Dhh1.</p>
<p>Dhh1 droplets were assembled from purified components as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, while no LLPS of Pat1 alone was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure S5A</xref>), addition of increasing concentrations of wild-type Pat1 strongly enhanced the LLPS of Dhh1 in the presence of ATP and RNA as judged by an increase in the area &#x002A; intensity of Dhh1 droplets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, Pat1 itself enriched in Dhh1 droplets, suggesting that Pat1 and Dhh1 co-oligomerize with RNA to form a composite phase-separated compartment.</p>

<p>To test the specificity of LLPS stimulation, we tested the Pat1<sup>4</sup>A-Dhh<sup>1</sup> (Dhh1 binding) and Pat1<sup>EE</sup> (phospho-mimic) mutants both of which both drastically reduce PB formation <italic>in vivo</italic> (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, 3A and S2B). Consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results, Dhh1-RNA droplet formation was either not at all or only mildly stimulated upon addition of these Pat1 variants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated that the MIF4G domain of Not1 prevents formation of Dhh1-RNA droplets, presumably by activating the ATPase cycle of Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore next analyzed whether the Pat1-Dhh1 droplets are still responsive to Not1.

<title>Tug-of-war model between Pat1 and Not1 to regulate PB dynamics</title>
<p>The ability of proteins and RNA to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as an essential fundamental biological process allowing cells to organize and concentrate their cellular components without the use of membranes. Yet, how these membraneless organelles assemble, are kept dynamic and are regulated remains enigmatic. One such cellular phase-separated compartment is the PB and our results presented here together with our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>) identify and characterize both positive and negative regulators of PB assembly and provides novel insight into the regulation of membraneless organelle formation.</p>
<p>Overall, our work uncovers a function of Pat1 as an enhancer of PB formation that acts via Dhh1 and counteracts the inhibitory function of Not1. Based on our results, we propose that there are at least three inputs that cooperatively regulate PB dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). First, the availability of mRNA clients acting as seeding substrates to initiate PB formation. mRNA availability is inversely proportional to the translation status, which is regulated by different stress responses and the metabolic state of the cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Second, the activity of cAMP-dependent PKA negatively regulates PB assembly in nutrient-rich conditions, at least in part through phosphorylation of Pat1. However, since expression of non-phosphorylatable Pat1<sup>AA</sup> at endogenous levels (in contrast to overexpression) is not sufficient to induce PBs, Pat1 availability appears to be limiting (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, S2B and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>). Third, activation of the Dhh1 ATPase cycle by the CCR4-Not1 deadenylation complex stimulates mRNA release and negatively regulates PB assembly. It is of note that Not1 itself might also be subject to post-translational regulation, in response to metabolic state and/or cell cycle stages of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Braun et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In this model, a tug-of-war between Pat1 and Not1 regulates PB assembly and disassembly: whereas a tight Pat1-Dhh1 interaction in the presence of RNA clients, promotes PB formation, Not1, induces PB turnover via stimulating the ATPase activity of the DEAD box ATPase Dhh1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Remarkably, our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings are corroborated <italic>in vitro</italic> wherein, Pat1 enhances the LLPS of Dhh1 and RNA, a step critical for the assembly of large mRNP granules, and by contrast, Not1 reverses the LLPS of Pat1-Dhh1-RNA droplets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Furthermore, the observed stoichiometry of Dhh1 and Pat1 in PBs is recapitulated in our <italic>in vitro</italic> phase separation assay.</p>

<title>The interaction between Pat1 and Dhh1 is critical for PB assembly</title>
<p>Inducing PB formation by Pat1 overexpression or hippuristanol treatment allowed us to dissect distinct mechanisms that govern PB assembly and characterize the crucial role of the Pat1-Dhh1 interaction in this process. The benefit of these modes of PB formation are that they bypass the characteristic stresses associated with PB formation, such as nutrient starvation, that might have more widespread and confounding effects on translation, mRNA degradation, or on the regulation of other PB components.</p>
<p>Our experiments reveal that Pat1 functions in PB formation through Dhh1 since PB induction by Pat1 overexpression is strictly dependent on the presence of Dhh1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, a mutant in the DETF motif in the N-terminus of Pat1 mediating direct binding to Dhh1 (Pat1<sup>4</sup>A-Dhh<sup>1</sup> variant) fails to promote PB assembly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). These results were further confirmed using the drug hippuristanol that inhibits translation initiation wherein PBs were induced in wild-type cells but not in cells expressing the Pat1<sup>4</sup>A-Dhh<sup>1</sup> mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chan et al., 2018</xref>) suggesting that high mRNA load alone is inadequate for PB formation and that a direct physical interaction between Pat1 and Dhh1 is obligatory as well. Since the DETF motif in Pat1 is conserved across evolution and was suggested to regulate PB assembly in human cells as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ozgur and Stoecklin, 2013</xref>), the Pat1-Dhh1 interaction likely plays a critical role in PB formation across species.</p>
<p>Our results seem to be at odds with a previous publication, which suggests that Pat1 acts independently of Dhh1 to promote PB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker 2005</xref>). However, in this study Pat1 was overexpressed from a plasmid, on top of the endogenous copy. When recapitulating these conditions, we observed that PB components mislocalize to the nucleus [observed by DAPI and a nuclear rim marker, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7A, B</xref>.] and it is possible that in the absence of additional organelle markers, this nuclear accumulation was misinterpreted as PB formation.</p>

<title>Pat1 enhances the LLPS of Dhh1, thereby promoting PB formation</title>
<p>How does Pat1 enhance PB formation? One hypothesis is that Pat1 directly counteracts the Not1-stimulated ATPase activation of Dhh1, but we do not favor such a model since i) Pat1 does not inhibit Dhh1&#x2019;s ATPase activity at physiological protein ratios <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>), ii) Not1<sup>MIF<sup>4</sup>G</sup> dissolves Pat1-Dhh1 condensates, while droplets formed from catalytic-dead Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> are Not1-resistant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>), and iii) <italic>in vivo</italic>, PBs formed upon Pat1 overexpression are much more dynamic than those formed from Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Instead, our data are consistent with a model in which Pat1 promotes PB assembly by directly enhancing the LLPS of Dhh1. DDX6, the human homolog of Dhh1 can oligomerize (Lange et al., 2012), and given the fact that both DDX6 and Dhh1 are found in molar excess over mRNA, we propose that Pat1 functions as a scaffold, providing additional multivalent interactions with Dhh1 and RNA, thereby aiding in the fusion of Dhh1 LLPS droplets and promoting assembly of microscopically-detectable mRNP condensates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, both functional binding to Dhh1 in Pat1-N and RNA-binding in Pat1-C are required for this mechanism as individually mutations in each of the domains alter PB assembly <italic>in vivo</italic> and fail to enhance Dhh1&#x2019;s phase separation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, the Pat1<sup>4A-Dhh1</sup> (Dhh1 binding mutant) and Pat1<sup>EE</sup> (phospho mimic mutant) not only have a drastically reduced number of PBs, but also much lower intensity (reduced by 7 and 8 fold respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7C</xref>) compared to Pat1 wild-type PBs. It is interesting to note that Pat1-N was previously shown to interfere with the ability of Dhh1 to interact with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>). This might explain why RNA-binding by Pat1&#x2019;s C-terminus that is under the regulation of PKA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3</xref>) is critical for LLPS and PB assembly.</p>
<p>Our recent findings also show that the un-structured poly-Q rich C-terminal tail of Dhh1 is required for PB formation <italic>in vivo</italic> and Dhh1 LLPS <italic>in vitro</italic> (Hondele et al., <italic>under revision</italic>). Thus, Pat1 might potentially enhance Dhh1 multimerization via the low complexity tails of Dhh1.

<title>The emerging importance of liquid-liquid phase separation in diverse aspects of cell biology and the power of <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution systems</title>
<p>As non-membrane bound organelles, it is of interest to understand how cells assemble large RNP granules and regulate their dynamics. PBs are prominent membraneless cellular compartments, which have been shown to be not only involved in numerous aspects of mRNA turnover, but also crucial for survival under various cellular stresses. With an <italic>in vitro</italic> phase separation tool in hand that faithfully reconstitutes certain aspects of PB formation, we are now in a position to dissect how PBs form and characterize their biophysical behavior. This will aid us not only in elucidating key components of PB formation, but also help us elucidate the function of PBs in regulating mRNA turn-over. At this stage, our in <italic>vitro</italic> systems are limited to Dhh1, Pat1, Not1 and RNA and it must be pointed out that several additional PB components have been characterized. It will thus be critical to examine also these components in future experiments and to evaluate their role in PB dynamics and how they function together with Pat1 and Dhh1. For example, this includes the low complexity-domain containing factors Edc3 and Lsm4 that were shown to be critical for PB formation <italic>in vivo.</italic> Recently, it was demonstrated that in addition to regulatory inputs through signaling pathways a threshold concentration of low-complexity domain containing proteins is required for robust PB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Protter et al., 2018</xref>). In the future, it will thus be important to evaluate the effect of concentration thresholds on Dhh1-based LLPS <italic>in vitro</italic> and PB formation <italic>in vivo</italic> to understand the complex interplay of various inputs that regulate PB assembly.</p>
<p>The physical basis of LLPS has attracted a great deal of attention recently, at least in part because of the critical role that proper mRNP assembly plays in pathological neurodegenerative diseases and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ramaswami et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alberti and Hyman 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aguzzi and Altmeyer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). An important challenge is to understand how these granules are kept dynamic and functional under some conditions whereas the formation of solidified and aberrant aggregates are triggered under others. Robust <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution systems that can recapitulate mRNP granule assembly, dynamics and stoichiometry will be invaluable in addressing these research questions and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanism of how cells age and deal with stress.</p>

<title>Automated image analysis for PB quantification</title>
<p>In order to quantify PB formation in live cells, we used an automated image analysis in a manner similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>. First, PBs were counted using Diatrack 3.05 particle tracking software using local intensity maxima detection, followed by particle selection by intensity thresholding and particle selection by contrast thresholding with a value of 5&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vallotton et al., 2017</xref>). To speed up the analysis, we renamed all our images in a form that can be recognized as a time-lapse sequence by Diatrack, and placed them all in a single directory, such that they all will be analyzed using exactly the same image analysis parameters. Renaming and copying was done by a custom script (supplementary code 1), which also performed cell segmentation using a method adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hadjidemetriou et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, the method first detects all edges using a Laplacian edge detection step, and then traces normals to those edges in a systematic manner. These normals tend to meet at the cell centre where the high density of normals is detected, serving as seeds to reconstruct genuine cells. Our script thus counts cells and reports their number for each image -information which is output to an excel table. The results from Diatrack PB counting are imported from a text file into that table, and the number of PB is divided by the number of cells for each image.</p>

We then measured the intensity of the 10 brightest PBs as a function of time and in both cases took the median intensity value as representative of the more visible PBs (at least 10 PBs were present in every image for both strains and at each time point). Finally, we divided the median value obtained for Dhh1 by that for Pat1 and plotted that ratio as a function of time post-stress.</p>
