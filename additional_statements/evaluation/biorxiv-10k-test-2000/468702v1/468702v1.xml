<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Induction of plant defense against insect herbivory is initiated by a combination of both, mechanical wounding and chemical factors. In order to study both effects independently on plant defense induction, SpitWorm, a computer controlled device which mimics the damage pattern of feeding insect larvae on leaves and can additionally apply oral secretions (OS) or other solutions to the &#x2018;biting site&#x2019; during &#x2018;feeding&#x2019;, was developed and evaluated. The amount of OS left by a <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> larva during feeding on <italic>Phaseolus lunatus</italic> (lima bean) leaves was estimated by combining larval foregut volume, biting rate, and quantification of a fluorescent dye injected into the larvae&#x2019;s foregut prior to feeding. For providing OS amounts by SpitWorm equivalent to larval feeding, dilution and delivery rate were optimized. The effectiveness of SpitWorm was tested by comparing volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions of <italic>P. lunatus</italic> leaves treated with either SpitWorm, MecWorm or <italic>S. littoralis</italic> larvae. Identification and quantification of emitted VOCs revealed that SpitWorm induced a volatile bouquet that is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to herbivory. Additionally, RT-qPCR of four jasmonic acid responsive genes showed that SpitWorm, in contrast to MecWorm, induces the same regulation pattern as insect feeding. Thus, SpitWorm mimics insect herbivory almost identical to real larvae feeding.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Standing at the beginning of the food chain, plants undergo biotic and abiotic challenges from the environment. In nature, herbivorous insects are one of their major threats, especially in higher plants. Despite their physical immobility, plants have survived and propagated for hundreds of millions of years. During this long time, they have coevolved with herbivorous insects and developed strategies to fend, repel and annihilate their insect enemies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Plant defense strategies against herbivores have aroused ardent and tremendous interests and research with profound achievements, especially in the last 30 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. These studies have deciphered that the feeding of insects can initiate a series of diverse defense related events <italic>in planta</italic> such as signaling processes, specific gene and protein expression patterns, and the production and accumulation of secondary metabolites including volatile emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Besides the wounding trauma, all the defense responses of plant are triggered by herbivory associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] but our understanding of these HAMPs is still in the very early stages. To date, HAMPs can be classified into two categories: (1) chemical elicitors derived from herbivore oral secretions, oviposition fluids or environmental DNAs (eDNA) that were left behind by insects; and (2) those that originate from the specific patterns of wounding, i.e. the mechanical damage and the resulting elicitors from plants. This second category is also called damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Only both aspects together are able to induce the full spectrum of plant herbivory defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>To study the contributions of the two aspects (mechanical wounding and chemical elicitors), mechanical wounding of insect feeding was originally mimicked with different tools, including razor blades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], pattern wheels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], forceps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], paper punch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and needles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>However, using lima bean (<italic>Phaseolus lunatus</italic>) as a model plant, mechanical wounding alone by cuts or scratches was not observed to cause induced volatile emission. Only by continuous mechanical wounding by a computer-controlled device (MecWorm) which mimics the leaf wounding pattern of a feeding insect, the emission of a blend of volatiles was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Those results indicated that mechanical wounding itself plays important roles in plant defense induction.</p>
<p>For a period of time, mechanical wounding with single or a few cuts or scratches with different wounding tools was used as a control or in combination with larval oral secretions (OS) or OS elicitors to study the defense inducing roles of chemical compounds from OS. This was effective in inducing plant defense responses such as volatile emission and jasmonic acid (JA) burst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>These elicitors include small molecular size fatty acid - amino acid conjugates (FACs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]; inceptins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]; caeliferins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and volicitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]; glucose oxidase (GOX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] or a <italic>&#x03B2;-</italic>glucosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] as well as pore or channel forming compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] and were reported to induce signaling pathways, biosynthesis of phytohormones and volatile emissions. However, compared with the vast diversity of herbivores that attack plants, the known herbivore-derived elicitors are relatively few. Moreover the molecular mechanism of plant perception of these elicitors needs further study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Methods to study insect OS or OS derived elicitors include mainly applying saliva or related components onto wounds to mimic insect feeding and examine plant defense response. Up to now, no standard procedure for wounding or OS application was established. Thus, besides different ways of wounding itself, applying OS amounts varying between 1 to 20 &#x03BC;L and dilution factors up to 1:5, and wounding areas varying from a few scratches or puncture rows to 2&#x0025; of the total leaf can be found in the various studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>
<p>To examine the effect from different amounts and concentrations of insect OS applied to mechanical wounding Musser, Farmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) prevented the delivery of larval saliva (<italic>Helicoverpa zea</italic>) during feeding. By using this technique, they showed that in tobacco plant defense responses to caterpillar feeding were qualitatively different when caterpillars are either able or not able to secrete saliva. In another case, Major and Constabel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) used a dilution range from 1:1 to 1:180 to optimize the aqueous dilution of OS from <italic>Malacosoma disstria</italic> applied to poplar leaves with over 100 puncture holes for maximal target gene induction (<italic>PtdTI3</italic>). Quantitative effect of insect saliva introduced to plant wounding area indicated that it is important to quantify the delivery ability of saliva from insect to plant, i.e. how much saliva is delivered per bite by insect.</p>
<p>However, from all the former studies, one can estimate that the quantities of OS applied to mechanical wounded plants were often several thousand times higher than the real amount left behind at the wounding site by a larva per feeding bout, which was estimated in the range of 0.5 to 5 nL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. To precisely mimic insect feeding, it is necessary to determine the real amount left at the wounding zone by insect feeding.</p>
<p>In order to establish an insect feeding mimicking device that combines both mechanical wounding and the simultaneous application of chemical elicitors, SpitWorm was engineered and tested in comparison with MecWorm and <italic>S. littoralis</italic> larvae feeding on induced defense responses in lima bean.</p>

<p>Lima bean, <italic>Phaseolus lunatus</italic> L. (Ferry Morse cv. Jackson Wonder Bush) was grown from seeds at 23 &#x00B0;C and 60&#x0025; humidity in plastic pots (diameter 5.5 cm) using sterilized potting soil. For daylight radiation, fluorescent tubes (ca. 270 &#x03BC;E m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) with a photophase of 16 h were used. Experiments were conducted with 12 to 16 days old seedlings showing two fully developed primary leaves.</p>

<sec id="s2a2">
<title>Insects</title>
<p><italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) larvae, hatched from eggs (Bayer CropScience AG, Monheim, Germany) were reared on artificial diet (500 g white beans powder soaked overnight in 1.2 L water, 9 g ascorbic acid, 9 g parabene, 4 mL formaldehyde (36.5&#x0025;), and 75 g agar boiled in 1.0 L of H<sub>2</sub>O) and raised at 22 &#x00B0;C to 24 &#x00B0;C, 14 h to 16 h photophase, to the developmental stage of 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> instar. For all experiments, larvae with a body length in the range of 2.5 &#x2013; 3 cm were chosen.</p>

<p>A gas-tight glass syringe (100 ml) was connected to a capillary (Fused Silica, 0.25 mm i.d., SGE, Melbourne, Australia) running from the top of the punching head of MecWorm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] through the inner-hollow of the &#x2018;biting&#x2019; needle until to a hole close to the needle tip. The syringe was actuated by a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus PHD 2000) to generate a stable and quantitative fluid delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Flow rate optimization</title>
<p>In order to determine the lowest flow rate at which a fluid can be supplied continuously without interruption through the hole in the punching needle, ink was used instead of larval OS. With different delivery rates (2.5 nL&#x00B7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 5 nL&#x00B7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 10 nL&#x00B7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) SpitWorm was set to mimic larval biting pattern on a filter paper for 5 min.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Collection of insect oral secretions</title>
<p>Regurgitate was by slight squeezing the larvae with tweezers and collection of the excreted fluid with a Gilson Pipetman P20 Variable Volume Pipette (2 to 20 &#x00B5;L). If not used immediately, the regurgitate was frozen and stored at &#x2212;20 &#x00B0;C. Before dilution and use with SpitWorm, larval regurgitate was filtered through a syringe filter (CME, 0.22 &#x00B5;m).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Wounding size and biting rate determination</title>
<p>After 12 h starving single larvae were allowed to feed on a lima bean leaf for 5 min, 1 h, 3 h, 9 h and 17 h. For subsequent quantification, only treatments where the larva did not feed at the leaf edges were used. Images of the damaged leaves were printed out. Scaled unit areas and wounding areas were cut out of the same sheet of paper and weighed. Wounding sizes were determined by dividing the paperweight of the wounding area by the paperweight of the scaled unit (n &#x003D; 4 for each treatment).</p>
<p>Biting rate (bites&#x00B7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) was determined by evaluating a close-up slow-motion video of a larva during feeding on a lima bean leaf.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Insect foregut volume determination</title>
<p>After feeding, larvae were suffocated in 75&#x0025; ethanol solution for 30 seconds, dissected, and the length (l) and width (d) of the foregut were measured. Foregut volume (V<italic>g</italic>) was calculated as a cylinder (V<italic>g</italic> &#x003D; l&#x00B7;&#x03C0;&#x00B7;(d/2)<sup>2</sup>, n &#x003D; 5).</p>

<title>Optimization of the injection volume of fluorescent dye solution</title>
<p>After being starved for 12 hours, larvae were injected with 1 &#x00B5;L, 5 &#x00B5;L, 10 &#x00B5;L, and 15 &#x00B5;L of an aqueous solution (1 mg&#x00B7;mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) of Lucifer Yellow CH dipotassium salt (Fluka, &#x03BB;<sub><italic>Ex</italic></sub> &#x003D; 428 nm, &#x03BB;<sub><italic>Em</italic></sub> &#x003D; 535 nm), 4 replicates for each injection volume. As control, 4 starved larvae without being injected were used. Larvae were then fed on lima bean plants for 5 min, wounding areas were pictured with a LEICA LMD6000 fluorescence microscope and wounding sizes were measured as described above.</p>

<title>Fate of foregut injected fluorescent dye</title>
<p>In order to estimate the residence time of the injected fluorescent dye solution in the larval foregut, <italic>S. littoralis</italic> were injected with 5 &#x00B5;L of an aqueous solution (1 mg&#x00B7;mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) of Lucifer Yellow and observed under ultraviolet light (365 nm) for 3 h.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Amount of OS left on the leaf at the wounding zone</title>
<p>An aqueous solution (5 &#x00B5;L, 1 mg&#x00B7;mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) of Lucifer Yellow CH dipotassium salt was injected into the larval foregut. After injection, larvae were allowed to feed on leaves for 5 min. Leaf tissue around the wound margins was cut out, ground in liquid nitrogen, suspended in 1 mL H<sub>2</sub>O by shaking for 1 h in the dark at 4 &#x00B0;C, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12.6 &#x00D7; 1000 rcf. The supernatant was subjected to fluorescence signal quantification with a FP-750 Spectrofluorometer (JASCO Cooperation, Tokyo, Japan). The supernatant of centrifuged tissue suspensions of leaves treated with unlabeled larvae, processed in the same manner as above served as blank and as solvent for the dilutions for the standard curve measurements (n &#x003D; 3 for each treatment). A standard curve (R<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 0.9968; S4 Fig) was generated using a series of dilutions (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 nL&#x00B7;mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) of Lucifer Yellow solution (1 mg&#x00B7;mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>).</p>

<p>For headspace volatiles collection of control and <italic>S. littoralis</italic> treated leaves (one larva per plant) as well as for MecWorm and SpitWorm (filtered larval OS, 1:10 diluted; flow rate, 10 nL&#x00B7;sec-<sup>1</sup>) treatments (equivalent treatment duration (17 h) and wounding areas (7.25 cm<sup>2</sup>) for <italic>S. littoralis</italic>, MecWorm, and SpitWorm treatments), the test leaves were enclosed in an acryl glass case (width &#x00D7; depth &#x00D7; height, 95 &#x00D7; 87 &#x00D7; 135 mm<sup>3</sup>; net headspace volume approximately 1 L) together with the punch head in the MecWorm device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). The capillary of SpitWorm was threaded through a hole (diameter, 0.5 mm) in the left sidewall of the case; the stainless steel tubings of the volatile collection pump system were inserted through two holes (diameter, 0.8 mm) in the top-side. For control and larvae treatment, the punching head was positioned away from the leaf area and the device was switched off. The wounding time and area were 17 h and 7.25 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Headspace volatiles emitted by untreated lima bean leaves (n &#x003D; 8), or treated with larvae (n &#x003D; 6), MecWorm (n &#x003D; 5), and SpitWorm (n &#x003D; 6), respectively, were continuously collected for 24 h on Porapak Q traps (quartz glass tubes; length, 66 mm; inner diameter, 2.5 mm; outer diameter, 5.5 mm; filled with 10 mg Porapak Q, 80-100 mesh, Aldrich) using closed-loop-stripping (CLS) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Traps were pre-cleaned before the first use and regenerated after elution by rinsing with 1 ml of solvent each in the following order: methanol, methanol/chloroform (1:3), chloroform, acetone, dichloromethane and dried at 60 &#x00B0;C for 24 h. All experiments were started between 11:00 and 13:00. Setups were kept at 22 &#x2013; 24 <sup>&#x00B0;</sup>C with a light/dark rhythm of 7 h light, 10 h dark, and 7 h light. For all samples after volatile collection, adsorbed compounds were eluted with dichloromethane (2 &#x00D7; 50 &#x03BC;L, supplemented with 1&#x2013; bromodecan (50 &#x00B5;g&#x00B7;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) as internal standard, and stored at &#x2212;20 &#x00B0;C prior to analysis. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with an ISQ GC-quadrupole MS system (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a fused silica capillary column ZB&#x2013;5 (30 m &#x00D7; 0.25 mm &#x00D7; 0.25 &#x00B5;m with 10 m guard column, Zebron, Phenomenex, USA). Helium at 1 mL&#x00B7;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> served as carrier gas with an injector temperature of 220 &#x00B0;C running in split mode (1:10); 1 &#x00B5;L of sample was injected.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As a further developed MecWorm, a SpitWorm was expected to mimic the action of a feeding insect as close as possible. It will provide the possibility to study the effects of individual bioactive molecules in combination with the effects of continuous mechanical damage.</p>
<p>Plants react to herbivory with a series of defense reactions provoked by the mechanical destruction of plant tissue in combination with chemical compound left by the feeding organism. For lima bean leaves, it has been shown that sole continuous mechanical wounding by a designed mechanical caterpillar (MecWorm) is able to induce volatile emissions qualitatively almost identical to the bouquet released upon herbivory by <italic>S. littoralis</italic> larvae. This induction was not observed by wounding with razor blades or pattern wheels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to study the influence of larval oral secretions or single chemical compounds on the leaf&#x2019;s wounding response, we aimed for turning the mechanical caterpillar MecWorm into SpitWorm, which combines the mimicking of mechanical leaf wounding by a larva with a continuous and simultaneous delivery of larval OS through a capillary to the tip of the punching needle. The feeding of <italic>S. littoralis</italic> larvae on lima bean leaves and the respective defense response of the plant was chosen as the &#x2018;gold standard&#x2019; model for developing and parameter-adjusting of SpitWorm.</p>
<p>The average leaf wounding sizes of larval feeding were measured for different feeding periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3a</xref>) and the continuous mechanical leaf damage by SpitWorm was set accordingly for experiments comparing larvae and SpitWorm treatment. For SpitWorm fluid delivery an optimized flow rate of 10 nL&#x00B7;sec<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> was evaluated to leave a continuous trail during mechanical &#x2018;biting&#x2019;. It is worth to note that the values for flow rate as well as for biting rate and the leaf area destroyed per bite of SpitWorm are different to real larval feeding.</p>
<p>In order to determine the amount of OS left by a larva at the wounding edge and to adjust the amount of OS to be delivered by SpitWorm a fluorescent dye solution (Lucifer Yellow CH) was injected into the foregut of the larvae before they start feeding on leaves. Lucifer Yellow CH was chosen because (i) of its fluorescence emission maximum at 535 nm, fitting perfectly in the green gap between 490 to 620 nm of chlorophyll a and b, (ii) it is assumed to be non-toxic, (iii) of its high quantum yield, and (iv) it is highly dissociated at physiological pH levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. The injected dye solution starts to move through the whole body of the larva to the anus about 45 min to 1 hour after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>). Therefore, all feeding experiments had to start within 30 mins after injection. After comparing the feeding behavior of larvae injected with different volumes of fluorescent dye solution with untreated larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3b</xref>), an injection volume of 5 &#x00B5;L was chosen for subsequent experiments because higher injection volumes resulted in a significant reduction of larval feeding activities. A long-time effect of Lucifer Yellow on further larval growth and development was not evaluated in this study because all experiments with fluorescence labeled larvae were completed within less than 1 h after injection.</p>
<p>Comparison of microscope fluorescence images of the wounding edges of leaves treated with labeled larvae, SpitWorm delivering fluorescent labeled OS (dilution. 1:10; delivery rate, 10 nL&#x00B7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), and on the other hand treated with MecWorm and with a razor blade, both without any fluorescent labeling showed (i) a pronounced fluorescence signal at the wounding edge after larva and SpitWorm treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs. 7A-B</xref>) and (ii) no fluorescence after sole mechanical wounding by MecWorm or a razor blade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs. 7C-D</xref>). This confirms that larval OS infiltrates the tissue at the wounding edge and that the fluorescence signal is not resulting from or affected by sole mechanical wounding. SpitWorm left a slight different pattern of OS trail at the edge of the wounding site compared to larva feeding. Upon larval feeding, the OS goes deeper into the plant tissue following the veins compared to SpitWorm treatment. The wounding edges showed a difference in biting patterns. In accordance with scanning electron micrographs of wounding sites resulting from MecWorm and larva treatment reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], larva feeding forms a straight borderline in contrast to SpitWorm treatment, which forms to some extend a small, frayed zone which can explain the different permeation depths of the fluids.</p>
<p>The amount of OS left by a larva per bite (approximately 50 to 100 pL&#x00B7;bite<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) was calculated by quantifying the fluorescent dye extracted from the wounding edge tissues of leaves treated with labeled larvae in combination with feeding duration, average foregut volume, amount of fluorescent dye solution injected, and observed larval biting rates (3-5 bites&#x00B7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). This resulted in a calculated flow rate of 250 &#x2013; 300 pL&#x00B7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for the OS delivered by a larva which is 30 &#x2013; 40 times lower than the optimized flow rate (10 nL&#x00B7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) determined for SpitWorm (see above). Thus, the &#x2018;effective&#x2019; OS delivered by SpitWorm had to be aligned to the amount of OS from the larva during feeding by dilution. The amount of fluorescent dye extracted from larva-damaged tissue (see above) was compared with the amounts extracted from wounding edge tissues after SpitWorm treatment delivering different dilutions of labeled larval OS labeled with Lucifer Yellow solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). This resulted in an optimized dilution of 1:10 of larval regurgitate for SpitWorm treatments. The concentration of fluorescent dye in the regurgitate before dilution was adjusted to the concentration in the larval foregut.</p>
<p>With an OS dilution of 1:10 SpitWorm delivers an equivalent of 1 nL OS per second, which is still about three to four times the amount of OS left by larva feeding (0.3 nL&#x00B7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). Here it needs to be taken into account that the feeding track of <italic>S. littoralis</italic> larvae is not linear but usually follows repetitively a curved path. The OS left in the tissue during a feeding bout is re-ingested by the larva in the next round [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], while SpitWorm is continuously delivering diluted OS without taking up the damaged plant tissue. Additionally, to reduce the viscosity caused by large polysaccharides, proteins, fat and food residues, freshly harvested regurgitate was filtered through a 0.22 &#x03BC;m filter and it cannot be excluded that active component were removed thereby. Delivery of OS by SpitWorm was conducted at room temperature. Although the larvae were raised healthily within the same temperature range, it is not ensured that all the active compounds in the OS can keep the same activity, especially with long time delivery. Although this problem may be compensated by over-delivery of OS, more experiments need to be done in the future to test the activities of chemical factors by using SpitWorm.</p>
<p>In order to test to what extend SpitWorm can mimic larva feeding, with all the parameters evaluated so far, relative VOC amounts in the headspace of leaves as well as expression levels of four JA responsive genes in leaves upon larvae, MecWorm, and SpitWorm treatment were compared.</p>
<p>Volatiles in the headspace of lima bean leaves released upon different treatments were collected, identified, and quantified relative to an internal standard by GC-MS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Instead of charcoal as described earlier for comparison of MecWorm and larvae treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] we used Porapak Q as adsorbent for a more reliable quantification. It is known that for example (E)-&#x03B2;-ocimene, one of the most abundant compounds induced after larvae treatment of lima bean leaves, is oxidized to (3<italic>E</italic>,5<italic>E</italic>)-2,6-dimethyl-3,5,7-octatrien-2-ol and dehydrogenated to (3<italic>E</italic>,5<italic>E</italic>)-2,6-dimethyl-1,3,5,7-octatetraene to some extend when collected on active charcoal in the presence of humid air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Besides these two a third artefact, 5-ethylfuran-2(5H)-one (described as hexenolide by Bricchi, Leitner (8)), only detected after continuous mechanical wounding by MecWorm but not upon larval treatment, was absent when using Porapak Q as adsorbent. In total 38 compounds in all three treatments were identified and their relative amounts were subjected to a principal component analysis which revealed an almost complete overlap of the confidence areas (confidence level, 95&#x0025;) resulting from larvae and SpitWorm treatment. The cluster of the MecWorm treatments is clearly separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref>), showing that SpitWorm mimics larval feeding much better than MecWorm. Comparing the relative amounts of each compound after SpitWorm and larvae treatment shows that 90&#x0025; are not significantly different. On the other hand, comparing MecWorm with larval treatment, the relative amounts for 60&#x0025; of the compounds exhibit a significant difference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In general, MecWorm treatment evoked a stronger plant response, i.e. higher amounts of compounds released, than larvae or SpitWorm treatment (S5 Fig). This leads to the conclusion, that in this case, mechanical wounding is responsible for inducing volatile emission upon herbivory, figuratively named &#x2018;the cry for help&#x2019;, but compounds in the OS reduce the emission to &#x2018;turn down the sound&#x2019;.</p>
<p>To further investigate responses to SpitWorm treatment in <italic>P. lunatus</italic> leaves, time series of expression levels for four JA-responsive genes, were chosen which were also used in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. The four genes are: lipoxygenase (<italic>LOX3</italic>), phenylalanine ammonialyase (<italic>PAL</italic>), pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (<italic>PR2</italic> (&#x03B2;-1, 3-glucanase)) and (<italic>PR3</italic> (chitinase)).</p>
<p>All treatments showed no significant difference between SpitWorm treatment and larvae feeding (S6 Fig). Whereas for <italic>PAL</italic> SpitWorm/<italic>S. littoralis</italic> treatments resulted in a stronger induction for all periods compared to sole continuous mechanical wounding by MecWorm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8</xref>) the expression levels of the other JA responsive genes showed no significant differences between the different treatments for longer periods. Except for LOX where almost no difference between mechanical wounding and larval feeding is observed, the early response (1 h) is influenced by OS from <italic>S. littorals</italic> or SpitWorm, respectively. This indicates that mechanical wounding alone is able to induce the JA responsive genes pathway, but chemical factors enhance or modulate this induction for a more rapid defense response. Additionally, the results confirmed that 10 times diluted OS is the optimal dilution factor to add OS to SpitWorm to mimic <italic>S. littoralis</italic> feeding.</p>
<p>These results emphasize that both, mechanical wounding and chemical factors play prominent roles in gene regulation and defense reactions, which further proves that SpitWorm can be used as an effective tool in mimicking insect feeding. Our findings also support the hypothesis that in wounded leaves, mechanical wounding can trigger most of the defense reactions while chemical factors in insect OS have a &#x2018;fine-tune&#x2019; function by enhancing or attenuating the induction of gene expression by mechanical wounding.</p>
<p>With this new tool at hand, it is now possible to study the interplay of mechanical wounding and larval OS at different environmental conditions or with different combinations of compounds. Using fractions of larval OS or single compounds will allow tracking down individual elicitors and in combination with other comparative genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic methods, it will be possible to go further and deeper in understanding regulation processes of plant defense against herbivory.</p>
