<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in the United States (diagnosed in 1 in 68 children (Christensen et al., 2016)). The core symptoms of ASD include social and communication deficits, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>). In addition, several studies show that individuals with ASD report a variety of co-morbid conditions including sleep problems. It is estimated that 40 &#x2013; 80&#x0025; of the ASD population experience sleep disorders that do not improve with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>). More specifically, people with ASD have problems falling and staying asleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hodge et al., 2014</xref>). A recent study showed that sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood and increase over time, suggesting that sleep problems are an essential part of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Verhoeff et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, sleep impairments are a strong predictor of the severity of ASD core symptoms as well as aggression and behavioral problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tudor et al., 2012</xref>). Although a great number of studies documented sleep problems in ASD, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>To better understand the mechanisms underlying sleep problems in ASD, we need animal models that closely recapitulate sleep phenotypes observed in clinical populations. The study of genetic animal models of ASD, in which a genetic abnormality that is known to be associated with ASD is introduced, has provided valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ASD. These models include Fragile X syndrome, 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, cortical dysplasia-focal epilepsy (CDFE) syndrome and mutations in neuroligins, neurexins and shank genes among others. Sleep research in animal models of ASD is limited and has not yet revealed the underlying mechanisms. Studies using a fly model of Fragile X syndrome reported an increase in sleep which is in contrast to what is observed in the clinical population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bushey et al., 2009</xref>). The opposite phenotype was reported in a Fragile X mouse model, displaying instead an age-dependent reduction in activity during the light phase (i.e the mouse subjective night) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boone et al., 2018</xref>). Mice with a missense mutation in Neuroligin 3 show normal sleep behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), but neuroligin 1 knockout mice spend more time asleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">El Helou et al., 2013</xref>). Mutant rat models of CDFE syndrome show longer waking periods while the mutant mice show fragmented wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Thomas et al., 2017</xref>). Mice carrying a 16p11.2 deletion syndrome sleep less than wild-type mice, but only males are affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Angelakos et al., 2017</xref>). More importantly, problems of sleep onset, the most prominent feature of sleep problems in ASD patients, have not been evaluated in animal models of ASD.</p>
<p>In this study, we examined sleep in Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) patients with Shank3 mutations and in a mutant mouse with a deletion in Shank3 exon 21 (Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup>). PMS is a syndromic form of ASD characterized by gene deletions affecting the human chromosomal region 22q13.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Phelan and McDermid, 2012</xref>), particularly the neuronal structural gene <italic>Shank3</italic>. Individuals with PMS have high rates of intellectual disability, difficulties in communication and motor function, and approximately 84&#x0025; fit the core diagnostic criteria for ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Soorya et al., 2013</xref>). There is also a high rate of sleep problems in PMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bro et al., 2017</xref>). Mice with mutations in <italic>Shank3</italic> recapitulate multiple features of both ASD and PMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bozdagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dhamne et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jaramillo et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kouser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pe&#x00E7;a et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Speed et al., 2015</xref>), including cognitive impairment, deficits in social behavior, and impaired motor coordination. We show that PMS patients have trouble falling and staying asleep similar to what is observed in the general ASD population. We also show that Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice sleep less than wild type mice when sleep pressure is high, have reduced sleep intensity (using an accepted electroencephalographic (EEG) metric) under baseline conditions and have delayed sleep onset following sleep deprivation. Our genome-wide gene expression studies show that sleep deprivation sharply increases the differences in gene expression between mutants and wild types, downregulating circadian transcription factors <italic>Per3</italic>, <italic>Dec2</italic>, <italic>Hef</italic>, <italic>Tlf</italic>, and <italic>Reverb&#x03B1;</italic>. We also show that Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice are unable to sustain wheel-running activity in constant darkness. Overall we show that Shank3 is an important modulator of sleep that may exert its effect through the regulation of circadian transcription factors. Our findings may lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep problems in ASD. This may one day lead to the development of successful treatments or interventions for this debilitating comorbidity.</p>

<title>Phelan McDermid syndrome patients have problems falling and staying asleep</title>
<p>Recent studies suggest that sleep problems may be present in a substantial number of PMS patients and may be an important factor for caregiver&#x2019;s well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bro et al., 2017</xref>). We obtained genetic and sleep questionnaire data from the Phelan McDermid Foundation International Registry (PMSIR) to estimate the frequency and age of onset of sleep problems in PMS individuals carrying a Shank3 deletion. In parallel, we carried out a meta-analysis of clinical literature to estimate the prevalence of sleep problems in ASD and typically developing populations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that PMS patients have trouble falling asleep and experience multiple night awakenings starting at about 5 years of age. Those difficulties translate to reduced time asleep, particularly during adolescence. Although total sleep time seems to improve in adulthood, that improvement seems to be accompanied by an increase in parasomnias. Problems falling and staying asleep persist regardless of age. The frequency of problems falling and staying asleep in PMS patients is similar to what is observed in the general ASD population and much higher than in typically developing individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1tblS1">Figure 1 &#x2013; table supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice sleep less during the dark phase and show reduced sleep intensity</title>
<p>To determine if Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice had deficits in spontaneous sleep, undisturbed baseline EEG and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were obtained from wild type (WT) and Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice. There were no differences between WT and Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice in time spent in wakefulness or sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), bout number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2 &#x2013; figure supplement 1A</xref>), or bout duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2 &#x2013; figure supplement 1B</xref>) in the light period. The two exceptions were that 1) there was a time &#x00D7; genotype effect for REM sleep during hours 1 &#x2013; 6 and 2) REM bouts were of longer duration in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice during hours 7 &#x2013; 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2 &#x2013; figure supplement 1B</xref>). There were also no differences in time in wakefulness or sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or bout measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2 &#x2013; figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) for the first half of the dark period (hours 13 &#x2013; 18). However during hours 19 &#x2013; 24, Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice spent more time in wakefulness and less time in NREM and REM sleep compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice also had longer waking bouts, shorter NREM and REM bouts, and fewer REM bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2 &#x2013; figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). These data show that Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice spend more time awake at the end of the dark phase compared to WT mice under baseline conditions.</p>

<p>Fourier analysis of the EEG indicates that Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice also sleep differently than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2tblS1">Figure 2 &#x2013; table supplement 1</xref>). During wakefulness, Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice showed enhanced power in the alpha band during the light period as well as enhanced delta power and blunted theta power during the dark period. During NREM sleep, delta power was blunted and theta and alpha bands were enhanced for Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice during the light and dark periods. During REM sleep, the alpha band was elevated in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice compared to WT during the light period. Because NREM delta power is a measure of sleep intensity or depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Achermann and Borbely, 2017</xref>), these data suggest that Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice sleep less deeply under baseline conditions.</p>

<title>Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice have abnormal homeostatic responses to sleep deprivation</title>
<p>To investigate sleep homeostasis in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> we sleep deprived mutant and WT mice for 5 hours via gentle handling starting at light onset and sacrificed immediately post-SD. Both WT and Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice showed homeostatic responses to SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3 &#x2013; figure supplement 1</xref>) with reduced wakefulness and increased time spent in NREM and REM sleep during the recovery phase. This response was delayed until the dark period in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3 &#x2013; figure supplement 1B</xref>). Sleep was more consolidated after SD for both WT and Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S2">Figure 3 &#x2013; figure supplement 2A &#x2013; B</xref>), but Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice had fewer NREM bouts/h for hours 13 &#x2013; 18. In the last 6 h of the dark period, Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice spent more time awake and less time in NREM and REM sleep post-SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3 &#x2013; figure supplement 1C</xref>) which is consistent with baseline data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Overall, Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice showed homeostatic increases in sleep and consolidation of arousal states during recovery sleep, but this response was delayed in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice compared to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3 &#x2013; figure supplement 1</xref> &#x2013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S2">2</xref>). Changes in NREM EEG delta power were similar between WT and Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice, indicating that mutant mice accumulate sleep pressure similarly to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice showed a transient enhancement of power in the higher frequencies (3.9 &#x2013; 19.5 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) compared to WT mice in the first 2 h post-SD (hours 6 &#x2013; 7) that resolved to baseline and WT values during hours 11 &#x2013; 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Overall, these data, as well as depressed NREM baseline delta power, suggest the presence of abnormal sleep homeostasis in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice.</p>

<p>Remarkably, Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice took longer to enter NREM sleep post-SD compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As a consequence, Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice spent less time in NREM sleep compared to WT during the first 2 h of recovery sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). During the subsequent 5 h of the light period (hours 8 &#x2013; 12), Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice spent more time in NREM sleep compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Overall our data show that Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice have difficulties falling asleep despite heightened sleep pressure.</p>

<title>Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice show downregulation of circadian transcription factors in response to sleep deprivation</title>
<p>We conducted a genome-wide gene expression study to investigate the molecular basis for the Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mouse phenotype Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> and WT adult male mice were subjected to 5 hours of SD starting at light onset. Mice from both genotypes were sacrificed at the same time of day to determine differences in gene-expression under home cage conditions (HC). Prefrontal cortex was collected for all animals and subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq, n &#x003D; 5 per group). As expected, sleep deprivation is the greatest source of variation in the data, followed by the genotype effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, the difference between genotypes is increased after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which greatly increases the number of differentially expressed genes between Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> and WT mice, starting at 67 genes (HC) and doubling to 136 genes (SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, Figure 4 &#x2013; table supplement 1; FDR &#x003C; 0.5) Most of the differences in gene expression following SD are not present in HC conditions.</p>

</fig>
<p>Clustering of gene expression patterns for all genes differentially expressed between Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> and WT mice reveals 3 groups of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Cluster 1 contains genes that are downregulated in mutants versus WT mice under HC conditions. Genes in this cluster are also downregulated in response to SD in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice but are generally unaffected by SD in WT mice. SD seems to exacerbate the difference between genotypes, which explains why differential expression of some of the genes in cluster 1 only reach statistical significance after SD. This cluster contains the majority of the genes that are differentially expressed between genotypes. Cluster 2 contains genes that are upregulated in mutants versus WT mice under HC conditions that are also downregulated by SD in WT mice. Cluster 3 contains genes that are normally upregulated by SD. For both clusters 2 and 3, the Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mutation seems to dampen the response to SD.</p>
<p>To better understand the impact of the gene expression at the pathway level, we carried out functional annotation of transcripts differentially expressed between Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, Table 1 &#x2013; table supplement 1). Our results revealed that MAPK/GnRH signaling and circadian rhythm-associated transcripts are downregulated in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice, and that sleep deprivation exacerbates that difference. Circadian transcription factors are particularly affected. For example, while expression of <italic>Per3</italic>, <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> is already different under homecage conditions, SD leads to a genotype specific difference in expression of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> (<italic>Reverb&#x03B1;</italic>) and <italic>Bhlhe41</italic> (<italic>Dec2</italic>). All of the above mentioned circadian transcription factors belong to cluster 1 on our heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) showing downregulation in response to SD only in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice.</p>

<title>Wheel-running activity in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice is impaired in constant darkness</title>
<p>The results of our RNA-seq analysis revealed a general downregulation of circadian transcription factors in the mutants. These findings suggested that Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice might also have abnormal circadian rhythms. To test this we measured wheel-running activity in Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> and WT mice. Wheel running data were collected for 2 weeks under LD (LD weeks 2 &#x2013; 3; Figure 6 and Figure 6 &#x2013; figure supplement 1). Alpha, the length of activity period, was calculated as the time between activity onset and offset. Period length and alpha length did not differ between Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). However, Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice ran fewer revolutions/day compared to WT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Mice were then released into constant darkness (DD) for 3 weeks. There was no difference between Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> and WT mice for period length during the DD period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice showed significant but small decreases in alpha length compared to WT during DD weeks 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice also continued to run less than WT mice for the entire DD period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, there was a significant genotype &#x00D7; time interaction effect for wheel running activity from LD week 3 &#x2013; DD week 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, Table 2 - table supplement 1). Some Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice greatly reduced their running at certain periods of the DD period, which is reflected in variance for period, alpha, and activity measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5S1">Figure 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Daily checks were made to verify that each running wheel was transmitting data and that no light was detected in the room during constant darkness. Overall, these data indicate that constant darkness impairs wheel-running activity of Shank3<sup>&#x0394;C</sup> mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study is the first to establish a role for <italic>Shank3</italic> in mammalian sleep. We show that both PMS patients and <italic>Shank3</italic> mutant mice have trouble falling asleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). This phenotype is widely observed in the ASD population and until now had not been replicated in animal models. Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup> mice have problems falling asleep when sleep pressure is high, such as the end of the dark period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or following sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> &#x2013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">E</xref>). They also sleep less deeply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, they show no gross abnormalities in sleep homeostasis or circadian rhythms, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that the primary deficit is in sleep onset.</p>
<p>Our molecular studies show that sleep deprivation increases differences in gene expression between Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These differences point to the downregulation of circadian transcription factors and genes involved in the MAPK/GnRH pathways in the mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Circadian transcription factors affected include <italic>Per3</italic>, <italic>Hlf</italic>, <italic>Tef</italic>, <italic>Reverb&#x03B1;</italic> and <italic>Dec2</italic>. We therefore investigated the effects of our <italic>Shank3</italic> mutation in circadian rhythms. Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup> mice do not show a disruption in circadian rhythmicity but a large reduction in wheel-running activity in response to constant darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that the mutant sleep phenotype involves clock gene function outside of their central time-keeping role. Interestingly mutations in some of the circadian transcription factors we identified, <italic>Per3</italic> and <italic>Dec2</italic>, indeed lead to deficits in sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Archer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hirano et al., 2018</xref>). Our results support a role of clock genes in influencing sleep outside of their roles in generating circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Franken, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>An interesting question is how can deletion of exon 21 of Shank3 lead to dysregulation of transcriptional and signaling pathways linked to sleep and sleep loss? Exon 21 of Shank3 encodes the homer and cortactin interaction domains of the protein. Homer interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and Shank3/homer complexes anchor mGluRs to the synapse. Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup> mice show a marked reduction of the major isoforms of Shank3 as well as an increase of mGluRs at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kouser et al., 2013</xref>). mGluR signaling activates the MAPK/ERK pathway, a key regulator of activity-dependent transcription and synaptic plasticity in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Thomas and Huganir, 2004</xref>). So the role of SHANK3 at the synaptic membrane explains the observed regulation of MAPK pathway genes. However, circadian transcription factors act within the nucleus. Interestingly, SHANK3 is known to undergo synaptic-nuclear shuttling in response to neuronal activity and interact with nuclear ribonucleoproteins and components of the RNA Pol II mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grabrucker et al., 2014</xref>). Deletion of the c-terminus leads to nuclear accumulation of SHANK3 and alterations in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cochoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grabrucker et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, mutations in exon 21 of <italic>Shank3</italic> could lead to deficits in transcriptional regulation in response to sleep deprivation through direct regulation of transcription in the nucleus. Yeast-two hybrid data shows that SHANK3 can directly bind the circadian transcription factors REVERB&#x03B1; (NR1D1) and DEC1 (BHLHE40), a close paralog of DEC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sakai et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we propose that SHANK3 acts as a scaffolding protein in the nucleus that helps assemble protein complexes that are key for the regulation of sleep onset via circadian transcription factors.</p>

<title>Sleep questionnaire study</title>
<p>Sleep questionnaire data for PMS patients was obtained through a data access agreement with the PMSIR. The PMSIR contains demographic, clinical and genetic data on PMS patients. Parents and caregivers are able to create a profile on behalf of the patient, enter demographic data, complete questionnaires on symptoms and development, and upload files such as genetic test reports and other medical records. Trained genetic counselors curate all genetic data to ensure each patient has as complete and accurate of a &#x201C;genetic profile&#x201D; as possible. Researchers may apply for data exports containing de-identified clinical data, developmental data and genetic data. Once approved, the appropriate search is performed in the database and the results are provided to the researcher. Data in this study corresponds to a database export performed on 12/1/2016 containing the results of a sleep questionnaire completed by caregivers, as well as biographic and genetic information of PMS individuals. Problems with sleep onset are defined as more than an hour to fall asleep. Multiple night awakenings are defined as more than two. Reduced sleep time is defined as less than 6 hours per night. Parasomnias are defined as abnormal movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, and dreams that occur while falling asleep or sleeping. Presence of sleep apnea is defined as having received a diagnosis. Only individuals with a genetic counselor confirmed deletion of the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene were included in the analysis.

<title>EEG / EMG data acquisition and analysis</title>
<p>EEG and EMG data were collected with Grass 7 polygraph hardware (Natus Medical Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA) via a light-weight, counterbalanced cable, amplified, and digitized at 200 Hz using VitalRecorder acquisition software (SleepSign for Animal, Kissei Comtec Co., LTD, Nagano, Japan). EEG and EMG data were high- and low-pass filtered at 0.3 and 100 Hz and 10 and 100 Hz, respectively.</p>
<p>Wakefulness and sleep states were determined by visual inspection of the EEG waveform, EMG activity, and fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis by an experimenter blinded to the genotype. Data were scored as wakefulness, NREM sleep, or REM sleep with 4-s resolution using SleepSign for Animal as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Halassa et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and R statistical language. Data are presented as means &#x00B1; standard error of the mean (SEM). A general linear model for repeated measures using time (hours) as the repeated measure and genotype (WT vs. Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup>) or manipulation (undisturbed baseline vs. 5 h sleep deprivation) as the between subjects factor was used when multiple measurements were made over time (i.e. time in stage, hourly NREM delta power). Comparisons between genotypes (WT vs. Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup>) or manipulations (undisturbed baseline vs. 5 h sleep deprivation) were performed with paired or unpaired Student&#x2019;s t-test as appropriate for bout analyses, spectral bands, latency to state, and total time in stage. Latency to NREM or REM sleep after sleep deprivation was defined as time elapsed from release to recovery sleep to the first bout of NREM sleep (bout &#x2265; 28 s or 7 consecutive epochs) or REM sleep (bout &#x2265; 16 s or 4 consecutive epochs).</p>
<p>The EEG was subjected to fast Fourier transform analysis to produce power spectra between 0 &#x2013; 20 Hz with 0.781 Hz resolution. Delta (&#x03B4;) was defined as 0.5 &#x2013; 4 Hz, theta (&#x03B8;) as 5 &#x2013; 9 Hz, and alpha (&#x03B1;) as 10 &#x2013; 15 Hz. For comparison of light and dark period spectral data, each spectral bin was expressed as a percentage of the total state-specific EEG power (0 &#x2013; 20 Hz) of the baseline 12 h light period and 12 h dark period, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baracchi and Opp, 2008</xref>). The relation between EEG spectral power and frequency under baseline conditions was fit to smooth curves and 95&#x0025; confidence intervals for the respective light and dark periods. The analysis was performed via Generalized Additive Models (GAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">T.J. Hastie and R.J. Tibshirani, 1990</xref>) using the R package mgcf (v. 3.5.0). For hourly NREM delta power analysis, spectral values within the delta band for each hour were normalized to the average NREM delta band value of the last 4 h of the baseline light period (zeitgeber time (ZT) 8 &#x2013; 11) and expressed as a percentage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Franken et al., 2001</xref>). Changes in individual NREM EEG spectral bins (0 &#x2013; 20 Hz) were normalized to corresponding baseline spectral bins obtained from mean values from the last 4 h of the baseline light period (ZT8 &#x2013; 11).

<p>Differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR (v. 3.20.9) with a factorial design that included genotype (WT or Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup>) and treatment (homecage control or sleep deprivation). We specified the following contrasts: wild type sleep deprived vs wild type homecage controls (WTSD vs. WTHC); Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup> sleep deprived vs Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup> homecage controls (S3SD vs. S3HC); Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup> controls vs wild type controls (S3HC vs. WTHC); and Shank3<sup>&#x2206;C</sup> sleep deprived vs wild type sleep deprived (S3HC vs. WTHC). To gain insight on the different effects of sleep deprivation between wild type and mutant, we considered the union of the differentially expressed genes between genotypes both in controls and sleep deprived mice. We clustered the genes using k-means (k &#x003D; 3) and the samples using hierarchical clustering based on the selected genes.

A linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate the contributions of genotype and the interaction between genotype and time for wheel running activity for LD week 3 through DD week 3. The model was fitted using genotype, time, and their interaction as fixed effects, and the individual mice were labeled as a random effect. The analysis was conducted with the R package nlme (v. 3.5.0) and is publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/drighelli/peixoto">https://github.com/drighelli/peixoto</ext-link>.</p>
