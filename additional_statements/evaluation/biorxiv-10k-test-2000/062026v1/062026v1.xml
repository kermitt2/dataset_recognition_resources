<title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: CRISPR-Cas is a recent and powerful edition to the molecular toolbox which allows programmable genome editing. It has been used to modify genes in a wide variety of organisms, but only two alga to date. Here we present a methodology to edit the genome of <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>, a model centric diatom with both ecological significance and high biotechnological potential, using CRISPR-Cas.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: A single construct wa assembled using Golden Gate cloning. Two sgRNAs were used to introduce a precise 37nt deletion early in the coding region of the urease gene. A high percentage of bi-allelic mutations (&#x2264; 61.5&#x0025;) were observed in clones with the CRISPR-Cas construct. Growth of bi-allelic mutants in urea led to a significant reduction in growth rate and cell size compared to growth in nitrate.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: CRISPR-Cas can precisely and efficiently edit the genome of <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>. The use of Golden Gate cloning to assemble CRISPR-Cas constructs gives additional flexibility to the CRISPR-Cas method and facilitates modifications to target alternative genes or species.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Diatoms are ecologically important microalgae with high biotechnological potential. Since their appearance about 240 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], they have spread and diversified to occupy a wide range of niches across both marine and freshwater habitats. Diatom genomes have been shaped by secondary endosymbiosis and horizontal gene transfer resulting in genes derived from heterotrophic hosts, autotrophic endosymbionts and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. They play a key role in carbon cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], the food chain, oil deposition and account for about 20&#x0025; of the world&#x2019;s annual primary production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. However, they are perhaps best known for their intricate silica frustules which give diatoms a range of ecological advantages and play a key role for carbon sequestration and silica deposition.</p>
<p>Several aspects of diatom physiology including the silica frustule, lipid storage and photosynthesis are being applied to biotechnology. Areas of high interest include nanotechnology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], drug delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], solar capture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and bioactive compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the ecological importance of diatoms and their applications for biotechnology, it is pivotal that the necessary tools are available to study and manipulate them at a molecular level. This includes the ability to replace, tag, edit and impair genes. A recent edition to the genetic tool box, CRISPR-Cas, allows double strand breaks (DSBs) to be introduced at specific target sequences. This adapted mechanism, used by bacteria and archaea in nature as a defence system against viruses, facilitates knock-out by the introduction of mutations through repair by error prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). This requires both a Cas9 to cut the DNA and a sgRNA to guide it to a specific sequence. Further information on the history and application of CRISPR-Cas can be found in several excellent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), meganucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have also been used to induce double strand breaks. TALENs and CRISPR-Cas both bring flexibility and specificity to gene editing, however CRISPR-Cas is also cheap, efficient and easily adapted to different sequences by simply changing the 20nt guide sequence in the sgRNA.</p>
<p>So far, within the diverse group of algae, the diploid, pennate diatom <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and the haploid, green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] have been subject to gene editing by CRISPR-Cas. NHEJ and HR have been used to repair DSBs following CRISPR-Cas or TALENs in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>, introducing mutations into a nuclear coded chloroplast signal recognition particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], the urease gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and several genes associated with lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic> is a logical choice for CRISPR-Cas development. It is a model centric diatom with a sequenced genome (first eukaryotic marine phytoplankton to be sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]) and well-established transformation systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The genus has multiple biotechnology applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], and although gene silencing has been established, a method to easily and efficiently knockout and edit genes and the entire genome would be highly advantageous. The genus <italic>Thalassiosira</italic> is among the top 10 genera of diatoms in the World&#x2019;s Ocean in terms of ribotype (V9 of 18S) diversity and abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] and the species <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> is a model for understanding the mechanisms behind silicification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Golden Gate cloning can add further flexibility to CRISPR-Cas methods as demonstrated in higher plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. As a modular cloning system it allows different modules, including the sgRNA, to be easily interchanged or added [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. As a result, new constructs can be made quickly, cheaply and efficiently for new or multiple targets. This extends to any aspect of the construct, including promoters, Cas9 variants and their nuclear localisation signals (NLS). As a result, construct alterations such as replacing constitutive promoters for inducible ones, exchanging the wildtype Cas9 for a Cas9 nickase or changing the localisation signal to target other organelles can be easily carried out.</p>
<p>An increasing range of software tools are available for CRISPR-Cas, including programs that facilitate sgRNA target searches in a genetic locus of interest, estimate efficiencies of sgRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and perform off-target predictions.</p>
<p>While off-target prediction tools tend to be species specific, there are tools that accept requests for a genome to be added to the list, or allow for a genome to be directly uploaded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. The latter is particularly useful for less studied organisms, such as diatoms. The ability to combine several different aspects of sgRNA design can help to make an informed decision when choosing target sites for gene editing.</p>
<p>Our paper represents a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of gene editing in the model diatom <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> using two sgRNAs to induce a precise deletion in the urease gene. Methods combine a flexible Golden Gate cloning approach with sgRNA design, which draws on several available online tools. This takes into account multiple factors, such as position within the gene in terms of both early protein disruption and presence in the coding region, DNA cutting efficiency and presence of restriction enzyme sites at the cut site. The latter, in combination with inducing a large deletion by targeting with two sgRNAs, allows easy screening of mutants through either the restriction enzyme site loss assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] or the PCR band-shift assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], respectively.</p>

<title>5&#x2019; RACE U6 promoter</title>
<p>To identify the U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>, an NCBI blastn search was performed on the genome against the central conserved region of the U6 sequence. Two potential guanine (G) start sites were found downstream of a TATA box in the promoter. To identify the start site of the U6 snRNA and empirically determine the end of the promoter, 5&#x2019; RACE was carried out as follows: 400ml of culture was grown to exponential phase (1&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and harvested. Small RNAs were extracted and enriched using a miRNeasy kit (Qiagen). 5&#x2019; template switching oligo RACE was performed according to Pinto and Lindblad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].

<title>sgRNA design for the urease gene knockout</title>
<p>Two sgRNAs were designed to cut 37nt apart early in the coding region of the urease gene (JGI ID 30193) to induce a deletion and frame-shift. Several programmes, explained below, were used to collect data and make an informed decision on sgRNA choice. Excel was used to combine, process and compare data.</p>
<sec id="s2d1">
<title><underline>Selecting CRISPR-Cas targets and estimating on-target score</underline></title>
<p>Twenty bp targets with an NGG PAM were identified and scored for on-target efficiency using the Broad Institute sgRNA design programme (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design">www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design</ext-link>), which utilises the Doench et al.

<title><underline>Determining cut positions and cross referencing to restriction recognition sites</underline></title>
<p>All restriction sites and their positions within the urease gene were identified using the Emboss restriction tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://emboss.bioinformatics.nl/">http://emboss.bioinformatics.nl/</ext-link>). As the Broad Institute sgRNA design programme does not give the location of CRISPR-Cas targets within a gene, this was determined using Primer map (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/primer_map.html">http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/primer_map.html</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]). The cut site position (3nt upstream of the start of the PAM sequence) was calculated for each sgRNA depending on sense or anti-sense strand placement.

The final spreadsheet gives data on CRlSPR-Cas target sequences and their sense sequence (if located on the antisense strand), location of target (relative to the sense strand), predicted CRlSPR-Cas cut site, first nucleotide of the target, PAM sequence, location (i.e. exon, intron), strand, sgRNA score and restriction recognition sites overlapping the cut site. The table (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) was sorted to prioritise sgRNAs by starting base prioritising guanine, sgRNA score, position within the gene and interaction with restriction recognition sites.</p>

<title><underline>Predicting off-targets</underline></title>
<p>The full 20nt target sequences and their 3&#x2019; 12nt seed sequences were subjected to a nucleotide BLAST search against the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> genome. Resulting homologous sequences were checked for presence of an adjacent NGG PAM sequence at the 3&#x2019; end. The 8nt sequence outside of the seed sequence was manually checked for complementarity to the target sequence. ln order for a site to be considered a potential off-target the seed sequence had to match, a PAM had to be present at the 3&#x2019; end of the sequence and a maximum of three mismatches between the target and sequences from the blast search were allowed outside of the seed sequence.</p>
<p>Off-targets were also checked using the EuPaGDT program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], which checks for up to 5 mismatches in the 20nt target sequence and the CasOT program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], which uses flexible parameters for identifying off-target sequences. Parameters were set to check for an NGG PAM, complete complementarity within the 12nt seed sequence and up to 3 mismatches outside of the seed region.</p>

<title>Transformation and selection</title>
<p>Using the Poulsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] method, transformations were carried out in triplicate with the CRlSPR-Cas construct, pTpfcp/nat (positive control) and water (negative control). Five &#x00D7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells in exponential phase were used per shot with a rupture disc of 1350psi and a 7cm flight distance. Following transformation, cells were rinsed into 25ml of media and left to recover for 24 hours under standard growth conditions. Cells were counted using a Coulter counter (Beckman) and 2.5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells from each transformation were spread onto 5, &#x00BD; salinity Aquil 0.8&#x0025; agar plates (5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ plate) with 100&#x03BC;g ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> nourseothricin.

<title>sgRNA design</title>
<p>The two CRISPR-Cas targets with the highest on target scores (0.5 and 0.79), containing a predicted cut site over a restriction site and occurring early in the coding region, were chosen. sgRNAs were designed to cut 37nt apart at positions 138 and 175 within the urease gene. Both targets started with a G for polymerase III transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). No off-target sites were predicted for sgRNAs designed for either of the two CRISPR-Cas target sequences.</p>

<title>Constructing the CRISPR-Cas plasmid using the Golden Gate cloning method</title>
<p>A single CRISPR-Cas construct was made using Golden Gate cloning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The construct included the NAT selectable marker and Cas9:YFP driven by an endogenous FCP promoter for high expression and two U6 promoter-driven sgRNAs. RNA polymerase III U6 promoters are a popular choice for expression of sgRNAs in CRISPR-Cas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. RACE products showed that the U6 promoter ended 23nt after the TATA box. As a standardised, efficient, modular system, Golden Gate cloning gives a high level of flexibility to the CRISPR-Cas method and bypasses the need for cotransformation as it enables assembly of multiple expression units, such as Cas9 and sgRNAs, into a single vector backbone. Multiple sgRNA modules can be incorporated into the construct to target several genes or whole pathways. In human cells, up to 7 sgRNAs have been successfully assembled and expressed from a single construct created using the Golden Gate cloning method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Golden Gate has also proved successful for building constructs for genome editing in higher plants using both TALENs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] and CRISPR-Cas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, only the promoters and target sequences are specific to <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>, which demonstrates how simple it can be to apply this method to a new species using the Golden Gate system. The <italic>S. pyrogenes</italic> Cas9 with a human codon bias, shown previously to work in higher plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], carries a SV40 NLS, which follows a canonical sequence found throughout eukaryotes, including <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>.</p>
<p>The long term effects from off-target mutations introduced through CRISPR-Cas are currently unknown, therefore it may be advantageous for future work to remove CRISPR-Cas constructs from mutants. Adding a yeast CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3 sequence to plasmids allows autonomous replication in diatoms and expression of genes without random integration into the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, removing selection leads to plasmids being discarded. By expressing CRISPR-Cas genes and selective markers on a removable episome, mutations could be introduced without integration of the plasmid. CRISPR-Cas constructs could then be expelled by removing selection. As well as considerations for long term off-target effects, this could also be advantageous for studies and applications which are sensitive to the presence of transgenes.</p>

<title>Selecting and screening for mutations in the urease gene</title>
<p>The transformation efficiency with the CRISPR-Cas construct was on average 41.5 colonies &#x03BC;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> plasmid (13.35-66.65 colonies &#x03BC;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> plasmid). Thirty three colonies were screened by PCR and sequencing of the targeted urease gene fragment.</p>
<p>Four colonies showed mutations in the urease gene. All colonies screened positive for NAT but only the four colonies with mutations screened positive for Cas9, suggesting that once the Cas9 and sgRNAs are present there is a high chance of inducing mutations in the target gene. The lack of Cas9, which accounts for a third of the construct, in the majority of colonies was potentially caused by shearing of the plasmid during microparticle bombardment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] from either mechanical force or chemical breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Of the four primary colonies which screened positive for mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), one (M4) showed a single band with a 37nt deletion between the two sgRNA cut sites which suggests that both copies of the urease gene contain the deletion giving a bi-allelic mutant. Two colonies (M2 and M3) produced two bands following PCR: a WT higher MW band and a lower MW band with the 37nt deletion, confirmed by sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The fourth colony (M1) showed a single band associated with the WT urease, however sequencing showed two products: a WT urease and a mutant urease with a 4nt deletion at the first sgRNA cut site. A mixture of PCR products may be due to a mono-allelic mutation, in which one allele is WT and the other displays a mutation. It can also be due to colony mosaicism where a colony contains a mixture of cells with WT and mutant alleles due to mutations occurring after transformed cells have started to divide. Both mono-allelic mutants and mosaic colonies have been observed in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>To determine if the colonies were mosaic or mono-allelic, cells from mutant clones producing mixed PCR products were spread onto selective plates to isolate single sub-clones. Thirty four sub-clones from each clone were screened by PCR (a few examples are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Two clones (M2 and M3) were mosaic with a mixture of sub-clones showing either a single band corresponding to the expected deletion (61.5&#x0025; and 25&#x0025;, respectively), two bands associated with the WT and expected deletion (25.5&#x0025; and 28.1&#x0025;, respectively) or a single band corresponding to the WT urease fragment (13&#x0025; and 46.9&#x0025; respectively). For each of the two clones PCR amplicons from three putative bi-allelic sub-clones were sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Four out of six (M2_9, M2_10, M3_10 and M3_11) showed the expected 37nt &#x2018;clean&#x2019; deletion without any additional mutations. Precise deletions, such as this, using 2 sgRNAs have previously been generated with high efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], and allow a large degree of control over the mutation. Two of the sub-clones (M3_9 and M2_12) showed one allele with the expected 37nt deletion and the other with an additional deletion at the 2<sup>nd</sup> sgRNA cut site. In addition, M2_12 showed a C&#x002D;&#x003E;G SNP within the sgRNA1 target site. Sub-clones derived from the M1 clone showed WT and 4nt deletion PCR amplicons as seen in the original clone, suggesting that this clone may have a mono-allelic mutation.</p>
<p>Using CRISPR-Cas with one sgRNA can introduce a variety of indels into a locus of interest via the error-prone NHEJ DNA repair mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Cas9 preferentially cuts DNA three nucleotides upstream of the PAM sequence in the seed region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] and the NHEJ mechanism either repairs a double strand break perfectly or indels are introduced. If cut sites are not cleaved at the same time, when using two sgRNAs, mutations at each site rather than removal of the fragment in between target sites may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. In this study, however, we report a high occurrence of bi-allelic mutants with precise deletions between the CRISPR-Cas cut sites, suggesting that the Cas9/sgRNA complex is cutting efficiently and DNA ends tend to be repaired perfectly. This allows control over the introduced mutations and gives the chance to avoid introducing in-frame indels.</p>
<p>Restriction digest (results not shown) and sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) demonstrated loss off the BccI site in all knock-out clones and HpaII in M2_12 and M1 as a deletion downstream of the cut site is required to remove the HpaII site. This demonstrates that restriction screening can be a valuable tool, however is this case screening for a deletion based band shift by PCR was an efficient way of identifying bi-allelic mutants especially given the limited sgRNA/restriction site interactions available for this gene.</p>
<p>As well as clones from plate selection, one culture from liquid selection (LM1; population of cells transferred to liquid selective media after transformation), showed a single band associated with the bi-allelic 37nt deletion following PCR. This was confirmed by sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). PCR screening following growth of LM1 in urea showed only the lower MW band product (results not shown), giving further evidence for a bi-allelic mutation from a population of cells. As small volumes of cells are transferred to fresh media when passaging this may have isolated bi-allelic mutants.</p>

<title>Growth experiments with mutants</title>
<p>Urease catalyses the breakdown of urea to ammonia allowing it to be used as a source of nitrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Sub-clones from different cell-lines with 37 or 38nt deletions were tested for knock-out of the urease gene by looking for a lack of growth when supplemented with urea as the sole nitrogen source.</p>
<p>Cells were nitrogen starved and then transferred to media with either nitrate or urea. Cell counts, cells size and Fv/Fm were measured daily for 7 days. Negative controls to account for any background nitrate in the media were also run in which no nitrate or urea was added for WT cultures.</p>
<p>Four putative bi-allelic mutants (LM1, M4, M2_10 and M3_9) were tested along with WT and the mono-allelic M1_10 over two growth curve experiments. Both LM1 from liquid selection (p&#x003D;0.0029) and the sub-clone M3_9 (p&#x003D;0.0000001) showed a significant decrease in growth rate in urea compared to nitrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as well as a significant 13-18&#x2025; decrease in cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; p&#x003D;0.0029 and p&#x003D;0, respectively). The latter was also apparent with light microscopy (results not shown). Mutants in urea could be easily discerned even without cell counts, as cultures appeared much paler in colour. M4 did not show a difference in growth rate but did show a significant decrease in cell size (p&#x003D;0.038).The mono-allelic mutant M1_10, displayed higher growth in urea and similar growth to the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This correlates with results from Weyman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] which showed that despite a reduced protein concentration, a mono-allelic urease knock-out was able to grow in urea. M2_10 which screened as a bi-allelic mutant prior to growth experiments showed a smaller but still significant decrease in growth rate (p&#x003D;0.0014) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and cell size (p&#x003D;0.0039) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). PCR screening of the urease gene following growth in nitrate and urea showed the expected bi-allelic mutation for LM1, M3_9 and M4, however M2_10 also showed a faint WT band in nitrate and a strong WT band in urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that M2_10 was mosaic, with cells containing a functional urease out-competing those with a mutant urease. Given that only a faint WT band was present after growth in nitrate this suggests that the majority of the cells from the sub clone contained the mutant urease, initially accounting for the majority of growth and resulting in a lower but still significant decrease in growth rate.</p>

<p>Knock-out of the urease gene in the diatom <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> prevents growth in urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Urease mutants in this study still grew in urea but with a lower growth rate and reduced cell-size, characteristics which are associated with nitrogen limitation in diatoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] rather than nitrogen starvation. Mutant cell-lines in urea grew to the same density as the same cell-lines in nitrate, but at a lower rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As nitrogen is an essential nutrient for growth, this suggests that mutant cells in urea still have access to nitrogen, but lower growth rates and cell-size indicates that nitrogen may not be as readily available compared to cells grown with nitrate. Controls in nitrogen free media showed very little growth which suggests that growth of mutants in urea was not due to residual nitrate in the culture. lt is unlikely that random integration of the CRlSPR-Cas plasmid is responsible for reduced growth rate in mutants as all four individual mutant cell-lines display increased growth rates when grown in nitrate. Therefore it seems likely that impaired growth of urease mutants in urea is due to a reduction in function of the urease gene.</p>
<p>There are a few possible reasons why a mutation in the urease gene appears to lead to nitrogen limitation rather than nitrogen starvation as seen in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>. Cells may be able to access nitrogen from another source, separate to the breakdown of urea via urease. Some algae have an alternative pathway for breakdown of urea but this has only been found in Chlorophyceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] and blast searches show no evidence of urea carboxylase or allophanate hydroxylase, the enzymes involved in this pathway, in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>.</p>
<p>The urease gene may still be active but with lower functionality. In <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> urease is modelled to be 807 amino acids. Urease consists of multimers of three sub-units: gamma, beta and alpha, which in TP are translated as one protein. The alpha sub-unit contains the active site which catalyses the breakdown of urea to ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. The gamma subunit has no known enzymatic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] but may play a role in quaternary structure and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Translations of urease sequences with both 37 and 38nt deletions show frame shifts and early stop codons after the deletion in the gamma sub-unit, leading to major disruption of the gamma sub-unit, nonsense down-stream and short products of 24 or 44 amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Since all mono-clonal bi-allelic mutants tested for growth in urea had either two alleles with a 37nt deletion or both a 37 and 38nt deletion, it was predicted that the urease gene would no longer be functional. However, several mechanisms exist in eukaryotes which can allow translation of the protein from start codons later in the coding region. These include leaky initiation, re-initiation of ribosomes and internal ribosome entry sites (lRES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. lRES have been shown to become active in yeast following amino acid starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. lf an in-frame translation can occur after the deletion at an lRES or via a mechanism such as re-initiation then the active site located in the alpha-subunit could still be present. The first in-frame ATG after the deletion would start translation of the protein just before the beta sub-unit, leading to an N-terminal truncated protein without the gamma sub-unit but with both the beta and alpha sub-units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Earlier start codons are predicted to result in non-sense and early stop codons.</p>
<p>The 5&#x2019; end of the urease coding region was targeted to induce a frame shift and disrupt the protein early on, however it may be better to target the active site or entirely remove the gene. Precise deletions larger than a gene using CRlSPR-Cas and two sgRNAs have been previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>CRISPR-Cas can precisely and efficiently edit the genome of the diatom <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic>. Twelve percent of initial colonies and 100&#x0025; which screened positive for Cas9 showed evidence of a mutation in the urease gene, with many sub-clones showing precise bi-allelic 37nt deletions from two sgRNA DSBs. Screening for the deletion by PCR allowed efficient identification of bi-allelic mutants and Golden Gate cloning allowed easy assembly of a plasmid for CRISPR-Cas. This included adapting the system for <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> by including endogenous promoters and two specific sgRNAs. Due to the flexible modular nature of the cloning system, this can be easily adapted for other genes in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>. A variety of available online tools were used to design two sgRNAs that would target the early coding region of the urease gene. A reduced growth rate and cell-size phenotype was seen in mutant cell-lines grown in urea compared to nitrate, suggesting that function of the urease may have been impaired rather than removed or an alternative source of nitrogen was available.</p>
<p>As potentially the most important tool in gene editing to date, CRISPR-Cas is fast becoming a key method in the molecular toolbox for a large variety of organisms. This efficient method has huge potential for future work from both an ecological and biotechnology perspective in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> and can potentially be easily adapted for many other algal species.</p>
