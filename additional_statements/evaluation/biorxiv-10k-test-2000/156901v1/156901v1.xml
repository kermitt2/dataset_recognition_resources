<p>Caspase-8, which is essential for death receptor-mediated apoptosis, inhibits necroptosis by suppressing the function of RIPK1 and RIPK3 to activate MLKL. We show that knockdown of <italic>caspase-8</italic> expression in embryoid bodies derived from ES cells markedly enhances retinoic acid (RA)-induced cell differentiation and necroptosis, both of which are dependent on <italic>Ripkl</italic> and <italic>Ripk3.</italic> RA treatment obviously enhanced the expression of RA-specific genes having a retinoic acid response element <italic>(RARE)</italic> to induce cell differentiation, and induced marked expression of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL to stimulate necroptosis. <italic>Caspase-8</italic> knockdown induced RA receptor (RAR) to form a complex with RIPK1 and RIPK3 in the nucleus, and RAR interacting with RIPK1 and RIPK3 showed much stronger binding activity to <italic>RARE</italic> than RAR without RIPK1 or RIPK3. In Caspase-8-deficient mouse embryos, expression of RA-specific genes was obviously enhanced. Thus, caspase-8, RIPK1, and RIPK3 regulate RA-induced cell differentiation and necroptosis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Apoptosis is an important physiological cell suicide mechanism essential for normal embryonic development and the maintenance of homeostasis in adult tissues. Caspases, members of the cysteine protease family, play an essential role in the induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Alnemri, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Chinnaiyan et al., 1997</xref>). Two major pathways of mammalian apoptosis are known, a pathway through mitochondria (intrinsic pathway) and a pathway through death receptors (extrinsic pathway) (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Green, 2005</xref>). Both pathways require the activation of a variety of caspases, which are known to be pro-enzymes activated by cleavage at aspartate residues upon death signaling (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Salvesen and Dixit, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Caspase-8 was originally identified as an initiator caspase and mainly functions in the death receptor pathway of apoptosis. Upon ligation of a death receptor such as Fas ( <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Yonehara et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Itoh et al., 1991</xref>), caspase-8 is recruited to a complex known as a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) together with other factors including Fas, Fas-associated death domain (FADD) (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Muzio et al., 1996</xref>). Within the complex, proximity-induced auto-cleavage through homo-oligomerization/dimerization catalytically activates caspase-8. The activated caspase-8 transmits the death signal mainly to executor caspases including caspase-3, which then cleave various cellular proteins to complete the apoptosis-inducing process (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">Thornberry and Lazebnik, 1998</xref>). Caspase-8 is unique, with associated critical activities not only to induce apoptosis but also to suppress death receptor-mediated necroptosis ( <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Varfolomeev et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Oberst et al., 2011</xref>). Caspase-8 inhibits necroptosis by suppressing the function of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1 or RIP1) and RIPK3 (or RIP3) (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Hitomi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) to activate MLKL, an executer molecule of necroptosis (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Disruption of <italic>caspase-8 (Casp8)</italic> expression causes embryonic lethality in mice around embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Varfolomeev et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Sakamaki et al., 2002</xref>), which is rescued by depletion of <italic>Ripk3</italic> or <italic>mlkl,</italic> indicating that the embryonic lethality is caused by activation of necroptosis (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Diaz et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Retinoic acid (RA), which is a metabolic product of vitamin A, is a well-established signaling molecule that plays essential roles in vertebrate embryonic body shaping and organogenesis, tissue homeostasis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis by regulating the expression of RA-specific target genes (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Mark, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Duester, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Rhinn and Dolle, 2012</xref>). RA binds to a transcription complex in nucleus, which includes a pair of ligand-activated transcription factors composed of the RA receptor (RAR)-retinoic X receptor (RXR) heterodimer, to induce transcription of RA-specific genes. There are three RAR genes <italic>(Rara, Rarb</italic> and <italic>Rarg)</italic> and three RXR genes <italic>(Rxra, Rxrb</italic> and <italic>Rxrg),</italic> and the heterodimeric pair binds to a DNA sequence called a retinoic acid-response element (RARE) (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Dolle et al., 1989</xref>, <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Mangelsdorf, 1990</xref>, <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Mangelsdorf, 1991</xref>). Genes containing RARE in their promoters are known to be involved in diverse but interrelated biological processes, such as embryogenesis, growth, and differentiation (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Durand et al., 1992</xref>). Following the successful application of RA in the differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), regulation of RA signaling was also related to differentiation, proliferation or apoptosis of tumor cells (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Ablain et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Knockdown of <italic>Caspase-8</italic> Expression Evidently Enhances RA-Induced Cell Differentiation</title>
<p>The roles of caspase-8 on growth, viability and differentiation were investigated in ES cells by utilizing a tetracycline/doxycycline (Dox)-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression (Tet-On) system (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Kobayashi and Yonehara, 2009</xref>) specific for <italic>Casp8</italic> (sh<italic>Casp8)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While <italic>Casp8</italic> expression was clearly down-regulated by treatment with Dox in ES cells with the Tet-On sh<italic>Casp8</italic> system (Tet-On <italic>shCasp8</italic> ES cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), significant effects on neither growth nor viability were observed in the ES cells after treatment with Dox. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> neural differentiation induced by embryoid body (EB) formation (<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>) was comparable in ES cells irrespective of whether <italic>Casp8</italic> expression was down-regulated or not. Interestingly, however, cell differentiation was remarkably enhanced in EBs derived from <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES <italic>(Casp8</italic> KD ES) cells after 6-day treatment with RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>Oct3/4,</italic> a marker of undifferentiated cells, was strongly down-regulated in RA-treated EBs derived from <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and the expression levels of neural differentiation markers, <italic>Nestin</italic> and <italic>Tuj1,</italic> were up-regulated in RA-treated EBs derived from <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES cells relative to control <italic>shGFP</italic> ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). While the expression level of <italic>Casp8</italic> was also up-regulated in the RA-treated EBs, expression of <italic>Casp8</italic> was almost entirely diminished for the entire time in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, KD of <italic>Casp8</italic> expression in ES cells markedly enhances RA-induced neural differentiation.</p>

<p>We then analyzed expression levels of RA-induced genes, <italic>Crabp2, Hoxb1, Cyp26a1</italic> and <italic>Rarb,</italic> which expressions were under the control of RARs and a <italic>RARE</italic> in the respective promoter regions of these genes (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Rossant et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Astrom et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Ogura and Evans, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Loudig et al., 2000</xref>). Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and dual-luciferase reporter analyses revealed that expression levels of all the RA-specific genes and RARE-dependent transcription of luciferase were dramatically elevated in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES cells treated with 1&#x03BC;M RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A,B</xref>). The enhancement of RA-specific genes expression in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES cells was significantly induced by even 10 nM RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, caspase-8 was shown to suppress evident activation of RA signaling in ES cells. While one of the RA-induced genes, which expression were enhanced by KD of <italic>Casp8,</italic> was <italic>Rarb</italic> (RA receptor &#x03B2;), the expression levels of other types of RARs than <italic>Rarb,</italic> such as <italic>Rara, Rarg</italic> and <italic>Rxra</italic> (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">Zelent et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Mattei et al., 1991</xref>), were not influenced by KD of <italic>Casp8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1B</xref>).

<p>The enhancement of RA signaling as well as RA-induced cell differentiation in the absence of <italic>Casp8</italic> expression was observed in not only mouse ES cells but also mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line P19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2 - figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, KD of caspase-8 expression in human RA-sensitive cancer cell lines, SK-N-SH and HL60, clearly enhanced RA signaling and RA-induced differentiation into neural cells expressing <italic>TUJ1</italic> and monocytes expressing <italic>CD11b,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 2 - figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, caspase-8 suppresses marked activation of RA signaling in not only mouse ES cells but also mouse embryonic carcinoma cells and human cancer cells.</p>
<p>To find out whether the protease activity and/or cleavage-associated activation of caspase-8 are necessary for inhibition of the evident activation of RA signaling, rescue experiments were carried out using exogenous expression of KD-resistant wild-type (Wt) or two kinds of <italic>Casp8</italic> mutants, CS and DE, which hold a Cys to Ser mutation in the protease domain (C362S) and 7 Asp to Glu mutations in expected cleavage sites of caspase-8 itself and other caspases, respectively (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Kikuchi et al., 2012</xref>). While expressions of Wt and DE <italic>Casp8</italic> significantly inhibited the evident activation of RA signaling by <italic>Casp8</italic> KD, DE mutant did not really inhibit the activation of RA signaling in Tet-On <italic>shCasp8</italic> P19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 2 - figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). These results show that protease activity of procaspase-8 is indispensable but cleavage-associated activation of procaspase-8 is not necessary for inhibition of the marked activation of RA signaling. We then analyzed the KD effect of <italic>Fadd</italic>, a component of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Chinnaiyan et al., 1997</xref>) and the necrosome (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2009</xref>) using Tet-On sh<italic>Fadd</italic> ES cells, indicating that KD of <italic>Fadd</italic> expression induced evident activation of RA-induced neural differentiation and RA-induced genes expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 2 - figure supplement 4C,D</xref>). Taken together, the protease activity of procaspase-8 and FADD prevent marked activation of RA signaling.</p>

<title>RIPK1 and RIPK3 but MLKL Are Involved in <italic>Caspase-8</italic> KD-Induced Enhancement of RA Signaling</title>
<p>Procaspase-8 and FADD inhibit not only activation of RA signaling but also necroptosis mediated by RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL. We then investigated whether these necroptosis-inducing genes were involved in the enhancement of RA signaling. Intriguingly, the marked enhancement of RA-induced differentiation was cancelled by down-regulated expression of <italic>Ripk3</italic> using sh<italic>Ripk3</italic> in Casp8 KD ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C,D</xref>). The enhancement of RA-specific genes expressions and RARE-dependent transcription of luciferase were also cancelled by down-regulating expression of <italic>Ripk3</italic> in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD P19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E-G</xref>). In addition, <italic>Ripkl</italic> was also shown to be involved in the evident enhancement of RA signaling in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 2 - figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). By contrast, MLKL was not involved in the enhancement of RA signaling in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 2 - figure supplement 5C,D</xref>). We then asked whether the enhancement of RA signaling was mediated by the kinase activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which are required for the induction of necroptosis. In sh<italic>Ripk3</italic>-expressing <italic>Casp8</italic> KD P19 cells, <italic>Casp8</italic> KD-induced enhancement of RA signaling was restored by exogenous expression of shRNA-resistant cDNAs encoding Wt <italic>Ripk3</italic> and a kinase-negative mutant, K51A <italic>Ripk3</italic> (<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E,F</xref>).

<title>KD of <italic>Caspase-8</italic> Expression Induces Nuclear Translocation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 to Form a Complex with RARs</title>
<p>To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the <italic>casoase-8</italic> KD-induced enhancement of RA signaling, we examined the relationship between RIPKs and RA signaling. Since RIPK1 and RIPK3 are localized in the cytoplasm under normal conditions and RA binds to RARs in the nucleus, we at first analyzed whether RIPK1 and RIPK3 can translocate into the nucleus. Treatment of Casp8-expressing P19 cells with Leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of nuclear export of proteins (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2004</xref>), converted subcellular localization of RIPK3 from cytoplasm to both cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). LMB treatment induced not only nuclear localization of RIPK3 but also promotion of RA signaling in a RIPK3-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that RIPK3 in the nucleus enhances RA signaling. In addition, KD of <italic>Casp8</italic> expression as well as treatment with LMB converted subcellular localization of RIPK3 from cytoplasm to both cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C,D</xref>). Taken together, caspase-8 suppresses nuclear localization of RIPK3, and intranuclear RIPK3 may play an important role in the enhanced activation of RA signaling in the absence of caspase-8.</p>

<title>The Complex of RIPK1, RIPK3 and RARs Works in The Coactivator Complex to Enhance RA-Dependent Transcription</title>
<p>To clarify whether the complex of RIPK1, RIPK3 and RARs functions in RA-dependent transcription, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was carried out in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES cells. RA treatment was indicated to notably enhance binding of endogenous RIPK1 to <italic>RARE</italic> of an RA-inducible gene, <italic>Rarb,</italic> specifically in the absence of <italic>Casp8</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). RA treatment also clearly enhanced binding of exogenously expressed Wt and a kinase-negative mutant, K51A RIPK3 to <italic>RARE</italic> of an RA-inducible gene, <italic>Cyp26a1,</italic> in the absence of endogenous <italic>Ripk3</italic> and <italic>Casp8</italic> expressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, KD of Casp8 significantly enhanced RA-induced biding of RARs to <italic>RARE</italic> dependently on <italic>Ripk3</italic> expression but independently on the kinase activity of RIPK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Taken together, RARs, bound to RIPK1 and RIPK3 in the nucleus of <italic>Casp8</italic> KD cells, showed much stronger binding activity to RARE in the presence of RA than RARs without RIPK1 and RIPK3.</p>
<p><italic>Caspase-8</italic> KD-induced enhancement of RA signaling was shown to be dependent upon RXRa, TDG, p300 and CBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1</xref>), all of which were reported to form a transcriptional coactivator complex with RAR on <italic>RAREs</italic> and to enhance RA signaling (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Um et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Cortellino et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, all the results suggest that RIPK1 and RIPK3 form a coactivator complex with RAR/RXR, TDG, p300 and CBP in the nucleus of <italic>Casp8</italic> KD cells, RA treatment induces tight binding of the RIPK1/RIPK3-containing coactivator complex onto <italic>RAREs,</italic> and RA signaling is subsequently enhanced.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The enhancement of RA-specific genes expression in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES cells was significantly induced by not only 1 &#x03BC;M RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but also 100 and 10 nM RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure2 - figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since the concentration of RA in mouse embryo tissues was reported to be approximately 25 nM on average (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Horton,. 1995</xref>), caspase-8 was supposed to suppress evident activation of RA signaling in a physiological condition. Indeed, up-regulated transcription of RA-induced genes was detected in <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> whole embryos by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Furthermore, expressions of sh<italic>Casp8</italic>-resistant Wt <italic>Casp8</italic> significantly inhibited the evident activation of RA signaling by <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure2 - figure supplement 4</xref>)). Based on all the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> findings in this manuscript, suppression of caspase-8 or FADD expression, or caspase-8 activity generally enhances RA signaling/RARE-dependent transcription through nuclear translocation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 followed by their association with RARs in a coactivator complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<p>Induced KD of <italic>Casp8</italic> expression in EBs derived form TetR-sh<italic>Casp8</italic> ES cells was shown to sensitize the cells to RA-induced necroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). RA-induced necroptosis was observed in EBs derived from <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES and P19 cells, but not in either <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES and P19 cells before EB formation, SK-N-SH cells or HL60 cells. RA-induced necroptosis seems to be induced in only EB or its related early embryo. In fact, the cell lines, which were insensitive to RA-induced necroptosis, were sensitized to apoptosis by strong stimulation with RA (data not shown). Yet-to-be-defined mechanism(s) in EBs might contribute the conversion of response to RA, from apoptosis to necroptosis. Necroptosis was induced in RA-treated <italic>Casp8</italic> KD EBs through enhanced expression of <italic>Ripk1, Ripk3</italic> and <italic>Mlkl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). RARs were reported to be able to directly bind to a RARE-like sequence in the promoter region of <italic>Ripk1</italic> in RA-treated ES cells (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Moutier et al., 2012</xref>). The RA-induced up-regulation of <italic>Ripk1</italic> expression in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD EBs might be directly mediated by RARs during RA-induced differentiation of cells in EBs. However, it has not been determined yet whether the RA-induced up-regulation of <italic>Ripk3</italic> and <italic>Mlkl</italic> are directly mediated RARs or not.</p>
<p><italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos die at E10.5-E11.5 with associated abnormal yolk sac vascularization, heart development and neural tube formation ( <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Varfolomeev et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Sakamaki et al., 2002</xref>). The embryonic lethality of <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos is rescued by not only depletion of <italic>Ripk3</italic> (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>) but also knock-in of kinase-negative K51A <italic>Ripk3</italic> (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Mandal et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that kinase activity of RIPK3, which is indispensable for induction of necroptosis, is required for embryonic lethality of <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos. In contrast, RIPK3 is, but kinase activity of RIPK3 is not, required for the enhancement of RA signaling in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G</xref>). In addtion, <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup> Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were recently reported to be viable and to mature into fertile adults (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Diaz et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, MLKL and kinase activity of RIPK3, both of which are required for the induction of necroptosis but not for the enhancemnt of RA signaling in <italic>Casp8</italic> KD cells, are indispensable for embryonic letality of <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>embryos. Taken togetger, the embryonic letality of <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is due to excess necroptosis (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Dillon et al., 2016</xref>), but not due to the enhancement of RA-induced differentiation. Interestingly, <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup> Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice succumbed significantly earlier than <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup> Ripk3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice due to a more rapid onset of severe lymphadenopathy and autoimmune pathology (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Diaz et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that biological activity other than necroptosis-inducing activity of RIPK3 is involved in the rapid onset of severe autoimmunity in <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup> Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. It would be interesting to analyze whether the RIPK3-dependent enhancement of RA signaling is implicated in the rapid onset of severe autoimmunity in <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup> Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>Elimination of TNFR1 from <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos was shown to delay embryonic lethality from E10.5 until E16.5 (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Dillon et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that TNFR1-mediated necroptosis plays an essential role in the embryonic letality of <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice around E10.5. Hence RA-induced necroptosis should not be required for the embryonic letality of <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice around E10.5. However, TNF was shown to induce necroptosis in RA-treated but not RA-untreated <italic>Casp8</italic> KD EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting that enhancement of RA signaling contributes sensitization of cells in <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryo to TNF-induced necroptosis. In addition, chemical inhibition of RA signaling delayed embryonic letality of <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice until E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8E</xref>). Taken together, we suppose that <italic>ripk1, ripk3</italic> and <italic>mlkl</italic> expressions are enhanced by RA in <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, and their increased expressions might be partly involved in the embryonic letality of <italic>Casp8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice around E10.5 through enhancing the sensitivity to TNF-induced necroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Caspase-8 and RIPK were shown to regulate sensitivity to RA signalling in not only mouse ES cells but also human cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure2 - figure supplement 3</xref>). Intriguingly, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was reported to be dramatically improved by co-treatment with RA and a caspase inhibitor when compared with treatment with only RA (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Ablain et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the nexus of caspase-8 and RA signaling in cell death, cell differentiation, development, stem cell fate, ontogenesis, and the fate of cancer cells.</p>
