<title>Abstract</title>
<p>A key player in the intracellular trafficking network is cytoplasmic dynein, a protein complex that transports molecular cargo along microtubule tracks. It has been shown that vertebrate dynein&#x2019;s movement becomes strikingly enhanced upon interacting with a cofactor named dynactin and one of several cargo-adapters, such as BicaudalD2. However, the mechanisms responsible for this increase in transport efficiency are not well understood, largely due to a lack of structural information. We used cryo-electron tomography to visualize the first 3-dimensional structure of the intact dynein-dynactin complex bound to microtubules. Our structure reveals that the dynactin-cargo-adapter complex recruits and binds to two dimeric cytoplasmic dyneins. Interestingly, the dynein motor organization closely resembles that of axonemal dynein, suggesting that cytoplasmic dynein and axonemal dyneins may utilize similar mechanisms to coordinate multiple motors. We propose that grouping dyneins onto a single dynactin scaffold promotes collective force production as well as unidirectional processive motility. These findings provide a structural platform that facilitates a deeper biochemical and biophysical understanding of dynein regulation and cellular transport.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Precise spatial and temporal delivery of components to specific locations within a cell requires tightly regulated trafficking across a vast microtubule (MT) network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Welte 2004</xref>). A key player in intracellular trafficking is cytoplasmic dynein-1 (hereafter dynein), which transports molecular cargo towards MT minus ends. Dynein functions as a multi-subunit complex of dimerized &#x201C;heavy chains&#x201D; (DHCs), containing a carboxy-(C)-terminal &#x201C;motor&#x201D; domain and an amino-(N)-terminal &#x201C;tail&#x201D; region that contains a dimerization domain and attachment sites for several non-catalytic subunits. The dynein motor is distinct from other cytoskeletal motors, composed of an AAA&#x002B; ATPase ring interrupted by a coiled-coil stalk with a globular microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Schmidt and Carter 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhang 2017</xref>). Notably, purified vertebrate dynein exhibits limited, diffusive movement on MTs. Long-range, minus end-directed movement requires the association of dynactin, a megadalton-sized multi-subunit cofactor, as well as one of various cargo adaptors, such as the N-terminal fragment of BicaudalD2 (BICD2N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McKenney 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Schlager 2014</xref>). Mutations that disrupt these dynein-cofactor interactions are associated with a variety of neurological pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hoang 2017</xref>). Although the manner by which BICD2N structurally mediates interactions between the dynein tail and dynactin has been elucidated by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Urnavicius 2015</xref>), a fundamental question remains: How do interactions with the dynein tail confer unidirectional processivity on the dynein motor domains?</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Structure determination of microtubule-bound dynein-dynactin-BICD2 complex</title>
<p>To understand how dynein is harnessed to yield processive movement, we isolated mouse dynein-dynactin-BICD2N (DDB) complexes bound to microtubules following methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chowdhury 2015</xref>), and used cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging to determine the 3D structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1</xref>, Supplemental Movie 1). To facilitate the 3D reconstruction of this inherently heterogeneous complex, we incorporated an assisted alignment procedure into the RELION subtomogram averaging workflow(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bharat and Scheres 2016</xref>), followed by focused refinement of individual components (dynein tails-dynactin-BICD2N (TDB), and each pair of dynein motors) (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">3</xref>, see Methods). The resulting structures were merged in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Goddard 2007</xref>) to obtain the final reconstruction of the intact DDB-MT complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 4</xref>, see Methods).</p>

<title>BICD2N mediates the association of two dynein dimers with a single dynactin</title>
<p>The overall organization of the DDB-MT resembles previous structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chowdhury 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Urnavicius 2015</xref>), but a striking new feature emerged: the presence of two complete dimeric dynein densities bound to dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The details of the reconstruction were sufficient to visualize the entirety of the four DHCs from the dynactin-bound N-terminus to the C-terminal motor domains, and to confirm the post-power-stroke conformation of the motor linker domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Schmidt 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhabha 2014</xref>), which is consistent with the presence of AMPPNP during the isolation procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The four motor domains are positioned in a row, &#x007E;17nm from the MT surface, with weak density attributable to the stalk contacting the corresponding MT. Additionally, the structure displays densities for several other dynein subunits, including the light intermediate chain (LIC), light chain 7 (LC7), and intermediate chain (IC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), in positions that are consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chowdhury 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Urnavicius 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhang 2017</xref>). By fitting available atomic models into the EM density, we generated a pseudo-atomic model of the complete DDB-MT complex, including two dynein dimers (Dyn-A and Dyn-B) with associated dynein subunits, one dynactin-BICD2N complex, as well as the GFP-tag at the N-terminus of BICD2N.</p>
<p>Manual inspection of the raw extracted subtomograms revealed that over 97&#x0025; of the dynactin densities were associated with four dynein motor domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1b</xref>). Importantly, a focused 3D classification on the region surrounding the dynein motor domains did not yield any well-resolved 3D classes containing a single dynein dimer (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5b</xref>), reinforcing our conclusion. Furthermore, comparison of our reconstruction with previously determined 2D averages of negatively stained DDB-MT complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chowdhury 2015</xref>) revealed highly correlated structural features (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5c</xref>), suggesting that two dynein dimers were associated with a single dynactin in our earlier 2D averages of DDB-MT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chowdhury 2015</xref>), but the limitations of 2D negative stain precluded resolution of multiple dynein motors in that study. Overall, these results strongly support a model in which BICD2N can facilitate binding of two dynein dimers to a single dynactin complex.</p>

<p>The observation that the dynactin-BICD2N assembly binds to two dynein dimers in the presence of MTs is unexpected because prior motility assays and structural studies concluded that only one dynein dimer was present in the dynactin-BICD2N complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McKenney 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Schlager 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Urnavicius 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhang 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5a,c</xref>). However, prior motility assays reported that a subset of DDB complexes exhibited extreme run lengths (&#x003E;50 &#x03BC;m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McKenney 2014</xref>), which might be attributed to DDB complexes containing two dynein dimers. Recent single molecule experiments show that DDB complex velocities on MTs distribute into two populations, with one exhibiting twice the velocity of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gutierrez 2017</xref>). Additionally, recent structural studies have shown that dynactin-BICD2N is capable of binding two dimeric dyneins (A. P. Carter, personal communication). It is possible that inclusion of AMPPNP in the lysate, which immobilizes DDB complexes on MTs for structural analyses, induces a dynein conformation that favors attachment of two dynein dimers to dynactin-BICD2. Together, our data suggest that regulatory mechanisms exist that influence the DDB&#x2019;s dynein:dynactin stoichiometry.</p>

<title>Hook3 also recruits two dynein dimers to dynactin</title>
<p>To assess whether the recruitment of two dynein dimers is unique to the BICD2N scaffold, we isolated dynein-dynactin complexes bound to MTs in the presence of another cargo adaptor, an N-terminal fragment of Hook3, which was also shown to endow dynein-dynactin with processive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McKenney 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Olenick 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Schroeder and Vale 2016</xref>). Strikingly, the subtomogram average of the resulting dynein-dynactin-Hook3 (DDH) complex again revealed two tail domains interacting with dynactin and EM density attributable to two sets of dynein&#x2019;s accessory subunits (LC, IC, LIC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 6</xref>). The fact that the structures of the DDH and DDB are largely indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, c</xref>, Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that recruitment of two dynein molecules to the dynactin-cargo adaptor complex is a widely conserved mechanism for inducing processive motility.</p>

<sec id="s1d">
<title>Dynein tails bind to adjacent clefts on the Arp1 filament of dynactin</title>
<p>Our 3D reconstruction illustrates how one dynactin-adaptor complex can accommodate two dynein dimers. The previously determined TDB structure showed the dynein tail to be bound to two clefts along dynactin&#x2019;s Arp filament: one between Arp1-D and F, and the other between Arp1-F and &#x03B2;-actin H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Urnavicius 2015</xref>). We observe identical interactions here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2b, c</xref>). The second dynein tail binds the Arp1 filament in a highly similar fashion, interacting with two adjacent clefts near the barbed-end of dynactin, one between the Arp1-D and B and the other between Arp1-B and the CapZ-dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2 b, c, d</xref>). The fact that neither our study, nor previous studies, observe complexes in which dynein straddles the clefts in the center of the Arp filament (i.e., on either side of Arp1-D) suggests that the dynactin-cargo adaptor interface has evolved to maximize dynein occupancy on dynactin.</p>

<sec id="s1e">
<title>Motor domains are positioned for processive motility</title>
<p>In contrast to previous structural studies of isolated DDB complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chowdhury 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Urnavicius 2015</xref>), our structure reveals the spatial organization of the dynein motor domains (MDs) relative to the dynactin complex. The four MDs are equidistantly spaced &#x007E;12 nm apart, with all four MTBDs projecting towards the MT minus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 b, c</xref>, Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5d</xref>). Interestingly, there is some variability in the transverse angle at which the MD pairs attach to the MT axis, which limits our ability to resolve individual tubulin dimers in the MT lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Regardless, the spacing between the MTBDs is consistent with the MT helical protofilament spacing, suggesting that the four MDs associate with four distinct but adjacent MT protofilaments (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 5d</xref>). Notably, interactions of the dynein tail with dynactin&#x2019;s helical Arp filament yield a conspicuous &#x201C;skewed&#x201D; organization in which dynactin is oriented approximately 40&#x00BA; relative to the linear array of dynein motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that the dynein MD configuration on MTs is promoted by the dynactin-adaptor complex, we used cryo-ET to visualize dynein dimers bound to MTs in the absence of dyanctin and adaptors. Manual inspection of 229 sub-volumes showed that isolated dynein dimers bind the MT surface individually, with their motor domains at a range of distances from one another (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 7</xref>), hindering our ability to generate a 3D average of these complexes. Despite this complication, our results suggest that in the absence of cofactors, individual cytoplasmic dynein complexes bind individually to the MT, with the two MDs positioned at variable distances from one another. Thus, not only does the dynactin-cargo adaptor complex recruit multiple dyneins, it positions their MDs in an array highly compatible with unidirectional processive movement. This is consistent with prior work showing that association of a single dynein with dynactin results in a dramatic reorganization of dynein from an auto-inhibited conformation to one that is capable of productive minus-end movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhang 2017</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1f">
<title>Structural and mechanistic parallels between cytoplasmic and axonemal dynein</title>
<p>In addition to positioning the dynein MDs for processive motility, dynactin can also serve as a scaffold for collective force production. Vertebrate dynein motors have been shown to work collectively to generate forces that far exceed those produced by an individual dynein motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Rai 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Rai 2016</xref>), and this multi-motor coordination may be required to carry out high-load transport processes, such as nuclear positioning, mitotic spindle rotation, and organelle trafficking. A well-characterized example of teamwork among dynein motors can be found in cilliary and flagellar axonemes, where axonemal dyneins are known to work in huge ensembles to accomplish large-scale, synchronized, cilliary and flagellar motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wemmer and Marshall 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We wondered if the dynein configuration observed in our structures showed any similarities to axonemal dynein. In addition to working collectively in teams to accomplish large-scale, synchronized, cilliary and flagellar motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wemmer and Marshall 2004</xref>), axonemal dyneins contain a C-terminal motor domain that is similar to cytoplasmic dynein, even though they have evolved a distinct N-terminal tail to accommodate its cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ishikawa 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, the organization of the dynein motors in the DDB-MT structure is strikingly similar to that of sea urchin sperm flagella outer dynein arms in the post-powerstroke state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lin 2014</xref>). In both structures, the dynein tails are associated with an elongated, filamentous structure &#x2013; a microtubule doublet in the case of axonemal dynein, and dynactin&#x2019;s actin-like filament in the case of cytoplasmic dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This leads to the intriguing hypothesis that cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins utilize a similar mechanism for coordinating the activity of multiple dynein motors, in which parallel arrangement of the motor domains relative to the MT allows the conformational change associated with ATP hydrolysis to propel the MTBD more effectively toward the MT minus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). By contrast, ATP hydrolysis in the absence of the massive dynactin scaffold might result in non-directed motion of the stalk or unproductive motion of the dynein tail, limiting the propensity for minus end movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Another non-mutually exclusive possibility is that the second motor might increase the duty ratio of the entire complex by providing an additional attachment to the MT lattice and reducing the probability of complex dissociation from the MT during movement. Such an effect could enhance complex processivity, as has been observed in assays that multimerize motors on an artificial scaffolding, such as a bead or DNA chassis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Derr 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Xu 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Torisawa 2014</xref>).</p>

The right side panel shows the organization of cytoplasmic dyneins in dynein-dynactin-cargo adaptor-MT complexes. Each of the two dimeric dyneins (Dyn-A and Dyn-B) are highlighted in gold and associate with the dynactin scaffold (light yellow) via the tails and to MT surface (light green) through the MT binding stalk of the motors. <bold>b</bold>. Similarities between the overall organization of multiple axonemal dyneins in axoneme (left) and two cytoplasmic dyneins in Dyn-cargo adaptor-MT complexes (right) are shown using diagrammatic representations. Each AAA&#x002B; domain with the dynein motor domain is colored uniquely, with linker arm colored purple. In both systems, multiple dyneins are associated with a filamentous scaffold (a MT doublet or dynactin) via N-terminal tail interactions. The dynein motors associate with MT tracks through the binding stalk. In this way, both axonemal and cytoplasmic dyneins integrate into scaffolds to work in teams. c. In Dyn-adaptor-MT complexes (right column), by anchoring the dynein tail to a scaffolding structure, ATP hydrolysis results in a rotation that propels the MTBD towards the MT minus end, positioning the MT binding stalk further along the MT upon its return to a high affinity state. The dynein powerstroke thus results in productive translocation of the scaffold and attached cargo toward the MT minus end. Star denotes MT-interacting stalk that prevents dissociation of the complex from the MT. In contrast, in absence of a scaffold such as dynactin (left column), there is an increased likelihood that ATP hydrolysis results in unproductive motion of the dynein tail, limiting the propensity for minus end movement. Additionally, association of multiple dyneins with a dynactin scaffold results a reduced probability of complex dissociation during processive movement, and in larger collective force production, similar to axonemal dyneins.</p>

<p>The collective force generation previously shown for cytoplasmic dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Rai 2013</xref>) may also involve an element of synchronization, as observed in axonemal dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lin 2014</xref>). It has been proposed that axonemal dynein motors synchronize as coupled oscillators by virtue of their connection to a shared scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wemmer and Marshall 2004</xref>). Our reconstructions show that dynactin is a scaffold for cytoplasmic dynein that may promote similar synchronization among bound dynein motors. Motor synchronization may also involve physical contacts between adjacent motor domains to promote teamwork and collective force generation. Interestingly, we observe density between MDs extending from AAA3 domain to the linker domain of the neighboring MD in the DDB reconstruction (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure 9</xref>). It is possible that this density corresponds to an inter-MD interaction involving the DHC C-terminal extension (CT-cap), which has been shown to play a role in regulating dynein processivity in Dictyostelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Numata 2011</xref>) and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Nicholas 2015</xref>). It is also possible that this bridging density corresponds to an auxiliary regulator factor, such as Lissencephaly-1, which binds directly to the dynein MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Toropova 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">DeSantis 2017</xref>) and has been shown to increase velocity of vertebrate DDB complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baumbach 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gutierrez 2017</xref>). Higher resolution studies will be required to confirm these hypotheses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we used cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging to reveal the 3-dimensional structure of intact dynein-dynactin-cargo adapter complexes bound to MTs, and discovered that multiple distinct cargo adapters are able to mediate the association of two dynein dimers with a single dynactin. This novel configuration imposes spatial and conformational constraints on both dynein dimers, positioning the four dynein MDs in close proximity to one another and oriented towards the MT minus end. Grouping multiple dyneins onto a single dynactin scaffold has the potential to promote collective force production, increased processivity, and favor unidirectional movement, suggesting mechanistic parallels to axonemal dynein. These findings provide a platform that integrates decades of biochemical and biophysical studies on the unusual behavior of this large, highly conserved, minus end-directed motor protein, while posing further interesting questions regarding the underlying mechanisms of dynein-mediated intracellular transport.</p>

<title>Purification of MT-bound complexes</title>
<p>The cargo adaptor proteins GFP-BICD2N (a.a. 25-400) and SNAPf-Hook3 (a.a. 1-552) were recombinantly expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McKenney 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chowdhury 2015</xref>). MT-bound DDB complexes were prepared from mouse brain tissue as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chowdhury 2015</xref>). Isolation of MT-bound DDH complexes was performed using the same MT-DDB protocol, with a minor modification to incorporate aspects of a protocol established by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amos 1989</xref>) to enrich DDH complex on MTs. We initially removed bulk tubulin from the lysate by adding 6 &#x03BC;M Taxol and 0.2 mM GTP, performing one round of MT polymerization, and then pelleting and discarding the polymerized MTs and MAPs by centrifugation. In order to prevent endogenous dynein from associating with the MTs prior to pelleting, 0.5mM Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-ATP was added to the lysate. This resulted in lysate having a higher dynein-to-tubulin ratio. The remaining tubulin in lysate was then polymerized by adding 10 &#x03BC;M Taxol and 1 mM GTP, and 4mM Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> - AMPPNP and 500nM of Hook3 was added to promote engagement of the DDH complexes to the MTs.</p>
<p>MT-engaged dynein was prepared from mouse brain using similar procedures as described for MT-DDH complex, but to prevent the association of endogenous dynactin with dynein, the lysate was not supplemented with recombinant cargo adaptor proteins. The protocol for this work was approved by the TSRI IACUC office under protocol 14-0013.</p>

<title>Grid preparation for cryo-EM analysis</title>
<p>All samples were prepared for cryo imaging in a similar manner. The complex-bound MT pellets were diluted 20 fold with PMEE buffer supplemented with 1mM GTP, 4mM Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> - AMPPNP, and 20&#x03BC;M Taxol at room temperature. 5nm colloidal gold (Ted Pella) were pretreated with BSA to prevent aggregation as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Iancu 2006</xref>). Immediately before freezing, samples were diluted 60 to 120-fold and mixed with the pre-treated colloidal gold (optimal dilution for each sample was determined by screening the cryo-EM grids at a range of concentrations). 4 &#x03BC;l aliquots of sample were applied to freshly plasma-cleaned (75&#x0025; argon / 25&#x0025; oxygen mixture) UltrAuFoil grids (Quantifoil) containing holes 1.2 &#x03BC;m in diameter spaced 1.3 &#x03BC;m apart. Plunge freezing was performed using a custom-built manual plunging device. The grid was manually blotted from the side opposite to which the sample was applied with a Whatman 1 filter paper for 5-7 s to remove excess sample. After blotting, the grid with remaining sample was immediately vitrified by plunge freezing into a liquid-ethane slurry. The entire procedure was carried out in a cold room maintained at 4&#x00B0;C and &#x003E;90&#x0025; relative humidity.</p>

<title>Cryo-ET data acquisition</title>
<p>Tilt series for DDB-MT and DDH-MT samples were collected using a Thermo Fisher Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 keV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector. Data acquisition was performed using the UCSF tomography package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Suloway 2009</xref>) implemented within the Leginon automated data acquisition software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Suloway 2005</xref>). Tilt series were acquired using a sequential tilting scheme, starting at 0&#x00B0; and increasing to &#x002B;59&#x00BA; at 1&#x00B0; increments, then returning to 0&#x00BA; and increasing to -59&#x00BA; at 1&#x00B0; increments. Each tilt series was collected with a nominal defocus value that was randomly set to between 6-8 &#x03BC;m for the DDB-MT data set, and 2-5 &#x03BC;m DDH-MT data set. Each tilt was acquired as movies in counting mode using a dose rate of 5.3 e<sup>-</sup>/pixel/s, with a per-frame exposure time of 80 ms and a dose of 0.09 e<sup>-</sup>/&#x00C5;<sup>2</sup>. The total cumulative dose for each tilt series was 114 e<sup>-</sup>/&#x00C5;<sup>2</sup>, and was distributed throughout the tilts based on the cosine of the tilt angle to account for changing sample thickness with increasing tilt. 154 and 126 tilt series were collected for DDB-MT and DDH-MT samples at a nominal magnification of 14,000X, giving a calibrated pixel size of 2.13 &#x00C5;/pixel at the detector level.</p>
<p>Tilt series for the dynein-MT sample were collected on a Thermo Fisher Arctica electron microscope operating at 200 keV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector operating in movie mode, as described above. The total cumulative dose and dose distribution for each tilt series was same as described for DDB-MT and DDH-MT data sets. Data were collected using the Leginon package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Suloway 2005</xref>) with an alternating tilt scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hagen 2017</xref>). A total of 58 tilt series were collected at a nominal magnification of 17,500X, giving a calibrated pixel size of 2.33 &#x00C5;/pixel at the detector level.</p>

<title>Tomogram reconstruction</title>
<p>Image processing and tomogram reconstructions were performed in similar fashion for all samples. Movie frames for each tilt were translationally aligned to account for beam-induced motion and drift using the GPU frame alignment program MotionCorr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Li 2013</xref>). A frame offset of 7 and a B-factor of 2000 pixels was used for frame alignment. The raw tilts were initially Fourier-binned by a factor of 2. All micrographs were aligned using the 5nm gold beads as fiducial markers, and further binned by a factor of 2 (final pixel size of 8.52 &#x00C5;/pixel for DDB-MT and DDH-MT datasets, and 9.32 &#x00C5;/pixel for dynein-MT dataset) for reconstruction in the IMOD package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kremer 1996</xref>). Tomograms were reconstructed using simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) with seven iterations in IMOD provided sufficient contrast for the purposes of particle selection. Tomograms were also reconstructed by weighted back projection (WBP) for the purposes of subtomogram averaging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Subtomogram averaging and data processing</title>
<p>Sub-volumes containing DDB-MT, DDH-MT, or dynein-MT were manually picked from SIRT-reconstructed tomograms with the EMAN2 single-particle tomography boxer program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Galaz-Montoya 2015</xref>). Picked coordinates for each sub-volume were imported into the RELION 1.4 subtomogram averaging workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bharat and Scheres 2016</xref>). 502 and 303 sub-volumes were extracted from the WBP reconstructions of the DDB-MT and DDH-MT datasets, respectively. Sub-volumes were extracted using a cube-size of 96 voxels for the DDB-MT and 84 voxels for the DDH-MT dataset. Reference-free 3D classification in RELION did not yield any structures resembling dynein or dynactin complexes, and instead predominantly produced averages of MTs. Attempts to remove signal from MTs by applying binary masks did not improve our ability to resolve the MT-bound complexes. To overcome this issue, we developed an assisted 3D subtomogram averaging procedure (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), wherein we manually docked the available reconstruction of the dynein tail-dynactin-BICD2N (TBD) complex (EMDB 2860(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Urnavicius 2015</xref>)) into the DDB-MT or DDH-MT sub-volumes using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Goddard 2007</xref>). The docked densities provided the rotational and translational parameters to generate initial subtomogram averages of the DDB and DDH complexes. These initial averages contained recognizable molecular features consistent with the previously published TDB structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Urnavicius 2015</xref>) (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2b</xref>). To better resolve different components (dynein tail-adaptor-dynactin region and dynein motors) of the DDB and DDH complexes, focused 3D refinements were performed using 3D ellipsoidal binary masks corresponding to the individual sub-regions (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2c</xref>). For each component, 3D refinement was performed in RELION using the initial alignment parameters, with a HEALPix order of 3, an angular step size of 7.5&#x00BA;, and an offset range of 5 pixels. These refinements resulted in better-defined sub-regions of the MT-DDB and MT-DDH complexes (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2c</xref>). The final resolutions of these reconstructions are conservatively estimated to be &#x007E;38 &#x00C5; (by Fourier Shell Correlation at a 0.5 cutoff) (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 4, 6a</xref>). Composite reconstructions of the DDB-MT and DDH-MT complexes were generated by aligning and stitching together the focused reconstructions using the &#x201C;vop maximum&#x201D; function in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Goddard 2007</xref>), which retains the maximum voxel values of overlapping volumes.</p>
<p>Although the presence of an additional tail dimer and appearance of 4 dynein motors in the DDB subtomogram average, as well as the absence of GFP in the DDH reconstruction, all serve as internal controls that preclude the introduction of model bias into our refinement procedure, we performed additional control experiments to rule out this possibility. We first tested the ability of our sub-volumes to reproduce the well-resolved dynein tail-adaptor-dynactin region after focused refinement of the motor domains. Focused refinement of the motors results in misalignment of the dynein tail-adaptor-dynactin region, resulting in poorly-resolved dynactin density. Re-refining this region using an ellipsoidal binary mask reproduces the dynactin with well-resolved structural features. Next, we docked the TDB complex (EMDB 2860 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Urnavicius 2015</xref>)) into the sub-volumes using randomly assigned Euler angles and performed the same refinement strategy outlined above. This was repeated using three unique seeds for randomization, and in each case the resulting subtomogram did not yield a recognizable complex (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>
<p>229 dynein-MT sub-volumes were extracted from the WBP tomograms with a cube-size of 96 voxels. As with the DDB and DDH datasets, ab-initio 3D classification mostly resulted in MT averages, and did not yield any recognizable dynein structures. We attempted to perform an assisted alignment approach, which involved placing spherical markers on the individual dynein motor domains using IMOD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kremer 1996</xref>). However, due to the variability the inter-motor spacing and disordered arrangement of the dyneins relative to the MTs, we were unable to produce a 3D subtomogram average of MT-bound dimeric dynein. The spherical markers were used to measure the inter-motor distances shown in Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 7</xref>.</p>

<caption><title>Validation of the subtomogram averaging procedure.</title> <p><bold>a</bold>. 3D refinement focusing on the dynactin-dynein tail region of DDB-MT subvolumes results in this region becoming better resolved, while the density corresponding to the dynein motor domains worsens due to misalignment (left image).

Continuing refinement with a binary mask around the dynactin-dynein tail density restores this density to a well-resolved state (right image), similar to that of the original 3D refinement of this region (left image), suggesting that the assisted subtomogram averaging procedure followed by focused 3D refinement does not impose any form of model bias to the final subtomogram averages. <bold>b</bold>.

Random assignment of the starting Eulers for the TDB complexes using three different seed models (Seed #1, #2, #3) results in 3D reconstructions that do not resemble any distinguishable feature of the DDB-MT complex, further suggesting that the assisted subtomogram averaging procedure does not introduce model bias to the final subtomogram averages of the dynein-dynactin-cargo adaptor complexes.</p>
