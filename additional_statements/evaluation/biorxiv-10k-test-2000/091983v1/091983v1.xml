<abstract>
<p>We present a rapid and label-free method for hematologic screening for diseases and syndromes, utilizing quantitative phase imaging (QPI) and machine learning. We aim to establish an efficient blood examination framework that does not suffer from the drawbacks of conventional blood assays, which are incapable of profiling single cells or using labeling procedures. Our method involves the synergistic employment of QPI and machine learning. The high-dimensional refractive index information arising from the QPI-based profiling of single red blood cells is processed to screen for diseases and syndromes using machine learning, which can utilize high-dimensional data beyond the human level. Accurate screening for iron-deficiency anemia, reticulocytosis, hereditary spherocytosis, and diabetes mellitus is demonstrated (&#x003E;99&#x0025; accuracy) using the proposed method. Furthermore, we highlight the synergy between QPI and machine learning in the proposed method by analyzing the performance of the method.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The use of disease-induced alterations of individual red blood cells (RBCs) as diagnostic markers that may facilitate efficient screening for various diseases and syndromes has been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baskurt et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bateman et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jung et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kim et al. 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Koepke and Koepke 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Watanabe et al. 1994</xref>). Previous investigations have stated that the diverse properties of RBCs, such as cellular morphology and deformability, change depending on the pathophysiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Diez-Silva et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al. 2012</xref>). The literature describes significant alterations of RBCs under a variety of pathophysiological conditions, including parasitic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chandramohanadas et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kim et al. 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Park et al. 2008b</xref>), inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baskurt et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bateman et al. 2017</xref>), and metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kotisaari et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schmid-Sch&#x00F6;nbein and Volger 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, conventional techniques for hematological examination offer limited access to the properties of individual red blood cells. An example of a conventional method is the complete blood count (CBC), which is the current gold standard technique for measuring RBC properties. In laboratory medicine, CBCs are routinely employed to obtain diagnostic parameters, including the mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (Hb) content, and the ratio between different blood cell populations. Despite the well-established diagnostic protocols and usefulness of this approach in hematological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Higgins 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Higgins and Mahadevan 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Urrechaga et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Weatherall 2011b</xref>), the massive <italic>population-based</italic> nature of CBC measurements and analyses suggest the clear limitation that this method is incapable of characterizing <italic>individual</italic> RBCs. Considering the increasing awareness of cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Altschuler and Wu 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang and Bodovitz 2010</xref>), a new technique for profiling individual RBCs would play a major role in extending the potential of RBC-based disease screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Weatherall 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Quantitative phase imaging (QPI), a recently emerging imaging technology based on laser interferometry, has been proven capable of rapidly characterizing individual blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kemper and von Bally 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Popescu 2011</xref>). Unlike conventional microscopes based on exogenous labeling (e.g., fluorescence microscopy or peripheral blood smear examination), QPI exploits the intracellular refractive index (RI) distribution as an endogenous imaging contrast for label-free imaging without exhaustive sample preparation. Holotomography, also known as three-dimensional (3D) QPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kim et al. 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wolf 1969</xref>), measures 3D RI tomograms of live cells and tissues, from which various parameters can be retrieved. For example, morphological (e.g., cellular volume) and biochemical (e.g., Hb content) properties of blood cells can be retrieved at the individual cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kim et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim et al. 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Memmolo et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Park et al. 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yoon et al. 2017</xref>). Furthermore, time-lapse two-dimensional (2D) QPI directly measures dynamic RBC membrane fluctuations, revealing the mechanical properties (e.g., deformability) of individual RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Park et al. 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Park et al. 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shaked et al. 2011</xref>). Combining 3D QPI with time-lapse 2D QPI for simultaneous access to all the aforementioned properties, or single-cell profiling of individual RBCs, has also been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al. 2014c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al. 2014d</xref>).</p>
<p>However, diagnostic applications of QPI-based RBC profiling have been challenging, owing to the lack of analytical tools for fully exploiting the fruitful information. For the population-averaged parameters obtained through CBC, it has been possible for human experts to hand-craft diagnostic criteria. In contrast, single-cell profiling data is typically high-dimensional (i.e., it is difficult to visualize), and accompanies cell-to-cell variations that preclude rule-based diagnostic approaches.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties, recent advances in machine learning suggest new opportunities in diagnostic applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cruz and Wishart 2007</xref>). The data-driven approach provides indispensable methods for analyzing high-dimensional and complicated data, as in single-cell profiling. In QPI, adopting machine learning has enabled rapid identification of bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jo et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jo et al. 2017</xref>), sperm cell analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mirsky et al. 2017</xref>), macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pavillon et al. 2018</xref>), and lymphocyte subtyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yoon et al. 2017</xref>), among a rapidly expanding range of applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jo et al. 2018</xref>). Recently, 2D QPI techniques have been combined with machine learning for the detection of abnormal morphologies in RBCs, such as malaria infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Go et al. 2018</xref>) or sickle cell diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Javidi et al. 2018</xref>). No study to date has demonstrated the efficient handling of single-RBC profiling data incorporating all the morphological, chemical, and mechanical properties simultaneously.</p>
<p>Here, we present a systematic method to rapidly and efficiently screen for hematologic disorders using QPI and machine learning. In the proposed method, a neural network classifier predicts the pathophysiological conditions of individuals based on the simultaneously measured properties of individual RBCs. We show that single-cell profiling provides invaluable information in the context of high-accuracy screening for iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), reticulocytosis (RET), hereditary spherocytosis (HS), and diabetes mellitus (DM). Importantly, the key traits utilized by the classifier are consistent with the literature, even though the classifier was trained in a purely data-driven manner without any human knowledge. We also propose a strategy for overcoming and even exploiting the cell-to-cell variations for more accurate screening.</p>

<title>Profiling of individual RBCs</title>
<p>QPI images of RBCs were measured using common-path diffraction optical tomography (cDOT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al. 2014c</xref>). 3D RI tomograms and time-lapse phase maps are measured for each RBC. The image acquisition process for 3D RI tomograms is visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1A and B</xref>. Using multiple 2D optical field images of a sample obtained with various illumination angles, a 3D RI tomogram is reconstructed. The illumination angle is scanned using two two-axis galvanometric mirrors. One galvanometric mirror was placed before a sample at the conjugated plane, in order to control the illumination angle of the beam. The other was located after the sample, so that the optical axis of the transmitted beam remained unchanged. A common-path interferometer was employed to record an interferogram of a sample beam, from which the optical field is recovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Debnath and Park 2011</xref>). The 3D RI tomogram of a specimen is reconstructed from the multiple 2D optical fields, using an optical diffraction tomography algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lauer 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wolf 1969</xref>). The information in the spatial frequencies that are inaccessible owing to the limited numerical apertures of objective lenses is filled using an iterative non-negativity algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lim et al. 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>The time-lapse 2D QPI acquisition process is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1C and D</xref>. Time-lapse phase maps are retrieved from the measurements of 2D optical fields by considering the RI value of each RBC measured using 3D QPI. For each RBC, 256 2D QPI images were measured at the frame rate of 125 frames/s. The detailed procedure is described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al. 2014d</xref>).</p>
<p>3D QPI is capable of profiling single RBCs by providing quantitative cellular features and high-resolution images in 3D. Six cellular properties, including volumes, surface areas, sphericities, Hb contents, Hb concentrations, and membrane fluctuations, were quantified from the QPI images using prior knowledge concerning RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al. 2017</xref>). The volume and surface area of an RBC can be directly obtained from a 3D RI tomogram. The sphericity, a dimensionless index ranging from 0 to 1, represents the sphere-likeness of a given 3D object. This is calculated as the ratio of surface areas between a sphere with the identical volume and the given 3D object. The Hb concentration of an RBC is extracted from the mean RI value of the cell. Because RBCs are primarily composed of Hb solution, the Hb concentration can be calculated using the linear relationship between the RI of Hb solution and the Hb concentration. Consequently, the cellular Hb content can also be obtained, since the cell volume and Hb concentration are provided. The dynamic membrane fluctuation is related to the deformability of an RBC. The dynamic membrane fluctuation is obtained using the mean RI and the temporal phase deviation, because the optical phase delay is identical to the integration of the RI and the thickness. A flow diagram showing the extraction of the properties is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>. An example of single-RBC profiling is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>.</p>

<title>RBCs under different pathophysiological conditions</title>
<p>We acquired QPI images of RBCs drawn from individuals under well-defined pathophysiological conditions. The conditions included a healthy condition, IDA, RET, HS, and DM. IDA, which is one of the most prevalent diseases globally, is caused by insufficient dietary iron absorption compared to the iron demand of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Killip et al. 2007</xref>). RET is a syndrome related to failures in maintaining the functional RBC population, as reticulocytes are immature RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Koepke and Koepke 1986</xref>). Pathological conditions including hypersplenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kar et al. 1986</xref>) and hemolytic anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Watanabe et al. 1994</xref>) have previously been related to an increase of reticulocytes. HS is an inherited disorder, characterized by the presence of spherical RBCs, or spherocytes, which are known to arise from defects in the linkages between the skeleton and the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Perrotta et al. 2008</xref>). Clinically, HS is known to be related to splenomegaly, jaundice, and other hemolytic diseases. DM is a group of diseases characterized by hyperglycemia, originating in defects in insulin secretion or insulin functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Association 2010</xref>). DM is conventionally diagnosed or monitored according to the fasting plasma glucose level and glycated Hb level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Droumaguet et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The single RBC parameters measured using QPI are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>. A total of 1028 RBCs were profiled using cDOT. The numbers of single-RBC profiling data items are 437, 99, 166, 86, and 240 for the healthy condition, IDA, RET, HS, and DM, respectively. The numbers of examined individuals are 7, 1, 1, 1, and 6 for the pathophysiological conditions in the same order.</p>

<p>This study and all experimental protocols were approved by the ASAN Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB project number: #IRB-13-90) and the KAIST Institutional Review Board (IRB project number: 2012-0128). Blood samples were collected over the regular course of patient care in the ASAN Medical Center, and we selected patients who had provided written informed consent for using their archival tissues for genetic testing. All data was de-identified.</p>
<p>The single-RBC profiling data was divided into a training set and a test set, to demonstrate disease screening based on unknown inputs. We randomly designated 40 profiling data items of RBCs under each pathophysiological condition as the test set, and employed the remaining data as the training set. Furthermore, the imbalance in sizes for the pathophysiological conditions in the training set was remedied using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique, in which the minority data is oversampled using linear combinations of the nearest neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chawla et al. 2002</xref>). The resulting size of the training set was 397 for each pathophysiological condition.</p>

<title>Neural network for predicting the pathophysiological condition based on single-RBC profiling</title>
<p>We implemented neural networks to screen for the pathophysiological conditions from input features consisting of the six RBC properties. The architecture of the neural networks is visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>. A neural network classifier consisted of three fully-connected hidden layers of size 32, with rectified linear units (ReLUs) as the activation functions and a fully-connected output layer of size five with softmax activation, which normalizes the neural activation into probabilities. In order to accelerate the training and reduce the internal covariate shift, batch normalization was performed before each ReLU function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ioffe and Szegedy 2015</xref>). The classifier was implemented using the TensorFlow 1.0.1 library for Python 3.5.3. The training and tests were run on a single central processing unit (Core i5-4670, Intel, USA).</p>

<p>The neural network classifier predicts the pathophysiological conditions of the donor of a red blood cell (RBC) using the cellular properties of the RBC. The properties of the RBC are fed into the neural network as the input vector. Three hidden layers, each consisting of 32 elements, process the input vector. The output vector represents the probability of each physiological condition. The neural nodes are fully connected between each adjacent layer. Batch normalization and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation follow the neural connection leading to each hidden layer, whereas softmax activation follows the neural connection leading to the output vector.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="091983_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The neural networks were trained using the single-RBC profiling data of the training set. Before training, each element of each input vector was normalized such that the average and standard deviation for the training set became 0 and 1, respectively. During training, a loss function was minimized using the Adam optimizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kingma and Ba 2014</xref>), with a learning rate of 0.0001. The loss function was composed of a cross-entropy loss term and an L2 regularization term, in order to optimize the network for the training set and reduce over-fitting, respectively. A neural network was trained for 200 epochs, taking approximately an hour.</p>
<p>During the test, each single-RBC profiling data item of the test set was classified as one of the pathophysiological conditions. Based on the neural network output, which represents the probabilities of the five conditions, the most likely condition was chosen as the prediction result. The performance of the neural network classifier was verified to be higher than five other types of classifier (Fig. s1).</p>
<p>The prediction result for the test set was analyzed focusing on two aspects: the performance and the contributions of different input features. We evaluated the performance of the classifier using the sensitivity, specificity, and confusion matrix of the prediction for the test set (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, we conducted an ablation study of the input features to identify the relevance of different types of RBC properties to screening for diseases and syndromes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Utilizing profiling data of multiple RBCs for the prediction of pathophysiological conditions</title>
<p>For accurate screening of diseases from single cells, it is necessary to overcome the cellular variation within an individual. While single-cell profiling based on QPI data provides an accurate method for characterizing individual cells, the distribution of RBC properties under an identical pathophysiological condition is broad. Incorrect predictions may occur for RBCs with properties that are dissimilar from the rest of the relevant population.</p>
<p>To overcome and exploit the wide spectrum of RBC populations, the classifier outputs of multiple RBCs were integrated for each individual. We attempted to increase the accuracy when examining an individual by statistically suppressing errors of predictions based on single-RBC profiling, while maintaining the utilization of single-RBC profiling. Specifically, the output vectors of the neural network were averaged over multiple RBCs belonging to the test set of an individual. The combinations of multiple RBCs were randomly chosen without replacement.

<title>Properties of RBCs under pathophysiological conditions</title>
<p>The six cellular properties of each RBC were extracted from the 3D RI tomogram and time-lapse phase maps. The volume, surface area, sphericity, Hb content, Hb concentration, and membrane fluctuation are plotted for the RBCs according to the pathophysiological condition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>. The average &#x00B1; standard deviation volumes of the RBCs were 88.1 &#x00B1; 13.0, 56.3 &#x00B1; 17.7, 94.6 &#x00B1; 21.5, 62.3 &#x00B1; 14.5, and 90.2 &#x00B1; 10.9 fL for the healthy individuals, IDA patient, RET patient, HS patient, and DM patients, respectively. In the identical order, the surface areas of the RBCs were 143.1 &#x00B1; 17.9, 117.8 &#x00B1; 21.2, 202.6 &#x00B1; 38.2, 97.8 &#x00B1; 16.7, and 148.2 &#x00B1; 14.4 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>; the sphericities of the RBCs were 0.67 &#x00B1; 0.06, 0.60 &#x00B1; 0.11, 0.50 &#x00B1; 0.08, and 0.66 &#x00B1; 0.05; the Hb contents were 27.3 &#x00B1; 6.4, 11.7 &#x00B1; 5.9, 19.4 &#x00B1; 7.3, 17.1 &#x00B1; 6.3, and 31.2 &#x00B1; 4.8 pg; the Hb concentrations were 30.9 &#x00B1; 4.6, 19.9 &#x00B1; 5.3, 20.1 &#x00B1; 5.0, 27.2 &#x00B1; 7.5, and 34.6 &#x00B1; 2.7 g/dL; and the membrane fluctuations were 51.0 &#x00B1; 8.6, 68.9 &#x00B1; 20.6, 61.6 &#x00B1; 16.5, 53.5 &#x00B1; 14.4, and 46.6 &#x00B1; 4.5 nm.</p>
<p>It was evident from the distributions of the RBC properties extracted from the QPI images that a tool for high-dimensional analysis is essential for the classification of RBCs. While the population-average of a property varies between the pathophysiological conditions, the range of the entire population significantly overlapped between the conditions. The pathophysiological condition of an RBC was unlikely to be accurately predicted when only a single property of the RBC was provided.</p>

<title>Screening for diseases and syndromes based on profiling single RBCs</title>
<p>The trained neural networks were capable of predicting the pathophysiological condition from the properties of single RBCs for the majority of the investigated RBCs. The average test accuracy of the classification was 78.7&#x0025; over five neural network models that were trained independently. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> presents the prediction results for the test set obtained using one of the five trained models. Here, each row represents the ground truth condition and each column represent the predicted condition. The diagonal elements refer to correct predictions, whereas the off-diagonal elements refer to incorrect predictions. The neural network classifier was relatively more sensitive to RET and DM, for which the sensitivities of screening were over 90&#x0025;, compared with other pathophysiological conditions. The most frequent error was the misclassification of RBCs of healthy individuals as RBCs of DM patients, which is not a failure to screen for unhealthy conditions, but a case of false alarm. Another case of error was misclassifying the RBCs of the HS patient as the RBCs of IDA patients.</p>
<p>The prediction process for an unknown input vector was rapid using a trained neural network, taking less than one second. Such rapid inference is the advantage of using an eager learning algorithm such as a neural network. In contrast to a lazy learning algorithm, for which the target function must be locally approximated for each input, the target function of an eager learning algorithm is approximated during training, which excludes the necessity of heavy computations. We consider this as an advantage for disease screening tasks.</p>

<label>3.3.</label>
<title>Ablation study of the input features</title>
<p>The contributions of different types of RBC properties to the screening of the pathophysiological conditions was investigated by conducting an ablation study of the input features. The performances of the neural network classifiers trained using different types of input features were evaluated. The input features were classified into three types: morphological, chemical, and mechanical properties of RBCs. A total of seven cases were compared, comprising three cases of a single-type input, three cases of a two-type input, and the entire input case. The prediction accuracies for the test set in the above-mentioned cases are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>. The accuracies were 42.9, 55.7, 64.6, 66.2, 73.5, 76.1, and 78.7&#x0025; when using the mechanical properties, chemical properties, morphological properties, mechanical and chemical properties, mechanical and morphological properties, chemical and morphological properties, and all three properties, respectively.</p>
<p>The results of the ablation study indicated that all three types of RBC properties are involved in screening for the pathophysiological conditions. The prediction accuracy increased as we utilized more types of RBC properties for the training, while it did not increase in any case of excluding a type of feature. This reflects the fact that no single type of RBC property can be fully derived from the other two, owing to the fundamental differences between the three types of RBC properties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the three types of RBC properties did not contribute equally to the screening for the pathophysiological conditions. In the three cases using single categories of RBC properties, the accuracies of the prediction were significantly different. The morphological properties appeared to be the most critical features in screening for the investigated conditions, because the presence of morphological properties in the input vector increased the classification accuracy more than the other two types of RBC properties. The chemical features were indicated to be the next most important features, based on the identical criterion. However, the presented order of importance does not determine the universal priorities for representing RBCs from the pathophysiological perspective. The magnitudes may vary depending on the investigated conditions, because different diseases and syndromes involve different alterations in RBCs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the key traits of the RBCs that the neural network selects to screen for each unhealthy condition appear to be consistent with the literature. We studied the role of each RBC property type in the screening for the unhealthy conditions by examining the disease sensitivities of neural networks trained using single categories of RBC properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Each condition was most sensitively screened for by the neural network trained using a specific category of RBC properties, even though the morphological properties were the most critical to the overall prediction accuracy. IDA, RET, HS, and DM were most sensitively screened for when the classifier was trained using the chemical, morphological, morphological, and mechanical properties, respectively. The aforementioned result is in agreement with the previous findings that IDA reduces the average Hb contents of RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Killip et al. 2007</xref>), RET increases the average volumes of RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Koepke and Koepke 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Watanabe et al. 1994</xref>), HS increases the average sphericities of RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al. 2014d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Perrotta et al. 2008</xref>), and DM suppresses the average membrane fluctuations of RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schmid-Sch&#x00F6;nbein and Volger 1976</xref>).</p>

<title>Screening for diseases and syndromes based on profiling multiple RBCs</title>
<p>The accuracy of predicting pathophysiological conditions of individuals was further increased by utilizing the neural network outputs of multiple RBCs. The output vector was averaged over multiple RBCs of an individual to predict the condition. The accuracies when averaging the output vectors between 1 and 10 RBCs are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>. The overall accuracy increased from 78.7 &#x00B1; 2.5&#x0025; to 98.8 &#x00B1; 0.3&#x0025;. The slope of the increase in the prediction accuracy was steeper for smaller numbers of RBCs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B and C</xref> display the confusion matrices of the predictions based on single RBCs and averages of 10 RBCs respectively. Comparing the two 3D bar graphs shows a reduction in the number of incorrect predictions when averaging over the output vectors of 10 RBCs, as off-diagonal elements in the graph are conspicuously removed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> specifies the detailed prediction results using the output averaging method, where the overall accuracy was 99.0&#x0025;. Here, the only remaining errors comprised misclassifications of healthy individuals as DM patients, which is in line with the most frequent errors in the prediction using single RBCs.</p>

<p>The increase in the accuracy indicates that the average neural activations converge to within a narrower scope, even though the neural activations of individual RBCs lie in a wide space. This indication was underpinned by visualizing the distributions of neural activations in the final hidden layer using t-distribution stochastic neighbor embedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">van der Maaten and Hinton 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D and E</xref>). While the activations of the final hidden layer are not fully separated according to the pathophysiological condition, the average values of the activations are well separated.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have demonstrated accurate screening for diseases and syndromes by combining QPI-based single-RBC profiling with machine learning. Our data-driven investigation of the high-dimensional feature space of a single-cell profiling dataset resulted in a high-accuracy neural network classifier, which systematically integrates morphological, chemical, and mechanical properties of individual RBCs. The pathophysiological condition-specific fingerprint patterns learned by the classifier were consistent with the literature. Combining the network predictions for multiple RBCs led to an accuracy of over 98&#x0025; by simply averaging over 10 RBCs, implying the fruitfulness of information available from QPI.</p>
<p>The proposed method exploits the inherent advantages of both QPI and machine learning. First, the label-free nature of QPI minimizes the required sample preparation, and thus enables rapid single-cell profiling. Second, QPI-based profiling of individual RBCs provides unique information that is otherwise inaccessible (i.e., membrane fluctuation, which is itself an important research topic in biophysics but has not been utilized in previous screening methods). Third, when trained beforehand a trained neural network classifier can perform extremely fast predictions immediately following the QPI measurement. Altogether, rapid and efficient screening for multiple diseases and syndromes was achieved.</p>
<p>The present work has several limitations, which can be improved in future work. Above all, it is essential to combine the QPI system with high-throughput microfluidics for generating large-scale datasets in order to explore the questions arising from the current work. For example: How many pathophysiological conditions can be screened? Is it possible to screen for multiple diseases and syndromes simultaneously? How many RBCs are required for good enough screening? Is there a systematic strategy to explore the learned patterns in the feature space for a data-driven understanding of diseases and syndromes? Furthermore, such large-scale data would enable an advanced implementation of deep neural networks or deep learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jo et al. 2017</xref>), with a stronger learning ability provided through feature learning. While the proposed machine learning framework is based on the hand-crafted features from previous studies on RBCs, deep learning automatically learns and extracts more powerful features from raw images. Furthermore, using commercially available QPI techniques we expect that the present method can be readily applied to clinical medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shin et al. 2016</xref>). Finally, we expect that cost-effective miniaturization of the system would enable rapid point-of-care diagnosis.</p>
