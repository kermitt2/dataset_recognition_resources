<title>Summary paragraph</title>
<p>Predicting a multicellular organism&#x2019;s phenotype quantitatively from its genotype is challenging, as genetic effects must propagate up time and length scales. Circadian clocks are intracellular regulators that control temporal gene expression patterns and hence metabolism, physiology and behaviour, from sleep/wake cycles in mammals to flowering in plants<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Clock genes are rarely essential but appropriate alleles can confer a competitive advantage<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and have been repeatedly selected during crop domestication<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Here we quantitatively explain and predict canonical phenotypes of circadian timing in a multicellular, model organism. We used metabolic and physiological data to combine and extend mathematical models of rhythmic gene expression, photoperiod-dependent flowering, elongation growth and starch metabolism within a Framework Model for growth of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic><sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. The model predicted the effect of altered circadian timing upon each particular phenotype in clock-mutant plants. Altered night-time metabolism of stored starch accounted for most but not all of the decrease in whole-plant growth rate. Altered mobilisation of a secondary store of organic acids explained the remaining defect. Our results link genotype through specific processes to higher-level phenotypes, formalising our understanding of a subtle, pleiotropic syndrome at the whole-organism level, and validating the systems approach to understand complex traits starting from intracellular circuits.</p>

<p>Small networks of &#x201C;clock genes&#x201D; drive 24-hour, biological rhythms in eukaryotic model species<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. A few among thousands of downstream, clock-regulated genes are known to mediate physiological phenotypes, such as the metabolic syndrome of clock mutant animals<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Identifying such causal links cannot predict whole-organism phenotypes quantitatively: formal, mathematical models are required. Predictive modelling in multicellular organisms has best succeeded for phenotypes that closely map the intracellular behaviour of gene circuits<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, metabolic<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> or signalling pathways<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Circadian clocks in contrast integrate multiple environmental inputs and affect disparate, potentially interacting biological processes, up to organismal growth and lifecycle traits<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Mis-timed mutant organisms suffer a syndrome of mild, environment-dependent effects akin to a chronic disease<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The Arabidopsis clock mechanism<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> comprises dawn-expressed transcription factors <italic>LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL</italic> (<italic>LHY</italic>) and <italic>CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1</italic> (<italic>CCA1</italic>), which inhibit the expression of evening genes such as <italic>GIGANTEA</italic> (<italic>GI</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1a</xref>). <italic>LHY</italic> and <italic>CCA1</italic> expression is inhibited by PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR (PRR) proteins. Removing the earliest-expressed <italic>PRR</italic> genes in <italic>prr7prr9</italic> mutants slows the clock<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> by delaying the decline of <italic>LHY</italic> and <italic>CCA1</italic> expression and the subsequent rise of their targets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1b</xref>). Mathematical models of this circuit<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> have been extended to intermediate transcription factors, including factors that regulate flowering time and organ elongation<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. We therefore tested whether these causal links were sufficient to understand (explain and predict) the multiple phenotypes of a clock mutant genotype.</p>

<p>The Arabidopsis Framework Model (FMv1)<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> represents the interacting physiological components of whole-organism phenotypes, in a simple, modular fashion. Flowering time in Arabidopsis is commonly scored by the number of rosette leaves, for example. Predicting leaf number involves the FM&#x2019;s clock and photoperiod<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, phenology<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and functional-structural sub-models<sup><xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Adding a clock sub-model that explicitly represents <italic>PRR7</italic>, <italic>PRR9</italic> and output pathways (see Supplementary Methods; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>) was sufficient to match the published, late-flowering phenotype<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> of <italic>prr7prr9</italic> compared to wild-type Columbia (Col) plants under long photoperiods (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1c</xref>). Under short photoperiods, the mutant phenotype is weaker (<xref rid="figE1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.1a</xref>). The model also matched the observed<sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, photoperiodic regulation of hypocotyl elongation in wild-type plants and qualitatively matched the longer hypocotyls of <italic>prr7prr9</italic> (<xref rid="figE1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.1b</xref>).</p>

<p>Biomass growth is mediated by the metabolic network, the development of sink and source organs and resource partitioning amongst them. Here, we test the importance of one of many potential circadian effects on biomass, <italic>via</italic> the nightly, clock-limited rate of sugar mobilisation from storage in transient starch<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. To understand these carbon dynamics in <italic>prr7prr9</italic>, we first extended the metabolic sub-model. Daytime starch accumulation in wild-type plants under short photoperiods was underestimated in the FMv1<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Partitioning of photoassimilate towards starch in the model was therefore updated using the measured activity of the key biosynthetic enzyme, AGPase, which partitions more carbon to starch under short photoperiods than is allowed for in the FMv1 (Supplementary Methods; <xref rid="figE2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.2a</xref>). At night, starch is mobilised (degraded) at a constant rate to provide sugar until dawn, as anticipated by the circadian clock<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We therefore linked the starch degradation rate to the clock sub-model<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> (Supplementary Methods). Simulation of the revised model closely matched end-of-day starch levels under photoperiods of 12h or less (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1e</xref>). Finally, the organic acids malate and fumarate also accumulate significantly during the day in Arabidopsis, are mobilised at night and have been proposed as secondary carbon stores<sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. At the end of the day, levels of malate and fumarate were two-fold higher in <italic>prr7prr9</italic> than wild-type, with a smaller elevation of citrate, aconitate and iso-citrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs.1d</xref>, <xref rid="figE3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.3</xref>). Malate and fumarate were therefore included as an organic acid pool with dynamics similar to starch, in an extended model termed the FMv2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>). The FMv2 predicts the gain of carbon biomass directly and other major biomass components indirectly. For example, the 3.3-fold increase in protein synthesis rates from night to day predicted by the model was very close to the observed 3.1-fold increase<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>(see Supplementary Methods). If altered starch mobilisation in the clock mutant was sufficient to affect its biomass, the FMv2 should also predict that phenotype.</p>

<p>We first tested whether the FMv2 could explain the phenotypes caused by a direct change in starch degradation, in mutants of <italic>LIKE SEX FOUR 1</italic> (<italic>LSF1</italic>). <italic>LSF1</italic> encodes a phosphatase homologue necessary for normal starch mobilisation<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. <italic>lsf1</italic> mutants grown under 12L:12D have mildly elevated starch levels and reduced biomass<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, similar to the <italic>prr7prr9</italic> clock mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3b</xref>). Reducing the relative starch degradation rate alone in the FMv2 recapitulated the <italic>lsf1</italic> starch excess observed in published studies<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figE1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.1c</xref>) and new datasets (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs.3g</xref>,<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). The higher baseline starch level arises naturally if the plant is close to a steady state, where the absolute amount of starch degraded nightly in <italic>lsf1</italic> equals the daily synthesis. Absolute starch synthesis in <italic>lsf1</italic> is wild-type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3g</xref>,3i). To degrade the same amount of starch as wild-type at a lower relative rate, the <italic>lsf1</italic> mutant must have a higher baseline starch level. The assumption of a lower relative degradation rate in <italic>lsf1</italic> is therefore functionally equivalent to but conceptually simpler than the previous assumption of an altered &#x2018;starch set point&#x2019; baseline level<sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A minimal model calibration workflow (<xref rid="figE4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.4</xref>) allowed comparison of simulations of the FMv2 with measurements from multiple experiments on <italic>prr7prr9</italic> and <italic>lsf1</italic> mutants. Measured photosynthetic and metabolic variables (<xref rid="figE5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.5</xref>) calibrated up to 4 model parameters (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>), and the genotype-specific water content<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Reducing the relative starch degradation rate in the calibrated model accurately predicted the reduced biomass of <italic>lsf1</italic> mutant plants in each case (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs.3c,3e</xref>), despite the apparent paradox that the mutants mobilised the same absolute amount of starch as the wild type. The explanation supported by the model is that <italic>lsf1</italic> mutant plants accumulate large, unused starch pools as well as new biomass, whereas wild-type plants produce biomass more efficiently, leaving only a minimum of carbon in starch. The coefficient of variation of the Root-Mean-Square Error (cvRMSE) provides a normalised error metric for all biomass data<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, showing a good fit to both <italic>lsf1</italic> and wild-type genotypes (10.1&#x0025;, 15.3&#x0025; Col and 13.7&#x0025;, 15.4&#x0025; <italic>lsf1</italic> in experiments 1 and 2 respectively). Altering the relative starch degradation rate therefore explained both the <italic>lsf1</italic> mutant&#x2019;s modest starch excess and its reduced biomass, validating the model.</p>

Simulating <italic>prr7prr9</italic> mutations in the clock sub-model matched these phenotypes for plants grown in Norwich (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs.3a</xref>, Extended Data 1e) and Edinburgh (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3h</xref>), indicating that the mutant clock&#x2019;s later estimate of subjective dawn explained the starch degradation defect. <italic>prr7</italic> single mutants<sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> fully mobilised starch and grew normally, as predicted (<xref rid="figE6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.6</xref>). Although model calibration data showed that photosynthesis, starch synthesis and leaf production rates were unaffected by the mutations (<xref rid="figE5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.5</xref>), biomass of <italic>prr7prr9</italic> mutant plants was strongly reduced relative to wild-type plants in independent studies (by 40&#x0025; and 31&#x0025; at 38 days in experiments 1 and 2 respectively). However, the calibrated FMv2 predicted much smaller reductions in biomass in <italic>prr7prr9</italic> due to accumulating starch (26&#x0025; and 18&#x0025; in experiments 1 and 2 respectively). Neither 1 S.D. variation in the mutant&#x2019;s simulated water content, the most sensitive parameter in our model (<xref rid="figE7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.7</xref>), nor any measured water content value allowed the model with only a starch defect to match the mutant biomass (<xref rid="figE8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.8</xref>). The poor model fits (cvRMSE = 41&#x0025;, 45&#x0025; in experiments 1 and 2 respectively) indicated that process(es) additional to starch degradation limited the growth of <italic>prr7prr9</italic> but not of <italic>lsf1</italic> plants.</p>

<p>Relative sensitivity of model outputs for each model parameter, coloured by the cognate sub-model (see legend). Sensitivities were calculated by simulating the model under 1&#x0025; perturbations of each parameter in turn. (a) Fresh Weight (FW); most sensitive parameter is s<sub>elec</sub>, associated with electron transport, (b) starch level at end of day (ED); most sensitive parameter is s<sub>elec</sub> and (c) at end of night (EN); most sensitive parameter is k<sub>dT1</sub>, the degradation rate of a putative inhibitor of starch turnover. Clock parameters mutated to simulate <italic>prr7prr9</italic> double mutants are highlighted (see legend). (d) Comparison of sensitivity of FW and EON starch for parameters clock and starch module parameters, showing a predominant negative correlation: parameters that lower starch at the end of the night tend to increase fresh weight. Note that water content (w, a directly measured parameter) is not shown due to high sensitivity. Sensitivities to changes in water content were 11.3, -10.1, and -10.1 for gFW, ED starch, and EN starch, respectively.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Considering malate and fumarate as a secondary carbon store<sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, the amount of carbon mobilised from malate and fumarate at night in the wild type was up to 19&#x0025; of the carbon mobilised from starch. <italic>prr7prr9</italic> but not <italic>lsf1</italic> plants accumulated excess malate and fumarate, representing further &#x2018;wasted&#x2019; carbon that did not contribute to subsequent growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs.3k-n</xref>). We therefore reduced the relative malate and fumarate mobilisation rate in the FMv2 simulation of <italic>prr7prr9,</italic> to reproduce the observed organic acid excess (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs.3l,n</xref>). Together, the simulated defects in starch and organic acid mobilisation quantitatively accounted for the mutant&#x2019;s reduced biomass (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs.3d,3f</xref>; cvRMSE = 14.4&#x0025;, 20.1&#x0025; in experiments 1 and 2 respectively).</p>
<p>The FMv2 built upon delayed gene expression patterns in <italic>prr7prr9</italic> mutants to predict canonical clock phenotypes: altered hypocotyl elongation, flowering time, starch metabolism and hence most (58-65&#x0025;) of the mutants&#x2019; reduced biomass. Unused malate and fumarate accounted for their remaining biomass defect, and might similarly affect arrhythmic <italic>prr5prr7prr9</italic> mutants<sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Carbon supply limited growth in our well-watered, nutrient-rich growth conditions<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, though carbon limitation was milder than in conditions that reduced the chlorophyll content of clock mutants<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> or triggered sugar signals to alter timing<sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Future extensions of the model could address the nutrient and water limitations that prevail in field conditions, test further aspects of circadian regulation and critical functions of plant biology with daily regulation, such as photosynthesis. Our results suggest a broader proof of principle, that the contributions of dynamic gene regulation and metabolism to whole-organism physiology will also be understood (explained and predicted) quantitatively in other multicellular species<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, for example using clock and metabolic models in animals and humans to understand body composition<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title>
<p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> of the Columbia (Col-0) accession, <italic>prr7-3/prr9-1</italic><sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and <italic>lsf1-1</italic><sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> were used in this study. Seeds were first sown on half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) solution and stratified in darkness at 4&#x00B0;C for 5 days before being exposed to white light at the desired photoperiod and temperature. Four-day-old seedlings were then transferred to soil containing Levington seed and modular compost (plus sand). The growth and treatment conditions for each experiment are shown in the figure legends. For the experiment in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1d</xref> and <xref rid="figE3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.3</xref> only, seeds were sown on wet soil in pots and transferred directly to experimental conditions. Plants were thinned after a week and treated with Nematodes after two weeks as a biological pest control.</p>

<sec id="s1a2">
<title>Leaf number and plant assay</title>
<p>The total number of leaves (including the cotyledons) was recorded every 3-4 days from seedling emergence. Only leaves exceeding 1 mm<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> in size (by eye) were considered in the total leaf count. Plants were harvested for biomass at different time points and for metabolite measurement at 3 weeks (<xref rid="figE3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.3</xref>) and 4 weeks (other data). For metabolite measurement, rosettes were harvested and immediately submerged in liquid nitrogen, half an hour before lights off (end of day, ED) or lights on (end of night, EN) and stored at -80&#x00B0;C until extraction. For dry biomass, dissected plants were oven-dried at 80&#x00B0;C for 7 days. Area analysis was conducted using ImageJ <sup><xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Each image was first processed with colour thresholding to isolate the green region, which was next converted into binary format. The area was then determined using the Analyze Particles tool.</p>

<sec id="s1a3">
<title>Gas exchange measurement</title>
<p>An EGM-4 Environmental Gas Monitor for CO<sub>2</sub> (PP Systems, US) was used for CO<sub>2</sub> flux measurement. A Plexiglass cylindrical chamber (12 cm in diameter x 3 cm sealed height, with a 6 cm tall support) was used (<xref rid="figE5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.5f</xref>). Rubber rings around the lid and the hole for the pot ensured an airtight seal. The chamber was connected to the EGM-4 with two butyl tubes for closed-loop measurement.</p>
<p>Each individual measurement was taken by placing an individual plant pot in the chamber for approximately 60 seconds, during which the EGM-4 recorded CO2 concentration (&#x03BC;mol mol<sup>-<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> or ppm) every 4.6 seconds. We covered the soil surface of the pots with black opaque plastic, leaving only a small hole in the middle for the plants. Plants were measured when they were 37 days old. Dark respiration was measured one hour before lights-on while daytime assimilation was measured one hour before lights-off.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment of the atmosphere in the growth chambers due to the experimenters&#x2019; breathing was avoided by using a breath-scrubbing device during measurement. Hourly CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at leaf level was also monitored by connecting the EGM-4 to a computer for automated data logging. The average hourly CO<sub>2</sub> level was used as input to the model.</p>

<title>Extraction and determination of metabolite content</title>
<p>Rosettes were harvested as described above and ground in liquid nitrogen. Around 20mg of ground material was aliquoted in screw-cap tubes (Micronic). Ethanolic extraction was performed using 80&#x0025; ethanol v/v with 10mM MES (pH 5.9) and 50&#x0025; ethanol v/v with 10mM MES (pH 5.9). During extraction, the successive supernatants obtained were combined into 96-deep well plates. The supernatant was used for spectrophotometric determination of chlorophylls, soluble carbohydrates, amino acids and organic acids as described<sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. The pellet remaining after the ethanolic extraction was used for the determination of starch and total protein content as described<sup><xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Photoperiod response model</title>
<p>The circadian clock controls the timing of flowering by regulating the expression of the <italic>FT</italic> gene through the photoperiod pathway. The photoperiod response was previously modelled in the Arabidopsis Framework Model version 1 (FMv1) <sup><xref rid="sc1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> by including the model from Salazar et al 2009 <sup><xref rid="sc2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. However, this model includes an older circadian clock model <sup><xref rid="sc3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> that does not explicitly represent the relevant clock components <italic>PRR9</italic> and <italic>PRR7</italic>. We therefore replaced the Salazar model with our most recent, Seaton-Smith model of the photoperiod pathway <sup><xref rid="sc4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. This brings several advantages. First, the Seaton-Smith model includes additional understanding of the photo period response mechanism, such as the regulation of CO protein stability by FKF1 <sup><xref rid="sc5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Second, it is based upon the same circadian clock model <sup><xref rid="sc6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> as the clock-starch model that we introduce in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5b">Section 1.2</xref>, below. Third, the clock model includes <italic>PRR9</italic> and <italic>PRR7</italic>, allowing explicit simulation of the <italic>prr9prr7</italic> mutation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5b2">section 1.2.2</xref>). Fourth, the Seaton-Smith model represents circadian regulation of hypocotyl elongation via the <italic>PIF</italic> transcription factors, allowing the FMv2 to represent this canonical clock phenotype.</p>
<p>As in the Salazar and FMv1 models, the photoperiod response model in the FMv2 interacts with the phenology model through the control of <italic>FT</italic> transcript expression. The important characteristic is '<italic>FTarea</italic>', the integrated <italic>FT</italic> level over the course of a 24h day. <italic>FTarea</italic> controls the <italic>Photoperiod</italic> component of the phenology model through the expression:</p>

<p>In order to utilise this connection with the new circadian clock model, the parameters <italic>b, c</italic> and <italic>n</italic> were chosen so that this function matched the original photoperiod function given by Chew et al 2012 <sup><xref rid="sc7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, as was done previously for the connection from the older clock model in Chew et al 2014 <sup><xref rid="sc1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Circadian control of starch turnover</title>
<p>The circadian clock controls the rate of starch degradation during the night in light: dark cycles <sup><xref rid="sc8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="sc9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this control have not been identified, but our recent work identified simple, plausible mechanisms <sup><xref rid="sc10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. These were formalised in mathematical models that were evaluated by comparison to a wide range of experimental data (e.g. the change in starch turnover when dusk arrives &#x007E;4 hours early). In Seaton et al 2014 <sup><xref rid="sc10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, three models were described in detail, named Model Variants 1, 2 and 3. Of these, Model Variants 2 and 3 provided the best match to experimental data, while Model Variant 1 was shown to have several limitations. Since Model Variants 2 and 3 provided quantitatively similar predictions over a range of conditions, and Model Variant 2 is simpler (6 fewer parameters and 2 fewer regulatory links from the circadian clock), we chose to integrate Model 2 with the FMv2.</p>

<title>Starch model structure</title>
<p>In order to incorporate this control of starch turnover with the FM, we treat the starch component <italic>S</italic> as a measure of starch concentration (rather than absolute quantity per plant). Thus, this is taken as:</p>
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="105437_ueqn2.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p>Where <italic>S</italic>(t) is starch concentration variable used in the model of starch turnover, <italic>C<sub>starch</sub></italic>(t) and <italic>C<sub>shoot</sub></italic>(t) are the carbon in starch and in the shoot biomass respectively, and <italic>r</italic> is a scaling factor used to bring <italic>S</italic>(t) to a similar range of concentrations to those used in the original model construction<sup><xref rid="sc10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Note, the control of starch synthesis by the species <italic>Y</italic> is disregarded, as starch synthesis is modelled as a fixed fraction of photoassimilate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5b">Section 1.2</xref>).</p>
<p>This model runs on an hourly basis throughout the day, but controls starch turnover only during the night. The starch concentration (i.e. <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)) is calculated at the start of the timestep, and the change in starch levels by the end of the hour is then given by:</p>

<title>Simulating <italic>lsf1</italic> and <italic>prr7prr9</italic> mutant genotypes</title>
<p>In order to simulate the circadian clock mutant <italic>prr7prr9</italic>, we set to 0 the clock parameters <italic>q3</italic>, <italic>n4</italic>, <italic>n7</italic>, <italic>n8</italic>, and <italic>n9</italic>, which control the multiple aspects of the transcription rate of <italic>PRR7</italic> and <italic>PRR9</italic>.

<p>All other parameter values were calibrated as described in Section 4, below (<xref rid="figE4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig.4</xref>), and are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>. The starch degradation rate parameter in FMv1 (<italic>sta_turnover</italic>) is not used in FMv2, because the starch degradation rate is computed bythe clock-regulated starch model. In order to simulate the <italic>lsf1</italic> mutant, the parameters <italic>k<sub>d,S</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>d,T,2</sub></italic> in this model were set to 10 and 0.018, respectively, calibrating simulated starch to our experimental data. This allowed the model to match the experimentally observed starch turnover in our experiment 1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>) and in literature data <sup><xref rid="sc11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figE1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 1c</xref>).

<title>Revision of Starch synthesis</title>
<p>In the original Carbon Dynamic Model (CDM) <sup><xref rid="sc1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="sc12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, starch is synthesised at a rate that is the sum of a baseline rate and an &#x2018;overflow&#x2019; rate. The baseline rate is a fixed proportion of the photoassimilate. The rest of the photoassimilate is first converted into soluble sugars which are used for growth and respiration. As growth demand is limited to a maximum value, any excess photoassimilate is converted into starch, through the &#x2018;overflow&#x2019; rate.</p>
<p>Our previous work <sup><xref rid="sc1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="sc13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> showed that the &#x2018;overflow&#x2019; mechanism is not always applicable, especially when plants are grown in short-day conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>). Results suggested that starch is synthesised at a photoperiod-dependent fixed rate that is much higher than the baseline, and any excess photoassimilate remains as sugars. This ensures that plants store sufficient starch to last the night. We therefore re-routed the carbon flow based on this finding.</p>
<p>To determine the photoperiod-dependent starch synthesis rate, we first calculated the fraction of measured net assimilate partitioned to starch using our previous data<sup><xref rid="sc13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and the equation below:</p>
<disp-formula id="ueqn5">

<p><italic>SEN</italic> = Starch level at EN</p>
<p><italic>AN</italic> = Net assimilation rate per hour</p>
<p><italic>P</italic> = Photoperiod</p>
<p>It has been reported that under low light conditions, most of the flux control through the pathway of starch synthesis resides in the reaction catalysed by AGPase <sup><xref rid="sc14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Since most lab experiments are conducted under low light, we therefore also tested the relation between the fraction partitioned to starch and AGPase activity. If the total amount of starch accumulated over the light period is proportional to daily AGPase activity (averaged between ED and EN), the fraction is given by:</p>

<p>where <italic>k</italic> is the proportional constant. We determined the value of <italic>k</italic> using data from 12-hr photoperiod as the reference. We found a strong linear relation between the fraction of measured net assimilate and photoperiod (<xref rid="figE2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2</xref>). This relation is therefore used in the FMv2 to determine starch synthesis rate, <italic>StaSyn</italic>, as follows:</p>

<title>Addition of carbon pool for malate and fumarate</title>
<p>Malate and fumarate can be interconverted in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, so they are considered together in a single pool. The dynamics of this pool is modelled in a manner similar to starch except for the regulation of degradation rate by the clock. In the daytime, a fixed proportion of the photoassimilate is converted to starch, malate and fumarate, while sugar level is allow to fluctuate depending on the carbon excess. At night, malate and fumarate are consumed with a linear rate, while starch degradation rate is controlled by the clock sub-model (see <xref rid="figE2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5b">Section 1.2</xref>). For simplicity, we model a direct conversion of carbon from malate and fumarate into sugar at night, omitting the intermediate metabolic reactions.</p>

<title>Parameter calibration</title>
<p>Results in our previous studies <sup><xref rid="sc1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="sc13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> suggested that carbon dynamics in plants are flexible and plants adjust processes like photosynthesis, starch synthesis and starch degradation rate depending on the environment. The aims of our study were to test if the dynamics of the different carbon pools can be quantitatively balanced over the timescale of vegetative growth, and how genetic regulation that modifies these dynamics affects plant growth. It is therefore necessary that the model first matches quantitatively the carbon pool data for wild-type plants as the reference genotype in each study. After accounting for environmental effects on all genotypes through the wild-type data, discrepancies between model simulations and data for the mutants can be attributed to genetic effects. To achieve this, we calibrated the following to the Col data (workflow illustrated in <xref rid="figE4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 4</xref>; parameter values in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>):</p>
<list list-type="bullet">

<p>photosynthesis rate was adjusted by introducing an efficiency factor relative to the default</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>starch synthesis rate was adjusted by introducing an efficiency factor relative to the default</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Starch turnover was simulated by the clock-controlled starch submodel (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5b">Section 1.2</xref>), which reproduced experimental measurement of percentage turnover in most cases. In cases where the phenotype of starch degradation was too mild and could not be explained by the starch submodel, we used a linear degradation rate as in the previous model version (FMv1) to reproduce the turnover. We then iteratively tuned starch synthesis and photosynthesis rates to match the measured end-of-day level (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We next calibrated the parameter values for the new carbon pool that represents malate and fumarate (MF) using Col data as follows:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>The initial level of this pool was set as 0.4 of initial starch level, based on the ratio measured in the literature <sup><xref rid="sc15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>MF synthesis was set as a fixed fraction of starch synthesis</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>MF turnover was set as the fraction of dusk level consumed</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Wherever possible, we used parameter values measured or calculated from our data. Mutants were simulated by changing the values of genotype-specific parameters as listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>, notably the water content.</p>
<p>In each experiment, we did not find genotypic differences in photosynthesis when expressed per unit area, but there was a general increase in photosynthesis in <italic>prr7prr9</italic> when expressed per gram fresh weight (<xref rid="figE5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>). Even though we used the same photosynthesis efficiency for all genotypes, we found that the model could reproduce this increase due to the lower water content measured in <italic>prr7prr9</italic>. This suggested the importance of including water content as a genotype-specific parameter in our model, since metabolites are measured per unit fresh weight.</p>
<p>As expected, we found variation in photosynthesis efficiency between experiments. In particular, the photosynthesis per unit area was higher for all genotypes in Experiment 2. As a result, the model underestimated these, but reproduced the values when expressed per unit fresh weight, suggesting a difference in the specific leaf area.</p>

<title>Modelling protein synthesis, compared to literature data</title>
<p>The biomass prediction in the FMv2 implies minimal budgets for the nutrient constituents of biomass, which are effectively predictions that can be compared to published experimental data. For example, <sup><xref rid="sc13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>CO<sub>2</sub> labelling has allowed quantification of the relative rates of protein synthesis in the light and dark during light:dark cycles <sup><xref rid="sc16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and of rates of protein turnover <sup><xref rid="sc17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The model does not include protein as a distinct component of the synthesised biomass. However, since the protein fraction of biomass is relatively constant across the course of a day (for example, see Pyl et al 2012 <sup><xref rid="sc18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>), and protein turnover has been measured, it is possible to calculate an implied rate of protein synthesis for a given model simulation (as done experimentally in <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al 2015</xref> <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>). In particular:</p>

<p>where <italic>ProtSyn</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the calculated rate of protein synthesis at time <italic>t</italic>, in units of gProtein gFW<sup>-</sup> 1h<sup>-1</sup>. <italic>Gr</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the relative growth rate (= <italic>(Biomass(t)-Biomass(t-1))/Biomass(t)</italic>), in units of hr<sup>-1</sup>. <italic>Turn</italic> is the rate of protein turnover, measured as 0.0014 hr<sup>-1</sup> (average of measurements by Pulse-Chase labelling <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>). <italic>Prot</italic> is the protein content, measured as 0.0169 gProtein gFW<sup>-1</sup> in <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al 2015</xref> <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Simulating the conditions used in <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al 2015</xref> <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> for wild-type plants shows that carbon biomass growth rates in the model predict a 3.3-fold increase in the rate of protein synthesis during the day, compared to during the night. This is in excellent agreement with experimental data which showed a 3.1-fold increase<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, <sup><xref rid="sc18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
