<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>In the past ten years, many studies have shown that malignant tissue has been &#x201C;normalized&#x201D; <italic>in vitro</italic> using mechanical signals. We apply the principles of physical oncology (or mechanobiology) <italic>in vivo</italic> to show the effect of a &#x201C;constraint field&#x201D; on tumor growth. The human breast cancer cell line, MDA MB 231, admixed with ferric nanoparticles was grafted subcutaneously in Nude mice. The magnetizable particles rapidly surrounded the growing tumor. Two permanent magnets located on either side of the tumor created a gradient of magnetic field. Magnetic energy is transformed into mechanical energy by the particles acting as &#x201C;bioactuators&#x201D;, applying a constraint field and, by consequence, biomechanical stress to the tumor. This biomechanical treatment was applied 2 hours/day during 21 days, from Day 18 to Day 39 following tumor implantation. The study lasted 74 days. Palpable tumor was measured two times a week. There was a significant <italic>in vivo</italic> difference between the median volume of treated tumors and untreated controls in the mice measured up to D 74 (D 59 &#x002B; population): (529 [346; 966] mm<sup>3</sup> vs 1334 [256; 2106] mm<sup>3</sup>; p=0.015), treated mice having smaller tumors. The difference was not statistically significant in the group of mice measured at least to D 59 (D 59 population). On <italic>ex vivo</italic> examination, the surface of the tumor mass, measured on histologic sections, was less in the treated group, G1, than in the control groups: G2 (nanoparticles, no magnetic field), G3 (magnetic field, no nanoparticles), G4 (no nanoparticles, no magnetic field) in the D 59 population (Median left surface was significantly lower in G1 (5.6 [3.0; 42.4] mm<sup>2</sup>, p=0.005) than in G2 (20.8 [4.9; 34.3]), G3 (16.5 [13.2; 23.2]) and G4 (14.8 [1.8; 55.5]); Median right surface was significantly lower in G1 (4.7 [1.9; 29.2] mm<sup>2</sup>, p=0.015) than in G2 (25.0 [5.2; 55.0]), G3 (18.0 [14.6; 35.2]) and G4 (12.5 [1.5; 51.8]). There was no statistically significant difference in the day 59&#x002B; population. This is the first demonstration of the effect of stress on tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting that biomechanical intervention may have a high translational potential as a therapy in locally advanced tumors like pancreatic cancer or primary hepatic carcinoma for which no effective therapy is currently available.</p></abstract>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In the great majority of cases, a cancerous mass is a complex of tissues: an extracellular matrix (ECM), stroma, and the cancer cells derived from epithelium. In a clinical cancer, ECM is rigid whereas the tumor tissue is softer than the tissue of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The stiffness of a cell/tissue is determined by its &#x201C;Young&#x2019;s modulus&#x201D; (E) which is obtained by measuring resistance to deformity of the cell/tissue in response to a force applied for a given surface area. E is expressed in Pascal (Pa). The measurement of stiffness with Young&#x2019;s Modulus E was first performed <italic>in vitro</italic> on cultured cells. This has become a diagnostic tool for effusion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) or circulating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Depending on the technique and origin of the cells, the absolute values differ, but a common pattern can be seen with E greater than 1 kiloPascal (kPa) for normal cells with a relatively large spread of values. Following transformation to cancer, the same cells exhibit an E value of less than 1 kPa with less variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently <italic>ex vivo</italic> measures on breast biopsies maintained viable <italic>ex vivo</italic> have confirmed the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>); Normal breast tissue has a unimodal stiffness distribution of 1.13 &#x002B;/-0.78 kPa. Cancer biopsies have a bimodal distribution with a first peak at 0.57&#x002B;/-0.16 kPa representing the cancer tissue. A second peak at 1.99&#x002B;/-0.73 kPa represents the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>); The differential between cancer and non cancer is around 30-40 Pa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). These studies also provided values for neoangiogenic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> measurements have in common the extensive use of Atomic Force Microscope and other approaches that have allowed us to have access to accurate measurement of cell and tissue mechanical parameters like Young&#x2019;s module. This is useful to estimate the range of forces to be applied to a tumor to be able to overcome its rigidity. The delicate balance of forces between the tumor, the ECM, and the normal tissue surrounding the ECM is poorly understood. The best known of these mechanisms is the translation of mechanical signals to biological changes while the experimental study of the translation of mechanical cues to mechanical changes is scarce in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The relationship in time and space of the forces controlling cancer and the surrounding normal tissues is yet to be studied. A tumor, therefore, is a complex ecosystem in which change from a non-malignant epithelial Euclidian architecture to a fractal architecture of cancer on a microscopic and macroscopic scale is accompanied by a change in mechanical/biochemical signals and a change in the physical properties of tissues in the cancerous complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Cells and tissues, normal and cancerous, are continuously exposed to compression, surface / interface tension, hydrostatic and osmotic pressure, shear stress, etc&#x2026; and more generally to constraint fields. In the last decade, the biophysical mechanisms associated with carcinogenic change and in ECM control of tissue growth and modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) have become better understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems have allowed the study of growth and apoptosis. It has been shown, for instance, that pressure applied to a tumor <italic>in vitro</italic> in different experimental setups delays tumor growth by changing cell death (apoptosis) and cell division in space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The first demonstration of the action of stress (surface tension) on the phenotype of a breast acinus was reported in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Others have shown the effect of osmotic pressure or compressive stress on a spheroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) or the effect of gravity on cells in a 2D cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). In those experiments, pressure was applied on tissue externally by modifying the environment that was then considered as being equivalent to the ECM. Tumor volume, rates of cell division and apoptosis are therefore measurable <italic>in vitro</italic>. They correlate with the effect of stress.</p>
<p>To apply a force to a malignant tumor <italic>in vivo</italic>, it was necessary to design an experimental device allowing pressure to be applied only to the tumor tissue using a process which delivered a constant pressure, locally. We present here the first <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment using pressure applied to a cancer mass of human origin to modify its growth<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref>. This disruptive innovation consists of the capacity to modify tumor growth with a constraint field usable <italic>in vivo</italic>. The principle is illustrated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> showing a 2D culture <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

</fig>
<p>To be able to apply the field <italic>in vivo</italic>, two permanent magnets located on either side of the tumor delivered a gradient of magnetic field. Magnetic energy is transformed into mechanical energy by the magnetized particles acting as &#x201C;bioactuators&#x201D;, applying a constraint field, and by consequence biomechanical stress to the tumor.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>STUDY RATIONALE</title>
<p>The action of a constraint field on a tissue is the result of biological consequences, only some of which are known: a very large number of biochemical signals are activated simultaneously either by conformational change as in changes in histone/DNA bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), or by action on receptors which are directly sensitive to membrane signals, or through a wide range of other mechanisms such as mechanical stimulation of growth factors or their receptors, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). To date, these consequences of the action of a constraint field have been described only qualitatively, without quantifying the effect, simply describing an increase vs decrease, or stimulation vs inhibition.</p>
<p>In addition, the mechanisms by which these biomechanical forces produce their effect, i.e. &#x201C;<italic>en bloc</italic>&#x201D;, have not been studied since the action of physical signals is extremely fast and not compartmentalized as signals are in a liquid medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>The imposition of biomechanical stress enables a shift in study from a biological reductionist approach to one that examines the interaction between the constraint field and the cancer mass on a macroscopic level, tumor volume, and changes thereof.</p>
<p>The measurement of tumor volume as the target variable in this report has developed through two stages:</p>
<p>Firstly, a feasibility study was performed to assess the distribution in space of a mix of cells and ferric nanoparticles grafted subcutaneously.</p>
<p>Next, the design and implementation of the experiment to test Proof of Concept: The two groups subjected to a Magnetic Field Gradient (MFG) were placed between 2 identical magnets in repulsive mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the experimental system was to be able to apply a constraint field to modify the forces between the tumor and its environment. This effect was maximum to the left and minimum to the right due to the difference of distance between magnet and tumor.</p>
<p>If a difference in reduction in volume between left and right was found, it was then possible to draw two conclusions: that the mechanisms involved were similar, and that an estimate of the orders of magnitude of the acting forces could be obtained. It was then necessary to measure the two living surfaces of a tumor, excluding necrosis. The measurement was enabled by digitizing histological sections.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Volume and surface measurements</title>
<p>Regular samples were monitored to quantitate the growth kinetics of overall volume and surfaces on histologic sections, including the viable tissue and the volume of central necrosis which is found in this type of subcutaneous tumor that has no or little angiogenic network.</p>
<p>The first measurement is performed <italic>in vivo,</italic> with a caliper, through the skin an converted in mm<sup>3</sup> during the 21 treatment days from D 18 to D 30 and then up to 74 days when the last animals were sacrificed.</p>
<p>The second measurement is the <italic>ex vivo</italic> surface areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1D</xref>): left living tumor (located on the left in contact with the ipsilateral magnet and right living tumor located on the right and one diameter remote from magnet) and necrosis (all measured in mm<sup>2</sup>) on histological sections of tumors taken at different times of the experiment.</p>

<title>Graft of MDA-MB-231 tumor in BALB/C Nude mice</title>
<p>Mice were 6-7 weeks old and weighed 16-20 g at reception (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). Ten million (1 x 10<sup>7</sup>) MDA-MB-231 tumor cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were suspended in a volume of 0.3 mL RPMI 1640 medium containing either 5 mg of iron (300 &#x03BC;l of 100 nm nanoparticles/injection Fluid MAG D, Chemicell, Germany) or no iron nanoparticles.

<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>Samples of tumor were obtained by humanely killing the mice in order to monitor the change in tumor volumes over time by analyzing the maximum histological surface area of the tumors from which samples were taken.</p>
<p>Several samples were taken during the experiment: 3 tumor samples in G1 and G3 and 6 tumor samples in G4 on D 28, D34 and D 61.</p>
<p>It was not possible to obtain samples in G2 (no MFG, nanoparticles) which was made up of only 9 tumors.</p>
<p>The last sample was taken on D 61, i.e. 22 days after the end of treatment following a final <italic>in vivo</italic> caliper measurement on D 59.</p>
<p>The remaining living mice were humanely killed for ethical reasons on D 63 and D 74. The groups are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1B</xref>.</p>

<title>Estimate of force</title>
<p>A graph was available which displayed the magnetic field gradient in the airgap of the magnets (Altran, France).

<p>When the tumor volume reached a maximum volume of 2,000 mm<sup>3</sup>, an autopsy (macroscopic examination of heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and gastro-intestinal tract) was performed on all killed mice in the study, and if feasible, on all moribund mice of mice found dead. Autopsy observations were recorded.</p>
<p>All tumors were resected, fixed in formalin, and shipped to the pathologist.</p>
<p>Each paraffin section was cut at 4 &#x03BC;m, and the slides stained with HES, (hematoxylin, eosin and safranin).</p>

<p>The length and width of the tumors were measured twice weekly in the 57 days of the experiment during the times when the tumors were easily measurable, i.e. D 17 to D 74.</p>
<p>At each measurement of tumor diameter, i.e. twice weekly, the airgap between the magnets was adjusted in order to maintain the left side of the tumor in contact with the left magnet and the right side of the tumor a distance of 1 diameter from the right magnet with a precision in the region of 0.1 mm.</p>
<p>The tumor volume (TV) was estimated by the formula: <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="045534_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> Length x Width<sup>2</sup>, expressed in mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>A first statistical analysis of the TV was performed on the tumors treated to D 39 and measured at least up to D 59 (last measurement before D 61 humane killing; D 59 population) and up to D 74 (last measurement before killing at D 63 and D 74; D 59&#x002B; population) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>STATISTICAL METHODS</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using <italic>in vivo</italic> manager<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> software (Biosyst&#x00E8;mes, France). Statistical analyses of mean body weight changes, mean tumor volumes at randomization, mean target tumor volumes V, mean times to reach the target volume V and mean tumor doubling times were performed using the Bonferroni/Dunn test. All groups were compared with each other.</p>
<p>The following summary statistics were calculated for each variable (volume or surface area): number of tumors measured (n), range (minimum and maximum values), 25 &#x0025;, 50 &#x0025; (median) and 75 &#x0025; quartiles and mean &#x00B1; standard deviation.</p>
<p>Where no departure from the heteroscedasticity and normality assumptions was detected before or after log transformation of the data, a variable was statistically analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. The treated group was then compared to the mean of all 3 control groups by testing the following Helmert contrast: 1xG1-1/3x (G2&#x002B;G3&#x002B;G4). The rationale for merging control groups was the absence of statistically significant difference between the groups. Where the statistical assumptions of ANOVA were unmet, pairwise comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. The same Helmert contrast was used as for the parametric procedure. Unless otherwise stated, a p value &#x003C; 0.05 is considered as significant.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to provide <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental evidence of the possibility of influencing tumor growth by biomechanical signals. This was based on results obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> in which the effect has been extensively demonstrated.</p>
<p>Two analyses were performed, one on the <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements of the volume of tumors grafted subcutaneously and the other on <italic>ex vivo</italic> digitized surfaces of tumors sampled.</p>
<p>A highly significant difference (p=0.015) was found in tumor volume measured <italic>in vivo</italic> in the D 59 &#x002B; population of tumors after 21 days of treatment. The difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.067) for all tumors included.</p>
<p>The analysis of the maximal histological surface comparing either the left side of tumors where the field of constraint was maximal or the right side where the field of constraint was minimal showed a significant difference between treated tumors compared to controls for all the D 59 population. No significant difference between surfaces right or left could be detected for D 59&#x002B; population.</p>
<p>The forces and pressures generated by the constraint field applied to the tumor produced complex effects related to the physical properties of the different constituent media, epithelial tissue, fibrosis, resistance of part of the ECM in contact with the tumor tissue and more remote tissues. It has been shown recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) that pressure exerted by a growing tumor influences biologically and mechanically the normal tissue at a distance.</p>
<p>These effects result from mechanics which have hardly been explored at all to date. This study does not answer the question of describing or measuring traction, impulses, shear and other forces involved.</p>
<p>The right/left comparison, however, may give a clue to answer the question of biomechanical impact resulting in highly significant surface differences between the left, the region exposed to the greatest pressure, and the right, the region of the lowest pressure. An increase in pressures applied would therefore appear to have a greater effect on tumor growth, despite the low level of forces exerted on tumor.</p>
<sec id="s6a">
<title>The future</title>
<p>After validating this Proof of Concept for this experimental device which cannot be used in a clinical situation. Moreover, the lesser increase of tumor volume is a low marker of anticancer activity. Proof of Efficacy using more powerful devices is a logical next step.</p>
<p>There are four available parameters than can be varied: magnetic field of the magnet, distance to the tumor, quantity of iron and approximate stiffness as derived from literature. There is, therefore the basis for further mechanistic studies.</p>
<p>The experimental design will be based on iron deposition in neoangiogenesis. To do this, specific neoangiogenesis nanoparticles already developed and used in animal imaging will be employed. The geometry of the iron deposit around the tumor makes it possible to apply a constraint field localized in the tumor with a turning ant tunable magnetic field gradient generated by electromagnets. Pressures could therefore be increased by a large factor.</p>
<p>Two problems arise: the first is constructing an experimental Proof of Efficacy model which may contribute information about the physical mechanisms involved on a macroscopic scale applicable to the cancer and its two tissues: Tumor and ECM, and to the surrounding normal tissue. This current model will allow insight to improve and better understand the experimental model chosen for Proof of Efficacy, i.e. orthotopic grafting of human pancreatic cancer into the pancreas of mice or human liver cancer into the liver of mice allowing an extrapolation to be made to the clinical situations of these locally advanced tumors which have no satisfactory treatment.</p>
<p>The second problem which arises is the microscopic analysis of biochemical signals generated by the physical changes. Description of signal transduction pathways and the expression of common promoter and inhibitor gene products under the influence of biomechanical forces would be of both academic and &#x201C;product development&#x201D; interest. Correlation with the observations of tumor growth as described herein could provide a model for targeted intervention designed to mimic the biomechanical effects.</p>
<p>Mechanical signals are transmitted from the ECM to the nucleus through CSK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The CSK components, actin filaments, microtubules and microfilaments, associated with mitochondria, representing approximately 20&#x0025; of the cell volume, are semi-solid and in continuity with the tissue environment. They maintain architectural integrity of tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) and mitochondrial thermodynamic function related to the CSK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<p>They are the support for the cell architecture through a reciprocal mechanism of compression and tension between them and the ECM or Basal Membrane (BM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). This semi-solid system is changed greatly by mechanical cues during the process or carcinogenesis and is the most accessible part to analysis and change by physical means. Resonance frequencies of the CSK will be looked for.</p>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>The study of tumor transformation through the action of forces and pressures and the introduction of the notion of constraint field in tissue is quite recent in oncology and also is relevant to embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), and tissue engineering.</p>
<p>This biomechanical framework makes it possible to redefine cancer as a disease of the cellular and, particularly, the tissue architecture leading to changes in cell metabolism ranging from oxidation to glycolysis and, ultimately, to a profound change in the genetic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>
<p>This is valid for the 3 steps of carcinogenesis, from BM crossing to metastatic invasion by adeno-or squamous carcinomas, in other words a very large majority of cancers of epithelial origin.</p>
<p>The two medical devices used in this Proof of Efficacy, ferric nanoparticles (developed as MRI IV contrast media of neovessels) and magnetic field gradient generators are commonly used in rodents and patients without significant toxicity. Moreover until now physical oncology has been used as a research and diagnostic tool and its therapeutic use has only been imagined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). This disruptive innovation was made possible by the <italic>in vivo</italic> construction of geometrical spreading of nanoparticles around the tumor. The same conditions will be used for a future Proof of Efficacy study before potential application to locally advanced epithelial tumors.</p>
<p>We can therefore conceive of producing a local well tolerated treatment centered on restoring normal biological properties to cancer tissue using physical manipulation.</p>
