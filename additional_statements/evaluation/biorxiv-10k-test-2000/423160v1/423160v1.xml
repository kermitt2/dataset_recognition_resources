<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Chemerin, a chemoattractant protein, is involved in endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation in pathological conditions. In a recent study, we observed the upregulation of chemerin in endothelial cells following <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with <italic>T. pallidum</italic>. Here, we investigated the role of chemerin in endothelial cells dysfunction induced by the <italic>T. pallidum</italic> predicted membrane protein Tp0965. Following stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with Tp0965, chemerin and its ChemR23 receptor were up-regulated, companied with elevated expression of TLR2. Furthermore, chemerin from HUVECs activated endothelial cells via chemerin/ChemR23 signaling in an autocrine/paracrine manner, characterized by upregulated expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin and MMP-2. Activation of endothelial cells depended on the MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, Tp0965-induced chemerin promoted monocytes migration to endothelial cells, also via chemerin/ChemR23 pathway. The RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway was also involved in monocytes migration in response to chemerin/ChemR23. Our results highlight the role of Tp0965-induced chemerin in endothelial cells dysfunction, which contributes to the immunopathogenesis of vascular inflammation of syphilis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Treponema pallidum</italic> subsp. <italic>pallidum</italic> (<italic>T. pallidum</italic>) is the spirochete of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection that remains an important public health problem around the world [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Infection by this bacterium causes a chronic system inflammation, and if untreated can seriously and irreversibly damage the nervous and cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular syphilis is associated with multiple clinical syndromes, of which aortic aneurysms, aortic insufficiency, and coronary artery stenosis are the most common [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These clinical presentations are similar to other, more common varieties of cardiac disease. At the beginning of the inflammatory process following infection by <italic>T. pallidum</italic>, the insult is primarily to the small nutrient vessels of the aorta, but by later stage all three layers of aortic wall are affected. The overlying aortic intima becomes diffusely diseased, with atherosclerotic changes occurring across virtually the entire intimal surface of the affected aorta. The calcification accompanying these complex atherosclerotic plaques accounts for the eggshell calcification. Characteristic histologic changes consist of infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells, suggesting that the condition has an immunologic basis. However, because we lack an ideal animal model of syphilis to mimic the invading progress of <italic>T. pallidum</italic>, the pathogenesis of these inflammatory processes are largely uncharacterized to date.</p>
<p>Based on an expanded corpus of molecular immunological observations, research focused on bacteria structure and physiology of bacteria made considerable progress over the past two decades [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, investigators found that <italic>T. pallidum</italic> outer membrane, unlike other Gram-negative bacteria, is fragile and contains limited antigens. There is now a consensus that vessel inflammation as well as other tissue damage result from the host immune response elicited by antigen by inner membrane and periplasm of <italic>T. pallidum</italic>. To date, 116 proteins of <italic>T. pallidum</italic> have been predicted as membrane localized proteins [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the immunological characteristics of most of these membrane proteins remain unknown, and only a few membrane proteins were reported in previous studies [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Proteome array analysis predicted that Tp0965 located in inner membrane of <italic>T. pallidum.</italic> Tp0965 is a putative membrane fusion protein and belongs to efflux transporter RND family MFP subunit [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our and others previous study suggested that recombinant protein Tp0965 showed excellent antigenicity and immunoreactivity [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Endothelial dysfunction plays key roles in vascular intimal inflammation by initiating the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and thrombosis [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is also the key step of systemic dissemination and pathophysiological basic of syphilis [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We investigated the effect of Tp0965 as well as Tp17 on endothelial cells. We found that the two recombinant proteins could induce endothelial dysfunction characterized by upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as enhanced transendothelial migration and adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These data suggest that Tp17 and Tp0965 are involved in vessel inflammation in <italic>T. pallidum</italic> persistent invasion. In addition, we found that chemerin, a recently identified adipocytokine and chemoattractant protein with a crucial role in inflammation and adipocytes metabolism [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], is highly expressed in endothelial cells after <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with <italic>T. pallidum</italic>. As a chemoattractant, chemerin can induce recruitment of leukocytes to inflammation sites and binding to adhesion molecules, thereby contributing to leukocyte activation [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Accordingly, the role of chemerin in vascular dysfunction has attracted increasing interest. Several teams reported the involvement of chemerin in multiple inflammatory disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus, psoriasis, and especially atherosclerosis [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the effect of chemerin and predicted membrane proteins of <italic>T. pallidum</italic> on vascular endothelial cells, we stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with recombinant Tp0965 and found that this treatment increased chemerin expression. With the aforementioned, we hypothesized that Tp0965 contributes to endothelial dysfunction by inducing chemerin expression. In order to test this hypothesis, we investigated the role of chemerin in endothelial cells dysfunction and migration of monocytes to endothelial cells, as well as the pathways involved. The data revealed that Tp0965-induced chemerin activated endothelial cells in a MAPK signaling dependent manner and promoted monocytes migration through chemerin/ChemR23 signaling pathway.</p>

<title>Tp0965 induced expression of chemerin and ChemR23 in endothelial cells</title>
<p>To investigate the involvement of Tp0965 in expression of chemerin and ChemR23 in endothelial cells, we treated HUVECs with Tp0965 or vehicle (DMSO). The level of chemerin in HUVECs was elevated after stimulation using Tp0965 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Likewise, expression of ChemR23 on the cell surface was significantly higher in Tp0965-treated HUVECs than in the vehicle group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). These results demonstrated that Tp0965 increased expression of chemerin and ChemR23, as well as secretion of chemerin, in endothelial cells.</p>

<title>Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is involved in the expression of chemerin</title>
<p>Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), an important member of the TLR family, recognizes bacterial lipoproteins and plays a crucial role in the host defense against bacterial infections, including those caused by <italic>T. pallidum</italic> [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Previous studies showed that TLR2 expressed on endothelial cells mediates the initiation of inflammatory signaling cascades [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To confirm the roles of TLR2 in the induction of chemerin expression by Tp0965, we transformed HUVECs with shRNA against TLR2 and TLR4, denoting them as HUVECs (shTLR2) and HUVECs (shTLR4), respectively. HUVECs transformed with vector alone, designated as HUVECs (V), was used as a negative control group. As expected, the expression of chemerin in HUVECs (shTLR2) was downregulated after treatment with Tp0965, but Tp0965 was unable to regulate expression of chemerin in HUVECs (shTLR4) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), suggesting that Tp0965-induced expression of chemerin depends on TLR2 signaling.</p>

<title>MAPK signaling pathway mediated chemerin induction in inflammation</title>
<p>MAPK signaling pathways are involved in pathophysiological processes in endothelial cells. To investigate the role of p38 MAPK signaling in activation of endothelial cells by chemerin, we measured the phosphorylation of p-JNK, p-ERK and p38 MAPK. Expression of p-ERK and p-p38 MAPK, but not p-JNK, was significantly higher in HUVECs induced with supernatants from HUVECs treated with Tp0965, as well as recombinant chemerin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Next, we inhibited p-ERK and p38 MAPK with SCH772984 and SB203580, respectively, before treatment with supernatant and recombinant chemerin. Phosphorylation of p-ERK and p38 MAPK was inhibited by these compounds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). These results suggest that the MAPK signaling pathway is involved in regulating activation of HUVECs by chemerin.</p>

<title>Tp0965 promotes migration of monocytes through the chemerin/ChemR23 signaling pathway</title>
<p>Chemerin/ChemR23 regulate inflammation, including leukocyte recruitment and migration through the extracellular matrix to the site of inflammation [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To characterize the effect of Tp0965-induced chemerin on monocytes recruitment and migration to endothelial cells, we pre-incubated HUVECs seeded in the bottom chambers of Transwell with supernatants from HUVECs treated with Tp0965 or recombinant chemerin. We then added Calcein-AM-labeled THP-1 cells to Transwell insert and measured the migration of THP-1 cells in response to chemerin. In a previous study, we showed Tp0965 significantly upregulated expression of soluble MCP-1, known as chemotactic factor to monocytes [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To inhibit the effect of MCP-1, every bottom chamber contained monoclonal antibodies against MCP-1 before the addition of THP-1 cells. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> showed that both supernatant and recombinant chemerin had the ability to sustain the migration of THP-1 cells. Next, we knocked down ChemR23 expression with shRNA and added these knockdown cells to the Transwell insert. THP-1 cells (shChemR23) were unable to migrate in response to either the supernatant or recombinant chemerin. Conversely, no effect was observed with vehicle alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). These results formally proved that Tp0965-induced chemerin promoted monocytes migration via chemerin/ChemR23 signaling pathway.</p>

<title>RhoA/ROCK signaling mediates migration of monocytes</title>
<p>Macrophages migration to sites of inflammation is dependent on the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This signaling pathway is also required for chemerin-mediated chemotaxis of lymphocytes [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Previously, we reported that RhoA in HUVECs is activated following treatment with Tp0965 [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To further explore this issue, we investigated whether RhoA was activated in HUVECs stimulated with supernatants of Tp0965-treated HUVECs or recombinant chemerin. Indeed, RhoA was activated following either treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). We then examined the effect of ROCK on monocyte migration. For this purpose, we pretreated HUVECs with Y-27632, an inhibitor of ROCK. In addition, cells were treated with monoclonal antibodies against MCP-1 to eliminate the effect of this cytokine on monocyte migration. Chemotaxis assays revealed no significant changes relative to vehicle, indicating that ROCK activity required for monocyte migration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). These data suggest that the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway is involved in Tp0965-induced monocytes migration in response to chemerin/ChemR23.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Inflammation response was emphasized to be responsible for syphilis pathogenesis during the invasion and persistence of <italic>T. pallidum.</italic> According to a recent proposed schema [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], treponemal lipoproteins created an proinflammatory backdrop and then an adaptive immune response stepped-up as treponemal antigens are processed and presented to naive T cells. Consequently, vasculitis was invoked by recruitment of immune cells, and led to <italic>T. pallidum</italic> dissemination through disrupting endothelial barrier. Thus, the investigation focus on endothelium damage will contribute to declare the immunopathogenesis of syphilis.</p>
<p>Chemerin is well characterized by acting as a chemoattractant for immune cells expressing ChemR23. Thereby, chemerin plays a pro-inflammatory role via recruiting these immune cells to sites of inflammation and tissue damage [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In a recent study, we observed a significant increase in serum level of chemerin in HUVECs following treatment with <italic>T. pallidum</italic> Nichols strain (data not shown). On the basis of this finding, we hypothesized that Tp0965 induces the dysfunction of endothelial cells through chemerin signaling. To test the hypothesis, in this present study, we investigated the effect of Tp0965 on chemerin expression in vascular endothelial cells. The results revealed that Tp0965 can significantly increase the expression of chemerin in HUVECs. TLR4 and very low levels of TLR2 are expressed in normal endothelial cells [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, TLR2 expression is dramatically increased upon stimulation with inflammatory factors. In contrast to TLR4, which potentiates macrophage responses during inflammation [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], TLR2 is expressed more broadly in vascular cells and promotes endothelial dysfunction [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To further characterize the relationship between TLR2 and chemerin, we knocked down TLR2 and TLR4 of HUVECs with shRNA. Expression of chemerin was downregulated after Tp0965 treatment in HUVECs (shTLR2), but not in HUVECs (shTLR4). These results suggested that TLR2 signaling is involved in Tp0965-induced chemerin expression. Several studies demonstrated that TLR2 promotes endothelial dysfunction by initiating inflammatory signaling cascades [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, further study is necessary to determine how TLR2 is involved in expression of chemerin in endothelial cells.</p>
<p>As a mediator of vascular inflammation, chemerin is involved in angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and adipocyte metabolism, ultimately leading to the development of cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, chemerin may induce activation of vascular endothelial cells, characterized by expression of cytokines including adhesion molecules and endothelial gelatinases, thereby promoting the growth and remodeling of blood vessels [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of chemerin on endothelial cells. The results revealed that chemerin significantly upregulated expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and MMP-2 in HUVECs. ICAM-1 and E-selectin are markers of endothelial cells activation, and can induce rapid adhesion of leukocytes to vascular endothelium and recruit these cell to sites of inflammation. On the other hand, MMP-2 contributes to dysfunction of the endothelial barrier. Together, these data suggest a pro-inflammatory role for chemerin in endothelial dysfunction. However, several studies suggested that chemerin plays anti-inflammatory roles in vascular endothelial cells [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>-<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Yamawaki <italic>et al.</italic> reported that chemerin prevents TNF-&#x03B1;-induced VCAM-1 expression and monocytes adhesion in vascular endothelial cells [<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This discrepancy may be due to difference in how chemerin protein is processed. Chemerin is initially secreted as pro-chemerin, and is activated by cleavage by proteases such as inflammatory serine proteases tryptase, elastase, and plasmin [<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The variant cleavages give rise to different chemerin functions, potentially explaining the inconsistent results reported by previous studies.</p>
<p>In this study, we observed upregulation of ChemR23 expression in HUVECs after treatment with Tp0965. ChemR23 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor also known as a chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1); the other two receptors of chemerin are chemokine C-C motif receptor-like 2 (CCRL-2) and G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR 1). Among the three receptors, ChemR23 is predominantly responsible for the function of chemerin in inflammation [<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Consistent with previous research, we found that both endothelial-derived and recombinant chemerin increased the expression of MMP-2, ICAM-1 and E-selectin in HUVECs. However, knockdown of the ChemR23 gene in HUVECs partly inhibited the pro-inflammatory function of chemerin. These findings suggest that chemerin affects endothelial cells through the chemerin/ChemR23 signaling way in an autocrine/paracrine manner.</p>
<p>The MAPK signaling pathways have three major components: ERK, p38, and JNK. These proteins exist in most immune cells and are involved in both physiological and pathophysiological processes. Previous research demonstrated that chemerin effects on monocyte-endothelial adhesion via the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that chemerin induced the phosphorylation of ERK MAPK, and p38 MAPK in HUVECs. This ability of chemerin was abolished by treatment with p38 MAPK inhibitor. However, chemerin had no effect of the phosphorylation of p-JNK. These results agreed with findings reported in recent studies [<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Kaur <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that chemerin dose-dependently activates ERK MAPK and p38 MAPK in endothelial cells [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our data suggest that both recombinant and Tp0965-induced chemerin promote the activation of HUVECs through the MAPK signaling pathway.</p>
<p>Chemerin was originally described as a chemoattractant that promotes recruitment of ChemR23-expressing immune cells, including immature dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages, to sites of inflammation [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>-<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition, a recent study showed that endothelial cells expressing chemerin can promote DCs transmigration across endothelial cell barriers, mediated by ChemR23/chemerin signaling [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Conversely, DCs can induce endothelial cells to express chemerin protein. As reported previously, in this study, we observed migration of THP-1 cells to HUVECs following treatment with Tp0965-induced chemerin. Furthermore, the migration of THP-1 cells was inhibited by knockdown of ChemR23. These results suggest that Tp0965-induced chemerin promotes monocytes migration through the chemerin/ChemR23 signaling pathway. Migration and retention of leukocytes during inflammation induced by chemerin are thought to contribute to the onset and development of inflammatory diseases, as reported in atherosclerosis and arthritis [<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>-<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. During the development of atherosclerosis, macrophages from the surrounding intima and adventitia migrate into the atherosclerotic lesion and adhere to extracellular matrix proteins. The adhesion of macrophages might decrease plaque stability by upregulating MMPs expression [<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>-<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In this study, we also observed upregulation of MMP-2 expression in endothelial cells. However, the role of MMP-2 in endothelial cell dysfunction induced by <italic>T. pallidum</italic> warrants further exploration.</p>
<p>In a previous study, we found that the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway is involved in increasing endothelial permeability and promotes transendothelial migration of monocytes [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other groups also reported that the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway plays important roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In addition, Rourke <italic>et al</italic>. showed that RhoA knockdown, or pharmacological inhibition of RhoA or ROCK, blocks chemerin-induced activation of serum response factor [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, we observed activation of RhoA in HUVECs after stimulation with Tp0965-induced chemerin. Furthermore, when we inhibited ROCK with Y-27632, we found that monocyte migration to HUVECs was blocked. These findings verified that Tp0965-induced monocytes migration in response to chemerin/ChemR23 depends on the activity of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.</p>
<p>This study has one major limitation. We showed that chemerin induced by Tp0965 affects the function of endothelial cells via the chemerin/ChemR23 signaling pathway <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, it remains unknown whether chemerin can induce dysfunction of vascular endothelium <italic>in vivo</italic>. Unfortunately, no animal model system that can mimic the behavior of <italic>T. pallidum</italic> in the host body is currently available. Notably in this regard, a recent study reported that the zebrafish model was successfully used to observe the angiogenic activity of TpF1 of <italic>T. pallidum</italic> [<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Accordingly, we anticipate that the zebrafish model could be used to study the angiogenic effect of Tp0965 on endothelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In summary, we showed that Tp0965-induced chemerin promotes dysfunction of endothelial cells, dependent on the activation of MAPK and RhoA/ROCK signaling pathways. These results provide further insight into the effect of Tp0965 on the function of endothelial cells, suggesting the role of predicted membrane proteins of <italic>T. pallidum</italic> in the immunopathogenesis of vascular inflammation of syphilis.</p>
