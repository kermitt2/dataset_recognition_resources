<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Repetitive sequences derived from transposons make up a large fraction of eukaryotic genomes and must be silenced to protect genome integrity. Repetitive elements are often found in heterochromatin; however, the roles and interactions of heterochromatin proteins in repeat regulation are poorly understood. Here we show that a diverse set of <italic>C. elegans</italic> heterochromatin proteins act together with the piRNA and nuclear RNAi pathways to silence repetitive elements and prevent genotoxic stress in the germ line. Mutants in genes encoding HPL-2/HP1, LIN-13, LIN-61, LET-418/Mi-2, and H3K9me2 histone methyltransferase MET-2/SETDB1 also show functionally redundant sterility, increased germline apoptosis, DNA repair defects, and interactions with small RNA pathways. Remarkably, fertility of heterochromatin mutants could be partially restored by inhibiting <italic>cep-1/p53</italic>, endogenous meiotic double strand breaks, or the expression of MIRAGE1 DNA transposons. Functional redundancy among these factors and pathways underlies the importance of safeguarding the genome through multiple means.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heterochromatin, the more tightly packed form of chromatin, plays important roles in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). It is less transcriptionally active than euchromatin and highly enriched for repetitive elements such as transposons and satellite repeats, which are kept silent to maintain genome integrity. The heterochromatin state is stable and heritable across generations highlighting the importance of keeping certain regions of the genome repressed.</p>
<p>Histones in heterochromatin are marked with modifications associated with transcriptional repression such as H3K9 methylation. In organisms with point centromeres, heterochromatin is typically found in large domains adjacent to centromeres and telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, heterochromatin associated histone methylations H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 are instead mostly found in many small domains on the distal arm regions of autosomal chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). This pattern is likely to be related to the holocentric nature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosomes, which have distributed centromeres rather than a single point centromere. Two histone methyltransferases carry out all H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The SETDB1 homolog MET-2 carries out mono- and di-methylation of H3K9. SET-25 primarily carries out tri-methylation of H3K9, but it can generate all three methylated forms of H3K9. In the absence of both proteins, H3K9 methylation is undetectable, heterochromatic distal arm regions show reduced association with the nuclear lamina, and heterochromatic transgenes are desilenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>A hallmark of heterochromatin is heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), the first heterochromatin protein to be discovered through work in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). HP1 contains a chromodomain that binds to methylated H3K9, and it is essential for heterochromatin maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In addition to HP1, a large and diverse array of proteins is associated with heterochromatin, including nucleosome remodelers, histone modifying enzymes, histone binding proteins, and DNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). However the functions and interactions of heterochromatin proteins are not well understood.</p>
<p>Many <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins that have predicted functions in heterochromatin or transcriptional repression are important for development. These include MET-2/SETDB1, HPL-2/HP1, LIN-61, LIN-13, and LET-418/Mi-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). HPL-2 is a <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of heterochromatin HP1, and LIN-61 is a protein containing MBT (malignant brain tumor) repeats. Both HPL-2 and LIN-61 can bind to all methylated forms of H3K9 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), and both can repress a heterochromatic reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). LIN-13 is a multi-zinc finger protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). A complex containing LIN-13, HPL-2, and LIN-61 has been detected <italic>in vivo</italic>, and LIN-13 is required for the formation of HPL-2::GFP nuclear foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). LET-418 is an ortholog of Mi-2, an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling component of the repressive NuRD and Mec complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutants of <italic>hpl-2, lin-61, lin-13, met-2</italic>, and <italic>let-418</italic> display both germ line and somatic defects. <italic>let-418</italic> and <italic>lin-13</italic> null mutants are sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), <italic>hpl-2</italic> null mutants show temperature sensitive sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and <italic>lin-61</italic> and <italic>met-2</italic> null mutants have slightly reduced brood sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). The underlying cause of the fertility defects is not known, but <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants have been shown to produce abnormal oocytes, suggesting defective gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Somatic defects are pleiotropic and show similarities among mutants, with most showing slow growth, somatic expression of germ line genes, synthetic vulval development defects, and larval arrest (some only at high temperature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Additionally, genetic interactions have been observed between some of the mutants, suggesting partially redundant functions, and that defects may result from alteration of a shared heterochromatin-linked process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>The genomic distribution of only one of the above heterochromatin proteins has been studied. An HPL-2 ChIP-chip study in early embryos showed that most binding was on the distal arm regions of autosomes in a pattern of similar to H3K9me1 and H3K9me2; interestingly, binding to chromatin was not dependent on H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). HPL-2 was observed to be broadly genic, with additional association at promoters in central chromosome regions and at repeats on distal arm regions; however, no clear relationship between HPL-2 binding and gene expression changes was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Systematic and comparative analyses of heterochromatin factors are needed to understand their functions.</p>
<p>The genomic binding patterns of orthologs of some of the above factors suggest roles in the regulation of mobile elements. SETDB1 binds to promoters of developmentally regulated genes in mammalian embryonic stem cells, 40&#x0025; of which are found next to or overlapping endogenous retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). In addition, retrotransposons are derepressed in <italic>Setdb1</italic> knockout mouse ES cell lines and primordial germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Retrotransposons are also repressed by HP1&#x03B1; and HP1&#x03B2; in mESCs, but it is a different set of retrotransposons than is targeted by SETDB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Drosophila HP1 binds to genes and to transposable elements, particularly in pericentric chromosomal regions, but transposable element expression in mutants has not been assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). A recent study showed that Mi-2 could bind to a LINE1 retrotransposon promoter and repress a LINE1 reporter in human and mouse cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The genomic distribution of Mi-2 is unclear as different genome-wide binding studies in human ES cells have yielded conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>The expression of repetitive elements can be detrimental to genome stability due to the negative effects of homologous recombination and transposon-induced breaks. Because the germline produces the gametes that transmit genetic information across generations, silencing of repetitive elements is an absolute requirement for germ line health. A small RNA pathway called the piRNA pathway, present in most animals, plays a role in transposon silencing in the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Recent work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> implicated HPL-2/HP1 and the H3K9me3 histone methyltransferase SET-25 in piRNA pathway function, indicating a connection between heterochromatin and small RNA silencing of piRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<p>In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line, the piRNA pathway involves generation of 21nt piRNAs that bind to the Piwi argonaute protein PRG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). This triggers generation of secondary 22G siRNAs that mediate silencing either in the cytoplasm or nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Cytoplasmic silencing mechanisms are not well understood, but recent advances have been made in the understanding of transcriptional silencing. In the nucleus, the piRNA pathway engages a second small RNA pathway called the nuclear RNAi pathway, which orchestrates H3K9 and H3K27 methylation and/or inhibition of RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Although the nrde pathway can be triggered by the piRNA pathway in the germ line, it is also active in the soma, with dedicated Argonaute proteins for germ line (HRDE-1) and soma (NRDE-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Regions transcriptionally upregulated in <italic>hrde-1</italic> mutants were found to be enriched for retrotransposons, suggesting that repetitive elements may be endogenous targets in the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to silencing transcription and maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the genome, heterochromatin also plays an important role in DNA repair. Heterochromatic compaction protects DNA from damage, and regulated decondensation is important for damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Additionally, in mammals, transient formation of heterochromatin occurs at the edges of double strand breaks, which involves recruitment of heterochromatin-associated proteins HP1 and nucleosome remodeller Mi-2, as well as methylation of H3K9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). This is thought to aid in damage repair by keeping the broken strands in proximity and inhibiting local transcription.</p>
<p>Here, through systematic genetic and genomic analyses, we investigate interactions and functions of five heterochromatin proteins (HPL-2/HP1, LIN-13, LIN-61, LET-418/Mi-2 and MET-2/SETDB1) and relationships with the piRNA and nuclear RNAi pathways. Our results reveal a nexus of factors that cooperate to prevent expression of repetitive elements and protect the germ line from endogenous damage.</p>

<title>Heterochromatin factors show partially redundant functions for fertility</title>
<p>The five genes we study here (<italic>hpl-2/HP</italic>1<italic>, lin-13, lin-61, let-418</italic>/Mi-2, and <italic>met-2</italic>) are needed for normal fertility ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>); Supplementary file 1). Previous analyses uncovered genetic interactions in fertility between three pairs of genes (<italic>hpl-2</italic> and <italic>lin-13, lin-61</italic> and <italic>hpl-2, lin-61</italic> and <italic>met-2</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>); however, the remaining six combinations were untested. Using RNAi in mutant backgrounds, we found that double loss of function of each of the uninvestigated pairs also caused synthetic sterility, which we also observed for three tested double mutant combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A-C</xref>). The single mutants show complex and pleiotropic germ line defects, but they all showed a high occurrence of abnormal oocytes, suggesting that sterility may be due in part to abnormal oogenesis (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). The fertility defects of single mutants and the enhancement in double loss of function combinations indicate that the five heterochromatin factors each have unique and partially redundant germ line roles. The genetic interactions suggest that the five factors may cooperate in a germ line process required for fertility.</p>

<p>(A) Genetic interactions in fertility assayed using RNAi. Indicated RNAi of wild-type, <italic>let-418(n3536), or lin-13(n770)</italic> was conducted by feeding at 20&#x00B0;C as described in the methods. Results are a combination of two independent experiments with the progeny of 3-8 total broods counted for each strain/RNAi combination. A one-sided t-test was used to determine whether the mutant/RNAi combination had a lower brood size than expected under a multiplicative model of interaction when compared to the mutant grown on empty vector RNAi and the individual RNAi knockdowns in wild-type animals. Brood size is significantly lower than expected for all RNAi/mutant combinations at p&#x003C;0.05. (B) Indicated double mutants were constructed and their brood sizes compared to that of the individual signal mutants raised at 20&#x00B0;C. Statistical testing was as in (A), with brood sizes of the three double mutants significantly lower than expected at p&#x003C;0.05 in a one-sided t-test (C) All pairs of <italic>hpl-2, lin-13, lin-61, let-418</italic>, and <italic>met-2</italic> show genetic interactions in fertility, as determined in this study or previous studies, ref 1.

<title>HPL-2, LIN-13, LIN-61, LET-418, and MET-2 are enriched at repetitive elements and show extensive co-binding</title>
<p>To begin to investigate the roles of HPL-2, LIN-13, LIN-61, LET-418, and MET-2 in genome regulation, we mapped their binding locations using ChIP-seq analyses in young adults and compared the patterns to each other and to those of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. Binding of each of the five factors is enriched on the distal arm regions of the autosomes (Figure 2A; Figure 2-figure supplement 1A), as previously seen for H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and HPL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Examination of ChIP-seq signals at a more local level revealed similar binding patterns for the five heterochromatin proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Indeed, genome-wide correlation analyses showed significant positive correlations in signal between all datasets (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B). In addition, signals for each of the five heterochromatin factors showed high correlation with H3K9me2 but not with H3K9me3 (Figure 2B, Figure 2-figure supplement 1B).</p>

<p>(A) Distribution of the indicated proteins and histone modifications over each <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosome, z-scored ChIP-seq tracks are shown for HPL-2 (red), LET-418 (blue), LIN-13 (green), LIN-61 (orange), MET-2 (pink), H3K9me2 (grey) and H3K9me3 (black) on each chromosome, demonstrating enrichment over the autosomal arms. Figure 2-figure supplement 1A shows distributions of peak locations in different chromosome regions. (B) IGV browser screenshot showing similar patterns of the heterochromatin factors and H3K9me2 methylation over a 45 kb region containing multiple repeat elements, z-scored ChIP-seq tracks are as in (A). Any5 peak calls denote combined peak calls for any of the five proteins; repeats are from Dfam2.0 &#x007B;Hubley, 2016 #4&#x007D;. Figure 2-figure supplement IB shows correlations in signal between all datasets. (C) UpSet plot of the association of heterochromatin factors with the 33,301 Any5 peak calls. Dots indicate peak class is bound by the factor. Bars show total number of peaks per class, the orange portion denoting overlap with repeat elements. Below the bar chart relative enrichments for H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 are shown. The peaks that overlap all 5 factors constitute the largest class (n&#x003D;4810). Figure 2-figure supplement 1 gives total peak numbers per factor, number of peaks overlapping repeats, and number of repeats bound by each factor. Figure 2-source data 1 gives peak calls. (D) Associations of factors and repeat classes. Upper panel: levels of indicated protein or histone modification on families within indicated Dfam 2.0 repeat classes relative to the genome average. Bottom panel: Proportion of families within each repeat class significantly enriched for indicated factor or histone modification. Criteria for enrichment are &#x003E;1.5 fold mean enrichment of family relative to genome, FDR&#x003C;0.1, considering families with at least 10 members. Number of families with 10 or more members within each class are: Cut and paste (n&#x003D;89), Helitron (n&#x003D;7), LTR (n&#x003D;31), LINE (n&#x003D;13), SINE (n&#x003D;3), Satellite (n&#x003D;16), Unknown (n&#x003D;7). Figure 2-source data 2 gives enrichment scores for repeat family factor binding.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="112847_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To further investigate patterns of binding, we identified regions of peak enrichment for each dataset (Figure 2-figure supplement 1C, Figure 2-source data 1; 12449 to 19313 peaks per factor). For each factor, peaks are enriched on the distal chromosomal regions of autosomes; most peaks are intergenic or located in introns, with enrichment for intergenic binding in central chromosomal regions and enrichment for intronic binding in distal arm regions (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A).</p>
<p>To facilitate comparisons between datasets, we merged peak calls from all factors into a superset termed Any5 (n&#x003D;33,301), then annotated each region in the Any5 set for the factors bound (Figure 2-source data 1). There is a high degree of peak overlap among the five factors, with 58&#x0025; of sites in the Any5 set being bound by &#x003E;1 factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Sites uniquely bound by only one factor are in the minority within each dataset (3.4&#x0025;&#x2013;27.4&#x0025;, Figure 2C and Figure 2-figure supplement 1C). Strikingly, the largest binding group contains all five factors (termed &#x201C;All5&#x201D;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Enrichments for H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 vary between binding classes, with the All5 class showing high enrichment for H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results show that HPL-2, LET-418, LIN-13, LIN-61, and MET-2 extensively overlap in binding genome-wide.</p>
<p>The previous HPL-2 ChIP-chip study in embryos noted binding at repetitive elements, which are concentrated on the distal arm regions of autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Repeat-rich heterochromatin in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is distributed in small domains rather than being concentrated in large regions as in mammals or Drosophila; therefore, the sequences of most repetitive regions have been determined. To investigate the association of heterochromatin factor binding at repetitive DNA, we used the recent Dfam2.0 annotation, which classified 62,331 individual repetitive elements in <italic>C. elegans</italic> into 184 repeat families, which were further classified by type (e.g., DNA transposon, retrotransposon, satellite, or unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>)).</p>
<p>We observed that HPL-2, LIN-13, LIN-61, LET-418, and MET-2 are all strongly associated with repetitive DNA elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A large proportion of each factor&#x2019;s peaks overlaps a repeat sequence (46.3&#x0025; - 71.0&#x0025;), and regions with all five factors have particularly strong repeat association (76.6&#x0025;, Figure 2C, Figure 2-figure supplement 1C). Furthermore, of the total set of 62331 annotated repetitive elements, nearly half (46&#x0025;) overlap a peak of at least one factor, and 8002 (13&#x0025;) by all five factors (Figure 2-figure supplement 1D). All repeat types and 180 of 184 repeat families are associated with a heterochromatin factor peak; of these, 105 repeat families are enriched for binding by at least one factor (Figure 2-source data 2). HPL-2, LIN-13, LIN-61, MET-2, and H3K9me2 have a particularly strong association with Helitron families; LET-418 shows generally lower enrichment on repeat families than the other factors (Figure 2D; Figure 2-figure supplements 2-6).</p>
<p>H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 show different patterns of repeat enrichment. H3K9me2 is more associated with DNA transposons and satellite repeats, similar to the heterochromatin factors, whereas H3K9me3 is particularly associated with retrotransposon families, especially LINE and SINE elements (Figure 2D; Figure 2-figure supplements 7-8). We also observed that H3K9me2 and all heterochromatin factors are enriched at telomeres, whereas H3K9me3 is not (Figure 2-figure supplement 1E). The binding and co-association of HPL-2, LET-418, LIN-13, LIN-61, and MET-2 at repetitive elements suggests roles in the regulation of these sequences.</p>

<title>Repetitive elements are desilenced in <italic>hpl-2, lin-13, lin-61, let-418</italic>, and <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> mutants</title>
<p>Because silencing of repetitive DNA elements is important for germ line function, we considered that the heterochromatin factors might function in preventing repeat expression. To investigate this possibility, we generated and analysed RNA sequence expression data for wild-type and heterochromatin mutant adults. MET-2 deposits H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, but all three methylation states of H3K9 are still present in <italic>met-2</italic> mutants (at lower levels) due to the action of SET-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Therefore we assayed a <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> double mutant, in which H3K9 methylation was not detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). For each strain, we performed two biological replicates and differential expression analyses of the 62,331 Dfam2.0 repeat elements.</p>
<p>We observed upregulation of repetitive elements in every mutant strain (<italic>hpl-2, let-418, lin-13, lin-61</italic>, and <italic>met-2 set-25</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A-D</xref>, Figure 3-figure supplement 1, Figure 3-source data 1). A total of 71 individual repeat elements representing 29 different families were upregulated in at least one mutant (Figure 3-source data 2; upregulation of 61/71 individual elements was confirmed based on uniquely mapping reads, see Methods). We observed a striking overlap in the sets of repetitive elements regulated by the heterochromatin factors: 41&#x0025; of elements are upregulated in more than one mutant (Figure 3A; Figure 3-source data 2). Furthermore, seven repeat elements are upregulated in all five strains, all of which are MIRAGE1 DNA transposable elements (Figures 3A, C, D, Figure 3-source data 2). The majority of repetitive elements upregulated in each heterochromatin mutant strain are DNA transposons, but retrotransposons are enriched for being upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Mutants show variation in the classes of repeats regulated; for example, SINE retrotransposons are particularly affected in <italic>let-418</italic> mutants, while many Helitron elements are upregulated in <italic>lin-13</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Overall, the total number of individual repetitive elements found with significantly altered expression is extremely small (&#x003C;1&#x0025;) relative to the &#x003E;30,000 with factor binding, indicating that binding does not generally regulate repeat transcription. There are many types of repetitive elements, and only a small fraction would be expected to have potential for RNA expression. For example, 67&#x0025; of repetitive elements are predicted to be non-autonomous DNA transposons, which would be mobilised in trans by a transposase encoded by another repetitive element, and many annotated elements are small fragments of larger elements. We therefore wondered whether the upregulation of repetitive element expression in heterochromatin mutants might be particularly associated with transposases or retrotransposons. Of 62331 Dfam2.0 elements, 221 overlap a predicted transposase ORF, and 1085 are annotated as LTR retrotransposons. We found that elements upregulated in any heterochromatin factor mutant are 83-fold enriched for containing a transposase (21 of 71) and 10-fold enriched for LTR retrotransposons (13 of 71), together accounting for nearly half of upregulated repeats. Therefore, a key role of heterochromatin factors is to suppress expression of repetitive element transposases. The widespread binding of heterochromatin factors to non-expressed repetitive elements is likely to play roles other than in the regulation of transcription. These could include preventing the cutting, copying, or movement of elements, or maintaining genome integrity by supressing homologous recombination between repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>).</p>
<p>We also analysed alterations in protein coding gene expression in the heterochromatin mutants. Consistent with roles in repression, we identified three to five times more genes with upregulated expression in each mutant strain compared to those with reduced expression (267-513 upregulated genes per mutant; Figure 3-source data 3). Additionally, there is a high degree of overlap among the upregulated genes; of the total set of 1155 genes upregulated in any of the five mutant strains, 404 are upregulated in more than one (Figure 3-source data 3). Heterochromatin factors are enriched at upregulated genes, but not downregulated genes (except for genes misregulated in <italic>let-418</italic> mutants); additionally, both H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 are enriched at upregulated genes in all mutant strains (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). Enrichment for all factors and H3K9 methylation is particularly strong at genes upregulated in <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> mutants (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). These associations suggest direct roles in repression.</p>

<title>Repression of desilenced MIRAGE1 elements partially restores fertility of heterochromatin mutants</title>
<p>The silencing of repetitive elements is a universal conserved feature of germ line function. The prominent upregulation of MIRAGE1 elements in all heterochromatin mutants prompted us to ask whether expression of this element might play a role in their reduced fertility. MIRAGE1 is an autonomous DNA transposable element that has two open reading frames. Of 69 MIRAGE1 element annotations in Dfam2.0, only six are full length. These six, plus an additional six partial MIRAGE1 elements are upregulated in at least one heterochromatin mutant, and both ORFs show upregulation.</p>
<p>We first examined the tissue distribution of MIRAGE RNA using RNA-FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). As expected from the RNA-seq results, wild-type adults had very low levels of MIRAGE1 RNA-FISH signal in germ line and soma (Figure 3E and Figure 3-figure supplement 3). In three tested heterochromatin mutants (<italic>hpl-2, let-418</italic>, and <italic>lin-13</italic>), we observed abundant germ line localized MIRAGE1 RNA whereas somatic expression remained low (Figure 3E and Figure 3-figure supplement 3). Therefore, <italic>hpl-2, let-418</italic>, and <italic>lin-13</italic> are important for repression of MIRAGE1 in the germ line.</p>
<p>To test whether upregulation of MIRAGE1 contributes to sterility, we used two sets of RNAi clones to simultaneously knockdown ORF1 and ORF2 (sets termed <italic>mirage-A</italic> and <italic>mirage-B). mirage-A</italic> and <italic>mirage-B</italic> target 16 different MIRAGE1 elements, including all full length elements and most of the MIRAGE1 elements upregulated in each of these mutants (8/8 for <italic>let-418</italic>, 7/8 for <italic>lin-13</italic>, and 10/11 for <italic>hpl-</italic> 2). To assess an effect on fertility, we grew <italic>hpl-2, lin-13</italic>, and <italic>let-418</italic> mutants at 25&#x00B0;C, a condition under which they are nearly sterile, and tested for an increase in brood size after RNAi knockdown. Remarkably, RNAi of MIRAGE1 using <italic>mirage-A</italic> or <italic>mirage-B</italic> sets of RNAi clones led to a small but significant increase in fertility of all three mutants, showing that inappropriate MIRAGE1 expression contributes to their sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also observed that MIRAGE1 RNAi resulted in amelioration of somatic growth defects (not shown). These results indicate that one mechanism by which heterochromatin proteins promote normal germ line function is via the repression of repetitive elements, in particular those encoding transposases.</p>

<title>Heterochromatin mutants display DNA repair defects, increased germ line apoptosis and fertility dependence on CEP-1/p53</title>
<p>Desilencing of repetitive elements has been reported to cause DNA damage in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>); therefore, repeat expression in heterochromatin mutants might lead to genotoxic stress and genome instability in the germ line. Consistent with this, loss of <italic>lin-61</italic> leads to replication stress and genome instability, with increased germ line and somatic mutation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). <italic>lin-61</italic> mutants also have defects in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). A previous study reported that an <italic>hpl-2(tm1489)</italic> null mutant strain was hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>); however, we found that this strain also harboured a deletion in the <italic>polq-1</italic> gene, which encodes DNA polymerase theta. Because <italic>polq-1</italic> mutants are reported to have increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and display genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>), it was unclear if the defects observed were due to <italic>hpl-2</italic> (see Methods).</p>
<p>To determine whether <italic>hpl-2</italic> has a role in DNA repair, we tested the response of the isolated <italic>hpl-2</italic>(<italic>tm1489</italic>) mutant to IR induced DNA damage. Following IR, we observed that <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants show higher levels of oocyte fragmentation compared to wild type, suggesting that they are defective in DNA repair (Figure 5-figure supplement 1). Additionally, <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutant germ lines are hypersensitive to induction of phosphorylation of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase CHK-1 (Figure 5-figure supplement 1). The hypersensitivity of <italic>hpl-2</italic> and <italic>lin-61</italic> mutants to exogenous DNA damage are consistent with increased genotoxic stress in the germ line.</p>
<p>We considered that the repeat desilencing and DNA repair defects of heterochromatin mutants might lead to increased germ line apoptosis, and thereby contribute to germ line and fertility defects. In wild-type animals, physiological apoptosis occurs in the pachytene region of the gonad, with around half of the initially produced germ cells eliminated by apoptosis as a quality control mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). DNA damage causes increased apoptosis over physiological levels, and this increase is dependent on <italic>cep-1</italic> /p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). To assess germ line cell death in the heterochromatin mutants we used a CED-1::GFP reporter, which allows visualization of apoptotic germ cells in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). We observed that <italic>hpl-2, lin-13, lin-61</italic>, and <italic>set-25 met-2</italic> mutants all displayed increased germ line apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <italic>let-418</italic> was not assayed because the apoptosis reporter used is genetically linked). Thus, heterochromatin factor mutants have increased germ cell death.</p>

We used RNAi to test whether activation of p53 dependent pathways played a role in heterochromatin mutant sterility. Following RNAi of cep-1/p53, we found that the brood sizes of <italic>hpl-2, lin-13</italic>, and <italic>let-418</italic> mutants grown at 25&#x00B0;C were modestly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We further tested the effect of loss of <italic>cep-1</italic> by making double mutants with <italic>cep-1(lg12501)</italic>. Similar to the RNAi results, we observed that mutation of <italic>cep-1</italic> increased the fertility of <italic>lin-13, let-418</italic> and <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This increase is not due to a general effect of <italic>cep-1</italic> on fertility, as <italic>cep-1</italic> mutants have a slightly reduced brood size compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We also observed that <italic>cep-1</italic> loss partially rescued the slow growth phenotype of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results suggest that genotoxic stress and DNA damage signalling in heterochromatin mutants activates p53, which contributes to sterility and slow growth. The increase in fertility upon <italic>cep-1/</italic>p<italic>53</italic> inhibition may be a direct consequence of reduced germ line apoptosis, or alternatively the effect may be indirect, by preventing DNA damage signalling or improving growth rate. We also note that although fertility of heterochromatin mutants is increased when <italic>cep-1/p53</italic> is inhibited, it is not restored to wild-type levels indicating that other mechanisms contribute to sterility.</p>

<title>The piRNA pathway shows similarity in repeat regulation and functional connections to heterochromatin factors</title>
<p>The piRNA pathway has a well-known role in preventing the activity of transposons in the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the piRNA pathway operates through the Piwi Argonaut protein PRG-1. Silencing occurs both transcriptionally, through engagement of the nuclear RNAi pathway, and post-transcriptionally, through a poorly understood mechanism. Interestingly, <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants have fertility defects, displaying a low brood size and a mortal germline phenotype that is more pronounced at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The observation that heterochromatin mutants desilence repetitive elements together with the finding that HPL-2 and H3K9 methyltransferse SET-25 are needed for piRNA pathway function in conjunction with the nuclear RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) prompted us to further investigate connections between these factors.</p>
<p>We first assayed the expression of repetitive DNA in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant adults because genome-wide profiling had not previously been done. We detected upregulation of 18 repetitive elements in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants, 14 of which are also upregulated in at least one of the heterochromatin mutants, including MIRAGE1 elements (Figure 6A, Figure 3-source data 1 and 2). RNA FISH experiments showed that MIRAGE1 RNA is increased in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant germ lines, similar to observations in heterochromatin mutants described above (Figure 3E and Figure 3-figure supplement 3). Given this overlap in targets and the fertility defects of <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants, we assessed whether they also showed increased germ line apoptosis as seen in heterochromatin factor mutants. Indeed, we observed significantly increased germ cell death in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Therefore, the piRNA pathway and heterochromatin factors have shared targets and phenotypes, and likely collaborate in maintaining genomic integrity of the developing germline.</p>

<p>We next used a piRNA activity sensor to test whether heterochromatin factors other than <italic>hpl-2</italic> are needed for piRNA pathway function. Similar to <italic>hpl-2</italic> and <italic>set-25</italic>, we found that <italic>lin-61</italic> and <italic>let-418</italic> mutants derepress the piRNA sensor reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>).

However, the piRNA sensor was not desilenced in <italic>lin-13</italic> mutants. It is possible that the lack of desilencing is due to the <italic>lin-13(n770)</italic> allele being non-null, however this mutant does show defects such as upregulation of repetitive elements and increased apoptosis.</p>
<p>A previous study profiling small RNAs in <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants in a piRNA sensor background showed that piRNAs targeting the sensor or a few endogenous targets were not altered in abundance, suggesting that <italic>hpl-2</italic> acts downstream of piRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). To investigate this further, we compared the global abundance of piRNAs in <italic>hpl-2</italic> and wild-type adults. Similar to the above results, we found that <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants make normal levels of piRNAs (Figure 6-figure supplement 1). We also investigated the production of secondary 22G siRNAs in <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants. We detected a decrease in 22G RNAs mapping near predicted piRNA target sites in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), but levels were normal in <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants (Figure 6-figure supplement 1). <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants also showed normal levels of 22Gs at repeat elements. (Figure 6-figure supplement 1). Therefore, at least for <italic>hpl-2</italic>, the role in the piRNA pathway appears to be downstream of piRNA and subsequent 22G RNA synthesis.</p>
<p>To summarize, <italic>hpl-2, lin-61, let-418, set-25</italic>, and <italic>met-2</italic> are important for piRNA pathway function. Nevertheless, the widespread binding sites and desilencing of additional targets relative to <italic>prg-1</italic> indicate that heterochromatin proteins also mediate repression that is not piRNA-induced.</p>

<title>Partial redundancy between <italic>let-418/</italic>Mi-2 and the nuclear RNAi pathway</title>
<p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> nuclear RNAi pathway (called the nrde pathway) mediates transcriptional repression and directs H3K9me3 methylation to its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). The nrde pathway also functions in repression of piRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). To investigate the relationship between the nrde pathway, the piRNA pathway, and heterochromatin factors in repetitive element regulation, we carried out RNA-seq on <italic>nrde-2(gg91)</italic>, a putative null mutant, and compared results to those of heterochromatin and <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants. We observed that <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants showed a larger and different spectrum of repetitive element desilencing compared to <italic>prg-1</italic> or any of the heterochromatin mutants (Figure 7-figure supplement 1, Figure 3-source data 1 and 2). Of 71 elements desilenced in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants, only seven overlap a repeat desilenced in one of the heterochromatin mutant strains (Figure 7-figure supplement 1). Notably MIRAGE1 elements, prominently upregulated in heterochromatin and <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants, are not desilenced in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants (Figure 3-source data 1 and 2; Figure 7-figure supplement 1). Retrotransposons are highly enriched among <italic>nrde-2</italic> targets (45/71) whereas heterochromatin factors and <italic>prg-1</italic> are more associated with DNA transposon misregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, although the nrde pathway is required for aspects of piRNA function, repetitive element targets largely differ. Notably, the finding that elements derepressed in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants differ from those in <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> mutants, which lack detectable H3K9 methylation, suggests that H3K9 methylation may not be required for nrde dependent repression.</p>
<p>Like the heterochromatin factor and <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants, <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants also show a temperature sensitive decrease in fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). To test whether the <italic>nrde-2</italic> fertility function had functional overlap with heterochromatin factors, we constructed double mutants between <italic>nrde-2</italic> and three mutants (<italic>hpl-2, lin-61</italic>, and <italic>let-418</italic>). We observed no reduction in fertility for <italic>nrde-2; hpl-2</italic>, and a weak but non-significant reduction for <italic>nrde-2; lin-61</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, <italic>nrde-2; let-418</italic>, double mutants showed a significantly smaller brood size than expected compared to the single mutants, indicating partial functional redundancy between <italic>let-418</italic> and the nrde pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We also observed that all three double mutants showed significantly increased embryo lethality compared to the single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To further investigate the genetic interaction between <italic>nrde-2</italic> and <italic>let-418</italic>, we carried out RNA-seq of <italic>nrde-2; let-418</italic> adults to test for redundancy in repeat element repression. We found that more repeats are upregulated in <italic>nrde-2; let-418</italic> double mutants compared to <italic>nrde-2</italic> or <italic>let-418</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Most of the repeat elements upregulated only in the <italic>nrde-2; let-418</italic> double mutant are retrotransposons (27/46; Figure 7B and Figure 3-source data 2). We conclude that NRDE-2 and LET-418 have unique and redundant roles in the repression of repetitive DNA elements.</p>
<p>Because a key output of the nrde pathway is the deposition of H3K9me3, the observed redundancy between NRDE-2 and LET-418 prompted us to investigate whether the nrde pathway might control H3K9me3 levels at heterochromatin regulated loci. To this end, we used published H3K9me3 ChIP-seq datasets in four different nrde mutants (<italic>hrde-1, nrde-2, nrde-3</italic>, and <italic>nrde-4;</italic> 44, 47, 51). and analysed levels at genes and repeats upregulated in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants or only in heterochromatin mutants. The nrde pathway acts in the germ line and soma: HRDE-1 and NRDE-3 are argonautes specific for germ line or soma, respectively, whereas NRDE-2 and NRDE-4 act in all tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). We observed that repeat elements and genes upregulated in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants also have reduced H3K9me3 levels, supporting the link between H3K9me3 methylation and repression of endogenous targets (Figure 7-figure supplements 2 and 3). H3K9me3 was also reduced on <italic>nrde-2</italic> upregulated elements in mutants of other nrde genes that act in the germ line (<italic>hrde-1</italic> and <italic>nrde-4</italic>), but not in the soma specific argonaute mutant <italic>nrde-3</italic> (Figure 7-figure supplements 2 and 3). This suggests that the transcriptional upregulation observed in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants occurs largely in the germ line.</p>
<p>We next analysed H3K9me3 levels in sets of genes and repeats upregulated in heterochromatin mutant strains but not in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants to ask if these elements were also under nrde control. Indeed, genes upregulated in any of the five heterochromatin factor mutant strains (<italic>hpl-2, lin-13, let-418, lin-61, met-2 set-25</italic>) but not in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants also showed reduced H3K9me3 in germ line nrde mutants, though the reduction was weaker than for <italic>nrde-2</italic> regulated genes (Figure 7-figure supplement 3). Repeats upregulated only in heterochromatin factor mutants showed a trend of reduced H3K9me3 (Figure 7-figure supplement 2). Therefore, the germ line nuclear RNAi pathway partially controls H3K9me3 levels at loci regulated by heterochromatin factors. Because these elements are not upregulated in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants, this indicates that the observed reduction of H3K9me3 is not sufficient for derepression and supports partial redundancy between the nrde pathway and heterochromatin factors in repeat silencing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>All animal genomes contain abundant repetitive elements, which are subject to silencing control. This study expands our knowledge of repetitive element silencing by showing that a diverse set of heterochromatin factors (HPL-2/HP1, LIN-61, LET-418/Mi-2, LIN-13, and MET-2) work together with the piRNA and nuclear RNAi pathways to silence repetitive elements such as DNA transposons and retrotransposons. The systematic analyses of multiple factors, most of which are conserved, uncovered a network of functional interactions between them. We suggest that the interactions we identify here are likely to be relevant to the control of repetitive elements in other animals.</p>
<p>All factors and pathways studied are individually important for germ line function, as evidenced by reduced fertility or sterility of single mutants, and all are individually necessary for repetitive element silencing. Importantly, functional redundancy among the factors and pathways demonstrates widespread safeguards for ensuring germ line health and fertility. Our results show that there are interacting and overlapping mechanisms of repeat element silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p>

<title>Heterochromatin factors and small RNA pathways</title>
<p>Connections between heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing via RNAi mechanisms involving small RNAs have been observed in a variety of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). For instance, RNAi machinery directs silencing at repetitive centromeric regions in <italic>S. pombe</italic> in a process that involves H3K9 methylation and chromodomain proteins that are similar to HP1. Likewise, in Arabidopsis and other eukaryotes, repetitive elements have been shown to be repressed in chromatin by the action of nuclear pathways involving small RNAs and the targeting of H3K9 methylation. These pathways have also been implicated in gene silencing. However the mechanisms linking these silencing pathways are not fully understood and it is clear that factors involved in heterochromatin formation and function remain to be identified. For example a recent study of HP1a interactors in Drosophila identified many new factors needed for gene silencing and/or heterochromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>)</p>
<p>Previous studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have also uncovered connections between heterochromatin factors and small RNA pathways. The piRNA pathway is a small RNA pathway active in the germ line that silences transposons and genes through cytoplasmic and nuclear mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In the nucleus, the piRNA pathway engages the nrde pathway and heterochromatin factors for transcriptional repression: HPL-2, the H3K9me3 histone methyltransferase SET-25, and nuclear RNAi factors are necessary for silencing a piRNA pathway sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). The nrde pathway directs H3K9me3 both endogenously and in response to exogenous dsRNA and effects transcriptional repression in both the germ line and soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Endogenous germ line nrde targets have been suggested to include retrotransposons based on their enrichment at genomic intervals with increased expression and decreased H3K9me3 levels in germ line nuclear RNAi mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Here, through genetic and profiling analyses, we have established additional connections between heterochromatin factors and small RNA pathways, linking them to repetitive element repression, uncovering functional redundancy, and expanding understanding of their relationships.</p>

<title>Heterochromatin factors associate with and repress repetitive elements</title>
<p>We found that the genome-wide distributions of each of the five heterochromatin factors studied here (HPL-2/HP1, LIN-13, LIN-61, LET-418/Mi-2, and MET-2/SETDB1) are highly correlated with each other and strongly associated with repetitive elements. These patterns are correlated with H3K9me2, but not with H3K9me3, as previously seen for HPL-2 in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 modifications largely do not overlap (this study and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)), but both are associated with repetitive elements. We further found that H3K9me2, but not H3K9me3 is enriched at telomeres. These patterns support functional differences between H3K9me2 and H3K9me3.</p>
<p>In addition to the similarity in binding profiles, we found that <italic>hpl-2, lin-13, lin-61, let-418</italic>, and <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> mutant strains all showed derepression of repetitive elements and genes. While this paper was under review, Zeller et al reported that <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> mutants derepressed transposable element expression in embryos and gonads, similar to the results presented here for <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). The global loss of H3K9 methylation also leads to transposon derepression and mobilization in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). The patterns of upregulated repetitive elements and genes among the five heterochromatin mutant strains are strikingly similar, indicating shared targets. However, although binding profiles and consequences of loss are similar, the factors also have unique roles. Furthermore, genetic interactions between all pairs show that they have partially redundant functions. To understand these relationships, it will be important to investigate their interdependencies and the consequences of inactivating multiple factors together.</p>

<title>Relationships between heterochromatin factors and small RNA pathways</title>
<p>Comparing expression profiles of heterochromatin mutants to those of <italic>prg-1</italic> (piRNA pathway) and <italic>nrde-2</italic> (nuclear RNAi pathway) mutants, we observed that repeat elements and genes have similar patterns of derepression in heterochromatin factor and <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants, but these largely differ from those in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants. Consistent with a functional link between the heterochromatin factors and the piRNA pathway, a previous study showed that HPL-2 and SET-25 are needed for piRNA pathway function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Here we further found that LIN-61, LET-418, and MET-2 (weakly) are also important. It appears that heterochromatin proteins act as downstream effectors of the piRNA pathway rather than having a role in small RNA biogenesis or stability since levels of piRNAs and their secondary 22G RNAs are normal in <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) (and this study). Investigating whether small RNA populations are altered in other heterochromatin mutants will be needed to confirm this hypothesis. This mechanism appears to differ from the situation in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, where H3K9 methylation and chromodomain proteins are required for association of silencing complexes that generate siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). However, it is possible that redundancy between heterochromatin factors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> may have masked involvement in small RNA production.</p>
<p>Many more elements are desilenced in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants than in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants, with little overlap between the two. The elements derepressed in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants are mostly LTR retrotransposons, in line with a study finding transcriptionally upregulated genomic intervals in <italic>hrde-1</italic> mutants to be enriched for LTRs and unaffected in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). The apparent difference in targets between NRDE-2 and PRG-1 could be due to the requirement for PRG-1 in initiation but not maintenance of silencing. Once silencing is established by PRG-1, nuclear RNAi maintains silencing in a process termed RNAe that depends on continued generation of secondary siRNAs by mutator proteins, the presence of secondary siRNA-associated argonautes (including <italic>nrde-2)</italic>, and maintenance of the established chromatin state by heterochromatin factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study also uncovered interactions between heterochromatin factors and the nuclear RNAi pathway. We found that <italic>let-418; nrde-2</italic> double mutants show a strongly enhanced fertility defect compared to the single mutants, and that they desilence a larger set and a wider spectrum of repetitive elements. Therefore, for some elements, either LET-418 or NRDE-2 is sufficient for silencing, demonstrating redundancy in repetitive element silencing. These interactions further emphasize the overlapping safeguards that function to effectively repress repetitive elements. The increased embryo lethality seen in double mutants between <italic>nrde-2</italic> and three tested heterochromatin factors (<italic>hpl-2, lin-61</italic>, or <italic>let-418</italic>) suggest additional as yet unexplored redundancy between the nuclear RNAi pathway and heterochromatin factors. That a substantial number of repetitive elements are desilenced in heterochromatin factor mutants but not in <italic>prg-1</italic> or <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants suggests that heterochromatin factors can also act as independent agents, silencing repetitive elements independently of small RNA pathways.</p>
<p>Interestingly, genes and repeats upregulated in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants more often have high levels of H3K9me3 than H3K9me2 whereas those upregulated in <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> mutants (which lack all H3K9 methylation) show the opposite pattern and more often have high H3K9me2 marking (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). The association between H3K9me3 and <italic>nrde-2</italic> upregulated genes suggests that the nuclear RNAi pathway may specifically engage this modification. Consistent with this, repeats and genes upregulated in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants have strongly reduced H3K9me3 levels in germ line nuclear RNAi pathway mutants. However, the difference in elements desilenced in <italic>nrde-2</italic> and <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> mutants (which lack H3K9 methylation) argues against an essential requirement for H3K9 methylation in nrde mediated repression. We observed that H3K9me3 levels in <italic>nrde-2</italic> and other germline nuclear RNAi mutants are also weakly reduced at genes and repeats repressed by heterochromatin pathway factors, even though these elements are not upregulated in <italic>nrde-2</italic> mutants. This suggests that the heterochromatin factors and the nuclear RNAi pathway may regulate many common elements, but that heterochromatin factors can still effectively silence them in the absence of the nuclear RNAi pathway. Future analyses in mutants compromised for both nuclear RNAi and heterochromatin factors will be needed to address the mechanisms of this redundancy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Heterochromatin factors may act locally within euchromatic domains</title>
<p>We speculate that in many cases, repetitive element regulation involves a local mechanism rather than the spreading of large heterochromatin domains. First, we observe that heterochromatin factor binding is often closely associated with repetitive elements and does not extend to adjacent genes. Second, genes containing repetitive elements bound by heterochromatin factors (usually within introns) are often expressed. Indeed, one fourth of genes contain a repetitive element bound by a heterochromatin factor, and of those, 59&#x0025; (3287/5568) are expressed in the germ line. Formation of a large inactive heterochromatin domain would clearly be incompatible with such widespread germ line expression.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, most H3K9 marking occurs on the distal chromosome arms, where small regions of H3K9 are interspersed with chromatin typical of euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Many active genes, including those expressed in the germ line, reside in these arm regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Intriguingly, the repeat- and H3K9-rich chromosome arms are generally associated with the nuclear lamina, a region implicated in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). Active genes at the periphery that contain repetitive elements bound by heterochromatin factors may be subject to special mechanisms for their expression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3e">
<title>Heterochromatin factors and DNA repair</title>
<p>In addition to functioning in repetitive element repression, some of the heterochromatin factors we studied here are implicated in DNA repair or genome stability. We found that <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutant germ lines show reduced repair and increased activation of DNA damage signaling in response to ionizing radiation. LIN-61 is needed for DNA repair in the germ line and its loss causes an increase in the germ line mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Additionally, both <italic>lin-61</italic> and <italic>set-25</italic> were identified in a genome-wide RNAi screen for genes needed for genome stability in the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> mutants, which lack all H3K9methylation, were recently shown to have increased sensitivity to replication stress and increased rates of repeat associated mutations and R loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). In mammalian cells, orthologs of LET-418 (Mi-2), HPL-2 (HP1), and MET-2 (SETDB1), have documented roles in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). Mi-2 is needed for recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of DSBs, and loss of Mi-2 from human fibroblast cell lines leads to apoptosis and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>). HP1 accumulates at DSBs and its depletion causes abnormal recruitment of repair factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). Additionally, DNA damage repair defects caused by depletion of SETDB1 are similar to those seen upon loss of HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). Defects in repair of DNA lesions are likely to cause germ line stress and to contribute to the germ line instability, germ line development defects, and increased germ line apoptosis seen in heterochromatin factor mutants. Such processes might also underlie the reduced fertility and increased germ line apoptosis seen in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>The activation of MIRAGE1 DNA transposases in all heterochromatin factor mutant strains and <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants would be expected to cause double strand breaks and/or replication stress. We show that this abnormal expression contributes to sterility because fertility was partially restored in <italic>hpl-2, let-418</italic>, and <italic>lin-13</italic> mutants when MIRAGE1 transcripts were knocked down via RNAi. Similarly, inhibiting endogenous meiotic double strand breaks by knockdown of <italic>spo-11</italic> also partially restored fertility. These results suggest that heterochromatin factors act to combat different types of genotoxic insults, both through silencing repetitive elements and facilitating repair. If not dealt with, these insults cause sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>We also observed that loss of <italic>cep-1/</italic>p53 suppressed heterochromatin factor defects. p53 is important for mediating DNA damage signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, p53<italic>/cep-1</italic> is required for damage induced germ cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). In the soma, DNA damage signaling does not lead to p53/CEP-1-mediated apoptosis; however, CEP-1 does play a role in DNA repair in the soma, and it slows larval development in response to loss of CLK-2/TEL2 DNA damage signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). Our findings that loss of <italic>cep-1</italic> partially suppresses the sterility and slow growth phenotypes of <italic>hpl-2, lin-13</italic>, and <italic>let-418</italic> suggests that activation of damage signaling and <italic>cep-1/</italic>p53= underlies these defects.</p>
<p>Interestingly, none of the heterochromatin mutant strains studied here display hallmarks of mutators such as high embryo lethality or the frequent production of progeny with visible mutant phenotypes. We propose that quality control mechanisms in the germ lines of heterochromatin factor mutants largely prevent improperly repaired meiotic germ cells from becoming mature gametes, either through apoptosis or the arrest of gametogenesis, to ensure that mutation rates are low.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study indicates a complex orchestration of fertility protection by HPL-2/HP1, LIN-13, LIN-61, MET-2, and LET-418/Mi-2 together with the piRNA and nuclear RNAi pathways. Repression of repetitive elements may prevent replication stress and DNA damage, but when damage does occur, these heterochromatin proteins participate in repair pathways to maintain genome integrity. Further work will be required to untangle the mechanisms and individual roles in DNA repair pathways and repetitive element repression.</p>

<p>Wild-type young adults (YA) were prepared by growing synchronized L1s in liquid culture using standard S-basal medium with HB101 E. coli for 60 hours at 20&#x00B0;C. Adults were sucrose floated, washed in PBS, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Extract preparation and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>) with the following modifications: tissue was fixed for 10 minutes in 1.5 mM EGS (Pierce 21565) then formaldehyde added to 1&#x0025; for a further 10 minutes before quenching with 0.125M glycine and washing 2X with PBS plus protease inhibitors. Pellets were washed once in FA buffer, then resuspended in 1ml FA buffer per 1 mL of ground worm powder and the extract sonicated to an average size of 250 base pairs with a Diagenode Bioruptor or Bioruptor Pico for 28 pulses of 30 seconds followed by 30 seconds pause. Antibodies used for ChIP are given in Supplementary file 3. Following ChIP and DNA purification, libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq kit. Fragments in the 250-300 base pair range were selected using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Two biological replicate ChIPs were conducted for each factor.</p>

<title>RNA-seq</title>
<p>Synchronized, starved L1 stage worms were grown on NGM plates at either 15&#x00B0;C (<italic>lin-13, prg-1, nrde-2, nrde-2; let-418</italic>, and N2) or 20&#x00B0;C (<italic>hpl-2, let-418, lin-61, met-2 set-25</italic>, and N2) until the L4 stage and then shifted to 25&#x00B0;C for 15-18 hours until they reached young adult stage. Worms were washed off plates at the young adult stage, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until use. RNA was extracted from frozen worms using TriPure (Roche). RNA was purified with Zymo Research RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 (Cambridge Bioscience) following DNAse I digestion. Ribosomal RNA was depleted using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (Illumina). Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Two biological replicates were prepared for each strain.</p>

<title>Data Processing</title>
<p>ChIP-seq and RNA-seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq. Reads were aligned to the WS220/ce10 assembly of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome using BWA v. 0.7.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>) with default settings (BWA-backtrack algorithm). The SAMtools v. 0.1.19 &#x2018;view&#x2019; utility was used to convert the alignments to BAM format. To be able to investigate binding and expression at repetitive elements, we used all aligned reads (mapq0) to generate pileup and normalised tracks. Normalized ChIP-seq coverage tracks were generated using the BEADS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>) without the mappability correction step. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq library read numbers and alignment statistics are given in Figure 2-source data 3.</p>

<title>Peak calls</title>
<p>Broad and sharp ChIP-seq peaks were generated as follows. Initial ChIP-seq peaks were called using MACS v. 2.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>) with a permissive 0.7 q-value cutoff and fragment size of 150bp against a summed ChIP-seq input. These were used in conjunction with a modified IDR procedure to generate broad peak calls ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/software/idr/">https://www.encodeproject.org/software/idr/</ext-link>) with an IDR threshold of 0.05 to combine replicates. These broad peaks are termed &#x201C;IDR peaks&#x201D; (Figure 2-source data 1). The pipeline for generating IDR peaks is available here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Przemol/biokludge/blob/master/macs2idr/macs2idr.ipy">https://github.com/Przemol/biokludge/blob/master/macs2idr/macs2idr.ipy</ext-link>. To generate sharp peak calls, the IDR calls were further refined using an adhoc post-processing step, as visually distinct peaks close to each other were often contained within single broad peaks. We identified concave regions within the IDR peaks using the smoothed second derivative of the mapq0 pileup coverage signal with 250bp kernel (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Przemol/biokludge/blob/master/macs2_idr/concave_regions.py">https://github.com/Przemol/biokludge/blob/master/macs2_idr/concave_regions.py</ext-link>). We empirically found the minimum of the second derivative within a concave region to be a good indicator of a visually compelling peak, and used concave regions (within IDR peaks) with a threshold of lower than &#x2212;500 curvature index. Next, we discarded peaks with MASC2 score lower than 100 and peak width lower than 100bp. The resulting peaks were filtered against combined ENCODE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/&#x007E;anshul/projects/worm/blacklist/ce10-blacklist.bed.gz">http://www.broadinstitute.org/&#x007E;anshul/projects/worm/blacklist/ce10-blacklist.bed.gz</ext-link>) and in-house blacklist (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gist.github.com/przemol/8a712a2e840f95237f4a4f322f65bee1">https://gist.github.com/przemol/8a712a2e840f95237f4a4f322f65bee1</ext-link>) to generate our final sharp peak calls, described as &#x201C;concave peaks.&#x201D; We created a summary peak call super set by creating a union of the five heterochromatin factor concave peak calls. We termed this set &#x201C;Any5&#x201D; (n&#x003D;33301; Figure 2-source data 1). Each Any5 region was then annotated for overlap with each factor. Venn diagrams were plotted using VennDiagram R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>), and UpSet plots were generated as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>). For determination of factors bound to repeats, we used broad IDR peak calls since repeats usually display a pattern of broad factor binding. Broad IDR peaks were used in Figure 3-figure supplement 2.</p>

<title>Differential expression analyses of genes</title>
<p>We built an exon model based on Ensembl Gene 77 (Nov 2014) database gene annotation lifted over to ce10/WS220. Tag counts for each gene were extracted from BAM alignment files using HTSeq method working in union mode and implemented in R. These values were used to build an expression matrix. Differential gene expression between N2 and mutant backgrounds was tested using DESeq2; mutants were compared to their temperature matched control N2 replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). Reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) normalized expression values were generated using the median ratio method (Equation 5 in Anders and Huber, 2010). RPKM values, maximum posterior estimates of log2 FC (LFC) and statistical significance estimates for each gene is in Figure 3-source data 3. We used a false discovery rate (FDR) &#x003C; 0.01 and LFC &#x003E; 1 to call genes up-regulated, and FDR &#x003C; 0.01 and LFC &#x003C; &#x2212;1 to call genes down-regulated. To avoid small differences in developmental stages from contributing to apparent gene expression differences, we also excluded genes whose wild-type expression oscillates repeatedly during development (Supplemental Table S7 in(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>)).</p>

<title>Differential expression analyses of repeats</title>
<p>We built a repeat element model based on Dfam 2.0 ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>), downloaded Sept 2015 from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dfam.org/">http://dfam.org/</ext-link>). The model contained 62331 individual repeats divided into 184 families. Since individual repeats did not had unique identifiers (UID), we named them based on genomic position in &#x201C;chromosome:start-end&#x201D; convention, e.g. &#x201C;chrI:10773-11032&#x201D;. Tag counts for each repeat were extracted from BAM alignment files using HTSeq method working in union mode and implemented in R. These values were used to build expression matrixes. Differential repeat expression between N2 and mutant backgrounds was tested using DESeq2 as described above for genes. A table containing RPKM values, maximum posterior estimates of log2 FC (LFC) and statistical significance estimates for each repeat is available in Figure 3-source data 1. Upregulated repeats were defined as those with a false discovery rate (FDR) &#x003C; 0.01, and LFC &#x003E; 0. In addition, repeats that overlapped a gene upregulated in the matched mutant background were filtered out. For purpose of filtering, differentially expressed genes were defined with more permissive cutoffs: FDR &#x003C; 0.05 and LFC &#x003E; 0.</p>
<p>To assess expression of individual repeats scored as upregulated above, we counted uniquely mapping reads, defined as having a BWA mapping quality over 10. Elements with &#x003E;10 unique reads and fold-change &#x003E;1.5 were considered upregulated, which applied to 61 of 71 elements upregulated in any of the heterochromatin factor mutant strains. The remaining 10 elements had insufficient uniquely mapping reads for assessment.</p>

<title>Telomere enrichment</title>
<p>Telomere enrichment for ChIP-seq factors were determined by counting reads with the telomere sequence &#x201C;GCCTAA&#x201D;. Reads were extracted from BAM files (including non-aligned reads) and trimmed to 36bp. Then the number of &#x201C;GCCTAA&#x201D; motifs was counted for each read using Biostrings R package. Telomeric reads were defined as those having 5 or 6 &#x201C;GCCTAA&#x201D; motifs in 36bp. To assess the statistical significance of enrichment we used one sided Mann-Whitney U test (2 replicates for each factor vs. input background of 129 experiments) and reported the p-values.</p>

<title>H3K9me3 levels in nrde mutants</title>
<p>The following H3K9me3 ChIP seq datasets were used: <italic>nrde-2</italic> (GSM855086), <italic>nrde-3</italic> (GSM932875), <italic>nrde-4</italic> (GSM932876), WT for <italic>nrde-2, &#x2212;3, &#x2212;4</italic> (GSM855085), <italic>hrde-1</italic> (GSM1399632), and WT for <italic>hrde-1</italic> (GSM1399631) from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Datasets were processed as described in the data processing section above. The average signal in each region of interest was calculated and the H3K9me3 fold change was calculated relative to the matched wild-type dataset. Control repeats (n&#x003D;612) have &#x003E;1.5-fold H3K9me3 levels relative to the genome average, have &#x003C;1-fold signal for each of the five heterochromatin factors (HPL-2, LIN-13, LIN-61, LET-418 and MET-2) relative to the genome average, and are not upregulated in any of the five mutant strains. A reduction of H3K9me3 at gene and repeat sets of interest was assessed by comparing to all genes or all repeats using a single-sided Mann-Whitney U test.</p>

<p>N2 and <italic>hpl-2</italic> adults grown at 25&#x00B0;C were irradiated at 0, 20, and 100 Gy and recovered for one hour at 25&#x00B0;C. One hour post irradiation, gonads were dissected in 8 &#x03BC;L M9 on slides and freeze-cracked. Gonads were fixed four minutes in 100 &#x0025; methanol followed by twenty minutes in 4 &#x0025; formaldehyde in 1 X PBS. After fixation, gonads were washed two times for ten minutes in 1 X PBS &#x002B; 0.2 &#x0025; Tween-20 (PBST), blocked for one hour at room temperature in 1 &#x0025; milk in PBST, washed two times for ten minutes in PBST, incubated overnight at 4 &#x00B0;C in primary antibody diluted in PBST (1:50 rabbit monoclonal &#x03B1;-phospho-CHK-1, Ser345, 133D, Cell Signalling Technologies, catalogue #2348), washed two times for ten minutes in PBST, incubated 2 hr with secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) and DAPI. Gonads were scored for the presence of phospho-CHK-1 staining using a Zeiss 510 Meta scanning-laser confocal microscope.

<title>Sterility interaction tests</title>
<p>Fertility interactions among heterochromatin factors were tested as follows: N2, <italic>let-418(n3536)</italic>, and <italic>lin-13(n770)</italic> were maintained at 20&#x00B0;C. Worms were fed at 20&#x00B0;C from the L4 stage for the following RNAi clones from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>): <italic>hpl-2</italic> (K01G5.2), <italic>met-2</italic> (R05D3.11), and <italic>lin-61</italic> (R06C7.7) or from starved L1s for <italic>lin-13</italic> (sjj2_C03B8.4). RNAi plates were prepared as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>). Progeny of fed L4s or the fed L1were singled out onto fresh RNAi plates as L4s and total broods assessed by transferring the worms to new plates every day until they stopped laying eggs. Two independent experiments were conducted, with 3-8 total broods counted for each strain/RNAi combination. Three double mutant combinations were also constructed and tested: <italic>lin-61(tm2649); lin-13(n770), lin-61(tm2649); hpl-2(tm1489)</italic>, and <italic>hpl-2(tm1489); let-418(n3536)</italic>. Wild-type N2, single mutants, and double mutant strains were maintained at 20&#x00B0;C and total broods counted.</p>
<p>Fertility interactions between <italic>nrde-2</italic> and <italic>let-418, hpl-2</italic>, or <italic>lin-61</italic> were tested as follows. Wild-type, single mutants, and double mutants were grown at 15&#x00B0;C from starved L1 until the L3 stage, then transferred to 25&#x00B0;C. Total brood size per worm was determined for 12-24 worms per strain across two independent experiments. Genotypes of strains are given in Supplementary file 2.</p>
<p>Statistical tests for the above genetic interactions were conducted as follows: Under the null hypothesis that the two genes do not interact to affect fertility, the expected brood size of double mutant (or RNAi knockdown in a single mutant background) is the product of those of the single mutants (or that of the single mutant and the RNAi knockdown in a wild type background) divided by the brood size of the wild-type (or of the wild-type strain grown on control (empty vector) RNAi plates). Similar to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>), a t-test was used to test if the observed brood size of double mutants (or RNAi knockdown in a single mutant background) equals the expected brood size under the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>Tests for suppression of sterility of <italic>hpl-2(tm1489), lin-13(n770)</italic>, and <italic>let-418(n3536)</italic> mutants were conducted mutants as follows. The three strains show temperature sensitive sterility. Strains were maintained at 20&#x00B0;C, a temperature at which they are fertile, and starved L1s prepared by bleaching adults to collect embryos and hatching them in M9 buffer for 24 hrs at 20&#x00B0;C. Starved L1s were spotted onto RNAi plates prepared as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>). They were then grown under conditions at which the mutant strain is nearly sterile: <italic>hpl-2</italic> was incubated at 24&#x00B0;C or 25&#x00B0;C, <italic>lin-13</italic> was incubated at 24&#x00B0;C, and <italic>let-418</italic> was incubated for 7.5hrs at 20&#x00B0;C, then shifted to 24&#x00B0;C. After three days, the number of progeny produced by these L1s was counted. RNAi plates were prepared as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>). The following RNAi clones were from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>): <italic>cep-1</italic> (F52B5.5), <italic>spo-11</italic> (T05E11.4), <italic>mirage-A</italic> (K02E7.2 &#x002B; K02E7.3), <italic>mirage-B</italic> (W03G1.3 &#x002B; W03G1.4). For each combination of mutant strain and target gene to knockdown, a paired t-test was used to compare the average number of progeny per parent from gene-targeting RNAi plates and matched empty vector plates incubated under the same condition.</p>
<p>Brood sizes of <italic>cep-1(lg12501); hpl-2(tm1489), cep-1(lg12501); let-418(n3536)</italic> and <italic>cep-1(lg12501);lin-13(n770)</italic> double mutants were compared to wild-type and single mutants. Adults raised at 15&#x00B0;C were bleached to obtain embryos and left at 20&#x00B0;C to hatch without food to obtain starved L1s. The starved L1s were fed with OP50 bacteria and immediately shifted to 25&#x00B0;C (for <italic>hpl-2</italic> tests) or fed at 20&#x00B0;C for 7.5 hrs before shifting to 25&#x00B0;C (for <italic>let-418</italic> and <italic>lin-13</italic> tests). Experiments were repeated at least twice and total brood sizes were determined for 8 to 40 worms per strain. L1s prepared in the same way were used for growth rate tests, counting the number of adults, L4s, or worms younger than L4 (indicated &#x003C;L4) after approximately 48 hrs post feeding. A single sided t-test was used to test whether the brood size of the <italic>cep-1</italic> double mutant is larger than that of the single heterochromatin mutant.</p>

<p><bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 1. Heterochromatin mutants display abnormal oogenesis</bold></p>
<p>(A) Strains of the indicated genotype were shifted to 25&#x00B0;C at the L4 stage and imaged by Nomarksi microscopy 48 hours later. Oocyte quality was determined and deemed &#x2018;abnormal&#x2019; when oocytes appeared small, round and gapped, showing the appearance of a curdled cytoplasm, or when they were unaligned and disorganized. Numbers in brackets denote the total number of germlines scored. Disintegrated germline refers to the absence of oocytes and an apparent disintegration of (most of the) gonad arm. Representative images of several of the mutants are shown. Scale bar is 33 &#x03BC;m.</p>
