<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique for identifying and quantifying transcription and splicing events, both known and novel. However, given its recent development and the proliferation of library construction methods, understanding the bias it introduces is incomplete but critical to realizing its value.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Here we present a method, in vitro transcription sequencing (IVT-seq), for identifying and assessing the technical biases in RNA-seq library generation and sequencing at scale. We created a pool of &#x003E; 1000 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed (IVT) RNAs from a full-length human cDNA library and sequenced them with poly-A and total RNA-seq, the most common protocols. Because each cDNA is full length and we show IVT is incredibly processive, each base in each transcript should be equivalently represented. However, with common RNA-seq applications and platforms, we find &#x223C;50&#x0025; of transcripts have &#x003E; 2-fold and &#x223C;10&#x0025; have &#x003E; 10-fold differences in within-transcript sequence coverage. Strikingly, we also find &#x003E; 6&#x0025; of transcripts have regions of high, unpredictable sequencing coverage, where the same transcript varies dramatically in coverage <italic>between</italic> samples, confounding accurate determination of their expression. To get at causal factors, we used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to show that rRNA depletion is responsible for the most significant variability in coverage and that several sequence determinants also strongly influence representation.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In sum, these results show the utility of IVT-seq in promoting better understanding of bias introduced by RNA-seq and suggest caution in its interpretation. Furthermore, we find that rRNA-depletion is responsible for substantial, unappreciated biases in coverage. Perhaps most importantly, these coverage biases introduced during library preparation suggest exon level expression analysis may be inadvisable.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>High-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is a powerful suite of techniques to understand transcriptional regulation. Using RNA-seq, not only can we perform traditional differential gene expression analysis with better resolution, we can now comprehensively study alternative splicing, RNA editing, allele specific expression, and identify novel transcripts, both coding and non-coding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In contrast to the more established microarray based RNA expression analysis, the flexibility of RNA-seq has allowed for the development of many different protocols aimed at different goals (e.g. gene expression of poly adenylated transcripts, small RNA sequencing, total RNA sequencing, etc.). However, this same flexibility has the potential for complex technical bias, as different methods are routinely employed in RNA isolation, size selection, fragmentation, conversion to cDNA, amplification, and finally, sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. While progress has been made in generating and analyzing RNA-seq data, we understand comparatively little about the technical biases the various protocols introduce. Understanding these biases is critical to differential analysis, to avoiding experimental artifacts (e.g. in characterizing RNA editing), and to realizing the full potential of this powerful technology.</p>
<p>Previous efforts at understanding bias identified several contributing sources, including GC-content and PCR enrichment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], priming of reverse transcription by random hexamers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], read errors introduced during the sequencing-by-synthesis reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], and bias introduced by various methods of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) subtraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Studies that revealed these sources of bias typically use computational methods on existing sequencing data to assess the performance of various sequencing technologies and library protocols. One downside to this approach is that it can be difficult to know whether anomalies in coverage are natural, or are due to technical artifacts. For example, nearly every RNA-seq study has differences in intra-exonal coverage, which could arise from naturally occurring splice variants sharing part of an exon, or could be due to technical error in library construction or sequencing.</p>
<p>Given that researchers are continually developing new sequencing methodologies and library generation protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], we need a means for assessing the technical biases introduced by each new iteration in technology. One attractive alternative is to generate libraries from RNA that has been <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed (IVT) from cDNA clones, where the nucleotide sequence at every base is known, the splicing pattern established and inviolate, and the expression level is known to be uniform across the transcript. Thus, any observed biases in coverage or expression must be technical rather than biological. This is the experimental equivalent of simulated data that computational researchers commonly use to develop and assess alignment algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Jiang and colleagues used a similar approach with 96 synthetic sequences derived from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> or the deep-sea vent microbe <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], organisms that do not have RNA splicing or poly adenylation. The focus of that work, though, was creating a useful set of standards that could be used in downstream analysis, not exploring library construction bias in a comprehensive set of complex mammalian samples.</p>
<p>Here we present and apply IVT-seq at scale to better understand bias introduced by RNA-seq. In brief, individual plasmids were produced, pooled, and subjected to in vitro transcription. Next, this RNA was mixed with complex mouse total RNA at various concentrations, and sequenced using the two most common RNA-seq protocols, polyA seq or total RNA seq, on the Illumina platform. We find coverage bias in most IVT transcripts, with over 50&#x0025; showing &#x003E; 2-fold changes in within-transcript coverage and 10&#x0025; having &#x003E; 10 fold differences attributable to library preparation and sequencing. Additionally, we find &#x003E; 6&#x0025; of IVT transcripts contain regions of high, unpredictable sequencing coverage, which vary significantly between samples. These biases are highly reproducible between replicates and suggest that exon-level quantification may be inadvisable. Furthermore, we created sequencing libraries from the original plasmid templates and using several different RNA selection methods (rRNA depletion, polyA selection, and no selection). We find that both rRNA depletion and polyA selection are responsible for a significant portion of this coverage bias, and computational analysis shows that poorly represented regions of transcripts are associated with low complexity sequences. Taken together, these results show the utility of the IVT-seq method for characterizing and identifying the sources of coverage bias in sequencing technologies.</p>

<title>IVT-seq library preparation and sequencing</title>
<p>To generate IVT-seq libraries (for full details, please see the <italic>Materials and methods</italic> section), individual glycerol stocks each harboring a single, human, fully sequenced plasmid from the Mammalian Gene Collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] were produced and plasmid DNA was extracted and plated at 50 ng per well in 384-well plates. The contents of three 384-well plates containing a total of 1062 cDNA clones (Additional file 10) were mixed, transformed into bacteria, and plated as single colonies. These plates were scraped, amplified for a few hours in liquid culture, and purified as a pool (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, plasmids were linearized, purified, and SP6 polymerase was used to drive <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of the cloned cDNA sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Following a DNase I treatment to remove the DNA template and RNA purification, a pool of 1062 different human RNAs derived from fully sequenced plasmids was produced.

</fig></p>
<p>To approximate what happens in a total RNA sequencing reaction, we subjected this IVT RNA to rRNA-depletion and then prepared libraries using the Illumina TruSeq protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, IVT only). To account for possible carrier effects, we also mixed the IVT RNA with various amounts of mouse total RNA derived from liver. The addition of the mouse RNA gave these samples greater diversity (transcripts from &#x223C;10k genes vs. 1062) and more closely resembled a real biological sample. Also, by adding background RNA from a different species (mouse) than the IVT RNA (human), we make it easier to differentiate between the IVT transcripts and mouse sequences during downstream analysis. Since the IVT RNA does not contain rRNA sequences while the mouse RNA does, the quantity of mouse RNA will be significantly reduced by the rRNA depletion step. In order to account for this we mixed IVT and mouse RNA such that following rRNA depletion we would have final pools with IVT:mouse ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:10. Finally, to account for mouse RNAs potentially mapping to the human reference genome and our IVT sequences, we prepared a pool consisting of mouse RNA alone. We pooled the resulting six libraries and sequenced them using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. We performed this entire process in duplicate.</p>

<title>Mapping and coverage of IVT-seq data</title>
<p>Following sequencing and de-multiplexing, we aligned all of the data to the human reference genome (hg19) using the RNA-seq Unified Mapper (RUM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. For all analyses, we only used data from reads uniquely mapped to the reference, excluding all multi-mappers (data contained in RUM_Unique and RUM_Unique.cov files). Of the 1062 original IVT transcripts, we found 11 aligned to multiple genomic loci, while 88 aligned to overlapping loci. To avoid any confounding effects in our analyses, we filtered those transcripts from all analyses, leaving us with 963, non-overlapping, uniquely-aligned IVT transcripts. We saw excellent correlation in expression levels between replicates (transcript-level R<sup>2</sup> between replicates &#x003E; 0.95; Additional file 1: Figure S1A). Secondly, at least 90&#x0025; of the 963 IVT transcripts are expressed with an FPKM &#x2265; 5 in all IVT-seq datasets except mouse only (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In the IVT-only samples, over 80&#x0025; of the IVT sequences are expressed above 100 FPKM (Additional file 1: Figure S1B). Since we prepared the MGC plasmids and IVT transcripts as pools, it is likely that the IVT transcripts showing low or zero coverage were initially present at low plasmid concentrations prior to the transformation and IVT steps. Using the IVT-seq technique, we are able to specifically detect the vast majority of the human IVT transcripts with high coverage in both the absence and presence of the background mouse RNA.

<p>While we do see reads aligned to the human IVT transcripts in the mouse only data, these transcripts collectively represent &#x223C;2&#x0025; of reads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Those transcripts with higher coverage are likely the result of mouse reads aligning to highly similar human sequences. We excluded these sequences from our analyses.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Within-transcript variation in RNA-seq coverage of IVT transcripts</title>
<p>Consider first the IVT only data. Given that these transcripts were generated from an IVT reaction using cDNA sequences, this data is unaffected by splicing or other post-transcriptional regulation. Thus, most regions of transcripts should be &#x201C;expressed&#x201D; and present at similar levels. The exceptions would be repetitive sequences that map to multiple genome locations and may be poorly represented, and the ends of the cDNAs, which are subject to fragmentation bias. To account for this we created a simulated dataset which models the fragmentation process and which deviates from uniform data only by the randomness incurred by fragmentation. We generated two such datasets using the Benchmarker for Evaluating the Effectiveness of RNA-Seq Software (BEERS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The first dataset contains all of the IVT transcripts expressed at roughly the same level of expression (&#x223C;500 FPKM). For the second, we used FPKM values from the IVT-only samples as a seed, creating a simulated dataset with expression levels matching real data (Additional file 2: Figure S2). These datasets are referred to as simulated and QM-simulated (Quantity Matched), respectively. The simulated data provides an ideal result, while the QM data allows us to control for any artifacts arising from expression level (eg. transcripts with lower expression may show more variability). Next, we aligned both simulated datasets using RUM, with the same parameters as for the biological data. Thus, both simulated datasets also serve as a controls for any artifacts introduced by the alignment (eg. low coverage in repeat regions). For full details on the creation of simulated data, see the <italic>Materials and methods</italic> section.</p>
<p>Using IVT data derived from the BC015891 transcript as a representative example, the ideal, theoretical coverage plot from the simulated data shows near-uniform coverage across the transcript&#x2019;s entire length, with none of the extreme peaks and valleys characteristic of biological datasets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). However, our observed data shows a high degree of variability, with peaks and valleys within an exon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, these patterns are reproducible across our replicates (Additional file 3: Figure S3). We see many other cases of extreme changes in coverage; over 50&#x0025; of the IVT transcripts show &#x003E; 2-fold changes in within-transcript coverage attributable to library preparation and sequencing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and Additional file 4: Figure S4). For example, BC009037 shows sudden dips to extremely low levels of expression in both of its exons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Both simulated datasets show no such patterns, which indicates this coverage variability is not the result of alignment artifacts. Furthermore, the absence of this pattern in the QM-simulated data indicates these fold-change differences in coverage are not due to sampling noise introduced by transcripts with low or high coverage. In the case of BC016283, the peaks and valleys in coverage lead to greater than five-fold differences in expression levels between exons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Once again, these patterns are reproducible across replicates (Additional file 3: Figure S3). The SP6 polymerase cannot fall off and then re-attach at a later point in the transcript, leaving a region un-transcribed. Therefore, given that these patterns show troughs followed by peaks, they cannot be the result of artifacts from <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. Furthermore, we sequenced the IVT products directly and found the vast majority were transcribed with little to no bias. Taken together, these data suggest that these coverage patterns are primarily the result of technical biases introduced during library construction, rather than biology. These results are consistent with a previous study that uses <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA as standards in RNA-seq experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], suggesting that our IVT-seq methodology is suitable for identifying technical variability in sequencing data.

<title>Between-sample variation in RNA-seq coverage of IVT transcripts</title>
<p>In addition to this variability within transcripts, we also find many transcript regions showing extreme variability in coverage across samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). For example, the sixth exon of BC003355 varies wildly relative to the remainder of the transcript across all IVT:mouse dilutions. Interestingly, the overall pattern of variation relative to the rest of the transcript across the dilutions is maintained between the replicates. Almost no reads in the mouse-only sample map to this transcript, which eliminates the possibility that this variability is due to incorrect alignment of mouse RNA.

</fig></p>
<p>Including BC003355, we find 86 regions of high, unpredictable coverage (hunc) spread across 65 transcripts (Additional file 11). Therefore, over 6&#x0025; of the 963 IVT transcripts contain regions showing wild but reproducible variations in RNA-seq coverage between samples. While identifying these hunc regions, we used a two-stage filter to eliminate variable regions resulting from mouse reads mapped to highly similar human sequences. First, we eliminated all hunc regions coming from transcripts with FPKM &#x003E;&#x003D; 5 in either mouse-only dataset. Next, to account for localized misalignment of mouse reads, we filtered out all hunc regions with an average coverage &#x003E;&#x003D; 10 in either mouse-only dataset. We also removed those hunc regions with mouse-only coverage &#x003E;&#x003D; 10 in the flanking 100bp on either side. Given the stringent criteria we used to identify these hunc regions (see <italic>Materials and methods</italic> section for full details), it is likely that this is an underestimate. To address the possibility that mouse RNAs may interact with homologous human RNAs and interfere with them in <italic>trans</italic>, we assayed the sequences surrounding these regions using the MEME Suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], but we found no sequence motifs these regions have in common. Furthermore, the depth of coverage at these regions does not follow a linear relationship with the increasing mouse RNA, which suggests it is not simply a direct interaction with the background RNA. There is no clear cause for these hunc regions, particularly since we prepared all samples from the same pool of IVT RNA and the only difference between samples is the relative ratios of IVT RNA to mouse liver RNA. We also searched for hunc regions that were divergent between the two replicates, but found none. If such regions do exist, they could be identified and overcome by creating libraries in duplicate. The hunc regions we identified above with expression patterns maintained between replicates present a greater challenge, as they could not be identified and filtered out by creating duplicate libraries. This is particularly problematic for using exon-level expression values to identify alternative splicing events or differential expression. The within-transcript and between-sample variation we see in our IVT-seq data suggests that library generation introduces strong technical biases, which could confound attempts to study the underlying biology.</p>

<title>Sources of variability in RNA-seq coverage</title>
<p>There are three potential sources for technical bias in library preparation: RNA-specific molecular biology (i.e. RNA fragmentation, reverse-transcription), RNA selection method (i.e. rRNA-depletion, polyA selection), and sequencing-specific molecular biology (i.e. adapter ligation, library enrichment, bridge PCR). To identify biases introduced solely by sequencing-specific molecular biology, we created a DNA-seq library from the same MGC plasmids used as templates for the IVT-seq libraries (Additional file 5: Figure S5). In doing this, we skip the steps specific to the IVT or RNA molecular biology. We also prepared two additional IVT-seq libraries using polyA selection or no selection, instead of rRNA depletion. By comparing our plasmid library data and the IVT-seq data using various selection methods, we can identify which coverage patterns are the result of RNA-specific molecular biology, the RNA selection method, or of some common aspect of the library generation protocol.</p>
<p>We sequenced the plasmid library using an Illumina MiSeq and aligned the resulting data to the human reference genome using the same method as the IVT-seq libraries. In this plasmid data, we see 924 of the cDNA clone sequences with FPKM values &#x2265; 5, compared to &#x223C;870 in both of the IVT only samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This small drop in coverage is likely because the IVT RNA goes through more pooling steps during library construction than the plasmids. Furthermore, the plasmids are not affected by transcription and reverse transcription efficiencies. Additionally, the plasmid data maps to the cDNA sequences with an average, normalized coverage of 42.08, which is within the range of coverage values we see for the IVT-seq samples. We sequenced the no selection and polyA selection libraries on a HiSeq 2500. This data also shows cDNA clone coverage values similar to the other IVT-seq libraries.</p>
<p>The plasmid data represents the &#x201C;input&#x201D; into the IVT reaction and the no selection data represents the closest measure of its direct output. By measuring the 3&#x2019;/5&#x2019; ratio in depth of coverage for each IVT transcript, we can assess the processivity of the SP6 polymerase. In a perfectly processive reaction, this 3&#x2019;/5&#x2019; ratio would be 1, indicating the polymerase did not fall off the cDNA template and lead to the formation of truncated products. The median 3&#x2019;/5&#x2019; ratios for the plasmid and no selection data were 1 and 0.98, respectively, indicating premature termination of the IVT reaction was not a factor in our analyses.</p>

<title>Effect of different RNA selection methods on coverage patterns</title>
<p>Our analysis is illustrated by an examination of the coverage plots for BC003355 across all of our different datasets. The high degree of variability we noted in this gene&#x2019;s coverage plot from our rRNA-depleted data is absent in the no selection and plasmid data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). While the polyA data also shows fewer peaks and valleys than the rRNA depleted total RNA-seq data, it is marked by the well-documented 3&#x2019; bias. This data suggests that the rRNA-depletion step is likely responsible for a large quantity of the observed coverage biases.

</fig></p>
<p>To quantify the variability for each selection method, we calculated the coefficient of variation at the single base level in coverage for all IVT transcripts across each of these datasets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (plasmid n &#x003D; 924, no selection n &#x003D; 870, rRNA-depleted n &#x003D; 869), we find the rRNA-depleted data has significantly higher variability than the no selection and plasmid data (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 2.2e-16). Furthermore, the rRNA-depleted and polyA libraries are &#x003E; 60&#x0025; more variable on average than the plasmid library (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that a significant portion of the observed variability in coverage across transcripts in the IVT-seq data is the result of RNA-specific molecular biology, specifically the RNA selection step. Furthermore, after accounting for bias introduced by the sequences themselves (plasmid data) and bias introduced by the IVT reaction (&#x2018;no selection&#x2019; data), we find that 50&#x0025; of transcripts have 2-fold and 10&#x0025; have 10-fold variation in within transcript expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and Additional file 4: Figure S4). While it is well appreciated that polyA selection introduces bias, we found that rRNA-depleted data introduced just as much if not more. Neither simulated dataset showed transcripts with a 2-fold or higher change in within transcript expression. Again, this suggests that the observed within transcript variations are not the result of alignment artifacts or sampling due to low/high expression. One commonly acknowledged source of bias arises from random priming during library preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. When we examined the different libraries, we saw that fragments from all of the RNA-seq data showed nucleotide frequencies characteristic of random priming bias (Additional file 6: Figure S6). As expected, the plasmid data showed no such bias, since it was derived directly from DNA and required cDNA generation step. However, the significant differences between all RNA libraries suggest that bias from random priming is not the only factor. The plasmid and no selection data still contain a fair amount of variability when viewed alongside the simulated data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; black). When we examine the entire dataset, both the plasmid and no selection data have significantly higher variation than either simulated dataset (Wilcoxon rank-sum test; simulated data n &#x003D; 963, QM-simulated data n &#x003D; 869, plasmid n &#x003D; 924, no selection n &#x003D; 870; <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 2.2e-16). This data suggests that sequencing-specific molecular biology common to all libraries we prepared (adapter ligation, library amplification via PCR), is also responsible for a portion of the observed coverage variability and sequencing bias.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Biases associated with sequence features are dependent on RNA selection method</title>
<p>Given these significant differences in coverage variability, we sought to identify sequence features that might contribute to this bias. We considered three quantifiable sequence characteristics: hexamer entropy, GC-content, and sequence similarity to rRNA (see <italic>Materials and methods</italic> for a detailed description of these metrics). For each sequencing strategy (plasmid, no selection, rRNA-depleted, polyA), we tested if any of the three sequence characteristics has a significant effect on variability in sequencing coverage, as measured by the coefficient of variation. While we are primarily focused on coverage variability as an indicator of sequencing bias, we also looked at depth of coverage, as measured by FPKM.</p>
<p>For each sequencing strategy we sorted the transcripts by coverage variability or depth. Next, we selected the 100 most and 100 least extreme transcripts from each list. We compared the values of the sequence characteristics between the 100 most and 100 least extreme transcripts using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Significant <italic>p</italic>-values indicate a significant association of the sequence characteristic with coverage variability and/or depth.

</fig></p>
<p>To check for any confounding effects between coverage depth and variability, we tested the least and most expressed transcripts for any correlations with variability in coverage (Additional file 7: Figure S7). The polyA library showed a significant correlation (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 2.2e-16) between coverage variability and depth, which indicates sequence features could be affecting coverage through variability (or vice versa). The rRNA-depleted data showed a slight, significant correlation (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.04933). It is possible some feature of RNA selection affects both variability and coverage, given that we saw no significant correlations for the two remaining samples.. This indicates that coverage variability and depth are independent for the plasmid and no selection data.</p>
<p>All three sequence characteristics have a significant association with variability and depth-of-coverage in at least one of the sequencing strategies. In particular, lower hexamer entropy, a measure of sequence complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], is strongly associated with higher variance in all of the RNA libraries (no selection <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 4.712e-05; rRNA-depletion <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 3.956e-11; polyA <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.003921; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This suggests that bias associated with hexamer entropy is due partially to RNA-specific procedures in library preparation. Furthermore, an association with lower hexamer entropy indicates there are more repeat sequences in the transcripts with higher variability. This could be indicative of complex RNA secondary structures, as repeated motifs could facilitate hairpin formation. Furthermore, the absence of this association from the plasmid data suggests that this observation is not due to mapping artifacts. The plasmid data contains the same sequences as the RNA-seq data, and would be subject to the same biases introduced by our exclusion of multi-mapped reads.</p>
<p>Higher GC-content is strongly associated with lower coverage variability in the no selection and polyA data (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 5.627e-13; <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 4.914e-05; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that the effects of GC-bias on within-transcript variability could arise, in part due to some RNA-specific aspects of library preparation. Also, it appears that GC-bias is not a significant contributing factor to either depth of coverage, or the extreme variability in the rRNA-depleted data. Meanwhile, lower GC-content is associated with higher coverage in the plasmid data (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 3.776e-05), and lower coverage depth in the no selection and polyA libraries (no selection <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 8.531e-05; polyA <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.0009675; Additional file 8: Figure S8B). Given that this trend switches directions between the plasmid library and the RNA libraries, this also suggests that some RNA-specific aspect of library preparation is introducing GC-bias distinct from the high GC-bias associated with Illumina sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, higher rRNA sequence similarity is associated with higher coverage variability in the rRNA-depleted library (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 9.006e-05) and lower variability in the no selection library (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.0367; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). It is unsurprising that similarity to rRNA sequences contributes to variability in the rRNA-depleted data, given that rRNA-depletion is based upon pair-binding between probes and rRNA sequences. While it is unclear why this trend is reversed in the no selection library, it is striking given the significant increase in within-transcript variability between the no selection and rRNA-depleted libraries (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, we see a slight but highly significant correlation (Pearson R<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 0.308452; <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 2.2e-16) between a transcript sequence&#x2019;s similarity to rRNA, and the magnitude of the difference in coverage between the no selection and rRNA-depleted libraries (Additional file 9: Figure S9). While the majority of the factors contributing to the extreme bias in sequence coverage we see in the rRNA-depleted data remain unclear, our data suggests this is could be partially due to depletion of sequences homologous to rRNA.</p>
<p>Taken together, all of our data demonstrates the utility and potential of the IVT-seq method to identify sources of technical bias introduced by sequencing platforms and library preparation protocols.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, we present IVT-seq as a method for assessing the technical variability of RNA sequencing technologies and platforms. We created a pool of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNAs from a collection of full length human cDNAs, followed by high-throughput sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Since we know the identities and sequences of these IVT transcripts, and since they were created under conditions not affected by splicing and post-transcriptional modification, they are ideal for identifying technical biases introduced during RNA-seq library generation and sequencing. We used this method to demonstrate that library generation introduces significant biases in RNA-seq data, adding extreme variability to coverage and read-depth along the length of sequenced transcripts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Our most striking finding is that over 50&#x0025; of the IVT transcripts show &#x003E; 2-fold differences in this within-transcript coverage attributable to library preparation and sequencing, in the polyA and rRNA-depleted data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We prepared all RNA-seq libraries from the same pool of IVT RNA, so these differences are due to library construction and sequencing methods. Furthermore, 6&#x0025; of the IVT transcripts contain regions with high unpredictable coverage variability (huncs) across different dilutions of IVT and mouse liver RNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We found it particularly concerning that these huncs are consistent between replicates, as this means these regions cannot be indentified and avoided by making replicate libraries. While the exact cause of this effect is unclear, it could be due to some trans interaction between different RNA (human IVT RNA and the background mouse liver RNA). If this is the case, it could prove difficult to account for, given the challenges we have already encountered making predictions for miRNA targets and RNA secondary structure. Based on these results, we strongly recommend caution in interpreting exon-level quantification data, particularly for identifying and quantifying alternative splicing events, without further understanding of these biases.</p>
<p>Using simulated data and by sequencing at various stages of the process (plasmids, unselected IVT RNAs, rRNA-depleted, and polyA selected), we found each step introduces bias. Regions of certain IVT transcripts are underrepresented in both DNA and RNA, suggesting something inherent in their structure may resist cloning and sequencing properly. The IVT reaction has its own biases, however, by and large, it worked extremely efficiently with 90&#x0025;of the input templates producing transcripts at detectable levels. PolyA sequencing revealed the well described 3&#x2019; bias. Finally, we saw extreme bias introduced by the rRNA-depletion step. Though we have yet to find the majority of the sources for this extreme bias, knowing that it occurs and that is at least partially due to rRNA sequence similarity is an important first step. By making this data available to the community, we hope that new experimental and analysis methods can be developed to account for the biases inherent in various aspects of RNA-seq.</p>
<p>Moreover, IVT-seq could be more broadly employed. By itself, the MGC collection has cDNAs derived from more than 16,000 mouse and human genes, including hundreds of genes for which there are more than one form. Therefore, in principle, it is possible to generate sequence profiles for representatives for nearly 2/3 of the mammalian transcriptome, or spike in datasets to develop new and better methods for splice form detection and quantification. Similar profiling approaches could do the same for other organisms. In addition, IVT-seq is also immediately relevant to RNA-seq method development, e.g. developing new protocols or refining existing ones. Finally, the method is not specific to Illumina sequencing and could be used to account for bias in other sequencing chemistries and methods (e.g. SOLID, Ion Torrent, PacBio, etc.).</p>
<p>Importantly, we are not suggesting that current generation RNA-seq is not a fantastic new technology or that quantification data is incorrect, particularly given the validated, reproducible results researchers have been able to gain through its use. Rather, we wish to provide a cautionary note that our understanding of this technology is still relatively new and incomplete. It is our hope that through the use of this data and IVT-seq, we will develop the means to minimize or account for bias in RNA-seq and truly realize the vision of digital gene expression.</p>

For the QM-simulated (Quantity Matched) data, FPKM values from replicate 1 of the IVT-only data were used as seeds for generating expression levels. All other parameters were the same as for the other simulated data.</p>

<title>Processivity analysis</title>
<p>Coverage data for each IVT transcript was extracted from coverage files for the plasmid and no selection samples. For each transcript, base pair-level coverage data was extracted from the regions spanning 5-15&#x0025; and 85-95&#x0025; of the transcript, by length. For example, given a 1000 bp transcript, the first region spans base pairs 50-150, and the second region spans base pairs 850-950. These two coverage regions represent the 5&#x2019; end and 3&#x2019; end of the transcript, respectively. The first and last 5&#x0025; of the transcript was excluded to avoid artifacts from the fragmentation process. Processivity of each transcript was assessed by the ratio of the mean depth of coverage from both of these regions (3&#x2019; region mean / 5&#x2019; region mean). These processivity ratios were calculated for all transcripts in the plasmid and no selection data, with expression &#x003E; 5FPKM.</p>

<title>Calculating fold-change difference in within-transcript coverage</title>
<p>Coverage data for each of the IVT transcripts was extracted from the coverage files for the IVT-only, polyA, and no selection samples. The first and last 200 bp were trimmed from each transcript to prevent edge effects from interfering with the calculations. Due to this trimming, all IVT transcripts with less than 500 bp were discarded. Nucleotide-level coverage data was grouped into percentiles based on depth of coverage. Average coverage across the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile were calculated. Fold-change difference in within-transcript coverage were calculated by dividing the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile average by the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile average. The list of transcripts with associated fold-change values is included in Additional file 13.</p>

<title>Identifying hunc regions</title>
<p>Coverage data for each of the IVT transcripts was extracted from the coverage files from each of the rRNA-depleted datasets (replicate dilution series: IVT-only, 1 IVT: 1 mouse, 1 IVT: 2 mouse, 1 IVT: 10 mouse, and mouse-only). These coverage plots were normalized between 0 and 1 to allow comparison between different dilutions. For each nucleotide position in a transcript, the deviation in coverage between each of the samples was calculated using the median absolute deviation (MAD), due to its resistance to outliers. MAD scores were calculated across the different dilutions using R&#x2019;s <italic>mad</italic> function with constant &#x003D; 1. Next, a sliding window was used to calculate the average MAD in the 100 bp windows centered on each nucleotide in the transcript. The first 300 and last 250 windows were trimmed from each transcript to avoid confounding variability due to edge effects or fragmentation artifacts. All analysis up until this point was carried out separately on the two replicate datasets. The 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of MAD scores was calculated for each of the replicates using R&#x2019;s <italic>quantile</italic> function (replicate 1: 0.08810424, replicate 2: 0.07183765). Only those regions with at least 20 contiguous windows having MAD scores above the appropriate 95<sup>th</sup> percentile values were retained for further analysis. Next, the BEDTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] intersect function was used to remove any regions with high MAD scores not present in both replicates. Finally, these remaining regions of high coverage variability were filtered for mouse reads misaligned to the human reference. Any region coming from a transcript with FPKM &#x003E;&#x003D; 5 in the mouse-only samples were discarded. To account for localized misalignment of mouse reads, any regions with an average coverage &#x003E; 10 in the mouse-only samples or in the 100 bp on either side of the region were discarded. These remaining regions comprise the list final list of regions with high coverage variability. To search for hunc regions not maintained between replicates, windowed MAD scores from replicate 2 were subtracted from those of replicate 1. The 2.5<sup>th</sup> and 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles of these difference values were used as cutoffs (2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile: &#x2212;0.07053690, 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile: 0.09134876) to pull out the most extreme positive and negative difference values. Regions corresponding to these extreme difference values were filtered as above. Additionally, those difference regions within 200 bp of a previously identified hunc regions were filtered out. This last filtering step accounts for cases where a difference region with high MAD scores is just an extension of an existing hunc region. Hunc regions and difference regions were manually checked to determine whether or not they represent regions where expression patterns deviate from the remainder of the transcript.</p>

<title>Generating sequence characteristics</title>
<p>Sequences for each transcript were collected in R using the BSgenome, GenomicRanges, and GenomicFeatures packages. Hexamer entropy for each transcript was calculated as follows: occurrences of all possible hexamers in a given transcript were counted. These counts were converted into frequency space, and these frequency values were used to calculate the Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy is commonly used to represent complexity in nucleotide sequences or multiple alignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Similarity of transcripts to rRNA sequences were calculated as follows: each transcript was aligned to 45S (NR_046235.1) and 5S (X71804.1) rRNA using NCBI-BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and the e-score for the best alignment was saved.</p>

<title>Sequence characteristic analysis</title>
<p>The list of IVT transcripts were sorted by transcript-level coefficients of variation for each library method (plasmid, no selection, polyA, replicate 1 of rRNA-depleted IVT-only). All transcripts with transcript-level FPKM &#x003C;&#x003D; 5 were excluded from further analysis. From this sorted list the transcripts with the 100 least and 100 most extreme coefficients of variation were collected for each of the above sequencing samples. The values for hexamer entropy, GC-content, and rRNA sequence similarity were compared between every pair of 100 least and 100 most extreme coefficients of variation using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (implemented in R as the wilcox.test function). This entire analysis was repeated using transcript-level FPKM values instead of the coefficients of variation. All boxplots were prepared using R.</p>

The protocol for preparing MGC plasmids for DNA-sequencing library generation is displayed alongside the protocol for preparing IVT transcripts for RNA-seq library generation. Both protocols start by linearizing the plasmids. For DNA-sequencing, linearized plasmids are fragmented via Covaris sonication, and the resulting fragments are taken through the TruSeq protocol. For RNA-sequencing, the linearized plasmids are used as templates for an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction. IVT RNA is then pooled with mouse RNA, rRNA is removed from pool via Ribo-Zero Gold kit, rRNA-depleted pool is fragmented via metal-ion hydrolysis, and fragmented RNA is converted to cDNA via reverse transcription with random-hexamer priming. The resulting cDNA fragments are then taken through the TruSeq protocol.</p>
