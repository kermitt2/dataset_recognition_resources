<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Bovine milk provides an important source of nutrition in much of the Western world, forming components of many food products. Over many years, artificial selection has substantially improved milk production by cows. However, the genes underlying milk production quantitative trait loci (QTL) remain relatively poorly characterised. Here, we investigate a previously-reported QTL located at the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> locus, for several milk production phenotypes, to better understand its underlying genetic and molecular causes.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Using a population of 29,350 taurine dairy cattle, we conducted association analyses for milk yield and composition traits, and identified highly significant QTL for milk yield, milk fat concentration, and milk protein concentration. Strikingly, protein concentration and milk yield appear to show co-located yet genetically distinct QTL. To attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms that might be mediating these effects, gene expression data were used to investigate eQTL for eleven genes in the broader interval. This analysis highlighted genetic impacts on <italic>CSF2RB</italic> and <italic>NCF4</italic> expression that share similar association signatures to those observed for lactation QTL, strongly implicating one or both of these genes as the cause of these effects. Using the same gene expression dataset representing 357 lactating cows, we also identified 38 novel RNA editing sites in the 3<sup><italic>&#x2032;</italic></sup> UTR of <italic>CSF2RB</italic> transcripts. The extent to which two of these sites were edited also appears to be genetically co-regulated with lactation QTL, highlighting a further layer of regulatory complexity implicating the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> gene.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This chromosome 5 locus presents a diversity of molecular and lactation QTL, likely representing multiple overlapping effects that, at a minimum, highlight the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> gene as having a causal role in these processes.</p></sec>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Liquid milk provides a source of nutrition to neonate mammals, and is also used as a convenient source of nutrition for both infant and adult humans. In much of the Western world, milk is primarily produced for human consumption by taurine cattle (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) dairy breeds. Within these breeds, many generations of selection have improved milk production capacity and efficiency. However, despite numerous recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) e.g. [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], major QTL remain for which no causative gene has been definitively assigned.</p>
<p>Several genes with substantial impacts on milk yield are known, including <italic>DGAT1</italic> [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], <italic>ABCG2</italic> [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], <italic>GHR</italic> [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], <italic>SLC37A1</italic> [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and <italic>MGST1</italic> [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, as part of work presented elsewhere [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we performed a milk volume genome-wide association analysis in 4,982 mixed breed cattle using a BayesB model [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], using a panel of 3,695 variants selected as tag-SNPs representing expression QTL (eQTL) from lactating mammary tissue. Of the top three loci explaining the greatest proportion of genetic variance in this model, genes representing the top and second to top effects have been well described for their role in milk production effects (<italic>DGAT1</italic> and <italic>MGST1</italic> respectively [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]), whereas no causative gene appears to have been definitively assigned for the third signal at chromosome 5:75&#x2013;76 Mbp.</p>
<p>This locus broadly overlaps QTL reported previously for milk yield [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], milk protein yield [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], milk protein concentration [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and milk fat concentration [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].Although no gene has been definitively implicated, Pausch et al [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] noted significant markers mapping adjacent to the <italic>CSF2RB, NCF4</italic> genes, and <italic>TST</italic> genes, proposing the latter as the most likely candidate based on its proximity to the top associated variant. Other studies have proposed <italic>CSF2RB</italic> due to its high level of expression in the mammary gland [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], or involvement in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other nearby genes speculated to cause these effects also include <italic>MYH9</italic> [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and <italic>NCF4</italic> [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Given these observations, and the magnitude and diversity of effects at this locus, the aim of this study was to investigate the chromosome 5 region in detail. By combining information from milk yield and composition traits with gene expression data from a large bovine mammary RNA sequence dataset, we highlight multiple lactation, gene expression, and RNA-editing QTL segregating at the locus, presenting <italic>CSF2RB</italic> as the most likely causative gene responsible for these effects.</p>

<title>Sequence-based association analysis at the chr5 interval</title>
<p>Fine mapping of milk yield and protein concentration QTL at the chr5:75&#x2013;76Mbp locus was performed using imputed sequence genotypes representing &#x003E;30,000 cows. These animals had been physically genotyped using the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP) chip, where this panel had also been augmented with 224 custom sequence variants representing the chromosome 5 window, enriching the interval for QTL-tag variants identified from previous, preliminary analyses of the locus (spanning 74.8&#x2013;76.2Mbp; see Materials and Methods). Sequence data were imputed using Beagle4 [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (74.8&#x2013;76.2Mbp; 11,733 markers), and phenotypes were produced from herd-test records (N=29,350 cows) from the animals&#x2019; first lactations to derive values for milk yield (MY), protein yield (PY), fat yield (FY), protein concentration (PC), and fat concentration (FC; see Materials and Methods).</p>
<p>Mixed linear model association (MLMA) analyses were conducted using GCTA [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The top associated variant for each of the five phenotypes is shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. All QTL were found to be significant at the genome-wide threshold 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>. The most significant QTL was identified for protein concentration, followed by fat concentration and milk yield. The fat yield phenotype exhibited the least significant QTL.

<title>Functional prediction of variant effects suggests regulatory QTL mechanisms</title>
<p>To assess potential functional effects of the statistically implicated QTL variants, all polymorphisms in strong LD (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> <italic>&#x003E;</italic> 0.9) with the top-ranked QTL variants for each trait were extracted (N=365 variants), and analysed using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The majority of these variants (N=247) were predicted to map outside of genes, while 113 were predicted to be intronic, with 58 in transcript ENSBTAT00000009911.4 (<italic>NCF4</italic>) and 55 in ENSBTAT00000011947.5 (<italic>CSF2RB</italic>).The remaining five variants were predicted to be synonymous mutations, with two in ENSBTAP00000009911.4 (<italic>NCF4</italic>) at positions p.Gln145= and p.Tyr243=, and three in ENSBTAP00000011947.5 (<italic>CSF2RB</italic>) at positions p.Asn58=, p.Tyr405=, and p.Glu424=. Importantly, none of the highly associated variants were predicted to change the protein sequences of genes, suggesting a regulatory mode of effect as the likely mechanism(s) of the QTL.</p>

<title>Expression QTL analysis highlights three genes differentially expressed by genotype</title>
<p>To look for <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL effects that might explain the lactation QTL, gene expression levels were calculated for genes in the BTA5:75-76Mbp window, using RNAseq data representing lactating mammary tissue biopsies from 357 cows (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, panel C). Expression levels in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) and transcripts per million mapped reads (TPM) were calculated using Stringtie [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and are shown in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> for transcripts where FPKM <italic>&#x003E;</italic> 0.1. The gene with the highest expression level was <italic>CSF2RB</italic>, consistent with previous observations in murine mammary RNAseq data [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moderate expression was also observed for the candidate gene <italic>MYH9</italic>. However, the expression level of <italic>NCF4</italic> was very low, at FPKM &#x003D; 0.406. The highest correlation between pairs of gene expression levels was observed for <italic>TST</italic> and <italic>MPST</italic> (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.545), concordant with the published observation of a shared bidirectional promoter for these two genes [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

<p>Association mapping was then conducted for the eleven expressed genes in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. To this end, gene expression data were first scaled using the variance-stabilising transformation (VST) implemented in DESeq [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A GRM was then calculated for the 357 cows representing the RNAseq dataset, and the MLMA-LOCO method performed as described for analysis of lactation traits, above. This yielded genome-wide significant eQTL for three genes: <italic>CSF2RB</italic> (1.33 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;26</sup>), <italic>NCF4</italic> (4.30 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>), and <italic>TXN2</italic> (5.85 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;12</sup>) (see <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). All three genes locate within the peaks of their respective eQTL, demonstrating regulation in <italic>cis</italic>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="414821_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In cases where genetic regulation of gene expression (i.e. an eQTL) underlies a complex trait QTL, we expect that both QTL should share similar association signals, with the most (and least) associated variants similar between phenotypes. To test whether any of the eleven expressed genes shared similarities with the milk QTL, the Pearson correlation between the log<sub>10</sub> p-values for each of the milk QTL and eQTL were calculated. <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the QTL:eQTL correlations for all five phenotypes with three significant eQTL, plus the <italic>TST</italic> gene, which did not yield a genome-wide significant eQTL, though has been proposed as a candidate underlying this locus. The eQTL for <italic>CSF2RB</italic> has <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> <italic>&#x003E;</italic> 0.5 (<italic>r &#x003E;</italic> 0.707) with three of the five milk phenotypes, while correlations for the neighbouring gene <italic>NCF4</italic> sit just below this level. Neither of the <italic>TXN2</italic> or <italic>TST</italic> genes exhibited high correlations with any milk QTL. The eQTL for <italic>CSF2RB</italic> was also highly correlated with the <italic>NCF4</italic> eQTL (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.863). A similar picture is obtained when examining the LD between the top tag markers for each QTL, with high LD observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) among the tags for the MY, FC, and PC phenotypes with the tags for the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> and <italic>NCF4</italic> eQTL.</p>

<title>Evidence of multiple, differentially segregating QTL for milk yield and protein concentration</title>
<p>Examining panel A in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (repeated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>) suggested that protein concentration might be influenced by two co-located but mechanistically independent QTL, as a number of markers that are not in strong LD with the top marker nevertheless exhibit very small p-values (<italic>&#x003C;</italic> 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;60</sup>). To investigate this possibility, the top associated marker (rs208375076) was fitted as a fixed effect and the MLMA-LOCO analysis repeated using the residual, protein concentratiThe same pattern wason phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The new top marker (rs210293314) remained highly significant (P=1.30 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;24</sup> after adjustment, 9.31 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;41</sup> before adjustment), suggesting that it is tagging a different QTL. Adjusting the original protein concentration phenotype for rs210293314 and repeating the MLMA-LOCO analysis yielded the result shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>. Here, the most significant marker was rs208086849, a variant largely equivalent to the top rs208375076 marker from the original, unadjusted analysis (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 0.999). These observations indeed suggest the presence of two QTL for milk protein percentage. This analysis was repeated with the MY phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). This phenotype showed little evidence of a second co-locating QTL, where fitting the top associated marker (rs208473130) dropped the signal below the genome-wide significance threshold (P=1.36 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> for marker rs378861677; 5E). However, adjusting the MY phenotype by fitting rs378861677 and repeating the MLMA-LOCO analysis resulted in an increase in significance for the top marker rs208473130, from 6.64 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;25</sup> to 8.63 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;29</sup> (5F), suggesting there may indeed be an additional weak QTL, or the variant otherwise addresses some other confounding signal. The variants rs208086849 (from the PC analysis in the previous paragraph) and rs208473130 show very strong LD (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 0.991), suggesting that both markers are in fact tagging the same QTL across the PC and MY traits. In contrast, variants rs210293314 (PC analysis above) and rs378861677 show moderate to weak LD (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 0.332), suggesting the two signals tagged by these variants are genetically distinct.</p>

<p>Since at least two differentially segregating QTL were apparent at the locus, it was possible that they were underpinned by different genes and/or molecular mechanisms. To assess whether the significant, co-locating <italic>CSF2RB</italic> and <italic>NCF4</italic> eQTL were themselves comprised of multiple, overlapping signals (i.e. multiple <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL driven by different regulatory elements), the top associated variants were fitted as fixed effects to the gene expression phenotypes, with analyses rerun as above. This yielded new top markers with p-values of 8.87 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup> and 1.75 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup> respectively, suggesting that the expression of these two genes, if influenced by multiple regulatory factors, were weak effects or impacts that were too heavily confounded by LD to differentiate clearly.</p>
<p>To look at how the eQTL might contribute to the multiple, co-locating PC QTL in comparative terms, the SNP-adjusted PC association results were used to calculate eQTL correlations, using the methodology described in the previous section. Notably, these analyses resulted in improved correlations with eQTL. The correlation between the <italic>CSF2RB cis</italic>-eQTL and the unadjusted PC phenotype was 0.754 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). However, using the phenotype adjusted for the marker rs210293314 yielded a correlation of 0.807 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). The same pattern was observed for the <italic>NCF4</italic> gene, where correlations improved from 0.691 to 0.843 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Applying the same approach to milk yield phenotypes (unadjusted, and adjusted by marker rs37886167) gave similar results, albeit with marginal increases: correlations with the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> eQTL increased from 0.855 to 0.872, and correlations with the <italic>NCF4</italic> eQTL increased from 0.692 to 0.719.</p>

<title><italic>CSF2RB</italic> encodes a promiscuously RNA-edited transcript</title>
<p>Previous work [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] had identified four RNA editing sites mapping to the introns of the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> gene. Here, while manually examining RNAseq and WGS sequence reads mapping to the gene, a surprising number of additional RNA edits were apparent (see Materials and Methods). This included a total of 38 novel A-to-G variant sites present in the RNAseq data, yet absent from the whole genome sequence representing the nine cows for which both data sources were available. These sites were present in four clusters within the 3<sup><italic>&#x2032;</italic></sup> UTR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), missed from our previously published genome-wide analysis [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] due to that analysis being based only on reference annotations that failed to capture the full length 3<sup><italic>&#x2032;</italic></sup>UTR sequence evident using empirically derived gene structures from mammary RNAseq data. Because the ADAR genes responsible for adenosine-to-inosine editing (A-to-G in sequence reads) target double-stranded RNA [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we predicted the potential for the sequence surrounding the edited sites to form double-stranded RNA.

<p>As recently reported, we have observed a proportion of RNA-edited bases to be genetically modulated for some sites [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To investigate potential genetic regulation of editing of <italic>CSF2RB</italic> transcripts, editing proportion phenotypes were generated (see Methods) for use in detecting RNA editing QTL (edQTL [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Using the MLMA-LOCO method as applied for eQTL analysis described above, genome-wide significant edQTL (P&#x003C;5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>) were identified for 18 of the 38 sites. Because RNA editing may impact gene expression by several different mechanisms [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we investigated whether any edQTL were correlated with the eQTL for <italic>CSF2RB</italic>. One site, mapping to BTA5:75,750,220, had a correlation of 0.849 between the &#x2013; log<sub>10</sub> p-values of the edQTL and the eQTL. This edQTL was also strongly correlated with the <italic>NCF4</italic> eQTL (0.929).</p>
<p>As an extension to the hypothesis that edQTL might underlie changes in gene expression (i.e. eQTL), we reasoned that one or more of the milk phenotype QTL might also be impacted, as evidenced through correlation. Investigating this hypothesis, we observed correlations <italic>&#x003E;</italic> 0.707 between edQTL and the fat concentration, protein concentration, and protein yield phenotypes (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). In addition, we found very strong correlations (<italic>&#x003E;</italic> 0.9) between two edQTL (sites BTA5:75,749,101 and BTA5:75,750,335) and the milk yield phenotype after adjusting for the genotype of marker rs208473130 (yield QTL illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, correlations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

<title>Hypervariability at the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> locus presents an abundance of candidate causative variants</title>
<p>Manual examination of the WGS alignments at the locus also revealed read depth anomalies at approximately BTA5:75,781,300&#x2013;75,782,800. This analysis revealed a suspected 1.5 kbp deletion variant, located between the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> and <italic>TEX33</italic> genes (downstream of the 3<sup><italic>&#x2032;</italic></sup> UTRs of both genes given a &#x2018;tail to tail&#x2019; orientation). To attempt to derive genotypes for this variant, the copy number at this site was estimated for 560 whole genome sequenced cattle using CNVnator 0.3 [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The resulting estimates of copy number formed a trimodal distribution (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>), suggestive of a biallelic variant that could be assumed to be inherited in a Mendelian fashion [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

<p>To investigate the candidacy of the deletion as a potential causative variant for one or more of the QTL in the region, genotypes were called from CNVnator copy number predictions (Materials and Methods), and the LD (R<sup>2</sup>) between the deletion and top QTL variants investigated. Strong LD (0.887) was observed with the top markers for the MY (rs208473130) and PC (rs208375076) phenotypes, as well as with rs208086849, the top variant for the PC phenotype after adjusting for the secondary QTL (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). A slightly lower LD score was observed for the FC phenotype (R<sup>2</sup>=0.807). The deletion allele was more frequent than the reference allele in the NZ dairy population (deletion=0.547).</p>
<p>The strong LD of the <italic>&#x223C;</italic> 1.5 kbp deletion with key QTL tag variants qualified the variant as a potential candidate for these QTL, so we then imputed the variant into the association analysis population to test for association directly.

Although highly significant, when ranking all variants by p-value, the deletion variant never placed higher than the 400<sup>th</sup> most significant; however, given the very large number of associated variants at the region generally (&#x003E;800 in the top 20 orders of magnitude for PC), and the fact that some of the read-depth-based genotype calls may be erroneous, the deletion remains a plausible candidate variant for future consideration of these QTL.</p>

<title>Milk phenotype QTL</title>
<p>We report QTL mapping of a chromosome 5 locus for several milk yield and composition phenotypes, with a diversity of gene expression and RNA editing QTL that could underpin these effects. We note in particular that some phenotypes exhibit multiple QTL, likely with distinct genetic causes. The fat and protein concentration QTL are both in high LD with the milk yield QTL, suggesting that these effects may be mediated by changes in the total volume of milk produced without concomitant changes in fat or protein production. The fat and protein yield QTL are not in LD with either each other or with milk yield. However, these two QTL are less significant than the others by many orders of magnitude (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the lack of LD may be due to insufficient power in the data set to identify reproducible tag variants.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Candidate causative genes</title>
<p>Several candidate causative genes have been previously proposed to underlie lactation effects at this locus, and based on the work presented here, we propose that one or both of the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> and <italic>NCF4</italic> genes are the likely candidates, with a predicted deleterious variant in the <italic>MPST</italic> gene also providing a potential candidate for a secondary effect milk yield QTL.</p>
<p>The <italic>CSF2RB</italic> gene (ENSBTAG00000009064) encodes the common beta chain of the receptors for GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and interleukin-5, cytokines that are involved in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is produced in the mammary gland by alveolar macrophages [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] where it enhances the bactericidal activity of milk neutrophils [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These receptors form a link in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, operating via JAK2 and STAT5 [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The STAT5 proteins, especially STAT5A, are important for enabling mammopoiesis and lactogenesis [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and directly bind the gamma-interferon-activating sequence (GAS) found in the promoters of milk proteins such as beta-casein, [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], beta-lactoglobulin [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and whey acidic protein in mice [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The importance of this pathway is further evidenced by associations for milk production traits observed at the <italic>STAT5</italic> locus [<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although the relevant ligands and subunits with which <italic>CSF2RB</italic> forms complexes are unknown in the current context, mutations that impact downstream interactions with STAT5 proteins could be assumed to impact milk production/composition phenotypes.</p>
<p>The <italic>NCF4</italic> gene (ENSBTAG00000007531) encodes neutrophil cytosolic factor 4, which forms the p40-phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex [<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This enzyme produces superoxide <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="414821_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, a reactive oxygen species produced in phagocytic cells during the respiratory burst [<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], intended to kill invading fungi and bacteria [<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. <italic>NCF4</italic> has been shown to be upregulated in mastitic mammary glands [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and two SNPs mapping to the <italic>NCF4</italic> gene have been associated with elevated somatic cell scores (SCS) [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], a trait that is used as a surrogate phenotype for mastitis in dairy animals. As cows suffering from mastitis produce smaller volumes of milk than healthy cows [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], this provides a possible mechanism by which <italic>NCF4</italic> could influence milk production. A more appealing mechanism is one that involves <italic>CSF2RB</italic> or <italic>NCF4</italic> outside of a pathogen response context however, given that the locus is better known for its impacts on milk production and composition in the absence of overt mammary infection.</p>
<p>Both the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> and <italic>NCF4</italic> eQTL were correlated with the MY QTL, with the former giving stronger correlations (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.849 compared to 0.682). Lower correlations were observed between the two eQTL and the PC QTL (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.754 and 0.691), however, removing one of the two apparent signals at this locus by fitting the rs210293314 marker to the PC phenotype increased correlations for both candidate genes. As no other genes showed similar patterns of co-association, we consider one or more of these genes to be the best candidates at this locus. The <italic>CSF2RB</italic> gene was expressed very strongly in mammary samples (TPM=80.1), and by comparison, at a much higher level than <italic>NCF4</italic> (TPM=0.51). This observation suggests a critical role for <italic>CSF2RB</italic>-mediated signalling in lactation, and given the plausible biological linkages of <italic>CSF2RB</italic> to these processes (via JAK-STAT signalling), we favour <italic>CSF2RB</italic> as the more likely of these two candidates.</p>
<p>The <italic>TST</italic> gene (ENSBTAG00000030650) was recently proposed by Pausch et al. [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] as a candidate for milk fat and protein percentage QTL at <italic>&#x223C;</italic> 75&#x2013;76 Mbp on chromosome 5. <italic>TST</italic> encodes thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, also known as rhodanese, a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the conversion of cyanide plus thiosulfate into thiocyanate plus sulfite [<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It has also been shown that the rhodanese enzyme (in misfolded form) can bind with 5S-rRNA, enabling its import into the mitochondria [<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. There appears to be limited literature implicating <italic>TST</italic> in mammary development and milk production, and given that the gene maps downstream of peak association in our dataset, and has no prominent eQTL by which to mediate these effects, a role for this gene seems unlikely for QTL in the NZ population. This does not preclude the involvement of the gene in other populations, however, we submit that the most parsimonious hypothesis is that these QTL are shared across populations, at least partially underpinned by regulatory variants modulating the expression of the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> gene.</p>

The correlation between the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> eQTL and the same milk QTL was -0.173, suggesting that, if the lactation effects indeed derive from an RNA-editing-based mechanism, that this mechanism is not wholly reflected by the gene expression data used to quantify the eQTL effects.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have examined a previously implicated chromosome 5 locus for milk yield and composition traits, and identified highly significant QTL for milk yield, protein concentration, and fat concentration. Using a large mammary RNA sequence resource, we have conducted eQTL mapping of the locus and show that expression of <italic>CSF2RB</italic>, a highly expressed gene that signals through pathways important to mammary development and lactation, appears to be responsible for these effects. RNA editing sites were also discovered in the 3<sup><italic>&#x2032;</italic></sup>-UTR of <italic>CSF2RB</italic>, and edQTL for two of these are correlated with one of two co-located yet differentially segregating milk yield QTL, which was also in strong LD with a predicted deleterious missense variant in the <italic>MPST</italic> gene. These results highlight the pleiotropic nature of the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> gene, and showcase the mechanistic complexity of a locus that will require further statistical and functional dissection to catalogue the full multiplicity of effects.</p>

<title>Genotyping and phenotyping</title>
<p>All cows that had been genotyped using the GGP LDv3 or LDv4 chips for which herd test phenotypes were also available were targeted for the current study (N=29,350). Animals representing these platforms were targeted since, based on preliminary sequence-based association analyses not reported here, these panels had been enriched with 365 polymorphisms identified as tag-variants of the chromosome 5 lactation QTL (spanning a region from 74.8&#x2013;76.2 Mbp; Additional File 1). These variants included 30 SNPs from the Illumina BovineSNP50 chip (50k), added to assist with imputation of the region and create equivalence with that platform for other analysis applications. Tag-variants were targeted as custom content using a scheme that attempted to genotype sites in both orientations (two primers per site), resulting in 341 custom markers on the LDv3 chip, and 342 on the LDv4 chip for this locus. Phenotypes were calculated from their herd-test records for the three yield traits plus fat and protein concentration in milk. These phenotypes were generated using herd-test data from the first lactation, adjusted using an ASReml-R [<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] model with birth year, age at calving, breed, and heterosis as linear covariates, stage of lactation as a fixed effect, season/herd as an absorbed fixed effect, and animal as a random effect.

<p>Genotypes for 29,350 animals were imputed to WGS resolution in the window of interest using Beagle 4 [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as described previously [<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Briefly, a reference population of 565 animals, comprising Holstein-Friesians, Jerseys, and cross-bred cattle, was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument to yield 100 bp reads. Read mapping to the UMD 3.1 bovine reference genome was conducted using BWA MEM 0.7.8 [<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], followed by variant calling using GATK HaplotypeCaller 3.2 [<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Variants were phased using Beagle 4 [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and those with poor phasing metrics (allelic R<sup>2</sup> &#x003C; 0.95) were excluded, yielding 12,867 variants.

Heritabilities for all phenotypes were calculated using this GRM with the REML option in GCTA. A leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) GRM was also created excluding chromosome 5, and used in combination with the imputed variant set and phenotypes to perform a mixed linear model analysis (MLMA-LOCO) [<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] using GCTA.</p>

<title>RNAseq, gene expressions and eQTL</title>
<p>RNAseq data from lactating mammary gland biopsies representing 357 cows was generated as described previously [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Briefly, samples were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments, yielding 100 bp paired-end reads. These were mapped to the UMD 3.1 reference genome using TopHat2 [<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Stringtie software [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was used to quantify gene expression values for genes mapping to the window BTA5:75&#x2013;76Mbp, yielding fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) and transcripts per million (TPM) [<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] metrics. These calculations used gene models defined by the Ensembl gene build (release 81). Gene expression levels were also processed using the variance-stabilising transformation (VST) function implemented in the Bioconductor package DESeq [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to produce expression data suitable for analysis using linear models.</p>
<p>WGS-resolution genotypes were imputed using the same WGS sequence reference described above in conjunction with a mixture of genotype panels (see Methods in [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]) for the 357 cows, yielding 12,825 variants in the window BTA5:74.6&#x2013;76.2Mbp. Filtering to remove variants with &#x003E;5&#x0025; missing genotypes (N=36) or MAF &#x003C;0.5&#x0025; (N=1,643) resulted in a final set containing 11,146 variants. VST-transformed gene expressions were analysed for genes with FPKM &#x003E; 0.1, using the GCTA MLMA-LOCO method described above. The GRM was calculated using physically genotyped variants from the BovineHD SNP chip for 337 cows, and imputed BovineHD genotypes for the remaining twenty cows based on an Illumina SNP50 platform scaffold.</p>

<title>RNA-editing site discovery and edQTL</title>
<p>RNA editing in the 3<sup><italic>&#x2032;</italic></sup>-UTR of the <italic>CSF2RB</italic> gene was investigated in the nine discovery set animals from [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], where these animals had been previously sequenced using both RNAseq and WGS methodologies. Editing sites were identified using custom scripts [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and by manual inspection of WGS and RNAseq BAM files for each animal. Sites were considered to represent RNA edits where: i) an A-to-G variant was present in the RNAseq reads, but was absent from the WGS reads, and ii) had at least five reads containing &#x2018;G&#x2019; at the position in every animal. This yielded 38 candidate edited sites. Following the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ramaswami et al 2012</xref> for non-<italic>Alu</italic> sites, the 38 candidate sites were examined for the presence of 5<sup><italic>&#x2032;</italic></sup> mismatches, simple repeats, homopolymer runs <italic>&#x2265;</italic> 5 bp, or splice junctions within 4 bp; however, none of the candidates were impacted by these filters, and all 38 were retained for further analyses.</p>
<p>Having determined the positions of variant sites, the rate of editing at each site was quantified in the larger &#x2018;quantification set&#x2019; of 353 cows [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] with RNA editing phenotypes for each site generated by transforming editing proportions using the logit function. RNA editing QTL discovery was performed using these phenotypes by performing MLMA-LOCO, incorporating the same GRM and imputed WGS genotypes used for eQTL discovery (N=353 animals).</p>
<p>RNA secondary structure around the edited sites was predicted using dot-plots as described by [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Sequence containing all 38 edited sites was extracted, along with 800 bp upstream and downstream. The sequence was then plotted against its complement, with dots placed where at least 11 of 15 nucleotides surrounding a point were complementary. Diagonal lines in the resulting plot indicate regions of extended complementarity, which therefore have the potential to form double-stranded secondary structures.</p>

<title>Copy number variant genotyping and imputation</title>
<p>Manual examination of the WGS BAM files suggested the presence of a copy-number variant (CNV) located downstream of <italic>CSF2RB</italic>, mapping to BTA5:75,781,300&#x2013; 75,782,800. Copy numbers were estimated from WGS reads for each of 560 cattle using the software package CNVnator version 0.3 [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], based on sequence read depth. Thresholds for genotype calling of the CNV were decided based on the histogram of the trimodal distribution of the copy number (CN) estimates, where homozygous deletion was called where CN&#x003C;0.95, heterozygous 0.95 &#x003C;= CN &#x003C; 1.95, and homozygous wild type when CN &#x003E;= 1.95. CNV genotypes were imputed into a larger population (N=29,350), for use in association analyses, using Beagle version 4.1 [<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], using the reference population of 560 cattle described above. Combining the reference genotype calls with the imputed population yielded a set of 31,950 animals for use in MLMA-LOCO analyses, as described above.</p>

<title>Ethics approval</title>
<p>All animal experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the rules and guidelines outlined in the New Zealand Animal Welfare Act 1999. Most data were generated as part of routine commercial activities outside the scope of that requiring formal committee assessment and ethical approval (as defined by the above guidelines). These animals were located in commercial dairy herds around New Zealand, with approval given to tissue sample for genetic analyses. For the mammary tissue RNA sequencing biopsy experiment, samples were obtained in accordance with protocols approved by the Ruakura Animal Ethics Committee, Hamilton, New Zealand (approval AEC 12845). These cows were situated on a research farm and permission was sought and obtained to biopsy mammary tissue from the owner of these animals (AgResearch, NZ). No animals were sacrificed for this study.</p>
