<title>ABSTRACT</title>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>ST131-<italic>H30</italic> was responsible for 5.3&#x0025; of all extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> infections and 44&#x0025; of ESBL-producing extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> infections among US children. The clinical and demographic correlates of infection with ST131-<italic>H30</italic> differed between extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant and -sensitive isolates.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>E. coli</italic> ST131-<italic>H30</italic> is a globally important pathogen implicated in rising rates of multidrug resistance, especially fluoroquinolone resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production, among <italic>E. coli</italic> causing extraintestinal infections. Previous studies have focused on adults, especially the elderly, leaving the epidemiology of <italic>H30</italic> among children undefined.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We used clinical data and extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates from a case-control study conducted at four US freestanding children&#x2019;s hospitals from 2009-2013 to estimate the burden and identify clinical and demographic correlates of infection with <italic>H30</italic>. <italic>H30</italic> isolates were identified using <italic>fumC/fimH</italic> genotyping. Host correlates of <italic>H30</italic> infection were examined using univariable and multivariable log-binomial regression models stratified by extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance status.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The estimated prevalence of ST131-H30 was 5.3&#x0025; among all extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates and 44&#x0025; among ESBL-producing isolates. The host correlates of infection with <italic>H30</italic> differed by extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance status: among resistant isolates, age &#x2264;5 years was positively associated with <italic>H30</italic> infection (relative risk [RR] 1.80, 95&#x0025; confidence interval [CI] 1.18-2.86); among sensitive isolates, age &#x2264; years was negatively associated with <italic>H30</italic> (RR 0.48, 95&#x0025; CI 0.26-0.86), while presence of an underlying medical condition was positively associated with <italic>H30</italic> (RR 4.19, 95&#x0025; CI 2.32-8.00).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>ST131-<italic>H30</italic> is less common among extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> collected from children compared to what has been reported among adults, possibly reflecting infrequent fluoroquinolone use in pediatrics; however, it is similarly dominant among ESBL-producing isolates. The <italic>H30</italic> subclone appears to disproportionately affect young children relative to other extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Extraintestinal <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are a common cause of urinary tract and bloodstream infections across all ages, and have displayed worrisome increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance in the past two decades.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] This increase has been attributed to the emergence and rapid clonal expansion of <italic>E. coli</italic> Sequence Type (ST) 131, which has transformed the population structure of extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> infections worldwide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] Molecular epidemiologic studies have shown that a subclone of ST131, termed <italic>H30</italic> or clade C, has driven the global dissemination of ST131.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] There are two dominant antimicrobial resistant sublineages nested within ST131-<italic>H30</italic>/clade C: <italic>H30R</italic> or clade C1, which is characterized by resistance to fluoroquinolones, and <italic>H30Rx</italic> or clade C2, which is characterized by resistance to fluoroquinolones as well as production of a CTX-M-15-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) that confers resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (Supplementary Fig 1).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]</p>
<p>Although <italic>E. coli</italic> ST131-<italic>H30</italic> (hereafter, <italic>H30</italic>) has been recognized as a high-risk clone of significant public health importance,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] there is a lack of data about its epidemiology in the pediatric population. Most studies that have included <italic>H30</italic> isolates from children have occurred over short time periods at single centers and have accumulated few <italic>H30</italic> isolates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] Among adults in the US, <italic>H30</italic> is estimated to comprise about 50&#x0025; of ESBL-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> infections and between 10&#x0025; and 20&#x0025; and of all clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> infections, and has been linked to host factors including older age, healthcare contact, local or systemic compromise, and recent antibiotic use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] Associations with adverse outcomes such as persistent infections, hospitalization, new infections, and sepsis have also been reported in adult populations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] Understanding the epidemiology of <italic>H30</italic> in pediatric populations is important, as its dominance among multidrug-resistant (MDR) extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> makes it a likely culprit of many difficult-to-treat infections in children. Proper treatment of urinary tract infections &#x2013; the most common type of infection caused by extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x2013; is especially critical in pediatric populations, as young children are more prone to upper tract infection with potential short- and long-term complications such as renal scarring and decreased renal function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</p>
<p>We sought to address this knowledge gap using data from a multiyear, multicenter prospective study of extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> infections to quantify the burden and identify clinical and demographic correlates of infection with <italic>H30</italic> among children. In addition, we describe and compare the antimicrobial resistance characteristics of <italic>H30, H30Rx</italic>, and all other (non-<italic>H30</italic>) <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates in a US pediatric population.</p>

<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Patients and isolates</title>
<p>All isolates and clinical data came from a multicenter case-control study that conducted prospective isolate and data collection and is described in detail elsewhere.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] In brief, between September 1, 2009 and September 30, 2013, four freestanding US children&#x2019;s hospitals (referred to here as West, Midwest 1, Midwest 2, and East) used standard clinical microbiology techniques to identify and collect all extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant (ESC-R) <italic>E. coli</italic> collected from urine or other normally sterile sites during routine clinical care of both inpatient and outpatient children &#x003C; 22 years of age. ESC-R isolates were defined as those non-susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, or aztreonam. For each resistant isolate, three consecutive <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates that were susceptible to the aforementioned agents, referred to here as extended-spectrum cephalosporin-susceptible (ESC-S) isolates, were also collected. Isolates were archived and shipped to the coordinating study hospital quarterly. The Institutional Review Board at each hospital approved the study protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Laboratory methods</title>
<p>Methods for antibiotic susceptibility and typing of resistance phenotypes and determinants were also described previously.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] Briefly, after arriving at the coordinating study hospital, all isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using disk diffusion, and ESC-R or ESC-S status was confirmed. ESC-R phenotypes (ESBL vs. AmpC) were characterized using a combination of disk diffusion and E-tests. Genetic determinants of extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance were identified by PCR using primers for genes encoding common extended-spectrum cephalosporinases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] <italic>H30</italic> isolates were identified using the <italic>fumC/fimH</italic> genotyping scheme.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] <italic>H30Rx</italic> isolates were identified by PCR detection of sublineage-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Clinical data</title>
<p>Demographic and clinical data were collected from the medical records of patients using a standardized data abstraction form. Methods for categorizing underlying medical conditions and capturing antibiotic exposure were also described previously.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Prevalence estimates</title>
<p>The overall prevalence of <italic>H30</italic> was estimated using the prevalence of <italic>H30</italic> among ESC-R isolates (which were captured completely), the prevalence of <italic>H30</italic> among the collected ESC-S isolates (which were captured partially), and the total number of <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates collected from each clinical microbiology laboratory during the study period, excluding repeat isolates from a given patient if they were collected within 15 days of the first isolate. The 15-day cut point was chosen in an effort to identify isolates that represented a new infection episode. The total number of <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates from each study hospital was only available between October 1, 2009 and September 30, 2013, so any isolates collected during September 2009 were excluded. After calculating the prevalence of <italic>H30</italic> among ESC-R and ESC-S isolates separately, the overall prevalence among all clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates was estimated using a weighted average of the stratified prevalence estimates, with the weights being the relative proportions of the two mutually exclusive groups among the total number of <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates reported. This approach makes two assumptions: 1) all ESC-R isolates were captured; and 2) the collected ESC-S isolates, which were collected without respect to any patient or microbiological characteristics beyond ESC-S status and temporal proximity to the ESC-R isolates, are representative of all ESC-S isolates. The same approach was applied to calculate the prevalence of <italic>H30Rx</italic>.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<sec>
<title><bold>Host correlates of infection</bold></title>
<p>Host factors were compared between patients with <italic>H30</italic> isolates vs. non-<italic>H30</italic> isolates, stratified by ESC-R status. Only the first isolate from each unique individual was considered. Variables were first compared using Chi-squared or Fisher&#x2019;s Exact tests to identify potential predictors of interest. Factors with a p-value of &#x003C;0.05 were considered candidate predictors of interest. The magnitude of the association between each predictor of interest and <italic>H30</italic> infection was then assessed using univariable and multivariable log-binomial regression models. For each predictor of interest, the relative risk (RR) and 95&#x0025; confidence intervals (CIs) from three models are presented: 1) a univariable model that estimates the crude (unadjusted) total effect of the predictor of interest on the outcome; 2) a multivariable model that estimates the total effect of the predictor of interest on the outcome, adjusted for potential confounders; and 3) a multivariable model that estimates the direct effect of the predictor of interest on the outcome, adjusted for potential confounders as well as for potential mediating variables. Potential confounders and mediators were selected according to the conceptual framework found in the supplementary material (Supplementary Fig 2).</p>

The estimated prevalence of <italic>H30</italic> among all clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates at all study hospitals was 5.3&#x0025;, while the study hospital-specific prevalence ranged from 2.7&#x0025; to 6.2&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Host correlates of infection by ESC-R status</title>
<p>Among ESC-R isolates, and when only considering the first isolate per patient, patient age was associated with <italic>H30</italic> infection and further examined as a predictor of interest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Our sample size precluded multilevel predictors, so age was categorized into ages 0-5 and 6-21 years in regression models. In our data, young age was strongly associated with Asian race (data not shown), and Asian race also displayed an association with <italic>H30</italic> infection. Therefore, we included Asian race (yes/no) as a potential confounder of the association between patient age and <italic>H30</italic> infection. After adjusting for Asian race, age 0-5 was associated with an 80&#x0025; increased risk of the infecting organism being <italic>H30</italic> (RR 1.80, 95&#x0025;CI 1.18-2.86). There was no evidence that this association was mediated through factors related to underlying illness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). When restricting the outcome to <italic>H30Rx</italic> infection only (vs. non-<italic>H30</italic> infection) and adjusting for Asian race, the effect size was stronger (RR 2.21, 95&#x0025;CI 1.33-3.87).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Among ESC-S isolates, patient age and several factors associated with underlying illness were associated with <italic>H30</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Each of these variables was examined as a predictor of interest except for: (i) history of transplantation, due to small numbers, and (ii) type of infection acquisition, since it is a composite variable and previous hospitalization and underlying medical conditions were examined independently. Underlying medical condition and indwelling device categories were collapsed into any vs. none. In a univariate analysis, patient age &#x2264;5 years was negatively associated with <italic>H30</italic> infection (RR 0.48, 95&#x0025; CI 0.26-0.86). Of the variables related to underlying illness, after adjusting for potential confounders, only presence of an underlying medical condition (RR 4.19, 95&#x0025;CI 2.32-8.00) remained as an independent predictor of <italic>H30</italic> infection. When including potential mediators in the models, the magnitude of the associations between age &#x2264;5 years and presence of an underlying medical condition with <italic>H30</italic> infection decreased, but the associations remained statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Since patient age was a strong predictor in both the analyses of ESC-R and ESC-S isolates, we visually inspected the distributional differences of age measured continuously. While the non-<italic>H30</italic> age distributions are very similar, the <italic>H30</italic> age distributions display marked differences between ESC-R and ESC-S isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>We utilized a multiyear, multicenter, prospective study of extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> infections in children&#x2019;s hospitals to address a critical knowledge gap about the epidemiology of the globally important ST131-<italic>H30</italic> subclone among US children. Our results can be summarized into three main findings. First, the estimated prevalence of <italic>H30</italic> among pediatric clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates of 5.3&#x0025; was lower than the 10-20&#x0025; that has been observed in US adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] However, <italic>H30</italic> was nearly as dominant among ESBL-producing isolates in children (44&#x0025;) as has been reported in adults (about 50&#x0025;).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] Second, patient age was associated with infection due to <italic>H30</italic>, but the nature of this association contrasted sharply between ESC-R and ESC-S infections. Among ESC-R infections, <italic>H30</italic> was associated with young age (&#x2264;5 years). Conversely, among ESC-S infections, <italic>H30</italic> was associated with older age (6-21 years), as well as with the presence of an underlying medical condition. Third, the antimicrobial resistance characteristics of <italic>H30</italic> and <italic>H30Rx</italic> collected from children were consistent with what has been previously reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] ESC-R <italic>H30</italic> isolates were almost always fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing, and ESBL-producing <italic>H30Rx</italic> isolates were associated with the CTX-M-15 beta-lactamase, while ESBL-producing <italic>H30-non-Rx</italic> isolates were associated with the CTX-M-27 beta-lactamase.</p>
<p>Other studies have suggested that <italic>H30</italic> is less prevalent among children than adults; however, very few pediatric isolates were included in these studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] Interestingly, we observed that <italic>H30</italic> was nearly as dominant among ESBL-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> infections in children as has been reported in adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] These findings are consistent with a recent study from a pediatric setting conducted in the Midwestern US.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] However, in the context of all clinical extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> infections, ESBL-producing organisms are still relatively rare in both adults and children. The bulk of the <italic>H30</italic> isolates circulating in the population are non-ESBL-producing but fluoroquinolone-resistant, and the prevalence of such organisms was much lower in our study than estimates from adult populations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] This observation may be explained by differential antibiotic use in these populations. Fluoroquinolones are infrequently prescribed to children due to historical concerns about toxicity;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] in our study, about 5&#x0025; of patients received fluoroquinolones in the year before collection of their first isolate, while 46&#x0025; of patients received any antibiotic in that same time period (data not shown). Lower rates of fluoroquinolone use likely translate to less selective pressure on fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms such as <italic>H30</italic>. Interestingly, a recent study conducted in adults in Australia and New Zealand, a population that also has low rates of fluoroquinolone use, reported an overall prevalence of <italic>H30</italic> of 3.5&#x0025;, but a prevalence of <italic>H30</italic> among ESC-R <italic>E. coli</italic> of 39&#x0025;, which is similar to our findings.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]</p>
<p>Although not explicitly previously reported, the association between <italic>H30</italic> and young age among ESC-R isolates is consistent with the findings of a recent longitudinal study showing that among children, the prevalence of ESBL-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> was highest and increasing most rapidly in children aged 1-5.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] Why <italic>H30/H30Rx</italic> is more frequently found among young children with ESC-R infections compared to older children with ESC-R infections, as well as where young children are acquiring this pathogen, deserves further investigation. Previous studies have portrayed <italic>H30</italic> as an opportunistic pathogen that favors compromised hosts,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] and the developing immune systems of young children could be a factor in colonization or infection. While transmission of <italic>H30</italic> between children within healthcare facilities has not been documented, there are reports of transmission of, and persistent colonization with, <italic>H30/H30Rx</italic> among healthy children within daycares and households.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] Future studies might focus on systematic sampling in the community setting in order to better elucidate the reservoirs and transmission dynamics of <italic>H30/H30Rx</italic> among young children.</p>
<p>The association we observed between ESC-S <italic>H30</italic> infections and older children is not consistent with the limited existing data.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] This association could be driven by different selective pressures in older children: specifically, fluoroquinolones may be prescribed more frequently to older children than younger children due to less concern about toxicity. This prescribing pattern was borne out in our data; the median age was 12.6 years among patients that received fluoroquinolones in the year prior to their infection, whereas the median overall age was 5.4 years (data not shown). Our multivariable models that included potential mediators suggested that factors associated with healthcare contact and antibiotic use may partially explain the observed association between older patient age and antibiotic use, but not completely. A more refined examination of antibiotic exposure, specifically focusing on fluoroquinolones, was not feasible here due to small numbers, but is warranted.</p>
<p>Notably, previous studies have described <italic>H30</italic> as being associated with healthcare contact and compromised hosts;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] however, we found those associations only among ESC-S <italic>H30</italic> infections. Even without ESBL production, ESC-S <italic>H30</italic> pathogens are more antimicrobial-resistant than other ESC-S isolates, and factors associated with compromised hosts and healthcare contact are consistently associated with antimicrobial resistant infections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] We observed that when compared to other ESC-R organisms, there is no evidence of an association between <italic>H30</italic> and underlying illness. This observation raises the question of whether some of the host correlates observed in previous studies are specific to the <italic>H30</italic> subclone, or just reflect risk factors for MDR extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> in general. Future studies should consider comparing <italic>H30</italic> to other MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> where possible.</p>
<p>A number of limitations need to be considered in the interpretation of these data. First, because of the case-control design of the parent study, the prevalence of <italic>H30</italic> and <italic>H30Rx</italic> among clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates could not be calculated directly. However, we believe the assumptions employed in our prevalence estimates are reasonable, and that these data provide the best estimate of the prevalence of <italic>H30</italic> in children to date. The design of the parent study was also beneficial, as it allowed us to enrich the collection with the less common MDR isolates and examine risk factors for infection with <italic>H30</italic> among those with ESC-R <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates specifically. Second, because this study was meant to be descriptive and exploratory, any significant statistical associations could be an artifact of multiple testing, and should be interpreted cautiously. To mitigate this, we attempted to make thoughtful model building decisions and interpretations by using conceptual models rather than taking a purely data-driven approach. Third, although this was a multicenter study, our data were collected from freestanding children&#x2019;s hospitals between 2009 and 2013, so the results may not be generalizable to other settings, and epidemiologic patterns may have shifted slightly during the subsequent several years. Despite these limitations, this study significantly improves our understanding of the impact of <italic>H30</italic> in children, and is one of the most robust examinations of the clinical burden of, and risk factors for, <italic>H30</italic> infections to date.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although <italic>E. coli</italic> ST131-<italic>H30</italic> is not as prevalent among children as has been reported in adults, perhaps as a result of low rates of fluoroquinolone use in pediatrics, this high-risk clone is dominant among ESC-R extraintestinal <italic>E. coli</italic> infections in children. In particular, the ESBL-producing type of <italic>H30</italic>, dominated by the <italic>H30Rx</italic> subclone, disproportionately affects young children relative to other MDR <italic>E. coli</italic>, even when accounting for other underlying host factors. More densely sampled studies are needed to investigate the reservoirs and transmission dynamics of this serious pathogen in a pediatric population in order to determine where these infections are coming from, and ultimately to develop interventions designed to reduce the burden of this difficult-to-treat pathogen in children.</p>
