<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>The synthetic control (SC) model is a powerful tool to quantify the population-level impact of vaccines, because it can adjust for trends unrelated to vaccination using a composite of control diseases. Because vaccine impact studies are often conducted using smaller subnational datasets, we evaluated the performance of SC models with sparse time series data. To obtain more robust estimates of vaccine effects from noisy time series, we proposed a possible alternative approach, &#x201C;STL&#x002B;PCA&#x201D; method (seasonal-trend decomposition plus principal component analysis), which first extracts smoothed trends from the control time series and uses them to adjust the outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Using both the SC and STL&#x002B;PCA models, we estimated the impact of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) on pneumonia hospitalizations among cases &#x003C;12 months and 80&#x002B; years of age during 2004-2014 at the subnational level in Brazil. The performance of these models was also compared using simulation analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The SC model was able to adjust for trends unrelated to PCV10 in larger states but not in smaller states. The simulation analysis confirmed that the SC model failed to select an appropriate set of control diseases when the time series were sparse and noisy, thereby generating biased estimates of the impact of vaccination when secular trends were present. The STL&#x002B;PCA approach decreased bias in the estimates for smaller populations.</p>

<p>Estimates from the SC model might be biased when data are sparse. The STL&#x002B;PCA model provides more accurate evaluations of vaccine impact in smaller populations.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Evaluating vaccination programs is essential to understand their benefit and to guide appropriate allocations of healthcare resources. However, it is challenging to quantify the reduction in disease rates caused by a vaccine at the population-level because various unrelated factors also affect the outcomes of interest. For example, improvements in living conditions and access to preventive care may decrease the incidence of a disease and exaggerate the effect of a vaccine. In contrast, improvements in the capacity of inpatient care services and better disease surveillance may increase the number of hospitalizations, and thus mask true vaccine-associated declines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several methods have been proposed to control for such unrelated trends when assessing the impact of an intervention. Most commonly, linear trends (e.g., interrupted time series analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Holt Winter method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) are used to adjust for unrelated changes. A limitation of these approaches is that they assume that the pre-intervention trends are linear and continue as such in the post-vaccine period. Alternatively, a time series of a control disease can be used in a regression model to adjust for trends that influence both the disease of interest and the control disease. This approach has the advantage of capturing irregular and unexpected trends, and it draws on information about the control disease from the post-intervention period. This approach can be used to isolate the effect of the intervention if the control disease is not influenced by the intervention, if the relationship between the control disease and the disease of interest is consistent over time, and if the control captures the relevant trends. The synthetic control (SC) framework builds on this concept but combines several control diseases into a single composite and has been used to assess the impact of interventions in economics, political science, and website analytics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> We have previously demonstrated the utility of the SC approach in estimating changes in pneumonia hospitalizations associated with the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>When evaluating the effects of interventions using datasets with large numbers of cases, the time series of the disease of interest and the control diseases are measured with relatively little noise. With these types of data, the SC approach can effectively adjust for unmeasured confounding. In practice, however, interventions often need to be evaluated using noisy data with few cases. It is not clear whether the SC approach can successfully select an optimal set of controls and adjust for shared underlying trends when using sparser time series data.</p>
<p>We therefore set out to evaluate the performance of the SC approach in such settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> We first evaluated the ability of the SC method to quantify the impact of a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) on all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations at subnational levels (e.g., regions and states) in Brazil. Based on these analyses, we found that the SC approach failed to yield reasonable counterfactual estimates when data became sparse. Therefore, we proposed an alternative approach to obtain more robust estimates of vaccine effects from sparse time series by first extracting smoothed trends from the controls. We evaluated this approach, which we called the &#x201C;STL&#x002B;PCA&#x201D; method (seasonal-trend decomposition plus principal component analysis), using Brazil data and simulated time series data, and compared its performance with those of both the SC approach and a standard time-trend model.</p>

<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Hospitalization data, down-sampled data, and simulated time series data</title>
<p>Three types of data were used in this study: 1) national, regional, and state-level hospitalization data in Brazil, 2) down-sampled data based on the national Brazil data, and 3) simulated time series data. Detailed information on these data are provided in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6a">eAppendix 1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6c">3</xref>, and the key information for each dataset is highlighted here.</p>
<p>We used a national hospital discharge database from Brazil for hospitalizations that occurred between January 2004 and December 2014.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Hospitalizations were categorized using a single International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 code. There are 27 states in the country, which are grouped into five geographic regions: North (seven states), Northeast (nine states), Southeast (four states), South (three states), and Centre-West (four states). Children under 12 months of age and adults 80&#x002B; years of age were included in the analyses for contrast because previous studies of national-level data for Brazil demonstrated clear benefits of PCV10 in the infants but no benefit in the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Moreover, there was a strong increasing secular trend in pneumonia hospitalizations among older adults but not among young children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">eFigure 1</xref>). These different characteristics provided an opportunity to evaluate the model performance when there was no effect or a significant effect of the vaccine and with the presence of or absence of longterm trends in the time series.</p>
<p>To investigate how the performance of various models changes depending on the number of cases per unit time, we performed down sampling analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> This approach is used to simulate how the national-level time series would behave had they been drawn from a smaller population. For example, the national population in Brazil is about 200 million, but down sampling analysis allows us to simulate a time series of a theoretical population of 20 million (i.e., down-sampling rate 10&#x0025;) or 2 million (i.e., down-sampling rate 1&#x0025;). Methods are described in detail in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6b">eAppendix 2</xref>. In short, we randomly subsampled the time series of ICD10 chapters from the national-level data, using the binomial distribution with the rates of 10&#x0025;, 5&#x0025;, 1&#x0025;, and 0.25&#x0025;, to simulate the population sizes of different regions and states in Brazil. This sampling process was repeated 100 times for each rate.</p>
<p>We also used simulated monthly time series data, which included an outcome and four control diseases, to demonstrate the performance of various models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">eFigure 2</xref>). The length of time series was 120 months, and a &#x201C;vaccine-associated&#x201D; decline was introduced starting in month 85. There was a gradual 20&#x0025; decline in the number of cases in the outcome that occurred between month 85 and the end of the time series. Both the outcome and control diseases were given an annual seasonality with different amplitude and peak timing, and the time series had a u-shaped curve that (by design) could not be captured by a standard linear trend adjustment. One of the four control diseases was a &#x201C;perfect&#x201D; control (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">eFigure 2</xref>), which means that the underlying model that generates the mean for the control is the same as the outcome, except the simulated vaccine effect is set to 0. To evaluate how the performance of the statistical models changes depending on the number of cases per unit time, we manipulated the average number of cases for the outcome at the first time point (i.e., intercept) to be roughly 8000 (100&#x0025;), 800 (10&#x0025;), 80 (1&#x0025;), and 20 (0.25&#x0025;). For each of these sample sizes, we simulated 100 time series data.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Synthetic control (SC) model</title>
<p>The SC method has been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> The main outcome was the number of hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia (ICD10 code: J12&#x2013;J18). The covariates (control diseases) were disease categories based on groupings of ICD10 chapters, including both infectious and non-infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">eTable 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Key assumptions that these control diseases need to satisfy to be valid are 1) they were not affected by PCV10 and 2) relationships between the outcome and control diseases would not change over time had PCV10 not been introduced. We therefore excluded respiratory diseases except for bronchitis/bronchiolitis (J20&#x2013;J22) and disease categories that could potentially be influenced by PCV10.</p>
<p>The SC model was fit to monthly data from the pre-PCV10 period (2004&#x2013;2009) and used to generate a counterfactual prediction for the post-PCV10 period (2010&#x2013;2014). Further information can be found in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6d">eAppendix 4</xref> while full details on the SC method are provided in Brodersen, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> We used the bsts and CausalImpact packages in R version 3.4.3 (Vienne, Austria) for model fitting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>STL&#x002B;PCA model</title>
<p>To address issues of sparsity in the control variables, we propose an alternative approach, &#x201C;STL&#x002B;PCA&#x201D; model, where we first extract a long-term trend for each control variable, obtain a &#x201C;composite&#x201D; of these trends, and use this composite trend to adjust pneumonia rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">eFigure 3</xref>). The first step of the STL&#x002B;PCA method is to extract smoothed trends from the time series of each of the control diseases using the seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (STL method).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> The span of the locally weighted scatterplot window can be adjusted to control the smoothness of extracted trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">eFigure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6e">eAppendix 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The second step is to obtain a &#x201C;composite&#x201D; trend among extracted trends for control diseases and to reduce the dimensionality of the total set of trends for control time series. To do so, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) with extracted trends.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> The first principal component &#x201C;PC1&#x201D; is a linear combination of extracted trends for control diseases with maximum variance, which accounted for about 75&#x2013;90&#x0025; of the total variance in the extracted trends for all control diseases.</p>
<p>In the third and final step, we use PC1 as a covariate in a regression model for the prevaccine data and to generate the counterfactual for the post-vaccine period. We only included PC1 in the model, because PC1 explained most of the variance (75&#x2013;90&#x0025;) and the rest of the principal components were just capturing the remaining noise. More information can be found in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6e">eAppendix 5</xref>. We validated the STL&#x002B;PCA model by performing a cross validation analysis with the pre-vaccine data (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6h">eAppendix 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Evaluation of the impact of vaccine</title>
<p>Each of the models was fit to pneumonia time series from the pre-vaccine data to establish a relationship between pneumonia and the covariates. We then estimated the number of pneumonia cases that would have occurred without vaccination in the post vaccine era (i.e., counterfactual), assuming that the relationships between the outcome and covariates were consistent. We calculated the rate ratio (RR) of the observed to the counterfactual pneumonia hospitalizations during the evaluation period, which was 2013&#x2013;2014 for the Brazil data (i.e., 36&#x2013;60 months following the introduction of PCV10) and the last two years for the simulated time series data (i.e., 12&#x2013;36 months after the simulated introduction of the vaccine). Posterior medians and 2.5<sup>th</sup> and 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles were reported as point estimates and 95&#x0025; credible intervals (CIs) of RR, respectively.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Performance of the models with national, regional, and state-level data from Brazil</title>
<p>The time series for all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations among children under 12 months of age in Brazil showed strong seasonality with peaks occurring in the winter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">eFigure 1A</xref>). All models (the SC, time-trend, and STL&#x002B;PCA model) detected a significant decline in the number of pneumonia hospitalizations after the introduction of PCV10 in 2010 at the national level in this age group. National-level estimates of RR were 0.72 (95&#x0025; CI: 0.67, 0.77) by the SC model, 0.85 (95&#x0025; CI: 0.73, 0.99) by the time-trend model, and 0.83 (95&#x0025; CI: 0.71, 0.96) by the STL&#x002B;PCA model. Similarly, all models estimated significant declines in most of the regions and states in this age group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C, and E</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Time series data for the older age group showed a complex pattern; all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations, as well as some control diseases, began to increase several years prior to the introduction of PCV10 and continued to increase until the end of the study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">eFigure 1B</xref>). At the national level, all models adjusted for this unexplained long-term increasing trend and found no statistically significant effect of PCV10. Estimated national-level RRs were 0.95 (95&#x0025; CI: 0.82, 1.12) by the SC model, 1.06 (95&#x0025; CI: 0.90, 1.23) by the time-trend model, and 1.02 (95&#x0025; CI: 0.88, 1.18) by the STL&#x002B;PCA model. Repeating this analysis for the elderly at the state level, however, the SC model generated RRs that were significantly greater than one in 12 (46&#x0025;) states, which is not epidemiologically plausible. Most of these states were found to have relatively few pneumonia hospitalizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A mean squared error (MSE, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6g">eAppendix 7</xref>) of state-level RRs compared to the national estimate was 0.148 by the SC model. State-level RRs estimated by the time-trend and STL&#x002B;PCA model were less biased, resulting in smaller MSEs (0.073 for the time-trend model and 0.076 for the STL&#x002B; PCA model). The number of states with RRs greater than one decreased to 7 (28&#x0025;) and 8 (32&#x0025;) states by the time-trend and STL&#x002B;PCA model, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Performance of the models with down-sampled Brazil data</title>
<p>To further examine the effect of smaller sample size on the accuracy of the estimates from these models while setting aside complicated factors affecting real-world data, we conducted a down sampling analysis of the national time series from Brazil. For adults age 80&#x002B; years, estimated RRs generated by the SC model rapidly diverged from the national estimate (the &#x201C;ground truth&#x201D;), as we sampled successively fewer cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As a result, MSE increased exponentially as the data became sparse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>With the national data for the elderly, the SC model selected three control diseases on average (range: one to nine control diseases). However, when the down-sampling rate was 0.25&#x0025;, the SC model did not select any control diseases in the final model in 47 of the 100 downsampled datasets (i.e., model only had an intercept and seasonal terms), only one control disease in 49 datasets, and two control diseases in the remaining four datasets. These results demonstrate that the SC model failed to identify an appropriate set of control diseases and thus failed to adjust for unmeasured confounding in the datasets down-sampled to resemble the smaller states. In contrast, the time-trend and STL&#x002B;PCA method successfully adjusted for a long-term increasing trend and corrected the bias even when the data became sparse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). MSEs remained small across all down-sampling rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>For children less than 12 months of age, where there was no strong secular trend, performance of all three models was not dramatically affected by sample size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">eFigure 5</xref>). MSEs remained small for all models, regardless of the down-sampling rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">eFigure 6</xref>). However, the average number of control diseases selected in the SC model was zero in 88 out of 100 downsampled datasets when the down-sampling rate was 0.25&#x0025;.</p>

<p>First, we fit a model with a single predictor, the &#x201C;perfect&#x201D; control, which had the exact same trend as the outcome during the pre-vaccine period, and tested whether this model was able to recover the true impact of the vaccine (RR&#x003D;0.8) in the simulated data. Because of this ideal, but not realistic, relationship between the outcome and the predictor, this model was expected to generate the best possible counterfactual. RRs yielded by this model tightly lined up around the true value, even when the data became sparse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we fit the model which included three controls, but not the perfect control, as predictors (&#x201C;Unsmoothed control model&#x201D; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">eFigure 7</xref>). This model failed to converge when the data size was large, because of a strong collinearity among those controls. As the data became sparse, estimated RRs moved away from the null and became significantly greater than the true RR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The traditional time-trend model could not capture the u-shaped trend, as expected, and estimated RRs did not cover the true value regardless of sample size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>The STL&#x002B;PCA model successfully recovered the true RR, even when the number of cases became smaller. Although point estimates of RR started to diverge gradually as data became sparse, 90&#x0025; and 81&#x0025; of the estimated RRs covered the true RR in their 95&#x0025; CIs when the data size was 1&#x0025; and 0.25&#x0025;, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). MSEs remained small regardless of the number of cases per unit time and were comparable to those for the perfect control model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">eFigure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Our analyses showed that when evaluating the effects of vaccines on rates of disease using time series data, the SC model was able to successfully adjust for underlying trends in the data when the control variables had relatively little noise. However, the SC model may not be able to do so when the time series are sparse. As a result, the SC model may fail to adjust for unmeasured confounding and may generate biased estimates of the impact of an intervention. These biases tended to become stronger as sample size decreased. This was particularly a problem when there was a strong secular trend, as was observed among the elderly in Brazil. As a possible solution, we decomposed the control variables and extracted the long-term trend, and then used this long-term trend as the control. This approach led to decreased bias in the estimates of vaccine impact.</p>
<p>When the data did not have a long-term secular trend (i.e., among &#x003C;12 month old children in our study), the sample size did not affect the performance of the SC model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">eFigure 5A</xref>). It should be noted, however, that this is not because the SC model worked well in the young age group. In fact, similar to the old age group, the SC model also failed to select an appropriate set of control diseases in this age group. However, due to the lack of a secular trend, the intercept-only model was able to generate a reasonable counterfactual in this instance. We suspected that the variable selection process in the SC model did not work with the sparse data because the time series data became noisier, and many control diseases had zero cases or only a few cases per unit time in the most heavily down-sampled datasets. To test this hypothesis, we introduced the national-level control diseases in the SC model in addition to the down-sampled control diseases. This process helped the SC model to select an optimal set of control diseases, and as a result, the bias in estimated RRs was successfully corrected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">eFigure 8</xref>). This analysis suggested that the problem of the variable selection may be attributed to the sparse data for control diseases but not the outcome. When data became sparse, there was more measurement error and random variation in the covariates, which biased their coefficients towards zero.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> As a result, the SC model failed to adjust for trends using the sparse control time series.</p>
<p>We proposed the &#x201C;STL&#x002B;PCA&#x201D; model as a possible solution to the problem of data sparsity. The approach involves first extracting trends from the control time series, then using these smoothed trends to adjust pneumonia rates. Using both simulated and real-world data, we demonstrated that the &#x201C;STL&#x002B;PCA&#x201D; approach helps to reduce the impact of sparseness and to decrease bias in the estimates for smaller populations. The first step, STL decomposition, makes it easy to identify a long-term trend in noisy time series for control diseases. The second step, PCA, allows us to find a projection that explains the maximum variability of the outcome (i.e., PC1). Users can then simply fit a regression with PC1 and generate counterfactual for the postvaccine period. Both STL and PCA are widely used and readily available in the major statistical software. Similar to the SC model, users can include all control diseases in this STL&#x002B;PCA model, as long as the chosen controls satisfy the key assumptions (i.e., are not affected by the vaccine and relationships with the outcome would not have changed had the vaccine not introduced). An important disadvantage of the STL&#x002B;PCA model is that it is no longer straightforward to interpret relationships between the outcome and control diseases, as the original time series for each control disease is not directly used as a covariate in the model. That is problematic if users want to understand associations between the outcome and control diseases, but is less of a concern if one&#x2019;s objective is to make a robust counterfactual and quantify the impact of vaccine.</p>
<p>The performance of the STL&#x002B;PCA model was found to be superior to those for the SC model and time-trend model, which was demonstrated by the analysis with the simulated time series data and the down sampling analysis for 80&#x002B; years-old in Brazil. With regard to the state-level data in Brazil, estimates of RR for the elderly generated by the STL&#x002B;PCA model seemed to be quite similar to those generated by the time-trend model. This was because the long-term trend observed in this real-world data showed an almost perfect linear increase, which was successfully captured by both the time index variable and PC1 in those models. However, as demonstrated by the simulated time series data, the time-trend model does not work well when the long-term trend is not perfectly linear, suggesting that the STL&#x002B;PCA model is more flexible than the time-trend model.</p>
<p>One might argue that the Bayesian variable selection process should be allowed to choose a few appropriate control disease trends to be included in the regression model, instead of performing PCA and finding the &#x201C;composite&#x201D; of the trends. However, the model did not converge due to the strong collinearity among extracted trends, which made it difficult to use the Bayesian variable selection. One might also argue that we should omit the STL step and perform PCA with original time series for control diseases. This approach, however, did not generate a reliable counterfactual when the original data were noisier. We found that the STL step, which allowed us to isolate long-term trends from seasonality and the remainder component was a key step to generate a robust counterfactual for sparse and noisy time series from small populations.</p>
<p>Another possible way to reduce the impact of sparseness is to aggregate monthly data into quarterly data and fit the SC model. This simple process increases the number of observations per unit time, thereby allowing the SC model to create an optimal composite of control diseases. This approach worked well with the Brazil data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">eFigure 9</xref>). However, it may not be a good solution when the pre-vaccine data are limited. Using lower resolution time series reduces the number of data points, which makes it difficult to establish relationships between the outcome and the synthetic control. Alternative approaches could involve using a latent variable model to explicitly model the observation process, using a spatial model to borrow statistical information between adjoining localities or using model stacking approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the STL&#x002B;PCA method could be an effective tool to infer the causal impact of vaccines and other public health interventions, and works well with sparse data. This STL&#x002B;PCA model will enable us to quantify the impact of interventions more accurately, especially for small populations, and will allow us to address various public health questions using population health data that are readily available.</p>

<title>Additional information on hospitalization data in Brazil</title>
<p>The national hospital discharge database covers the majority of the national population in Brazil (e.g., 82&#x0025; in 2012).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">1</xref></sup> Diseases were categorized using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 code, and only the primary ICD10 discharge code was consistently available for each hospitalization event. Data from Brazil were selected in this study because it has one of the most comprehensively-collected hospitalization databases in the world and has high geographic resolutions. Brazil also has interesting geographic characteristics, capturing a broad range of income/development levels and climatic zones. There are 27 states and 5 regions in the country, which largely reflect climatic differences, as well as sub-national variations in human development, as based on income, longevity, and education. For the senior age group, two states in the North region were dropped from analysis, because ICD10 chapters included in the model had fewer than 10 cases/month on average in the study period. Therefore, 27 states were included in analysis for the young age group, while the old age group had 25 states. Preprocessing of the hospitalization data, such as an adjustment for the rapid shift in the number of hospitalizations due to the change in coding practice in 2008, was done as described in our previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>To assess how the number of events in a time series may affect predictions from various quantitative models, we performed a down sampling analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">4</xref></sup> From the national-level data, we randomly subsampled the time series of ICD10 chapters, including all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations, using binomial distribution with various rates such that

where <italic>Observed&#x005F;cases<sub>i,t</sub></italic> was the actual number of hospitalizations for disease <italic>i</italic> reported in time period <italic>t</italic> at the national-level. Cases were randomly sampled at rates of 10&#x0025;, 1&#x0025;, and 0.25&#x0025;, to simulate the population sizes of different regions and states in Brazil. For example, the population sizes of the five regions were between 5&#x0025; and 48&#x0025; of the entire national population of infants and seniors. At the state level, the smallest state represented only 0.3&#x0025; (State 14 in the North region; n&#x003D;10,500) for children under 12 months of age and 0.2&#x0025; (State 12 in the North region; n&#x003D;5,900) of people 80&#x002B; years of age across Brazil.</p>
<p>We repeated this sampling process 100 times and created 100 down-sampled datasets at each of these rates. We then fit the models to each of these down-sampled datasets and quantified the impact of the vaccine. To evaluate the effect of sample size on the performance of the models, the estimated impact of the vaccine from the down-sampled data were compared to those from the national-level data, assuming the national estimate was the &#x201C;ground truth.&#x201D;</p>

The regression coefficients, <italic>&#x03B2;<sub>j</sub></italic>(<italic>&#x03B4;<sub>j</sub></italic>) for control disease <italic>j</italic>, are not time varying, because we assume that the relationships between the outcome and control diseases are constant over time. Time series for the outcome and control diseases were log-transformed prior to being used in the model in order to alleviate the effects of epidemics on the long-term trend and to more closely resemble normality assumed in the model. As a continuity correction, 0.5 was added to all data points. The 2009 influenza pandemic was adjusted for by including dummy variables for the months in which the pandemic peaked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Additional information on the STL&#x002B;PCA model</title>
<p>The seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (STL method) decomposes time series into three components: trend, seasonality, and the remaining variation in data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">11</xref></sup> The observed number of control disease <italic>j</italic> cases in month <italic>t</italic>, denoted by <italic>ControlDisease<sub>jt</sub></italic>, can be written as follows:

</alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>T<sub>jt</sub></italic>, <italic>S<sub>jt</sub></italic>, and <italic>R<sub>jt</sub></italic> are the trend component, annual seasonal component, and remainder component, respectively. For the STL trend extraction, the span of the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) window can be changed to control the smoothness of the extracted trends. The larger the LOESS window is, the smoother the extracted trends are (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">eFigure 4</xref>). We set it to be 5, 25, and 59 months, and selected the optimal size using the deviance information criterion (DIC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">12</xref></sup> The model with the optimal window size was then used to generate the counterfactual for the post-vaccine period and to quantify the impact of vaccine.</p>
<p>The principal component analysis (PCA) allows us to create new uncorrelated projections that explain the maximum variability in the data overall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">16</xref></sup> PCA was applied to the trends for control diseases extracted by the STL method. Extracted trends were first converted into standard deviation units (Z scores) by subtracting off the mean of each variable and dividing by its standard deviation, as the variables included in PCA need to have the same scale. PCA involved an <italic>n</italic>&#x00D7;<italic>p</italic> matrix, <italic>X</italic>, where <italic>p</italic> represents the number of control diseases and <italic>n</italic> represented the total number of time points. The <italic>j</italic>th column of matrix <italic>X, x<sub>j</sub></italic>, represents the time series of a scaled extracted trend for control disease <italic>j</italic>. We then find a linear combination of these extracted trends (i.e., columns of matrix <italic>X</italic>) with maximum variance, which are given by

<p>We have performed cross validation using the down-sampled pre-vaccine data with the rate 0.25&#x0025; for the elderly in Brazil. We trained our model using four years of pre-vaccine data (2004&#x2013;2007) and generated prediction for 2008. Although it was part of the pre-vaccine period, we avoided using the 2009 data due to a large 2009 influenza outbreak. The 95&#x0025; credible interval of the rate ratio included one in 97&#x0025; of 100 down-sampled datasets, suggesting that this model successfully predicted the 2008 data.</p>
