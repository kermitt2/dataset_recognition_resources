<abstract>
<p>The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKKs) are upstream activators of CAMK1 and CAMK4 signalling and have important functions in neural development, maintenance and signalling, as well as in other aspects of biology such as Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> signalling in the cardiovascular system. To support the development of specific inhibitors of CAMKKs we have determined the crystal structure of CAMKK1 with two ATP-competitive inhibitors. The structures reveal small but exploitable differences between CAMKK1 and CAMKK2, despite the high sequence identity, which could be used in the generation of specific inhibitors. Screening of a kinase inhibitor library revealed molecules that bind potently to CAMKK1. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the most potent inhibitors had binding energies largely dependent on favourable enthalpy. Together, the data provide a foundation for future inhibitor development activities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CAMKs) are of great interest due to their important functions in calcium signalling and especially in neuronal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The CAMK family is formed by CAMK1, CAMK2, CAMK3 (eEF2 kinase), CAMK4 and the CAMK kinases (CAMKKs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Each member of the CAMK family is composed of a catalytic protein kinase domain followed by an auto-inhibitory sequence, which is partially overlapped with a calmodulin-binding domain (CBD). The auto-inhibitory sequence keeps the CAMKs in an inactive state until activation by calcium/calmodulin (Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>/CaM). Activation occurs by Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>/CaM binding to the CBD of a CAMK, which releases the auto-inhibitory sequence from the kinase domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>CAMK1, CAMK4 and CAMKKs have a pivotal role in the cascade responsible for Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>/CaM signalling. This cascade is known to be crucial for neuronal maturation and axon elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The CAMKKs are Ser/Thr kinases and the upstream activator kinases of the CaM-stimulated kinase cascade in which activation of CAMK1 and CAMK4 requires phosphorylation at Thr177 and Thr196, respectively, by CAMKKs. There are two CAMKKs, CAMKK1 (CAMKK&#x03B1;) and CAMKK2 (CAMKK&#x03B2;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. There is extensive data supporting the importance of CAMKKs in neurite development, axon elongation, long term potentiation, and long-term memory (LTM), via activation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), which is essential for LTM formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Together the data support the value of investigating the roles of CAMKKs in neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, given the importance of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> signalling in cardiac function it is not surprising that there are important roles for CAMKKs in cardiovascular biology. For example, CAMKK1 was recently discovered to be involved in the regulation of the mesenchymal stem cell secretome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given the partially overlapping roles of CAMKK1 and CAMKK2, the commonality of some substrate proteins (such as CAMK1 and CAMK4) and possibility of cross-regulation of expression levels it is a challenge to assign specific roles to CAMKK1 or CAMKK2. A specific inhibitor of either protein would be a valuable research tool for this purpose. So far, the only available CAMKK inhibitors are not specific for one CAMKK protein or indeed over other human kinases. For example, it has been demonstrated that STO-609<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, the most commonly used inhibitor of CAMKKs, is able to bind to at least seven different kinases with potency similar to CAMKK1 (ERK8, MNK1, AMPK, CK2, DYRK2, DYRK3, and HIPK2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. To aid the development of CAMKK1-or CAMKK2-specific inhibitors we have screened a library of kinase inhibitors against CAMKK1 and determined the X-ray crystal structure of CAMKK1 kinase domain in complex with two different inhibitors. Despite the high sequence similarity between CAMKK1 and CAMKK2 (70&#x0025; over the kinase domain), comparison of the inhibitor-bound CAMKK1 structures with the existing structures of CAMKK2 reveal small but exploitable differences between the ATP-binding sites that might be used for the future design of specific inhibitors.</p>

<title>Identification of kinase inhibitors that are potent inhibitors of CAMKK1</title>
<p>Highly pure CAMKK1 kinase domain protein (residues Gln124-Lys411, hereafter called CAMKK1-KD) was successfully produced using an <italic>E. coli</italic> expression system. This protein was used to screen a library of 378 kinase inhibitors, which identified 86 molecules that bound to CAMKK1 causing a change in protein melting temperature (&#x0394;T<sub>m</sub>) of greater than 2 &#x00B0;C (see full list in Supplementary Information). Previously, two large scale kinase screening efforts published by Davis <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and Anastassiadis <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> included 9 and 6 (respectively) out of the 86 inhibitors identified here. Although there are only 9 inhibitors in common, the dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) values measured by Davis <italic>et al.</italic> nevertheless show a correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 0.52) with the &#x0394;T<sub>m</sub> values (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) allowing us to estimate <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for all of the inhibitors identified in our assay. Approximately, a &#x0394;T<sup>m</sup> of &#x003E; 7 &#x00B0;C corresponds to a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> &#x003C; 100 nM. Binding curves for inhibitors with &#x0394;T<sub>m</sub> of &#x003E; 7 &#x00B0;C are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, and the top 20 most potent inhibitors of CAMKK1 are shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Among the compounds identified as potent inhibitors of CAMKK1 are the ALK/IGF1R inhibitor AZD3463, the PDGFR inhibitors CP-673451, the PDGFR/FLT3 inhibitor Crenolanib, and the SGK inhibitor GSK650394<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> (which we previously also identified as a CAMKK2 inhibitor). The range of different chemotypes identified as potent CAMKK1 inhibitors suggests CAMKK1 as a common off-target of existing kinase inhibitors, and that development of CAMKK1-specific inhibitors will require a design that incorporates CAMKK1-specific structural features.</p>

<title>CAMKK1 has a similar overall structure to CAMKK2</title>
<p>Crystallisation trials of CAMKK1-KD with a selection of the strongest binding inhibitors from the DSF analysis yielded crystals in complex with Crenolanib, AZD3463, AP26113, hesperadin and GSK650394. Crystals were also obtained with STO-609 which is well-known as a CAMKK inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, crystals that diffracted X-rays to high resolution were only obtained with hesperadin and GSK650394. From these crystals it was possible to determine the crystal structure of CAMKK1 to 2.1 &#x00C5; resolution in complex with hesperadin and 2.2 &#x00C5; resolution in complex with GSK650394 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The two crystal structures were in different crystal forms, with two or four CAMKK1 molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final model for the co-crystal structure with hesperadin consists of residues 124-163 and 193-411, one molecule of hesperadin per CAMKK1 monomer and 271 water molecules. The disordered residues from 164-192 that are not visible in the structure are the RP-insert domain, which is implicated in substrate recognition. This RP-insert domain was also disordered in the co-crystal structure with GSK650394.</p>

<p>Overall, the CAMKK1 kinase domain has the expected protein kinase fold with an N-terminal lobe mostly of &#x03B2;-strands connected by a flexible linker (hinge region) to a predominantly &#x03B1;-helical C-terminal lobe (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In both the structures, the inhibitors hesperadin and GSK650394 are bound to the ATP-binding pocket located between the N-lobe and C-lobe. As expected from the relatively high sequence identity to CAMKK2 (70&#x0025; over the kinase domain), the CAMKK1 kinase domain structure can be superimposed with the CAMKK2 kinase domain structure (PDB ID 6BKU) with a low r.m.s.d. of 0.66 &#x00C5; over 261 C&#x03B1; atoms.</p>

<p>CAMK1 and CAMK4 have an &#x03B1;D helix (e.g. <sup>108</sup>LFDRIVEKGF<sup>117</sup> in CAMK1D, PDB: 2JC6) which is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with the calmodulin binding domain during activation of CAMK1 or CAMK4 by Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>/CaM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. This helix may also be involved with binding the RP-insert of CAMKKs during activation of the CAMKs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The positively charged RP-insert from CAMKKs is necessary for selective recognition of the negatively charged &#x03B1;D from CAMK1 and CAMK4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In CAMKK1 (as well as CAMKK2) there is no &#x03B1;D helix (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>); it is replaced by a loop with one proline that is conserved in the CAMKKs (CAMKK1: <sup>235</sup>KG<underline>P</underline>VMEVPCDKPF<sup>247</sup>, CAMKK2: <sup>272</sup>QG<underline>P</underline>VMEVPTLKPL<sup>284</sup>). Therefore the mechanisms by which CAMKKs interact with calmodulin for activation might be different compared to the mechanism of CAMK1 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The calmodulin binding domain in CAMKK1 is at the C-terminus of the protein, comprising the residues <sup>438</sup>VRLIPSWTTVILVKSMLRK<sup>456</sup>, immediately after the auto-inhibitory domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, and was not included in the construct used for crystallisation.</p>

<title>Analysis of inhibitor binding to CAMKK1</title>
<p>In both crystal structures the inhibitors were clearly visible in the electron density and could be convincingly modelled (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The inhibitors bind as expected in the ATP-binding pocket, between the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain. In the structure with GSK650394 the inhibitor is bound in a similar manner to that seen in CAMKK2 (PDB ID 6BKU), with two hydrogen bonds to the kinase hinge region, one to the backbone carbonyl atom of Asp231 and the other to the backbone nitrogen atom of Leu233 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). There is a favourable aromatic &#x03C0;-&#x03C0; interaction between the benzoic acid ring of GSK650394 and the side-chain of Phe230, and a hydrophobic interaction between the phenyl ring of GSK650394 and Pro237 on the hinge. The carboxylic acid of GSK650394 forms a hydrogen bond with the side-chain of Lys157, for a total of three hydrogen bonds in direct interaction with CAMKK1. There is also a hydrogen bond to a water molecule which is bound by the side-chain of the &#x03B1;C residue Glu199 and the backbone nitrogen of Phe294 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). ITC measurements showed that CAMKK1 binds GSK650394 strongly, with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 4 nM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>

<title>The most potent CAMKK1 inhibitors bind due to favourable enthalpy</title>

The data show that all of the tested inhibitors are extremely potent binders of CAMKK1, and furthermore in all cases the binding is heavily enthalpy-dependent.</p>

<title>Two active site differences could allow the design of specific inhibitors</title>
<p>The ATP-binding sites of CAMKK1 and CAMKK2 are highly conserved, which is reflected in the similarity of the inhibitor binding profiles of CAMKK1 and CAMKK2 seen previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Comparison of the CAMKK1 structures to CAMKK2 reveals two possible options for the design of specific inhibitors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The first is that there are differences in the hydrophobic &#x201C;back-pocket&#x201D; region around the kinase regulatory spine (R-spine). In particular, Leu228 in CAMKK1 is Met265 in CAMKK2 and this difference would presumably affect the movement of the R-spine residues in response to inhibitors that disrupt the R-spine, i.e. type II kinase inhibitors. A type II inhibitor would have the potential to gain selectivity between CAMKK1 and CAMKK2 by taking advantage of this and other non-conserved residues outside the ATP-binding pocket itself.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, a more significant difference between CAMKK1 and CAMKK2 is seen in the kinase hinge region (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The hinge residues Leu233, Arg234 and Lys235 are replaced in CAMKK2 by Val270, Asn271 and Gln272. Although none of these amino acid side-chains are directed into the ATP-binding site, these sequence differences cause a significant difference in the conformation of the protein backbone in this region, greater than 1 &#x00C5; difference in position. Especially important is CAMKK1 Leu233, which is larger than the equivalent valine residue in CAMKK2 and to be accommodated in the same space requires the different backbone conformation observed. The differences in the hinge residues Arg234 and Lys235 which interact with the &#x03B2;6-&#x03B2;7 loop are also likely to contribute to the different conformation, especially since the key residue on the &#x03B2;6-&#x03B2;7 loop, Asp285, is also not conserved in CAMKK2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The compound screening data showed that a significant number of kinase inhibitors interact with CAMKK1, despite none of these molecules being originally designed as a CAMKK inhibitor. This suggests that CAMKK1 is an easily inhibited kinase, and given the strength of binding observed, that alteration of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>/CaM signalling may be a significant cause of some of the phenotypes observed with some of these inhibitors. It also suggests that achieving high potency with a newly designed CAMKK1-specific inhibitor will be possible, especially given the relatively high <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>(ATP) previously reported for CAMKK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As the ATP-binding sites of CAMKK1 and CAMKK2 are so similar, for future design of a specific inhibitor there are two possibilities: an allosteric inhibitor, or an inhibitor which can take advantage of the small differences that do exist to achieve specificity. The two different crystal structures of CAMKK1 with different inhibitors show a large difference in the position of helix &#x03B1;C (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, 6D</xref>). In the structure with hesperadin &#x03B1;C is in an inactive &#x03B1;C-out conformation, with a disrupted kinase R-spine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). The R-spine is a set of four residues in kinases that line up to form a hydrophobic spine when a protein kinase is in an active conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Since it appears that hesperadin does not directly push out the &#x03B1;C helix, this indicates flexibility of this region of the protein and therefore that a type II inhibitor (or indeed an allosteric, type III, inhibitor) binding to and disrupting the R-spine would be possible. The inhibitor screening data shows that a number of known type II inhibitors such as ponatinib bind strongly to CAMKK1. Given that there are sequence differences between CAMKK1 and CAMKK2 in this region of the R-spine and &#x03B1;C, this could be a way to achieve selectivity. Finally, the significant differences in the conformation of the C-terminal part of the kinase hinge region (residues Arg234-Gly236, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) could be exploited by suitably-designed type I kinase inhibitors.</p>

<title>Protein expression and purification</title>
<p>CAMKK1-Q124-K411 (CAMKK1-KD) in pNIC28-Bsa4 was transformed into chemically competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3)-R3 cells that co-express &#x03BB;-phosphatase and three rare tRNAs (plasmid pACYC-LIC&#x002B;). Colonies were used to inoculate 50 mL of LB media supplemented with 5 mM betaine, 50 &#x00B5;g/mL kanamycin and 35 &#x00B5;g/mL chloramphenicol which was left shaking at 37 &#x00B0;C overnight. This culture was used to inoculate 1.5 L of Terrific Broth containing 50 &#x00B5;g/mL kanamycin at 37 &#x00B0;C until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached 3. The culture was cooled to 18 &#x00B0;C, 0.2 mM of Isopropyl &#x03B2;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added, and left overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 7,500 &#x00D7; g at room temperature. The cell pellet was weighed and resuspended in the same volume of 2&#x00D7; binding buffer (1&#x00D7; binding buffer was 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10&#x0025; glycerol, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) with protease inhibitors set II (Calbiochem) at 1:200 ratio) and frozen at -80 &#x00B0;C until use.</p>
<p>For purification, the cell pellet was thawed and sonicated on ice. Polyethyleneimine (pH 7.5) was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.15&#x0025; (w/v) and the sample was centrifuged at 53,000 &#x00D7; g for 45 min at 4 &#x00B0;C. The supernatant was loaded onto an IMAC column (5 mL HisTrap FF Crude) and washed in binding buffer containing 30 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted with elution buffer (binding buffer with 300 mM imidazole). To remove the 6xHis-tag, the protein was incubated with TEV protease during dialysis overnight at 4 &#x00BA;C into gel filtration buffer (20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 5&#x0025; glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, 5&#x0025; [v/v] glycerol). Protein was further purified using reverse affinity chromatography on Ni-Sepharose followed by gel filtration (Superdex 200 16/60, GE Healthcare). Protein in gel filtration buffer was concentrated to 10.4 mg/mL (measured by UV absorbance with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) using the calculated molecular weight and estimated extinction coefficient) using 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off centrifugal concentrators (Millipore) at 4 &#x00B0;C.</p>

<p>CAMKK1-KD protein was screened against a library of 378 structurally diverse and cell-permeable ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors available from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, United States; catalog No. L1200). DSF measurements were made in a 384-well plate. Each well contained 20 &#x03BC;L of 1 &#x03BC;M kinase in 100 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10&#x0025; glycerol and the Applied Biosystems Protein Thermal Shift dye at the recommended concentration of 1:1000.</p>
<p>The compounds, previously solubilized in DMSO, were used at 10 &#x00B5;M final concentration and 0.1&#x0025; DMSO. Plates were sealed using optically clear films and transferred to a QuantStudio 6 qPCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). The fluorescence intensity was measured during a temperature gradient from 25 to 95 &#x00BA;C at a constant rate of 0.05 &#x00B0;C/s and protein melting temperatures were calculated based on a Boltzmann function fitting to experimental data, as implemented in the Protein Thermal Shift Software (Applied Biosystems). Protein in 0.1&#x0025; DMSO was used as a reference.

<p>For crystallization, inhibitors previously identified were added to purified CAMKK1-KD at a threefold molar excess and the samples were incubated on ice for one hour. Initially, 40 &#x03BC;L of purified protein at 10.4 mg/mL was diluted in 360 &#x03BC;L of gel filtration buffer, passed to a fresh 1.5 mL tube containing 5.8 &#x03BC;L of the inhibitor (10 mM in DMSO), and incubated for one hour.
