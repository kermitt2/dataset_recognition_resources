<title>Summary</title>
<p>The marsupial Tasmanian devil (<italic>Sarcophilus harrisii</italic>) faces extinction due to transmissible devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). To unveil the molecular underpinnings of DFTD, we designed an approach that combines sensitivity to drugs with an integrated systems-biology characterization. Sensitivity to inhibitors of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases correlated with their overexpression, suggesting a causative link. Proteomic and DNA methylation analyses revealed tumor-specific signatures linked to oncogenic signaling hubs including evolutionary conserved STAT3. Indeed, ERBB inhibition blocked phosphorylation of STAT3 and arrested cancer cells. Pharmacological blockade of ERBB signaling prevented tumor growth in a xenograft model and resulted in recovery of MHC class I gene expression. This link between the hyperactive ERBB-STAT3 axis and MHC class I mediated tumor immunosurveillance provides mechanistic insights into horizontal transmissibility and led us to the proposition of a dual chemo-immunotherapeutic strategy to save Tasmanian devils from DFTD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer cells do not usually transmit between individuals. No human examples of transmissible cancers are known apart from rare iatrogenic cases during surgery and transplantation or materno-fetal transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Isoda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Metzger and Goff, 2016</xref>). Accordingly, horizontal transmission is not considered a hallmark of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Yet, at least six species in the animal kingdom harbor clonal cancers which spread horizontally within populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Metzger and Goff, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ostrander et al., 2016</xref>). These diseases include the fatal devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) in Tasmanian devils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Murchison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Murchison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pearse and Swift, 2006</xref>), a sexually transmitted sarcoma in dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Murchison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Murgia et al., 2006</xref>), and leukemia-like cancers in mollusks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>). Genetic studies provided invaluable insights into these unusual cancers but the molecular underpinnings of malignancy and transmissibility remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>DFTD is an allogeneic graft of Schwann cell origin, which is transmitted by direct transfer of living cancer cells from one individual to another as a result of biting behavior during feeding or mating interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Murchison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pearse and Swift, 2006</xref>). Diseased devils succumb to the disease within months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Loh et al., 2006</xref>), rendering DFTD a serious threat to the survival of the population of the largest living marsupial carnivore. Several mechanisms are thought to confer the tumor cells with the property of being successfully transmitted between individual Tasmanian devils, including the lack of rejection due to the low expression levels of MHC class I genes and diminished genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Siddle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Siddle et al., 2013</xref>). Despite recent efforts vaccines and treatments showed limited success against DFTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kreiss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tovar et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we undertook an integrative systems biology approach combining pharmacological drug screening, transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics and comparative pathology to unveil aberrant signaling pathways in DFTD. Specifically, we identified a critical role for persistent ERBB activation and signaling through STAT3, whose pharmacological inhibition resulted in arrested growth of DFTD cells and conferred protection in a tumor xenograft model. Blockade of the hyperactive ERBB-STAT3 axis led to recovery of MHC class I gene expression, suggesting a mechanistic link to transmissibility and rationalizing a therapeutic avenue to treat transmissible cancer in devils.</p>

<title>ERBB-specific vulnerability of DFTD identified by pharmacological screening</title>
<p>To identify potential pharmacological vulnerabilities of DFTD, we performed a cell viability screen with over 2500 selected compounds against four DFTD and one fibroblast cell lines of Tasmanian devil origin on an automated high-throughput screening platform (<bold>Table S1A</bold>, see Supplementary Materials). 69 compounds killed at least one out of four DFTD cell lines but did not affect the viability of fibroblasts, as measured by intracellular ATP levels (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S2</bold>). Interestingly, this unbiased approach yielded a substantial enrichment of tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the ERBB receptors (29/69; 42&#x0025;) including Lapatinib, Erlotinib and Sapitinib (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S2</bold>). Additional compound targets included histone deacetylases (HDAC), BET bromodomains and other potential therapeutic targets (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S2</bold>). The human ERBB family has four members (EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hynes and Lane, 2005</xref>), of which the devil genome has all orthologs annotated except ERBB4. Interestingly, DFTD cells expressed higher transcript levels of <italic>ERBB2</italic> and <italic>ERBB3</italic> while <italic>EGFR</italic> was barely detectable (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>) compared to fibroblasts. To validate this finding on the protein level, we tested antibodies with cross-species recognition (<bold>Table S3</bold>). Western blot analysis confirmed increased levels of total ERBB2 and ERBB3 in DFTD cell lines compared with fibroblasts (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). The phosphorylated residues Y1221/1222 (ERBB2) and Y1289 (ERRB3) are conserved across species (<bold>Table S3</bold>), highlighting the evolutionary impact of tyrosine kinase signaling in cancer cells. Phospho-site specific antibodies provided evidence for persistent activation of ERBB2 and ERBB3 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). These results were corroborated by detection of increased expression of ERBB2 and ERBB3 in primary tumor biopsies of diseased Tasmanian devils, with tumor cells identified by the DFTD diagnostic marker Periaxin (PRX) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Murchison et al., 2010</xref>). Together, this data indicates that DFTD cells express high levels of phosphorylated ERBB2 and ERBB3 that render them exquisitely vulnerable to ERBB kinase inhibitors.</p>

<title>Characterization of DFTD by integrated proteomic and DNA methylation analysis</title>
<p>To unravel the involved signaling cascades in DFTD, we investigated global changes in protein abundance in primary biopsies of diseased devils by mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. This unbiased approach included DFTD tissue and paired healthy biopsies from skin and spleen from four Tasmanian devils from different geographical locations as well as nerve tissue and one DFTD cell line (<bold>Table S1B</bold>). Overall we identified 6672 unique proteins across all samples searched against a Uniprot reference library of the devil (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S4A</bold>). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 3894 proteins quantified in all samples distinguished the replicates according to the tissue of origin, with the first principal component (PC1) accounting for 41.1&#x0025; of the inter-sample variability differentiating tumor from healthy samples (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). Upon differential analysis of tumor vs. healthy tissues we defined a tumor-modulated signature of 987 proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S4A</bold>). Among the most prominent proteins overexpressed in tumor tissue we identified the oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 and the STAT3 target gene Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Xie et al., 2004</xref>). Tumor tissue also expressed high levels of the chromatin factors HDAC5 and TRIM28, which regulates STAT3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tsuruma et al., 2008</xref>), and low expression of the tumor suppressor PTGIS (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Further, we found high expression levels of the putative ERBB ligand epithelial growth factor like domain multiple 8 (EGFL8) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>In complementation to the proteomic characterization we mapped DNA methylation by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to depict the landscape of epigenetic regulation in the aforementioned samples of primary biopsies from Tasmanian devils. DNA methylation marks readily distinguished tumor and healthy tissue and identified tumor-specific methylation signatures and their putative transcription factor binding sites (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>). Differential analysis of tumor versus healthy biopsies highlighted 166 candidate genes with different DNA methylation levels in their promoters (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S5</bold>), which included the tumor-specific hypomethylated <italic>EGFL8</italic> promoter as well as hypermethylated promoters of <italic>Estrogen Receptor 1</italic> (<italic>ESR1</italic>), <italic>PTGIS</italic> and the transcription factor <italic>GATA3</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). An integrative network analysis of the identified drug vulnerabilities, protein and methylation signatures revealed a high connectivity in the molecular wiring of DFTD (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>). This suggested a critical involvement of central oncoprotein hubs consisting of STAT3, TRIM28 and others, which may be triggered by ERBB kinase action.</p>

<title>Molecular dissection of ERBB-STAT3 axis in DFTD</title>
<p>The proteomic tumor signatures revealed increased levels of STAT3, which can become activated by ERBB receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, as well as an enrichment of STAT3 target genes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D-F</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S4C</bold>). Due to the central roles of STAT3 in cancer and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Villarino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yu et al., 2014</xref>) and the highly conserved amino acid sequences of STAT3 between <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>S. harrisii</italic> (99.09&#x0025;), we investigated the levels of expression and activation of STAT3 by Western blot. STAT3 is activated by phosphorylation of residues Y705 and S727. We, thus, tested antibodies specific to these phosphorylated residues of STAT3 and found highly increased STAT3 phosphorylation of both residues in DFTD tumor cells compared to fibroblasts (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S3</bold>). Interestingly, we also found a robust up-regulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation compared to fibroblasts (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref></bold>), indicating increased tyrosine kinase signaling. ERBB family members activate RAS-RAF-MAPK/ERK, which in turn phosphorylates STAT3 at S727 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chung et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, we detected increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in DFTD tumor cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). STAT3 phosphorylation was corroborated by immunohistochemical stainings in primary tumor biopsies (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). Further, treatment with the covalent STAT3-specific SH2-domain inhibitor PG-S3-009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Garg et al., 2017</xref>) resulted in DFTD cell-specific killing (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>) and led to reduced expression of ERBB2 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>). Intriguingly, treatment with the ERBB inhibitors Lapatinib and Sapitinib inhibited serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref></bold>), providing further support for a hyperactivated ERBB-STAT3 axis in DFTD pathogenesis.</p>

Further expression analysis of ERBB-related genes identified increased expression of the positive regulators ERBIN and CPNE3 while the negative regulators EREG and PTPN12 were expressed at lower levels (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S7</bold>). Moreover, DFTD tumors and cells expressed elevated levels of the ERBB ligands EGF, HBEGF and NRG1 (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S7</bold>). This included increased amounts of transcripts and protein of EGFL8 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A-B</xref></bold> and <bold>Table S4A</bold>), with its promoter being significantly hypomethylated in primary tumor tissues (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S5</bold>). Notably, we also found abolished expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in DFTD tumor cells (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C-D</xref></bold>), a known inhibitor of STAT3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Song and Shuai, 1998</xref>). In summary, our results suggest that DFTD tumor cells exhibit an ERBB-dependent constitutive activation of STAT3 in a positive feed-forward loop.</p>

<title>Hyperactivated ERBB-STAT3 reduces expression of MHC class I related genes</title>
<p>Transmissibility of DFTD has been linked to reduced expression of MHC class I genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Siddle and Kaufman, 2013</xref>), which prompted us to assess a potential link between hyperactive ERBB-STAT3 and MHC class I gene expression. To this end we stimulated DFTD tumor cells with recombinant autologous interferon (rIFN&#x03B3;). This induced the expression of <italic>b2-microglobulin</italic> (<italic>B2M</italic>) and <italic>MHC-I</italic> as shown previously (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Siddle and Kaufman, 2013</xref>). Importantly, concomitant treatment with the ERBB-inhibitor Sapitinib amplified increased expression of <italic>B2M</italic> and <italic>MHC-I</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref>, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref></bold>).

Thus, we hypothesized that high levels of STAT3 may interfere with STAT1 transcriptional regulation. Indeed, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation confirmed physical interaction between STAT3 and STAT1 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To test the effects of ERBB inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>, we transplanted DFTD cells subcutaneously into the flanks of NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice and treated them with 50 mg/kg Sapitinib or vehicle as control. DFTD xenografts in the control group proliferated rapidly after transplantation while treatment with Sapitinib effectively stalled tumor growth (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref></bold>). No drug toxicity was observed as assessed by the serum concentration of the liver transaminases alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase and the kidney parameter blood urea nitrogen (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A-C</xref></bold>) and by histopathology (<bold><xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7D</xref></bold>).

Together, this suggests that the ERBB-STAT3 axis drives cancer cell growth and facilitates tumor immune evasion through suppression of MHC class I gene expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ERBB signalling is influenced by ligand-induced activation and triggers downstream processes such as context-dependent activation of transcriptional regulators including members of the activator protein-1 family (AP-1, also <italic>bona fide</italic> STAT3 targets), ETS, and STAT3/5 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lemmon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Schneider and Yarden, 2016</xref>). ERBB family members themselves are frequently overexpressed, amplified or mutated in human solid cancers and are targets of clinical therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Appert-Collin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bae and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Roskoski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yarden and Pines, 2012</xref>). In Schwann cells, ERBB2/3 signalling regulates expansion and migration of progenitor cells as well as different functions in myelination and repair of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Corfas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Newbern and Birchmeier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Stassart et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we found increased expression of proteins associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in DFTD tumors which are also upregulated in Schwann cells upon nerve injury to support axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ferguson and Muir, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Weiss et al., 2016</xref>). This included the EMT-inducing zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox factor (ZEB2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Comijn et al., 2001</xref>) and the STAT3 target MMP2 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>), which enhances the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and cancer cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nistico et al., 2012</xref>). The regenerative properties of Schwann cells are highly linked to their plasticity whereby upon nerve injury, they reversibly de-differentiate, acquire high motility and guide the growth of the damaged axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the identification of hyperactivated ERBB-STAT3 signalling in DFTD may suggest aberrant regulation of the Schwann cell-intrinsic repair program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2017</xref>). Of note, an independently arisen second clonal transmissible tumor has been described in Tasmanian devils, which is pathologically similar but stains negative for the Schwann cell marker PRX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pye et al., 2016</xref>). It will be interesting to investigate the involvement of similar driver tyrosine kinase-STAT3 pathways blocking MHC class I.</p>
<p>A major enigmatic question of DFTD concerns the molecular properties that are required for transmission between individuals to explain the lack of rejection. Changes in MHC class I expression and diversity have been described in transmissible tumors of both devils and dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Belov, 2011</xref>). Of note, recent immunotherapy trials with MHC-induced DFTD cells showed immunogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tovar et al., 2017</xref>). Our data indicate that targeting of the hyperactivated ERBB-STAT3 axis re-establishes the expression of MHC class I, thus facilitating MHC-mediated tumor immunosurveillance in Tasmanian devils (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>). Promoters of interferon-stimulated MHC class I related genes are targets for STAT1, while STAT3 is known to interfere with transcription by sequestering STAT1 in the cytoplasm through heterodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Friedrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nivarthi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stancato et al., 1996</xref>). We hypothesize that the endogenous tonic interferon-STAT-MHC class I axis in DFTD is disrupted due to high STAT3 action promoting cancer cell proliferation, survival and invasion. These findings may bear relevance for other transmissible cancers in higher organisms including dogs, whose transmissible tumor lacks B2M and shows low MHC class I surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cohen et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Murgia et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Working model for the impact of the ERBB-STAT3 axis in Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD)</title>
<p>Aggressive social interactions in the highly inbred population of Tasmanian devils enabled the rapid spread of devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) with fatal consequences. At the molecular level, this study provides evidence that hyperactivation of the ERBB receptor tyrosine kinases, possibly through elevated expression levels of ERBB ligands, and its downstream signal transducer and transcription factor STAT3 are central oncogenic properties of DFTD. STAT3 activates ERBB in a positive feed-forward loop and induces the expression of metastasis genes such as MMP2 and ZEB2. Further, the hyperactive ERBB-STAT3 axis suppresses the expression of MHC class I genes, which is expected to contribute to immune evasion and the known lack of tumor rejection upon horizontal transmission. We hypothesize that high abundance of phosphorylated STAT3 leads to incorporation of unphosphorylated STAT1 in heterodimers with STAT3, thereby preventing the transcriptional regulation of STAT1 downstream target genes such as B2M and MHC class I.</p></caption>

<p>We wish to acknowledge that molecular investigations of non-model organisms can be notoriously hampered by imperfect genome annotations, orthology inferences and lack of reagents. In this study we addressed this by an integrative and unbiased systems biology approach of pharmacological screens, proteomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics. In addition, we complemented this by comparative pathology for which we exploited the high degree of conservation of key oncoproteins driving human cancer cross-validating a similar driver oncogene scenario in devils.</p>
<p>Our data indicate a positive feedback loop between ERBB receptor tyrosine kinases and STAT3 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-E</xref></bold>). The underlying mechanism of maintained STAT3 activation and the apparent lack of negative regulation requires further investigation. Mutually not exclusive, the involved processes may include recently detected copy gains of ERBB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hayes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>) leading to enhanced ERBB2-ERBB3 heterodimer activity, the secretion of ligands of the ERBB family, blunted negative control by phosphatases or the SOCS-ubiquitin pathway (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref></bold>). Serine phosphorylation of STAT3 is associated with RAS-RAF signalling and mitochondrial ATP production and this was also blocked by the ERBB inhibitor Sapitinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gough et al., 2009</xref>). The integrated and unbiased systems-level analysis presented in this study is expected to provide a critical foundation for further investigations and it raises general questions about the tumor biology and transmissibility of such cancers in other species. The implicated canonical cancer signatures apparently do not suffice to give rise to transmissible cancers in humans. Thus, it should be emphasized that the occurrence of transmissible cancers in mammalians are likely to depend on a complex combination of molecular as well as non-molecular context-dependent features such as aggressive behaviour, tissue wounding and population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Epstein et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Blocking the ERBB-STAT3 axis may present a promising drug target whose interference arrests cancer cells and at the same time leads to increased tumor surveillance through re-expression of MHC class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Garrido et al., 2016</xref>). While pharmacological treatments come with inherent logistic limitations for wildlife diseases, this rationalized therapeutic strategy &#x2013; possibly in combination with a vaccine against DFTD and/or immunotherapeutic interventions-offers a much-needed expansion of the so far limited measures to preserve the Tasmanian devil from extinction.</p>

<p>DFTD cells were grown from primary cell cultures derived from fine needle aspirates that have been collected from the wild (see <bold>Table S1A</bold>). Devil Facial Tumor cell strains 1-4 were grown in RPMI (Gibco 21875-034) supplemented with 10&#x0025; Fetal bovine serum (PAA A15-101), 1&#x0025; Pen Strep Glutamine (Gibco 10378-016) and 50 &#x03BC;M 2-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma M-3148). Fibroblasts were grown in Advanced DMEM (Gibco 12491-015) supplemented with 10&#x0025; Fetal bovine serum (PAA A15-101), 1&#x0025; Pen Strep Glutamine (Gibco 10378-016). Cells were grown at 35&#x00B0;C in 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> and lifted with either PBS containing 1 mM EDTA or 0.05&#x0025; Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco 25300-054). CHO supernatants containing recombinant devil interferon gamma (rIFN&#x03B3;) was used 1:3 diluted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Siddle et al., 2013</xref>). Control cells received supernatants of wild type CHO cells. Primary biopsies from Tasmanian devils were obtained from the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) (Tasmanian Government, Australia). Biopsies were received frozen on dry ice and stored in liquid nitrogen until processed (<bold>Table S1B</bold>).</p>

<title>Drug viability screen</title>
<p>We used a combined library of selected 1847 drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sdelci et al., 2016</xref>) and 684 kinase inhibitors (Targetmol catalog no. L1600 and Cayman Chemical item no 10505), which were transferred onto 384-well plates using an acoustic liquid handler (Echo, Labcyte). 5000 cells per well of strains 1-4, and 2500 cells per well of fibroblasts were added on top of the drugs (50 nl in DMSO) with a dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to a total of 50 &#x03BC;l/well. Cell viability was measured after 72h using the CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega G7573) in a multilabel plate reader (EnVision, PerkinElmer). Initially, all drugs were tested on DFTD cell line #1 at a single dose (typically 10 &#x03BC;M). 434 drug hits with effects on cell viability were subsequently tested in a 4-dose response in triplicate wells of DFTD cell lines 1 to 4 as well as fibroblasts. Drug candidates were selected based on the difference between the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of each tumor cell line to the control fibroblast higher than 50. The addition of 2 standard deviations of the mean AUC of each strain should also result in a lower value than the subtraction of two standard deviations from the fibroblast AUC (MeanAUC<sub>fibroblasts</sub> &#x2013; 2 Std DevAUC<sub>fibroblasts</sub>) &#x003E; (MeanAUC<sub>tumour strains</sub> &#x2013; 2 Std DevAUC<sub>tumour strains</sub>). This yielded 69 candidates that killed at least one DFTD cell line. Out of those, 41 drug candidates killed at least three out of four tumor cell lines but not fibroblasts. These 41 drugs were re-tested as 8-point dose-response in triplicates on the aforementioned 5 cell lines and cell viability was assessed by CellTiter-Glo as described previously. The STAT3 inhibitor PG-S3-009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Garg et al., 2017</xref>) was tested separately as 5-point dose-response curves in triplicates.</p>

<p>Approximately 5&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> cells from DFTD strains 1-4 and 2.5&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> Tasmanian devil fibroblasts were pelleted (260 <italic>g</italic>, 5 min, 4&#x00B0;C; <bold>Table S1A</bold>), washed three times in cold PBS, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and frozen at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until processed. Sample preparation and Western blotting was performed using standard techniques. Nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 &#x00B5;m Amersham Protran 10600002, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) were incubated with the following antibodies in the dilution as indicated: specific anti-phospho-STAT3 (Y705) polyclonal rabbit (1:1000; 9131; Cell Signaling Technology, Cambridge, UK), anti-STAT3 monoclonal mouse (1:1000; 610189; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) or (9139; Cell Signaling; 1:1000), anti-phospho-STAT3 (S727) polyclonal rabbit (1:1000; 9134; Cell Signaling Technology, Cambridge, UK), anti-STAT1 (rabbit; 9172; Cell Signaling; 1:1000), anti-phospho-EGFR (Y1068) monoclonal rabbit (1:1000; 3777; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-EGFR monoclonal rabbit (1:1000; sc-373746; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-phospho-HER2/ERBB2 (Y1221/1222) monoclonal rabbit (1:1000; 2243; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-HER2/ERBB2 monoclonal rabbit (1:1000; 4290; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-HER3/ERBB3 (Y1289) monoclonal rabbit (1:1000; 2842; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-HER3/ERBB3 monoclonal rabbit (1:1000; 12708; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-HSC70 monoclonal mouse (1:1000; sc-7298; Santa Cruz), anti-ERK1/2 monoclonal rabbit (1:1000; 4695; Cell Signaling Technology, Cambridge, UK), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) monoclonal rabbit (1:1000; 4370; Cell Signaling Technology, Cambridge, UK), anti-pY (4G10; Merck Millipore; 1:1000), anti-SOCS (1:1000; 3950; Cell Signaling Technology, Cambridge, UK), anti-B2M (1:1000; <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Siddle et al., 2013</xref>)</italic>), ECL anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V) or anti-mouse (NA931) HRP (1:10.000; GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).</p>

<title>Mass-spectrometry based proteomics</title>
<p>Sample Preparation for MS: Approximately 1&#x00D7;10<sup>7</sup> cells from DFT1 strain 1 were pelleted (260<italic>g</italic>, 5 min, 4&#x00B0;C), washed three times in PBS and frozen at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until processed. Primary biopsies were thawed and placed in a petri dish. Using a scalpel blade, 5&#x00D7;5 to 5&#x00D7;8 mm pieces of tissue were excised from the solid mass and placed in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube. Depending on the size of the piece of tissue, 500-1000 &#x00B5;l of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 2&#x0025; SDS, 1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)) was added to the tumour and skin samples. Samples were homogenised using the Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 4&#x00D7;2 min, 30 Hz. For some samples, it was necessary to repeat the homogenization procedure. Spleen samples were pre-cleared of blood before tissue lysis. Tissue pieces were placed in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL red blood cell (RBC)-lysis buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, USA). Spleen tissue was homogenised using the &#x2018;Tissue Lyser II&#x2019; (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 3&#x00D7;30s, centrifuged at 20000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and supernatant containing the lysed red blood cells removed. Lysis was performed at room temperature (RT) for 20 min. Lysed samples were heated at 99&#x00B0;C for 5 min and then cooled to RT. The cell lysate was sonicated using a Covaris S2 high performance ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Brighton, UK. The lysate was centrifuged at 20000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 20&#x00B0;C, and the protein extract was collected from the supernatant. Total protein content of the whole tissue lysates was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The assay was performed in a 96-well plate using 10 &#x00B5;l of each lysate and standard protein. The samples were measured in triplicates. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) was used as the standard protein.</p>
<p>Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP): 100 &#x00B5;g total protein per tissue was used for FASP digestion. Dithiothreitol (DTT; SIGMA-Aldrich Chemie, Vienna, Austria) was added to sample to a final concentration of approx. 83 mM. After incubation of the samples at 99&#x00B0;C for 5 min, FASP digestion was performed using a 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off filter (Microcon-30, Ultracel YM-30, Merck-Millipore Co., Cork, IRL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wisniewski et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, 200 &#x00B5;L 8 M urea in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (UA) was added to the samples. If the volume exceeded 50 &#x00B5;l, then 400 &#x00B5;l UA was added. After equilibration of the filter units with 200 &#x00B5;l UA and centrifugation at 14000&#x00D7;<italic>g</italic> for 15 min, the lysed samples were applied in steps of 250 &#x00B5;l to the filter unit and centrifuged at 14000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 20&#x00B0;C to remove SDS. Any remaining SDS was exchanged by urea in a second washing step with 200 &#x00B5;l UA. The proteins were alkylated with 100 &#x00B5;l 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Vienna, Austria) for 30 min at RT. Afterwards, three washing steps with 100 &#x00B5;L UA solution were performed, followed by three washing steps with 100 &#x00B5;L 50 mM TEAB buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria). Proteins were digested with Trypsin overnight at 37&#x00B0;C. Peptides were recovered using 40 &#x00B5;l 50 mM TEAB buffer followed by 50 &#x00B5;l of 0.5 M NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria).</p>
<p>Two-dimensional liquid chromatography was performed by reverse-phase chromatography at high and low pH. FASP digests were purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE) (MacroSpin Columns, 30-300 &#x00B5;g capacity, Nest Group Inc. Southboro, MA, USA) and reconstituted in 23 &#x00B5;l 5&#x0025; acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate. Peptides were separated on a Gemini-NX C18 (150 &#x00D7; 2 mm, 3 &#x00B5;m, 110 &#x00C5;, Phenomenex, Torrance, US) using a 30 min gradient from 5 to 90&#x0025; acetonitrile containing 10 mM ammonium formate buffer, pH 10, at a flow rate of 100 &#x00B5;L/min, using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent Biotechnologies, Palo Alto, CA). Details of the methodology are as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bennett et al., 2011</xref>). Ten time-based fractions were collected. Samples were acidified by the addition of 5 &#x00B5;l 5&#x0025; formic acid. Solvent was removed in a vacuum concentrator, and samples were reconstituted in 5&#x0025; formic acid. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was performed on a hybrid linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) using the <italic>Xcalibur version 2.1.0</italic> coupled to an Agilent 1200 HPLC nanoflow system (dual pump system with one trap-column and one analytical column) via a nanoelectrospray ion source using liquid junction (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark). Solvents for HPLC separation of peptides were as follows: solvent A consisted of 0.4&#x0025; formic acid (FA) in water, and solvent B consisted of 0.4&#x0025; FA in 70&#x0025; methanol and 20&#x0025; 2-propanol. From a thermostatted microautosampler, 8 &#x00B5;l of the tryptic peptide mixture were automatically loaded onto a trap column (Zorbax 300SB-C18 5 &#x00B5;m, 5&#x00D7;0.3 mm, Agilent Biotechnologies) with a binary pump at a fl 5 rate of 45 &#x00B5;l/min. 0.1&#x0025; trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was used for loading and washing the precolumn. After washing, the peptides were eluted by back-flushing onto a 16 cm fused silica analytical column with an inner diameter of 50 &#x00B5;m packed with C18 reversed phase material (ReproSil-Pur120 C18-AQ, 3 &#x00B5;m, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). The peptides were eluted from the analytical column with a 27 min gradient ranging from 3&#x0025; to 30&#x0025; solvent B, followed by a 25 min gradient from 30&#x0025; to 70&#x0025; solvent B, and finally a 7 min gradient from 70&#x0025; to 100&#x0025; solvent B at a constant flow rate of 100 nl/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bennett et al., 2011</xref>). The analyses were performed in a data-dependent acquisition mode, and dynamic exclusion for selected ions was 60s. A top 15 collision-induced dissociation (CID) method was used, and a single lock mass at <italic>m/z</italic> 445.120024 (Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>) was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Olsen et al., 2005</xref>). Maximal ion accumulation time allowed in CID mode was 50 ms for MSn in the LTQ and 500 ms in the C-trap. Automatic gain control (AGC) was used to prevent overfilling of the ion traps and was set to 5,000 in MS<sup>2</sup> mode for the LTQ and 10<sup>6</sup> ions for a full MS<sup>1</sup> FTMS scan. Intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap Velos at a resolution of 60,000 resolution (at <italic>m/z</italic> 400). The threshold for switching from MS<sup>1</sup> to MS<sup>2</sup> was 2,000 counts. The data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer version 2.2 against the Uniprot Tasmanian Devil fasta database version 2016.11 including isoforms obtained by VARSPLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kersey et al., 2000</xref>) and appended with known contaminants (91064 sequences total). The precursor masses were first recalibrated using the recalibration node (parameters: precursor mass tolerance: 20 ppm, fragment mass tolerance 0.5 Da, Carbamidomethylation of cysteine as static modification). The recalibrated data were then searched using Sequest HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eng et al., 1994</xref>) and Mascot (v2.3.02, MatrixScience, London, U.K.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Perkins et al., 1999</xref>) search engines with precursor mass tolerance being 4 ppm, fragment ion tolerance was 0.3 Da, methionine oxidation used as dynamic modification, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine as static modification in both search engines. Moreover protein N-terminal acetylation was considered as dynamic modification in Sequest HT. Minimum length of peptides was set to 6 and maximum number of missed cleavages was set to two in Sequest HT and to one in Mascot. Percolator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kall et al., 2007</xref>) was used to filter peptide-spectra matches (PSMs) at 1&#x0025; false discovery rate (FDR) and QVALITY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kall et al., 2009</xref>) to filter identified peptides at 1&#x0025; FDR. Identified proteins were also filtered at 1&#x0025; FDR by considering sum of negative logarithm of posterior error probabilities of connected PSMs. Matches against reversed fasta database were used to estimate FDR at PSM, peptide, and protein level. Abundance of proteins was quantified using the Minora feature detection node and integrating area under the MS1 chromatogram.</p>
<p>Principal component analysis was performed on 3894 out of 6672 proteins quantified in all 19 samples. We further focused on 4981/6672 proteins quantified in at least 80&#x0025; of the samples. The protein abundance data was normalized by variance stabilizing transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huber et al., 2002</xref>). Missing values are imputed on normalized abundance values with the k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm implemented in the R Bioconductor package impute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hastie et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>For each protein with a missing abundance in any of the samples, the kNN algorithm identifies the set of 10 most similar proteins based on non-missing abundance values. Missing abundance is then imputed as an average abundance in that set. An average of the signal is then performed on the k closest neighbours. Differential analysis, tumor versus the healthy, was performed between biopsies (excluding the tumor cell line) using the limma Bioconductor package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). Proteins were considered as differentially modulated if their adjusted p-value was &#x003C;&#x003D; 0.05 and their absolute log2 Fold Change was &#x003E;&#x003D;1 between tumor and healthy biopsies. Hierarchical clustering of the 987 differentially modulated proteins was performed with Pearson&#x2019;s distance measure and the average clustering method.</p>

<title>DNA methylation analysis</title>
<p>DNA methylation profiling by RRBS was performed as described previously using 100 ng of genomic DNA isolated from RNA-later preserved tissue samples through the Allprep DNA/RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Klughammer et al., 2015</xref>). Methylated and unmethylated spike-in controls were added in a concentration of 0.1&#x0025; to assess bisulfite conversion efficiency independent of CpG context. DNA was digested using the restriction enzymes MspI and TaqI in combination (as opposed to only MspI in the original protocol) in order to increase genome-wide coverage. Restriction enzyme digestion was followed by fragment end repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation. The amount of effective library was determined by qPCR, and samples were <sup>multiplexed in pools of 13 with similar qPCR <italic>Ct</italic> values. The pools were then subjected to</sup> bisulfite conversion followed by library enrichment by PCR. Enrichment cycles were determined using qPCR and ranged from 9 to 13 (median: 11). After confirming adequate fragment size distributions on Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chips (Agilent), libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 3000/4000 machines in a 50 bp single-read setup.</p>
<p>The DNA methylation (RRBS) data were analyzed using the RefFreeDMA pipeline as described previously to avoid potential biases in read mapping and methylation calling related to the scaffold assembly status of the published Tasmanian Devil reference genome sarHar1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Klughammer et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, a custom <italic>ad-hoc</italic> reference genome was deduced directly from the RRBS sequencing reads and used for read mapping and methylation calling. Based on the thus produced DNA methylation profiles, differential DNA methylation analysis was performed as part of the RefFreeDMA pipeline and as originally described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Assenov et al., 2014</xref>). Gene annotations were transferred by mapping the deduced genome fragments to the published scaffold-level Tasmanian Devil genome sarHar1, downloaded from the UCSC genome browser. A gene annotation file was produced by joining the UCSC transcript annotation file with the Ensembl v86 transcript annotation file of sarHar1 based on the common Ensembl transcript identifiers. Gene promoters were defined as the region between 5000 bases downstream and 2500 bases upstream of the transcription start site. 487540 (11.37&#x0025;) of the individual CpGs are situated in promoters of annotated genes. For promoter methylation analysis we focused on a total of 69754 CpGs that are also covered in at least 80&#x0025; of the samples. The significance of differential methylation throughout promoters or deduced genome fragments was assessed by combining the p-values for single CpGs within the respective promoter regions or deduced genome fragments using an extension of the Fisher&#x2019;s method as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Assenov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Klughammer et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>We performed Transcription Factor and Pathway Maps enrichment on the differentially modulated entities (proteins, genes) with the MetaCore&#x2122; (Thomson Reuters, version 6.32 build 69020; cutoff for p-value of enrichment 0.05). The results are reported based on the z-score of enrichment. The 987 differentially modulated proteins were integrated together with the 166 genes with differentially modulated promoters and the candidate genes ERBB2 and ERBB3 from the drug-screen at the level of MetaCore interactions. Only high-confidence direct interactions between pairs of genes are considered: protein binding, transcription factor regulation, other functional interaction. 632 of the previous candidates form a direct network connection.</p>

<title>Transcriptome expression analysis and variant calling</title>
<p>The amount of total RNA was quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometric Quantitation system (Life Technologies) and the RNA integrity number (RIN) was determined using Experion Automated Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). RNA-seq libraries were prepared with TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT sample preparation kit (Illumina) using Sciclone and Zephyr liquid handling robotics (PerkinElmer). Library amount was quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometric Quantitation system (Life Technologies) and the size distribution was assessed using Experion Automated Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). For sequencing 6 libraries were pooled, diluted and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 3000/4000 using 75 bp paired-end chemistry. Base calls provided by the Illumina Realtime Analysis software were converted into BAM format using Illumina2bam and demultiplexed using BamIndexDecoder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wtsi-npg/illumina2bam">https://github.com/wtsi-npg/illumina2bam</ext-link>). Paired-end reads were trimmed for adaptor sequences and filtered with the trimmomatic tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>). Trimmed reads were aligned on the version 7.0 of the Tasmanian Devil with the STAR aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Counting of reads on annotated transcripts (Sarcophilus_harrisii.DEVIL7.0.90.gtf from Ensembl) was performed with HTSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). The DESeq2 Biconductor library has been used for counts normalization and differential analysis between the transcriptomes of the four DFTD and fibroblast cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Differentially expressed genes were identified based on the following cutoffs: an average minimum expression value between conditions of 50 reads, an absolute log fold change of 1, and an adjusted p-value of maximum 0.05. The pipeline for variant calling is based on the GATK version 3.7, following the best-practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Van der Auwera et al., 2013</xref>). Called variants were annotated with SNPEff v4.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cingolani et al., 2012</xref>). Variants are filtered on strand bias (&#x003C;30), quality (QD &#x003E; 2), coverage (DP &#x003E;&#x003D; 10) and allele frequency (AF &#x003D; 0.5).</p>

<title>Mouse xenograft studies</title>
<p>NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna. Mice were at the age of 8-14 weeks at the time of cell implantation. All animal experiments were carried out according to the animal license protocol (BMWFW-68.205/0130-WF/V/3b/2016) approved by the Austrian Ministry BMWF authorities. The experimental design and number of mice assigned to each treatment arm were based on prior experience with similar models and provided sufficient statistical power to discern significant differences. Mice were matched according to initial tumor size and randomized to treatment with Sapitinib or vehicle (ddH<sub>2</sub>O &#x002B; 1&#x0025; Tween80). No mice were excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>Mice were implanted subcutaneously in both flanks with 1&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> Devil Facial Tumor cell line 1 (<bold>Table S1A</bold>) in 100 &#x00B5;l PBS, using a 27G needle. Tumor growth was measured twice a week using Vernier calipers for the duration of the experiment and tumor volumes were calculated with the following formula: tumor volume &#x003D; (length &#x00D7; width<sup>2</sup>)/2. Treatment was initiated when the average tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm<sup>3</sup> and experiments were terminated once tumor volume reached 1 cm<sup>3</sup> The animals were randomly divided into two groups and treated daily with Sapitinib (50 mg/kg) or vehicle (ddH<sub>2</sub>O &#x002B; 1&#x0025; Tween80) until terminal workup. After termination of the experiment, tumors were resected and used for analysis of tumor weight, immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and immunoblotting as described.</p>
