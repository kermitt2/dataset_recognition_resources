<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p>Cell migration and axon guidance are important steps in the formation of neural circuits. Both steps depend on the interactions between cell surface receptors and molecules on cells along the pathway. In addition to cell-cell adhesion, these molecular interactions provide guidance information. The fine-tuning of cell-cell adhesion is as an important aspect of cell migration, axon guidance, and synapse formation. Here, we show that Endoglycan, a sialomucin, plays a role in axon guidance and cell migration in the central nervous system. In the absence of Endoglycan, commissural axons failed to cross the midline of the spinal cord. In the developing cerebellum, a lack of Endoglycan prevented migration of Purkinje cells and resulted in a stunted growth of the cerebellar lobes. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that Endoglycan acts as a negative regulator of cell-cell adhesion in both commissural axon guidance and Purkinje cell migration.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Cell migration and axonal pathfinding are important aspects of neural development. Neurons are born in proliferative zones from where they migrate to their final destination. After their arrival, they send out axons that have to navigate through the tissue to find the target cells with which they establish synaptic contacts. Intuitively, it is clear that the same cues provided by the environment can be used by cells and by axons to navigate through the tissue to find their target. Although we know relatively little about guidance cues for cells compared to guidance cues for axons, both processes are dependent on proper cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gomez and Letourneau, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Short et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the best-studied model systems for axon guidance are the commissural neurons located in the dorsolateral spinal cord (de Ramon et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Stoeckli, 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2018</xref>). These neurons send out their axons toward the ventral midline under the influence of the roof plate-derived repellents BMP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Augsburger et al., 1999</xref>) and Draxin (Islam et al., 2008). At the same time, axons are attracted to the floor plate, their intermediate target, by Netrin (for a review on Netrin function, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boyer and Gupton, 2018</xref>), VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ruiz de Almod&#x00F3;var et al., 2011</xref>), and Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yam et al., 2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2012</xref>). At the floor-plate border commissural axons require the short-range guidance cues Contactin2 (aka Axonin-1) and NrCAM to enter the midline area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stoeckli and Landmesser, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stoeckli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fitzli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pekarik et al., 2003</xref>). Slits and their receptors, the Robos, were shown to be required as negative signals involved in pushing axons out of the midline area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Long et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blockus and Ch&#x00E9;dotal, 2016</xref>). Members of the Semaphorin family are also involved in midline crossing as negative signals mediated by Neuropilin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Parra and Zou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nawabi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Charoy et al., 2012</xref>) or as receptors for floor-plate derived PlexinA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andermatt et al., 2014a</xref>). Once commissural axons exit the floor-plate area, they turn rostrally along the longitudinal axis of the spinal cord. Morphogens of the Wnt family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Domanitskaya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avil&#x00E9;s and Stoeckli, 2016</xref>) and Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bourikas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Stoeckli, 2013</xref>) were identified as guidance cues directing post-crossing commissural axons rostrally. In the same screen that resulted in the discovery of Shh as a repellent for post-crossing commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bourikas et al., 2005</xref>), we found another candidate that interfered with the rostral turn of post-crossing commissural axons. This candidate gene was identified as <italic>Endoglycan</italic>.</p>
<p>Endoglycan is a member of the CD34 family of sialomucins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nielsen and McNagny, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sassetti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Furness and McNagny, 2006</xref>). The family includes CD34, Podocalyxin (also known as Thrombomucin, PCLP-1, MEP21, or gp135), and Endoglycan (also known as Podocalyxin-like 2). They are single-pass transmembrane proteins with highly conserved transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. A C-terminal PDZ recognition site is found in all three family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Furness and McNagny, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nielsen and McNagny, 2008</xref>). The hallmark of sialomucins is their bulky extracellular domain that is negatively charged due to extensive N- and O-glycosylation. Despite the fact that CD34 was identified more than 20 years ago, very little is known about its function. It has been widely used as a marker for hematopoietic stem cells and precursors. Similarly, Podocalyxin is expressed on hematopoietic stem and precursor cells. In contrast to CD34, Podocalyxin was found in podocytes of the developing kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kerjaschki et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Doyonnas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Furness and McNagny, 2006</xref>). In the absence of Podocalyxin, podocytes do not differentiate resulting in kidney failure and thus perinatal lethality in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Doyonnas et al., 2001</xref>). Podocalyxin, but not CD34, is expressed widely in the developing and mature mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vitureira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vitureira et al., 2010</xref>). Podocalyxin was shown to induce microvilli and regulate cell-cell adhesion via its binding to the NHERF (Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> exchanger regulatory factor) family of adaptor proteins that link Podocalyxin to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nielsen and McNagny, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nielsen and McNagny, 2009</xref>). Like <italic>Podocalyxin</italic>, <italic>Endoglycan</italic> is expressed in the brain and in the kidney. Only low levels were found in hematopoietic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sassetti et al., 2000</xref>). Nothing is known about the function of Endoglycan.</p>
<p>Based on its temporal and spatial expression pattern, we first analyzed the function of Endoglycan in the embryonic chicken spinal cord. In the absence of Endoglycan commissural axons failed to turn rostrally upon floor-plate exit. Often they were observed to turn already inside the floor-plate area. Furthermore, the trajectory of commissural axons in the midline area was tortuous in embryos lacking Endoglycan but straight in control embryos. Additionally, we found that <italic>Endoglycan</italic> expression in the embryonic chicken cerebellum is restricted to migrating Purkinje cells. The absence of Endoglycan resulted in the failure of Purkinje cells to migrate properly from the ventricular zone to their destination in the periphery of the cerebellum, where they normally form the typical Purkinje cell layer. This in turn resulted in a decrease in granule cell proliferation and in the stunted growth of the cerebellar folds.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results are consistent with a role for Endoglycan as a negative regulator of cell-cell contact and therefore modulator of molecular interactions affecting both axon guidance and cell migration.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Endoglycan was identified as a candidate guidance cue for commissural axons</title>
<p>In a subtractive hybridization screen, we identified differentially expressed floor-plate genes as candidate guidance cues directing axons from dorsolateral commissural neurons across the midline or along the longitudinal axis after midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bourikas et al., 2005</xref>). Candidates with an expression pattern that was compatible with a role in commissural axon navigation at the midline were selected for functional analysis using in ovo RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pekarik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wilson and Stoeckli, 2011</xref>). One of these candidates that interfered with the correct rostral turning of commissural axons after midline crossing turned out to be <italic>Endoglycan</italic>, a member of the CD34 family of sialomucins.</p>
<p>CD34 family members share a common domain organization that consists of a mucin-like domain followed by a cysteine-containing globular domain, a membrane associated stalk region a transmembrane spanning domain and the cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sassetti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Furness and McNagny, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nielsen and McNagny, 2008</xref>). With the exception of the mucin-like domain at the N-terminus, the conservation between species orthologues of CD34, Endoglycan and Podocalyxin is in the range of 80&#x0025;, but drops below 40&#x0025; within the mucin domain. However, homologies of these paralogous proteins within the same species are generally only in the range of 40&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), demonstrating that, while they might share a similar overall structure, the primary amino acid sequences can be quite diverse.</p>
<p><italic>Endoglycan</italic> was expressed mainly in the nervous system during development, as levels in non-neuronal tissues were much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). In the neural tube, <italic>Endoglycan</italic> was expressed ubiquitously but with higher levels in floor-plate cells at HH20 (Hamburger and Hamilton stage 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By HH26, expression was still found throughout the neural tube but now higher levels were also detected in dorsal commissural neurons (dI1 neurons) and motoneurons. <italic>Endoglycan</italic> expression was also maintained in the floor plate (insert in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For functional analysis, dsRNA was produced from the <italic>Endoglycan</italic> cDNA fragment obtained from the screen and used for in ovo electroporation of the spinal cord at HH18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The analysis of commissural axons&#x2019; trajectories at HH26 by DiI tracing in &#x201E;open-book&#x201D; preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) revealed either failure to turn or erroneous caudal turns along the contralateral floor-plate border in embryos lacking Endoglycan in the floor plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) or in one half of the spinal cord including the floor plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Furthermore, axons were turning prematurely either before midline crossing or within the floor-plate area. Detailed analysis of the axonal morphology in the floor-plate area revealed a tortuous trajectory in embryos lacking Endoglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), whereas axons crossed the midline in a straight trajectory in untreated control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and in embryos injected and electroporated with dsRNA derived from either CD34 (not shown) or Podocalyxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Endoglycan is required for the correct turning of post-crossing commissural axons.</title>
<p>(A,B) Endoglycan is expressed in the developing neural tube during commissural axon guidance. Endoglycan is expressed throughout the neural tube at HH20 (A). Higher levels are seen in the floor plate (arrowhead). (B) At HH26, Endoglycan is still found in most cells of the spinal cord. High levels are found in motoneurons and interneurons, including the dorsal dI1 neurons (arrow), and in the floor plate (arrowhead and insert in B). Commissural axon pathfinding was analyzed in &#x201C;open-book&#x201D; preparations (C,D; see Methods for details). The positions of the electrodes for dorsal and ventral electroporation are indicated (C). In control embryos at HH26, commissural axons have crossed the floor plate and turned rostrally along the contralateral floor-plate border (E). In contrast, after downregulation of Endoglycan (F-I) commissural axons failed to turn along the contralateral floor-plate border or they turned randomly either rostrally or caudally (arrowheads in F-I). Occasionally axons were turning already inside the floor plate (open arrowhead in F). A closer look at the morphology of the axons in the floor plate revealed their tortuous, &#x2018;corkscew-like&#x2019; trajectory across the midline at many DiI injection sites (open arrowheads in H).</p>
<p>To knockdown <italic>Endoglycan</italic> either in the floor plate or in commissural neurons the ventral or dorsal spinal cord was targeted as indicated in (C) (see inserts in F and I, respectively). Phenotypes were the same as those observed after targeting the floor plate (F) or one half of the spinal cord including the floor plate ((G,H). Pathfinding was normal in embryos electroporated with dsRNA derived from <italic>Podocalyxin</italic> (J).</p>
<p>The quantification of injection sites with pathfinding errors after targeting the floor plate or one half of the spinal cord is shown in (K). Pathfinding errors were seen only at 6.7&#x00B1;3.4&#x0025; of the injection sites in untreated control embryos (n=10 embryos, 45 injection sites). In control embryos injected and electroporated with the <italic>EGFP</italic> plasmid alone pathfinding errors were found at 16.2&#x00B1;6&#x0025; of the injection sites (n=17 embryos, 92 injection sites). Injection and electroporation of dsRNA derived from <italic>CD34</italic> (24.6&#x00B1;5.8&#x0025;, n=8 embryos, 80 injection sites) and <italic>Podocalyxin</italic> (23.3&#x00B1;3.9&#x0025;, n=17 embryos, 147 injection sites) did not affect midline crossing and turning behavior of commissural axons. In contrast, 82.3&#x00B1;5.6&#x0025; (n=11 embryos, 65 sites) and 61.7&#x00B1;6.4&#x0025; (n=18, 161 sites) of the injection sites in embryos injected with dsRNA derived from the 3&#x2019;-UTR or the ORF of <italic>Endoglycan</italic>, respectively, showed aberrant pathfinding of commissural axons. P values &#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x003C;0.001 and &#x002A;&#x002A;&#x003C;0.01, respectively, compared to EGFP-injected control groups, respectively. The two groups electroporated with dsRNA derived from Endoglycan were not different from each other. Bar: 50 &#x00B5;m in B-G; 100 &#x00B5;m in inserts.</p></caption>

<p>To demonstrate specificity of Endoglycan downregulation and to verify that the phenotype was not due to an off-target effect, we used three non-overlapping cDNA fragments to produce dsRNA. All fragments resulted in the same phenotypes. Downregulation of Endoglycan with dsRNA derived from the ORF resulted in 61.7&#x00B1;6.4&#x0025; injection sites with aberrant axon guidance. The effect on axon guidance was even stronger with dsRNA derived from the 3&#x2019;UTR, with 82.3&#x00B1;5.6&#x0025; of the injection sites with aberrant axon guidance. In contrast, aberrant axonal pathfinding was seen only at 6.7&#x00B1;3.4&#x0025; of the injection sites in untreated control embryos. Values were 16.2&#x00B1;6.0 for EGFP-expressing control embryos, 24.6&#x00B1;5.8&#x0025; for embryos transfected with dsRNA derived from <italic>CD34</italic>, and 23.3&#x00B1;3.9&#x0025; for embryos transfected with dsRNA derived from <italic>Podocalyxin</italic>.</p>

<title>Lack of Endoglycan affects the morphology of the floor plate</title>
<p>Because the hallmark of sialomucins is their bulky, negatively charged extracellular domain with extensive glycosylation a role as regulators of cell-cell adhesion has been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vitureira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Takeda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nielsen and McNagny, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">2009</xref>). This together with our observation that commissural axons have a &#x201E;corkscrew&#x201C;-like phenotype in the midline area in Endoglycan-deficient embryos prompted us to analyze the morphology of the floor plate. Sections were taken from the lumbosacral level of the spinal cord at HH26 from control-treated and experimental embryos and stained for HNF3&#x03B2;/FoxA2 to label floor-plate cells, and for Contactin2 (aka Axonin-1) to label commissural axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In untreated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>) and control-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-F</xref>), HNF3&#x03B2;/FoxA2-positive cells were aligned to form the characteristic triangular shape of the floor plate. In particular, the ventral border of the floor plate, where commissural axons traverse the midline was smooth because all floor-plate cells were precisely aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>). In contrast, floor-plate cells were no longer aligned to form a smooth ventral border in embryos lacking Endoglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,J</xref>). On the one hand, floor-plate cells were found dislocated into the commissure formed by the Contactin2-positive axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,L</xref>). On the other hand, the floor plate appeared to have gaps in embryos lacking Endoglycan. In addition, the floor-plate width was significantly narrower in embryos lacking Endoglycan in comparison to age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). However, no change in Shh or Nkx2.2 expression was found in experimental compared to control embryos, indicating that cells in the ventral spinal cord were correctly specified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>After downregulation of Endoglycan the morphology of the floor plate is compromised.</title>
<p>In untreated (A-C) and control-treated embryos (D-F) the floor plate is of triangular shape with floor-plate cells precisely aligned at the ventral border. There is no overlap between the floor plate (visualized by HNF3&#xF062; staining; red) and the commissure (visualized by anti-Axonin1 staining; green). The shape of the floor plate is no longer triangular in embryos lacking Endoglycan (G-L). The floor-plate cells are not aligned ventrally (arrowheads in G, I, J, and L) and the floor plate appears to have gaps. The width of the floor plate (indicated by asterisks) was measured (P). There was no significant difference in spinal cord width (Q), but floor plates were significantly narrower in embryos lacking Endoglycan (61.6&#x00B1;3.4 &#x00B5;m; n=7 embryos; p&#x003C;0.001) compared to untreated (82.4&#x00B1;2.0 &#x00B5;m; n=6 embryos) and <italic>EGFP</italic>-injected control embryos (83.6&#x00B1;3.2 &#x00B5;m; n=6 embryos). The commissure had a tendency to be wider in experimental compared to control embryos but the effect was not statistically significant (R). The changes in floor-plate morphology were only seen at HH26 (A-L), after axons had crossed the floor plate. When the floor-plate morphology was analyzed at HH21, when commissural axons have reached but only few have crossed the midline, no dislocated cells and no gaps in the floor plate were observed (M-O). The width of the floor plate was not different when measured at HH21/22 with 70.1&#x00B1;4.2 &#x00B5;m for untreated and 70.6&#x00B1;2.5 &#x00B5;m for EGFP controls, compared to 71.8&#x00B1;2.0 &#x00B5;m for experimental embryos.

<p>When embryos lacking Endoglycan were analyzed at HH21, that is at a time point when axons have reached but not yet crossed the floor plate, the morphology and the width of the floor plate were not different from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M-O</xref>). Thus, the absence of Endoglycan does not affect cell-cell adhesion between floor-platecells. Rather the altered floor-plate morphology appears to be an indirect effect of changes in axon to floor-plate adhesion.</p>
<p>An alternative way of demonstrating the requirement for Endoglycan in both floor plate and commissural axons was by rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We used dsRNA derived from the 3&#x2019;-UTR and expressed the ORF of <italic>Endoglycan</italic> either under control of the Math1 promoter (expression only in dI1 neurons) or the Hoxa1 promoter for floor-plate specific expression. We used three different concentrations of plasmid for our rescue experiments and obtained a dose-dependent effect on axon guidance. Expression of high doses of <italic>Endoglycan</italic> was never able to rescue the axon guidance phenotype. However, axon guidance was not different from control embryos after transfection of dI1 neurons with a low concentration or floor-plate cells with a medium concentration of the <italic>Endoglycan</italic> ORF (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The source of Endoglycan did not matter but the amount of Endoglycan did. Thus, we concluded that Endoglycan could be a regulator of growth cone-floor plate contact without the requirement for a specific binding partner.</p>

<title>Endoglycan is a negative regulator of cell adhesion</title>
<p>The observation that downregulation of Endoglycan in floor plate cells seemed to increase the adhesion between commissural axons and floor plate cells, together with the knowledge about its molecular features, led us to hypothesize that Endoglycan might act as a negative regulator of cell-cell adhesion. To test this hypothesis we manipulated the balance of adhesion between commissural axons and the floor plate. Commissural axons cross the midline because of the positive signals provided by the interaction of floor-plate NrCAM with growth cone Contactin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stoeckli and Landmesser, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stoeckli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fitzli et al., 2000</xref>). In the absence of NrCAM or Contactin2, commissural axons fail to enter the floor plate and turn into the longitudinal axis prematurely along the ipsilateral floor-plate border. The positive signal derived from the Contactin2/NrCAM interaction depends on sufficient contact between growth cone and floor-plate cells. Thus, we hypothesized that the failure to detect the positive signal due to lower NrCAM levels on the floor plate cells could be counteracted by a forced increase in growth cone-floor plate contact. We reasoned that the concomitant downregulation of NrCAM and Endoglycan would rescue the NrCAM phenotype, because the decrease in adhesion resulting in the failure of commissural axons to enter the floor plate would be counteracted by an increase in adhesion in the absence of Endoglycan. This is indeed what we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As found previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stoeckli and Landmesser, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pekarik et al., 2003</xref>), axons were frequently turning prematurely along the ipsilateral floor-plate border in the absence of NrCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In accordance with our hypothesis, ipsilateral turns were reduced to control levels when NrCAM and Endoglycan were downregulated concomitantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">C</xref>).</p>

<p>The perturbation of axon/floor-plate contact by downregulationof NrCAM resulted in the failure of commissural axons to enter the floor-plate area and caused their premature turns along the ipsilateral floor plate border (arrowhead in A), as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stoeckli and Landmesser, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Philipp et al., 2012</xref>). If both NrCAM and Endoglycan were downregulated in the floor plate, the number of ipsilateral turns was reduced to control levels (B, C), consistent with the idea that a decrease in adhesion due to a lack of NrCAM can be balanced by an increase in adhesion between floor plate and growth cone due to a lack of Endoglycan. Ipsilateral turns were rare in untreated control embryos (2.6&#x00B1;1.7&#x0025;, n=8 embryos, 62 injection sites) and embryos lacking Endoglycan (7.1&#x00B1;3.7&#x0025;, n=7 embryos, 51 injection sites). Ipsilateral turns were frequently found in the absence of NrCAM (35&#x00B1;9.8&#x0025;, n=10 embryos, 97 injection sites).

<p>Additional evidence for a negative effect on adhesion of Endoglycan was found in vitro. The expression of human Endoglycan in HEK cells strongly reduced adhesion of chicken motoneurons. Less than 25&#x0025; of the number of motoneurons found to stick to control HEK cells were counted on HEK cells expressing human Endoglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).

Overexpression of Endoglycan in motoneurons significantly shortened axon length no matter whether they were growing on transfected or non-transfected COS cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

<p>In summary, our results demonstrate a vital role for Endoglycan in commissural axon guidance at the ventral midline and Purkinje cell migration in the developing cerebellum. In both systems, the observed phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that Endoglycan is an essential regulator of cell-cell contacts by modulating the strength of adhesion between cells. This model is supported by observations in vitro. Neuronal attachment and neurite length were negatively affected by the presence of an excess of Endoglycan, indicating that Endoglycan decreases adhesive strength during neural circuit assembly.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>We identified <italic>Endoglycan</italic>, a member of the CD34 family of sialomucins, in a screen for axon guidance cues involved in commissural axon pathfinding at the midline of the spinal cord. In the developing chicken cerebellum. <italic>Endoglycan</italic> is expressed exclusively in Purkinje cells during their migration from the ventricular zone to their final destination between the molecular layer and the internal granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the absence of Endoglycan, Purkinje cells failed to migrate and accumulated in the center of the cerebellar folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>). This observation suggests a role of Endoglycan as an &#x2018;anti-adhesive&#x2019; molecule that is supported by the structural features of sialomucins. The function of CD34 family members has not been characterized in detail but all the results obtained so far are compatible with an anti-adhesive role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nielsen and McNagny, 2008</xref>). One exception are reports from the lymph node cells, the so-called high endothelial venules (HEVs) where a very specific glycosylation patterns was implicated in the interaction of CD34 and Endoglycan with L-selectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Furness and McNagny, 2006</xref>). However, in agreement with most published studies on the role of CD34 and Podocalyxin (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Furness and McNagny, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nielsen and McNagny, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">2009</xref>) and in accordance with our observation we favor the model that suggests an anti-adhesive function of Endoglycan. This model is supported by results from in vivo and in vitro experiments that confirm a negative effect of Endoglycan on cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Endoglycan modulates cell-cell contact by interference with adhesive strength</title>
<p>Based on our in vivo and in vitro studies we postulate a model for Endoglycan function in neural circuit formation that suggests an &#x2018;anti-adhesive&#x2019; role by modulation of many specific molecular interactions due to decreasing cell-cell contact. This model is consistent with our rescue experiments demonstrating that the source of Endoglycan did not matter but the expression level did. Thus, aberrant phenotypes were prevented when Endoglycan was expressed either in the axon or in the floor plate.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="425207_fig9.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The anti-adhesive effect of Endoglycan is mediated by the negatively charged mucin domain. Similar to the role suggested for the polysialic acid modification of NCAM, the neural cell adhesion molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rutishauser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brus&#x00E9;s and Rutishauser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burgess et al., 2008</xref>), Endoglycan could lower cell-cell adhesion by increasing the distance between adjacent cell membranes due to repulsion caused by the bulky, negatively charged posttranslational modifications of its extracellular domains. A similar effect was found for PSA-NCAM in hindlimb innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Landmesser et al., 1990</xref>) and in the visual system, where retinal ganglion cell axons innervating the tectum were found to regulate axon-axon adhesion versus axon-target cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rutishauser et al., 1988</xref>). The same mechanism was found in motoneurons, where axon-axon versus axon-muscle fiber adhesion was a determining factor for the appropriate innervation pattern. In contrast to PSA-NCAM that continues to play a role in synaptic plasticity in the adult nervous system, the function of Endoglycan appears to be restricted to development. Expression of <italic>Endoglycan</italic> ceased in the cerebellum after the mature wiring pattern was achieved.</p>
<p>At first sight, the effect of Endoglycan on floor-plate morphology appears to suggest a positive regulation of cell-cell adhesion. Floor-plate cells are precisely aligned in control embryos but are protruding into the commissure in the absence of Endoglycan. Therefore, one might conclude that in the absence of Endoglycan cell-cell adhesion between floor-plate cells is compromised, resulting in the observed structural changes. However, this scenario can be ruled out based on the analysis of younger embryos. At HH21 the floor plate was intact in the absence of Endoglycan, indicating that Endoglycan is not required for adhesion between floor-plate cells. The morphology of the floor plate is only compromised once axons have crossed the midline. Contacts between commissural axons and floor-plate cells have to be broken when later crossing commissural axons arrive and cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yaginuma et al., 1991</xref>). Commissural axons crossing the floor plate are suggested to do so by close interaction with short filopodial processes of floor-plate cells. Thus, the aberrant morphology of the floor plate at HH26 is explained by the inability of axons to break contacts with floor-plate cells in the absence of Endoglycan, consistent with our hypothesis that Endoglycan is a negative regulator of adhesion.</p>
<p>Thus, the function of Endoglycan in commissural axon guidance and in Purkinje cell migration is to lower cell adhesion. In both cases, the absence of Endoglycan results in too much stickiness. In the cerebellum, excessive adhesion prevents the Purkinje cells from migrating to their target layer. At the midline of the spinal cord, excessive adhesion causes axons to adhere too much to floor-plate cells and prevents their displacement by follower axons. Rather than acting as a guidance cue or guidance receptor, we suggest that Endoglycan affects neural circuit formation by modulating the interaction of many different guidance cues and their surface receptors.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose an &#x2018;anti-adhesive&#x2019; role for Endoglycan in axon guidance and neural migration that is fine-tuning the balance between adhesion and de-adhesion. Precise regulation of cell-cell contacts is required in both processes and is fundamental for developmental processes that depend on a high degree of plasticity and a plethora of specific molecular interactions.</p>

After incubation with anti-digoxigenin-AP antibody dissolved in buffer 2 (1:10,000; Roche) for 30 minutes at room temperature the membrane was washed twice in washing buffer (0.3&#x0025; Tween 20 dissolved in 0.1 M maleic acid, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5) for 20 minutes. Subsequently, detection buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 9.5) was applied for 2 minutes before adding CDP-star (25 mM, Roche) for 5 minutes in the dark. For detection of the chemiluminescence a Kodak BioMAX XAR film was used.</p>

<title>In vivo experiments</title>
<p>Fertilized chicken eggs were obtained from a hatchery (Br&#x00FC;terei St&#x00F6;ckli, Ohmstal. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the national authorities of Switzerland (Animal Protecion Ordinance). The protocols and the experiments were approved by the cantonal veterinary office of the Canton Zurich. Embryos were staged according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>. As the chicken embryos are from an outbred line, every embryo can be considered a biological replicate. The numbers of embryos used for the different experiments are given in the Figure legends.</p>

<title>In ovo RNAi</title>
<p>For functional studies in the spinal cord, we silenced <italic>Endoglycan</italic> with three different long dsRNAs. They were produced from bp 1028-1546 of the ORF, as well as bp 3150-3743 and bp 5070-5754 from the 3&#x2019;UTR. The fact that we obtained the same phenotype with three different, non-overlapping dsRNAs derived from <italic>Endoglycan</italic> confirms the specificity of the approach and the absence of off-target effects. dsRNA was produced as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pekarik et al., 2003</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wilson and Stoeckli, 2011</xref>. Because no antibodies recognizing chicken Endoglycan are available, we used in situ hybridization to assess the successful downregulation of the target mRNA.</p>
<p>For rescue experiments, the dsRNA was co-injected with 150 (low), 300 (middle), or 750 ng/&#x00B5;l (high) plasmid encoding the ORF of chicken <italic>Endoglycan</italic>. The ORF was either expressed under the control of the Math1 promoter for dI1 neuron-specific expression, or the Hoxa1 promoter for floor-plate specific expression of <italic>Endoglycan</italic>.</p>

<title>Ex ovo RNAi</title>
<p>To analyze the in vivo function of Endoglycan in the developing cerebellum ex ovo cultures of chicken embryos were prepared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baeriswyl and Stoeckli, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andermatt and Stoeckli, 2014b</xref>). Injections and electroporations were performed at E8 (HH34). To have direct access to the embryo a small hole of 3 to 4 mm diameter was cut into the extraembryonic membranes above the eye. For positioning and stabilization of the head during injection and subsequent electroporation we used a hook prepared from a spatula. Approximately 1 &#x00B5;l of the nucleic acid mixture consisting of a plasmid encoding EGFP under the control of the &#x03B2;-actin promoter (100 ng/&#x00B5;l), dsRNA derived from the ORF of <italic>Endoglycan</italic> (500 ng/&#x00B5;l), and 0.04&#x0025; (vol/vol) Trypan Blue (Invitrogen) dissolved in sterile PBS were injected into the cerebellum using a borosilicate glass capillary with a tip diameter of 5 &#x00B5;m (World Precision Instruments). Before electroporation a few drops of sterile PBS were added to the embryo. For the electroporation a platelet electrode of 7 mm diameter (Tweezertrodes Model #520, BTX Instrument Division, Harvard Apparatus) was placed collaterally to the head of the embryo. Six pulses of 40 V and 99 ms duration were applied using a square wave electroporator (ECM830, BTX).</p>

<p>Dissociated motoneurons of HH25-26 chicken embryos were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mauti et al., 2006</xref>) either on HEK293T cells stably expressing human Endoglycan-myc under the control of the CMV promoter or on untransfected HEK293T cells as control. The plasmid encoding human Endoglycan was obtained from SourceBioScience (Nottingham, UK). After 40h, the cultures were fixed for 1h at room temperature in 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde and stained with mouse anti-neurofilament (RMO 270; Zymed) and rabbit anti-myc antibodies (Abcam). The number of neurofilament-positive cells was counted in 16 randomly selected frames (0.4 mm<sup>2</sup>). Similar results were obtained in 3 independent experiments.

<title>Tissue preparation and analysis</title>
<p>To analyze commissural axon growth and guidance the embryos were sacrificed between HH25 and 26. The spinal cord was removed, opened at the roof plate (&#x2018;open-book&#x2019; preparation) and fixed in 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 40 min to 1 hour at room temperature. To visualize the trajectories of commissural axons, Fast-Dil (5 mg/ml, dissolved in ethanol, Molecular Probes) was injected to the dorsal part of the spinal cord as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wilson and Stoeckli, 2012</xref>). For the analysis of the cerebellum the embryos were sacrificed one to four days after electroporation. The whole brain was removed and analyzed for EGFP expression using a fluorescence stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX12). The brain tissue was fixed for two hours at room temperature in 4&#x0025; PFA in PBS. After fixation, the brain tissue was rinsed in PBS and transferred to 25&#x0025; sucrose in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for cryoprotection. In this study, 30 &#x00B5;m-thick sagittal cryostat sections were used for analysis. For the preparation of cryostat sections, the brains were embedded in O.C.T Tissue-Tek (Sakura) in Peel-a-Way<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> disposable embedding molds (Polysciences), frozen in isopentane on dry ice and cut on a cryocut (CM1850, Leica Microsystems). The sections were collected on SuperFrost&#x00AE;Plus microscope slides (Menzel-Glaeser).</p>

<p>Cryostat sections were rinsed in PBS at 37&#x00B0;C for 3 minutes followed by 3 minutes in cold water. Subsequently the sections were incubated in 20 mM lysine in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) for 30 minutes at room temperature before being rinsed in PBS three times for 10 minutes. The tissue was permeabilized with 0.1&#x0025; Triton in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature and then washed again three times with PBS for 10 minutes. To prevent unspecific binding of the antibody the tissue was blocked with 10&#x0025; fetal calf serum (FCS) in PBS for one hour. Rabbit anti-GFP (1:250; Abcam), anti-axonin-1 (rabbit 1:1000 or goat 1:500), anti-Calbindin D-28K (1:2000, CB38a; Swant) and mouse anti-HNF3&#x03B2; (supernatant; 4C7, DSHB) were dissolved in 10&#x0025; FCS/PBS and incubated overnight at 4&#x00B0;C. After three washes in PBS, 10&#x0025; FCS in PBS was applied again for one hour, followed by the incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488 (1:250; Molecular Probes), donkey anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch) or goat anti-mouse IgG-Cy3 (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in 10&#x0025; FCS in PBS for 90 minutes at room temperature.

After 1 (HH35) or 4 days (HH38) 200 &#x00B5;l 50 mM BrdU in H2O were pipetted onto the chorioallantois. After 3 h the embryos were sacrificed, the brains were dissected and prepared for cryostat sections as described above. For visualization of the incorporated BrdU, the sections were incubated in 50&#x0025; formamide in 2xSSC for 1 to 2 h at 65 &#x00B0;C, rinsed twice in 2xSSC for 15 min followed by incubation in 2 N HCl for 30 min at 37 &#x00B0;C. Sections were rinsed in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by PBS (six changes). BrdU was detected with mouse anti-BrdU (Sigma; 1:200) using the protocol detailed above. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (5 &#x00B5;g/ml in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature.</p>

<p>Dil injections sites in open-book preparations were analyzed by an experimenter blind to the experimental condition, using an upright microscope equipped with fluorescence optics (Olympus BX51). All measurements including floor-plate width, thickness of the commissure, spinal cord width, Calbindin fluorescence intensities, real and outer cerebellar circumference, EGL thickness, and number of BrdU positive cells were performed with the analySIS Five software from Soft Imaging System. For all measurements, embryos injected with dsRNA derived from <italic>Endoglycan</italic> were compared with embryos injected with the EGFP plasmid only, and untreated controls. For statistical analyses ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was used except for the rescue experiments, where Tukey&#x2019;s multiple comparison test was used instead.

<caption><title>Domain organization, exon alignment and conservation of the CD34 family of sialomucins</title>
<p>(A) Schematic of the domain organization of CD34 family members. They all contain an N-terminal, highly glycosylated, mucin domain (green), a cysteine-containing globular domain (CGD, yellow), a juxtamembrane stalk region (SR, brown), as well as a transmembrane alpha-helix (TM, red) and a cytoplasmic domain (CD, blue). O-linked glycosylation sites within the mucin domain are depicted in light blue, whereas further sialylated residues are symbolized in purple. N-linked glycosylation sites are not shown. Note, that the indicated glycosylation sites in this scheme are only symbolizing the extensive amount of glycosylation in sialomucins and are not representing the actual position of glycosylation. (B) Exon organization and domain conservation of sialomucins. Transcripts of CD34 family members are encoded by eight separate exons (colored boxes). While the length of exons coding for the cysteine containing globular domain (yellow), the juxtamembrane stalk region (brown), and the cytoplasmic domain (blue) are more or less conserved (exon sizes are given within the boxes), exons coding for the mucin domain (green) vary markedly in their length and organization. The translational start sites are highlighted by the ATG and the end of the coding sequences are indicated by the given Stop codon. Protein homology between the different chicken sialomucins is depicted by the large numbers between the exon pictograms. All domains were compared separately and the colors used indicate the corresponding domains. The first number indicates identical amino acids between the compared proteins, the second number represents conserved residues and the number in brackets designates the amount of gap positions within the alignment of the domains (eg. 28/44 (30)). The alignment was done using MUSCLE version 3.7. configured to the highest accuracy (Edgar, 2004). Single gap positions were scored with high penalties, whereas extensions of calculated gaps were less stringent. Using such parameters homologous regions of only distantly related sequences can be identified. Note, that within the mucin domain only some blocks, interspaced by sometimes large gap regions, are conserved between the different proteins.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Endoglycan is mainly expressed in the developing nervous system</title>
<p><italic>Endoglycan</italic> is expressed only at low levels in non-neuronal tissues. Northern blot analysis of tissues taken from HH38 chicken embryos revealed its high expression levels in the cerebrum (brain without cerebellum), the cerebellum, and the spinal cord. Only low levels were found in muscle, heart, lung, and kidney. GAPDH was used as a loading control.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Downregulation of Endoglycan does not affect Shh expression or spinal cord patterning.</title>
<p>Expression of Shh in the floor plate is required for spinal cord patterning during early stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>). Downregulation of Endoglycan by in ovo RNAi at HH18/19 did not abolish Shh expression in the floor plate at HH25/26. Shh expression in untreated (A) and control-treated (EGFP-expressing) embryos (B) was indistinguishable from embryos lacking Endoglycan (C). Note that the reduction in floor-plate width in embryos lacking Endoglycan (C; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) can also be seen when Shh expression is analyzed. In agreement with our finding that the reduction in floor-plate width was a consequence of axon/floor-plate contact rather than a direct effect of Endoglycan on floor-plate morphology the patterning of the spinal cord was no different in embryos lacking Endoglycan (F) compared to non-treated (D) and control-treated embryos (E). Staining for Nkx2.2, a marker for ventral interneurons that is induced by Shh, was the same in all conditions. Bar: 50 &#x03BC;m.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Endoglycan reduces adhesion of motoneurons</title>
<p>HEK cells stably expressing human Endoglycan (A) or mock-transfected HEK cells (C) were used as carpet for motoneurons dissected from HH26 chicken embryos. Neurons were allowed to attach for x hours. Staining for Neurofilament revealed a pronounced decrease in the number of motoneurons on HEK cells expressing Endoglycan (B) compared to control HEK cells (D). Bar: 50 &#x03BC;m.</p></caption>
