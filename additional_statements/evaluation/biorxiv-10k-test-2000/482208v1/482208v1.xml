<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cancer cell lines often have large structural variants (SVs) that evolve over time. There are many reported differences in large scale SVs between HL-60 and HL-60/S4, cell lines derived from the same acute promyelocytic leukemia sample. However, the stability and variability of inter- and intra-chromosomal SVs between different sources is unknown. Here, we used Hi-C and RNA-seq to identify and compare large SVs in HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cell lines.</p>
<p>Comparisons with previously reported karyotypes identified two non-canonical SVs in HL-60. Ten previously unreported SVs were identified in HL-60/S4. The unreported SVs were generally small enough to be plausibly undetected with traditional karyotyping methods. An expansion centered on MYC was found in a novel genomic location in HL-60. The HL-60 cell line has more within-line structural variation than the HL-60/S4 derivative cell line.</p>
<p>HL-60 and HL-60/S4 karyotypes are generally consistent with the current literature, with some exceptions. Hic_breakfinder is an effective tool for identifying all SVs, but intra-chromosomal SVs are less reliably detected across different samples. The orientation of SV patterns, and strandedness of gene fusions, allowed us to differentiate inversions from other forms of intra-chromosomal SV. Visual inspection of Hi-C heatmap patterns allow further characterization of SVs without additional methods, although orthogonal information such as gene fusions contribute to the characterization.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Karyotyping with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is an effective way of identifying large scale structural variation, but it has relatively low resolution [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Genome wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C), which was developed to identify spatial genome organization [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is emerging as a useful method for de-novo genome assembly [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and identifying structural variants [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The HL-60 cell line was derived from a female acute myeloid leukemia patient in 1976 [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since that time, the HL-60 cell line has been instrumental to breakthroughs in cancer, immunology, and cell biology. For example, HL-60 cells were used to identify retinoic acid as a therapeutic for acute promyelocytic leukemia [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], investigate myelocytic differentiation [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], study neutrophilic behaviors such as migration and respiratory bursting [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and understand the mechanical properties of nuclear envelope components [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Several cell lines have been derived from the original HL-60 cells, including HL-T [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], HL-60/MX2 [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and HL-60/S4 [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], however, the original HL-60 line [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the HL-60/S4 variant are currently the most frequently used in empirical studies [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The HL-60/S4 subline was generated using random mutagenesis and selection for cells supersensitive to retinoic acid-induced differentiation [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A recent karyotype identified novel structural variants in the HL-60/S4 genome when compared to the parental HL-60 cell line [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
<p>A recent survey of MCF7 sublines showed rapid development of genetic diversity and subsequent functional changes in this breast cancer cell line, demonstrating that they cannot be used interchangeably for drug discovery screens or other purposes [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While HL-60 and HL-60/S4 are recognized as different cell lines by ATCC, they are both used for similar studies [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is notable that despite the HL-60/S4 variant being developed as a super-responder to retinoic acid-induced differentiation; modern studies typically treat both HL-60 and HL-60/S4 with 1&#x00B5;M retinoic acid for four days to induce differentiation into the granulocytic form [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we analyzed Hi-C and RNA-seq data from two HL-60 sublines (HL-60 and HL-60/S4) to identify large structural variants (SVs) and gene fusions. We confirm that previously reported SVs can be detected in our HL-60 and HL-60/S4 samples. We also find that the known MYC gene expansion is highly stable, although it has inserted into different genomic locations in the HL-60 and HL-60/S4 genomes. We identify a number of novel intra-chromosomal SVs, many of which were only computationally detected in one dataset using hic_breakfinder but were visually identified in other dataset(s). Karyotyping of HL-60/S4 has previously identified a single inversion on one homolog of chromosome 2. Here we identified multiple additional intra-chromosomal SVs in HL-60/S4.</p>

<title>Structural variants detected with Hi-C and RNA-seq</title>
<p>We used Hi-C data from two sublines of the HL-60 cell line to detect SVs. Hi-C detects a high frequency of contacts between regions of DNA in close linear proximity, a feature which has been exploited to improve genome assemblies [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and detect structural variation [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been previously noted that very high contact frequencies between distal regions of the genome are likely to represent a translocation or inversion compared to the reference genome [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
<p>We detected SVs from Hi-C data in three independent experiments across two versions of the HL-60 cell line. Two independently generated Hi-C experiments were performed using HindIII and MboI and HL-60/S4 cells grown in RPMI 1640 with 1&#x0025; pen/strep and 10&#x0025; serum, in the same laboratory, two years apart [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. An additional Hi-C data set, generated using HaeIII and HL-60 cells grown in RPMI 1640 with 1&#x0025; penicillin/streptomycin and 10&#x0025; serum [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was retrieved from GEO GSE93997. The Hi-C data set from Jacobson et al [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was generated using HL-60/S4 cells that had been differentiated into granulocytes using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment over four days. Therefore, to avoid any treatment-specific effects, we only investigated the genomic structure in ATRA-treated HL-60/S4 cells.</p>
<p>We used hic_breakfinder v1 [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] to identify structural variants from our Hi-C data. Regions of unusually high contact frequency, indicating a possible SV (&#x2018;breaks&#x2019;), were identified in genome structures captured in the HL-60-HaeIII [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], HL-60/S4-HindIII (this study) and in the HL-60/S4-MboI [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] datasets. To further investigate each of these breaks, we visually inspected the putative SVs in Hi-C contact matrices visualized in HiGlass [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We found that hic_breakfinder identified five short range intra-chromosomal breaks in the HL-60/S4-MboI data set that were not supported by visual inspection of the Hi-C heatmap. Therefore, we filtered the hic_breakfinder results to remove breakpoints that were less than 10Mb apart (Supp <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Of the 67 remaining breaks (Supp <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), all except two (1&#x2014;1, 3&#x2014;8; both present in the HL-60/S4-MboI dataset [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) were supported by visual heatmap inspection. In some instances, multiple break locations represent a single SV, and in total we identified 27 SVs. Seven SVs were present in both HL-60 and HL-60/S4, one was unique to HL-60, and 19 were unique to HL-60/S4 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We used STAR-fusion v1.4.0 [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to identify gene fusion products that have been generated by SVs within the HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cell transcription profiles. Gene fusions were identified in two RNA-seq experiments from two different laboratories in HL-60/S4 cells [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These RNA-seq datasets each contained 12 samples from three [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and four [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] conditions respectively. We detected gene fusions in an RNA-seq experiment [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in HL-60 cells, the same source that was used to acquire Hi-C data from, containing four samples from two conditions [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All experimental datasets [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] included both undifferentiated and granulocytic (i.e. all-trans retinoic acid differentiated) cells. STAR-fusion identified a total of 93 putative, unique gene fusions. To reduce the number of spurious fusion calls, we only considered gene fusions that were detected in all samples of a single condition, leaving 17 putative fusion candidates (Supp <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). We then visually inspected the corresponding Hi-C heatmaps to identify SVs that could result in the predicted gene fusion. We identified one previously reported gene fusion in both HL-60 and HL-60/S4 [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and four previously unreported gene fusions in HL-60/S4 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Translocations are reliably detected with hic_breakfinder</title>
<p>Both HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cell lines have previously reported cytogenetic information [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], so we compared these to our Hi-C breakfinder results. The DSMZ catalogue describes the HL-60 karyotype (DSMZ no.: ACC 3), and a recent study has reported FISH karyotyping of HL-60/S4 [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All previously reported translocations and inversions were identified in HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cells (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>As described in early HL-60 cell karyotypes [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], all HL-60 cells contained a set of SVs between chromosomes 5, 7, and 16 and a t(9;14) translocation. A translocation between chromosomes 5 and 17 was not reported in the spectral karyotype, but has been described elsewhere in an early HL-60 study [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and is described in the DSMZ cytogenetic information. The SVs t(5;7)(q31.2;q32.3), t(5;16)(q33.3;q23.2-q23.3), t(7;16)(q32.3;q24.1), t(9;14)(q31.1;q23.2), andt(5;17)(q11.2;p11.2) were detected in all samples (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent FISH karyotype reported additional SVs (i.e. inv(2)(p22.1;q31.2), t(3;14)(q28;q12), t(4;18)(q35.2;q21.1), t(16;21)(p12.1;q22.11)) specific to HL-60/S4 cells [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] that we identified in both Hi-C HL-60/S4-HindIII and HL-60/S4-MboI datasets. The previously reported t(15;16)(q14-q21.1;p12.1-11.2) and t(16;17)(p13.3-p13.11;q11.1-q25.2) translocations [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] were detected with hic_breakfinder in the HL-60/S4-HindIII dataset (this study) but not the HL-60/S4-MboI dataset [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This apparent discrepancy may be due to restriction enzyme choice or other library preparation factors, especially given that both missing regions involve nearby regions of chromosome 16. For instance, MboI is methylation sensitive, while HindIII cuts at any site with the correct motif, regardless of methylation status. Thus, the sequencing coverage across breakpoints can be affected by the choice of restriction enzyme [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>

<title>MYC expansion integrates into different locations within the genome</title>
<p>The MYC expansion that is present in HL-60 cells involves a non-contiguous region of chromosome 8 that is centered on the MYC gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) and amplified many times [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The non-contiguous region of chromosome 8q24 that comprises the MYC expansion has been reported to exist as: a) an extrachromosomal region; b) in the form of double minute chromosomes; and c) integrated into the genome [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The composition of the MYC expansion is highly conserved between HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>), consistent with previous reports. The massive copy number increase means that in an ICE-normalized heatmap, amplified regions appear as densely populated &#x2018;windows&#x2019; compared to the surrounding sparser matrix (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). Due to the high density of these windows, the location of the six amplified regions that make up the MYC expansion can be identified to a high resolution (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The presence of the six amplified regions is consistent with the amplicon described in [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], based on the size and genes contained in each amplified region (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, we observed high sequence coverage of the six amplified regions in normalized DNase hypersensitivity data from ENCODE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>, [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]).</p>

<p>Hi-C heatmaps show the spatial contacts between two genomic locations, with the color of each pixel indicating the contact frequency. a) Hi-C heatmaps have been ICE-normalized to adjust for variable coverage across different regions, but the massive copy number increase of the region centered on MYC has resulted in densely-population regions of the heatmap. The amplified regions are highly conserved across i) HL-60-HaeIII, ii) HL-60/S4-HindIII, and iii) HL-60/S4-MboI. b) The amplified MYC expansion is i) inserted into chromosome 4 in HL-60-HaeIII ii) inserted into chromosome 6 in HL-60/S4-HindIII and HL-60/S4-MboI, and iii) translocated onto chromosome 11 in HL-60/S4-HindIII and HL-60/S4-MboI. c) FISH karyotyping has shown that the t(8;11) translocation is part of a derivative chromosome t(6;8;11) [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given that there was only one breakpoint location identified between chromosomes 6 and 11, we can surmise the order of MYC movement throughout the HL-60/S4 genome. i)A karyotypically normal chromosome 6, gained an 8q24 insertion in the q arm ii). The resultant 8q24;6q22-6qter end of the modified chromosome was then copied and translocated onto the end of chromosome 11 iii). d) Genomic features of 8q24.13-q24.21. DNase hypersensitivity sequencing of HL-60 from ENCODE identifies the six amplified regions characterizing the MYC expansion. The MYC expansion is gene-dense, particularly with non-coding genes (Gencode v24 annotations).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>As reported in [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], chromosome 8 is involved in two SVs, ins(6;8)(q22.2;q24.13-q24.21) and der(6;8;11)(q22.2;q24.13-q24.21;p14.1). Hi-C data for both HL-60/S4 cell lines ([<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], this study) confirms that the MYC expansion is involved in translocations with chromosomes 6 and 11 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). However, in the HL-60 cell line, the MYC expansion appears to be inserted into chromosome 4 (ins(4;8)(q35.2;q24.13-q24.21)) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). One previous report has identified the MYC expansion integrating into t(5;17) [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. By contrast, the DSMZ karyotype reports an insertion of 8q24 (containing the MYC expansion) into chromosome 1p31.</p>
<p>The difference between the insertions of 8q24 into chromosomes 4 and 6 and the translocation of 8q24 onto chromosome 11 is apparent in the Hi-C heatmaps ([<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). Regions of increased interactions with 8q24 are observed upstream and downstream of the chromosomes 4 and 6 breakpoints. By contrast, there are no interactions upstream of the chromosome 11 breakpoint. Notably, there is only one breakpoint identified between chromosome 6 and chromosome 8. These results indicate that the derivative chromosome der(6;8;11) resulted from a translocation between chromosome 11 and the derivative chromosome ins(6;8), and not a translocation between chromosome 6 and 11 that was followed by an insertion of the MYC expansion. Thus, the precise breakpoints identified with Hi-C can identify the likely timeline of genomic rearrangements in this instance.</p>
<p>Collectively, these indicate that the MYC expansion is highly conserved in its composition but inserted into different regions of the genome in HL-60 derivative strains. There could be many reasons for this, but the simplest is that the extrachromosomal MYC expansion integrated into different regions of the genome in different clones of the original HL-60 sample and has remained stably inserted during clonal expansion. However, there is some evidence to the contrary. Namely, an inversion identified in HL-60/S4 but not HL-60 inv(4)(p15.31;15.1) encompasses the location of the MYC expansion insertion (4p15.2), leaving open the possibility that the inversion is the result of MYC excision. If this is the case, the MYC expansion may continue to excise and insert into different genomic locations and could even be responsible for other SVs identified in HL-60 genomes.</p>

<title>Hi-C identifies non-canonical translocations in HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cell lines</title>
<p>We detected a translocation between chromosomes 10 and 13 (t(10;13)(p12.1;q12.12)) in the HL-60 cells that was not identified in either of the HL-60/S4 samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). This translocation has been reported previously in HL-60 cells [<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] but is absent from the HL-60 derived cell line HL-T [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and is not described in the DSMZ cytogenetic information. Higher resolution inspection in HiGlass [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] confirms that this translocation is not present in HL-60/S4 datasets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). Karyotype analysis shows that HL-60/S4 cells have two complete versions of chromosome 10 [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], further indicating that this translocation was not present in the original leukemia sample. Moreover, the Hi-C pattern indicates the derivative chromosome consists of chromosome 10 (&#x223C;25-133Mb) and chromosome 13 (&#x223C;23-114Mb) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>), a large &#x223C;200Mb chromosome that should be detectable with any cytogenetic analysis method.</p>

Characterization of t(14;21) in HL-60/S4. i) Heatmap of the breakpoint confirms that this translocation is absent from HL-60. iii) Heatmap of the whole of chromosome 21 and chromosomes 14, 15, and 16, indicate a series of linked SVs. The HL-60 t(10;13)(p12.1;q12.12) SV was present in the HL-60 Hi-C dataset, provided by the China Infrastructure of Cell Line Resources, but not the DSMZ cytogenetic information. Due to the large (&#x223C;200Mb) derivative chromosome this translocation creates, its absence from cytogenetic information is unlikely to be due to usage of a low-resolution karyotyping method [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. By contrast, the omission of the previously unreported inter-chromosomal SVs in HL-60/S4, which are small and/or complex, is likely to be due to the use of karyotyping methods that do not involve sequencing [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></caption>

<p>We identified previously unreported translocations between chromosomes 1 and 3 (t(1;3)(p36.32;q28)), and 14 and 21 (t(14;21)(q12;q22.11-q22.12)) in both HL-60/S4 Hi-C datasets ([<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], this study). Visual inspection of these putative SVs at multiple resolutions in HiGlass [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] confirmed that these translocations are not present in the HL-60 Hi-C dataset (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b,c</xref>). While the HL-60 t(10;13)(p12.1;q12.12) translocation results in a large derivate chromosome, the t(1;3)(p36.32;q28) and t(14;21)(q12;q22.11-q22.12) variants that are observed HL-60/S4 are much more subtle and would require confirmation with breakpoint PCR. In particular, the chromosome 21q22.11 translocations with chromosomes 14q12 and 16p12.1 may have generated a derivative chromosome or had two independent breaks on each homolog of chromosome 21. A further putative translocation was identified between chromosome 21q22.11 and chromosome 15q11.2. Despite hic_breakfinder not detecting a translocation between chromosomes 21 and 15 in either HL-60/S4-HindIII (this study) or HL-60/S4-MboI [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] datasets, there is a gene fusion TUBGCP5--TMEM50B identified across all HL-60/S4 samples and conditions that supports an SV between chromosomes 21q22.11 and 15q11.2. Heatmap inspection revealed poor sequence coverage across these regions, which may have obscured the breakpoint from detection.</p>

<title>Intrachromosomal SVs are sensitive to Hi-C detection</title>
<p>Inter-chromosomal SVs were generally identified across all samples using both the karyotyping and Hi-C datasets. By contrast, intra-chromosomal SVs (e.g. inversions) were less likely to be previously reported, and more likely to be missed by hic_breakfinder in one of the HL-60/S4 Hi-C datasets.</p>
<p>A deletion on chromosome 5(q23.3-31.1) was detected with hic_breakfinder in the HL-60-HaeIII and HL-60/S4-MboI Hi-C datasets and has weak visual evidence in the HL-60/S4-HindIII Hi-C dataset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). This deletion has been previously detected [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but is not reported in the DSMZ karyotype. Notably, the chromosome 5 SV contains a cancer-associated locus (5q31.1) that is frequently deleted in non-small cell lung carcinoma [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>

<p>Inversions on chromosomes 4(p15.31;15.1) and 20(p11.23;q11.23) were identified with hic_breakfinder within the HL-60/S4-MboI Hi-C dataset, while an inversion on chromosome 17(q21.1;q21.32) was detected in HL-60/S4-HindIII Hi-C dataset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). An SV on chromosome 18(q21.1;q21.32) was identified with hic_breakfinder within the HL-60/S4-MboI dataset. An inversion of 18p on one homolog was reported previously [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but this SV shows evidence of a large deletion and another unclassified SV that results in an unusual chromosome structure (Supp <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig 1</xref>). Critically, all of these intra-chromosomal SVs were visible in both samples upon visual inspection of the Hi-C heatmap (Supp <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>A fusion gene arising from the t(2;2)(p24.2;p13.1) SV further indicates that the SV is the result of a translocation between homologous chromosomes, not an inversion. Specifically, gene fusions arising from inversions (e.g. RALGAPB--RBBP9) have different strandedness of the left and right parts of the chimeric transcript, as the region has been &#x2018;flipped&#x2019;. Both halves of the SMC6--SLC4A5 fusion are negatively stranded, as is seen in fusions resulting from inter-chromosomal translocations such as CYFIP2--PLCG2 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Triaging putative gene fusions with Hi-C</title>
<p>Gene fusions are typically generated by genomic rearrangements [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], therefore gene fusions detected from RNA-seq data should occur at SV breakpoints identified with Hi-C data. Of the 17 gene fusions identified across all replicates of at least one condition (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Supp <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>), five unique predicted gene fusions occurred at breakpoints detected with hic_breakfinder, including two fusions located at the same breakpoint (SMC6--SLC4A5 and SMC6--AC006030.1), and a sixth (TUBGCP5--TMEM50B) had some visual support from Hi-C, despite poor sequence coverage across the region (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2cii</xref>). A further three predicted fusions had breakpoints less than 10Mb apart, and therefore their causal SV would not have been detected by our analysis. Two predicted fusions were between genes on the same chromosome, and so may have resulted from undetected SVs, given the reduced sensitivity of Hi-C to detect intrachromosomal SVs. Six predicted fusions occurred between genes on different chromosomes, and had no corresponding SV detected with Hi-C data. Although it is possible that these gene fusions were generated by an alternative mechanism, such as trans-splicing [<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we predict these are false positives and would not prioritize these candidates for follow-up (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we identified shared and unique SVs in the related HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cell lines. In HL-60, we identified two SVs that have been reported previously, but not consistently across HL-60 karyotypes [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and one novel insertion. We identified 10 previously unreported SVs in HL-60/S4, that were likely too small to be detected by a recent FISH karyotype [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We found that intra-chromosomal SVs were more sensitive to Hi-C method than inter-chromosomal SVs. We identified four novel gene fusions in HL-60/S4, including one that identified a likely translocation that was not identified with Hi-C. We confirmed the conserved composition of the known MYC expansion, and found it inserted into a novel location (4p15.2) in HL-60. We also identified an inversion encompassing this region (4p15.31-p15.1) in HL-60/S4, providing possible evidence of MYC insertion and excision contributing to HL-60 genome evolution.</p>
<p>Hi-C data is predominantly generated with the purpose of investigating the spatial organization of genomes [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but the same data can be repurposed to investigate genome structure without any additional wet-lab work [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The complexity of the genomic data that Hi-C generates has many uses and it represents a resource for SV detection.</p>
<p>Previous reports have identified the difference between reciprocal and non-reciprocal translocations based on Hi-C heatmap patterns [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In our analysis, we identified that four out of the eleven intrachromosomal SVs in HL-60/S4 cells were not inversions (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), based on the orientation of the butterfly block. In one instance, this was supported by the strandedness of a gene fusion that resulted from the SV (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In some instances, the complexity of the SVs, such as those seen with chromosome 21q22.11 and 18q21 in HL-60/S4, were difficult to interpret using Hi-C datasets alone. However, these SVs were also in some instances undetected by FISH karyotyping, presumably due to the small size of the rearranged regions. Analyzing Hi-C datasets was therefore able to highlight these for further, targeted analysis.</p>

<caption><p>Summary of structural variants in HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cells.</p></caption>

</table-wrap>
<p>A recent study demonstrated that inter-chromosomal SVs could be detected precisely with Hi-C in a mouse erythroid cell line [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and primary human brain tumors (five glioblastomas and one anaplastic astrocytoma), however, they did not report any intra-chromosomal SVs [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. An SV detection tool developed by Dixon et al [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] was able to identify both intra- and inter-chromosomal structural variations. However, they did not use the Hi-C data to distinguish different forms of structural variation. Instead, they utilized optical mapping to characterize SVs. While this is preferable, patterns in Hi-C heatmaps can also be used to differentiate inversions from other forms of intra-chromosomal SVs without additional costs.</p>
<p>The automated SV detection tool [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] is highly effective at identifying SVs. However, substantial additional characterization requires visual inspection of the putative SVs. New tools need to be developed to include the orientation and symmetry of SVs and thus determine whether they resemble a reciprocal or non-reciprocal translocation, inversion, or other form of SV. In theory, copy number variation can be detected with Hi-C [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the different restriction enzymes (i.e. HindIII, MboI, HaeIII) used in each Hi-C sample analyzed here complicated the analysis of genomic coverage. Despite this, the dramatic copy number increase of a region centered on the MYC gene (8q24) created a Hi-C heatmap pattern, even after matrix balancing to adjust for varied coverage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). The composition of the region (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) was consistent across all three datasets, and with the literature [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The MYC expansion was inserted into chromosome 4p15.2 in HL-60 but was involved in SVs with chromosomes 6q22.2 and 11p14.1 in HL-60/S4. The precise breakpoints that we determined with Hi-C allowed us to deduce the probable order of these two SVs (ins(6;8)(q22.2;q24.13-q24.21) and der(6;8;11)(q22.2;q24.13-q24.21;p14.1), <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). While the location of the MYC expansion was stable across two HL-60/S4 samples, it does not appear to be stable across different HL-60 sources, with our analysis showing an insertion into chromosome 4p15.2, while the DSMZ cytogenetic information describes an 8q24 insertion into chromosome 1, a 1990 study found it inserted into a t(5;17) translocation, and a spectral karyotype reported an insertion of chromosome 8 into the p arm of chromosome 11, but no chromosome 6 insertion [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
<p>We propose that the MYC expansion either; a) was stably inserted into different genomic locations during seed-lot generation at different repositories, or b) is a mobile element that may be inserted and excised, contributing to HL-60 genome evolution. If the former is true, different sources of HL-60 should confirm and report the current location of the MYC expansion, and derivative strains named if their MYC expansion location is different from the canonical strain (i.e. ATCC HL-60). Further experimentation should be performed to ascertain whether the MYC expansion remains able to move around the genome. For instance, HL-60 could be grown for many passages, possibly with the addition of a mutagenic agent to encourage homologous recombination. Samples would be collected at many time points, and then PCR performed with two forward primers aligned to the end of the MYC expansion, and random hexamers as the reverse primers. This would amplify sequences that occur at a junction with the MYC expansion, and the amplified products sequenced. The resulting library would confirm whether the MYC expansion is stably inserted, or whether it is mobile and warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>The MYC extra-chromosomal element is particularly well described in HL-60 cells, but MYC (and MYC homolog) extra-chromosomal amplifications have been identified in a number of different cancers, most commonly leukemias and glioblastomas [<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. MYC deregulation in cancer generally increases the expression levels of the MYC gene, maintaining cancer cells in a highly proliferative state [<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Intriguingly, overexpression of MYC is sufficient to drive genomic instability and induce the formation of extra-chromosomal elements such as double minutes [<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], meaning that amplification of MYC can drive further amplification of MYC in a positive feedback loop. If these amplifications can also contribute to genome rearrangements via insertion and excision of extrachromosomal copies, this could provide a second mechanism by which MYC amplifications can contribute to genomic instability, and subsequently tumor development and progression.</p>
<p>The t(10;13) translocation was identified in the HL-60 cell line by Hi-C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>) but not the DSMZ cytogenetic information [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Unlike the non-canonical deletion on chromosome 5, the t(10;13) translocation involves large regions, and it should be detectable with any form of karyotyping. The t(10;13) translocation has been previously reported [<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but its absence from HL-60/S4 datasets ([<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], this study) indicates it was not in the original leukemia sample. Therefore, it is likely that the t(10;13) translocation is absent from other HL-60 stocks. In contrast, the deletion on chromosome 5 is present in all samples, and likely is unreported in DSMZ due to its small size.</p>
<p>Hi-C alone is not sufficient to perform a comprehensive analysis of all structural variations within a cell line. Rather, comprehensive characterization of SVs requires validation and investigation from orthogonal techniques [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite this, Hi-C can provide substantial information regarding the location and type of SVs. Moreover, Hi-C and RNA-seq libraries are often generated together in gene regulation studies (e.g. [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). As such, integrating automated detection tools, e.g. hic_breakfinder [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and STAR-Fusion [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with visual heatmap inspection can provide substantial information regarding genomic SVs without any additional cost.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>HL-60/S4 cells have a stable karyotype, with a number of small SVs that are not detected with FISH-karyotyping. HL-60 cells from the China Infrastructure of Cell Line Resources have two large SVs that are distinct from the DSMZ karyotype (t(10;13)(p12.1;q12.12), ins(4;8)(q35.2;q24.13-q24.21)), and a small deletion del(q23.3-q31.3) that is unlikely to be detected with traditional karyotype approaches. The MYC expansion has a stable composition but is found in a different genomic location in each HL-60 cytogenetic analysis, indicating it may act as a mobile element. Hic_breakfinder was effective at identifying inter-chromosomal translocations and intra-chromosomal SVs above 10Mb apart. Visual inspection of SV patterns in the Hi-C heatmap distinguished inversions from other forms of intra-chromosomal SV, which was supported by the gene fusions identified with STAR-Fusion. Hi-C and RNA-seq are effective tools to characterize the location and type of genomic SV.</p>
