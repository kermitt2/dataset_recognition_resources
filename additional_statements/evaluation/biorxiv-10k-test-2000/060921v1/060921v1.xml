<title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: The first Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>) genome assembly published in 2011 was one of the early genome assemblies exclusively based on high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing. Since then, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have led to a multitude of assemblies generated from complex genomes, although many of these are of a fragmented nature with a significant fraction of bases in gaps. The development of long-read sequencing and improved software enable the generation of more contiguous genome assemblies.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: By combining data from Illumina, 454 and the longer PacBio sequencing technologies, as well as integrating the results of multiple assembly programs, we have created a substantially improved version of the Atlantic cod genome assembly. The sequence contiguity of this assembly has increased fifty-fold and the proportion of gap-bases has been reduced 15-fold. Compared to other vertebrates, the assembly contains an unusual high density of tandem repeats (TRs). Indeed, retrospective analyses reveal that gaps in the first genome assembly were largely associated with these TRs. We show that 21 &#x0025; of the TRs across the assembly, 19 &#x0025; in the promoter regions and 12 &#x0025; in the coding sequences are heterozygous in the sequenced individual.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: The use of multiple assembly programs combined with inclusion of PacBio reads drastically improved the Atlantic cod genome assembly by successfxully resolving long TRs. The high frequency of heterozygous TRs within or in the vicinity of genes in the genome indicate a considerable standing genomic variation in Atlantic cod populations, which likely is of evolutionary importance.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The speed and affordability of sequencing and improved software, including more efficient genome assemblers, have lead to a democratization of genomics, enabling individual research groups to create <italic>de novo</italic> genome assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The first published <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies for non-model organisms using pure massively parallel sequencing approaches (Illumina and 454) appeared in 2010-2011 and include diverse species such as giant panda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], woodland strawberry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] and Atlantic cod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Numerous genome assemblies from a myriad of non-model plants, invertebrates and vertebrates are now available, including examples of genomes that are difficult to assemble, e.g. the extremely large genomes of bread wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] and Norway spruce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], the highly heterozygous genome of oyster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and the tetraploid and repetitive salmon genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. These genome assemblies have provided new insights into a range of fundamental biological questions, including the first example of a vertebrate immune system, that of Atlantic cod, without MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], the untangling of the events of multiple hybridizations shaping the ancestral genomes of bread wheat prior to domestication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and the multiple avian genomes resolving bird phylogeny, their radiations and investigation of the genetic basis of complex traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Despite the tremendous impacts of the high throughput sequencing generated genomes, many of these assemblies are of varying completeness, depending on the purpose for which they have been obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. In the examples given above, the sizes of the scaffold sequences are usually far shorter than chromosome arm lengths. Most of these genomes have scaffold N50 lengths (i.e., half the assembly is in scaffolds of this length or longer) in the range of 400 kbp &#x2013; 1.5 Mbp, although some avian genomes have N50 scaffold lengths up to 10 Mbp, approaching chromosome arm lengths. However, contig N50 lengths are far smaller and in the range of 3 kbp &#x002D; 55 kbp.</p>
<p>The presence of repetitive DNA is the most important factor that leads to fragmented genome assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Assembly algorithms struggle to resolve repetitive regions if these are longer than the read length, and this problem particularly affects the assembly of sequencing data from short-read technologies such as the Illumina platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Repetitive regions can be divided into two classes, interspersed and tandem repeats. Interspersed repeats, including transposable elements (TEs), occur across the genome and are present in all vertebrate genomes, comprising from 5 &#x0025; to 55 &#x0025; of their assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Tandem repeats (TRs) are sequences with a repeat unit repeated more than two times in tandem. TRs typically occupy 0. 5 to 3 &#x0025; of eukaryotic genomes, and can be classified into microsatellites, simple repeats, or short tandem repeats (STRs, 1-6 bp, or 1-9 bp repeat unit size); minisatellites (10-100 bp) and satellite repeats (&#x003E;100 bp repeat unit size) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. TRs mutate by adding or removing full repeat units and their mutation rates, at least for STRs, are 10 to 10,000 fold higher compared to the average rates in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The heterozygosity caused by TR mutations, in addition to other types of heterozygosity, are also likely to have confounding effects on the contiguity of genome assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore address the drawbacks of short-read technologies by being able to read through larger repeat regions, and are therefore particularly well-suited for de novo genome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Including moderate amounts of PacBio coverage (5-20x) can dramatically improve the contiguity of an assembly in combination with other sequencing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. More extensive coverage (&#x003E;50x) has enabled assemblies of vertebrate genomes reconstructing nearly complete chromosome arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], although the associated costs may be economically prohibitive. Nonetheless, a sequencing strategy including long-reads is recommended to aid reducing the fragmentation typical of <italic>de novo</italic> genome assemblies based on a short-read technology only. Regardless of sequencing strategy, usage of a genetic linkage map, or an optical map, can place contigs or scaffolds into chromosome-sized reconstructions, called linkage groups, a prerequisite for large-scale genome comparisons between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The first release of the Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>) genome was sequenced and assembled with the 454 sequencing technology only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] and annotated by the Ensembl Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] (gadMor1). The 832 Mbp assembly was fragmented, with a contig N50 2.3 kbp and 27 &#x0025; of bases in gaps. The genome contained 17.8 &#x0025; transposable elements and 5.9 &#x0025; tandem repeats (Supplementary Table 6 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]). An increased abundance of TRs (unit size 1-4 bp) at the contig termini (32 &#x0025;), and at the gaps in scaffolds (24 &#x0025;, Supplementary Note 7 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]) indicated these repeats contributed to the observed level of fragmentation.</p>
<p>A more contiguous reference genome for Atlantic cod, preferably with chromosome-level reconstructions, will facilitate re-sequencing efforts addressing population genomics investigations, including detecting structural variants, introgression and hybridization between species, as well as improve comparative genomic investigations relying on synteny. Moreover, it would also enable an annotation with more complete gene models and allow for a better understanding of the lack of sequence contiguity in gadMor1. To achieve this, we created several assemblies using different combinations of Illumina, 454 and PacBio sequencing technologies as well as Sanger BAC-end sequences, using a suite of assembly programs. As often is the case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], no single assembly outperformed the others in various criteria (N50 contig/scaffold length, gene content, agreement with a genetic linkage map, accordance with read data), and thus a reconciled assembly was created to integrate the best characteristics of four draft assemblies. This new assembly, denoted gadMor2, has a fifty-fold improvement of the contig N50 length of gadMor1, and eight times as long scaffold N50, with 1.7 &#x0025; bases in gaps compared to 27 &#x0025; in gadMor1. A linkage map (personal communication, Sigbj&#x00F8;rn Lien) was used to order and orient the scaffolds into linkage groups. The new genome assembly and annotation reveal a high content of tandem repeats compared to other vertebrates, across the genome, and most notably in promoter regions and within amino acid coding sequences. Many of these TRs are heterozygous and we propose that this has implications for understanding local adaptation at a population level.</p>

<title>An improved genome assembly for Atlantic cod</title>
<p>In addition to already existing sequencing data for the wild-caught individual from the North East-Arctic population described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] (&#x007E;40x Roche/454 and &#x007E;0.1x Sanger BAC-ends), we added sequencing data from Illumina (&#x007E;480x coverage) and PacBio (&#x007E;19x coverage) (Supplementary Table 1) obtained from DNA isolated from the same individual. Different assembly strategies were used: a Newbler assembly with 454 and Sanger BAC-end sequences as input (referred to as NEWB454 for short), an ALLPATHS-LG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] assembly with the Illumina sequences only (ALPILM), a Celera Assembler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] assembly with 454 and Illu-mina sequences (CA454ILM) and a Celera Assembler assembly with 454 paired reads, Illumina reads and raw, uncorrected PacBio reads (CA454PB) (Supplementary Table 1). For each of the individual assemblies, different combinations of the assembly improvement programs Pilon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and PBJelly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] were applied to improve the consensus sequence and to close gaps (Supplementary Table 2). The properties of these assemblies were assessed using multiple tools: those based on the mapping of read datasets to an assembly: <italic>FRC<sup>bam</sup></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], REAPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]; comparing a transcriptome to an assembly:Isoblat (using the Newbler transcriptome, see Methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]; comparing the assembly to a linkage map (see Methods); and determining presence and completeness of conserved eukaryotic and Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) gene sets: CEGMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] and BUSCO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] (Supplementary Table 2).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="060921_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Based on these evaluations, each separate assembly had distinct properties, and none clearly outperformed any of the other on all metrics. For instance, the NEWB454 assembly has the largest scaffold N50 and the lowest number of conflict sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the CA454PB outperforms the other assemblies based on contig N50, yet has a lower scaffold N50 and higher number of sequences conflicting with the linkage map (sequences that map to two linkage groups) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Existing assembly reconciliation tools are limited to combining just two assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] and did not perform satisfactory. To obtain the best possible assembly, i.e., to integrate the information recovered by the different assemblies, we developed a novel assembly reconciliation method. This method involved an all against all alignment of the assemblies using Mugsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] after splitting the different assemblies when in conflict with the linkage map (see Methods) and removing sequences shorter than 1000 bp. The resulting alignment graph structure was traversed following the path from one of the original assemblies (CA454ILM, the one with the most genes found with CEGMA and BUSCO), outputting the sequence from the assembly with the least gaps (CA454PB), while using the alignments with ALPILM and NEWB454 in the graph to close gaps and extendscaffolds. The scaffold module from SGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] was applied on the resulting merged assembly using all paired reads (Illumina, 454 and sequenced BAC-ends), Pilon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] was used to improve per-base accuracy and to close or reduce gaps. The resulting assembly was ordered and oriented based on a linkage map of 9355 SNPs (personal communication, Sigbj&#x00F8;rn Lien) placing 93 &#x0025; of the sequences into 23 linkage groups (Supplementary Table 3). We call this assembly gadMor2. Comparisons of assembly statistics for the final, reconciled assembly (gadMor2) and the original four (CA454ILM, CA454PB, ALPILM and NEWB454), show that gad-Mor2 outperforms all other assemblies on all quality metrics apart from scaffold N50 (ranked 2<sup><italic>nd</italic></sup>) and CEGMA gene content (ranked 3<sup><italic>rd</italic></sup>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Based on an overall assessment of quality, gadMor2 combines the best features of each of the four original assemblies without loss of quality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The gadMor2 assembly has a fifty-fold larger contig N50 and eight-fold larger scaffold N50 compared to the gadMorl assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. This has dramatic consequences for the sequence contiguity; for instance, a 100kbp region containing the HoxC cluster is a single contig in gadMor2, while it previously consisted of 21 contigs and 20 gaps in gadMorl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Genome size</title>
<p>Estimation of genome size with odd-sized kmers from 17 to 31 with SGA PreQC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] on the 300 bp insert size, 100 bp reads, paired end Illumina reads (about 150x coverage), resulted in a genome estimate of 613 Mbp&#x00B1;11 Mbp (Supplementary Table 4), while the assembler ALLPATHS-LG estimated the genome to be 651 Mbp based on the k-mer distribution of the 180 bp insert size, 100 bp reads, paired end Illumina reads (about 52x coverage). Both estimates are lower than previous ones based on Feulgen Image Analysis Densitometry at 0.93 pg or 910 Mbp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] and a k-mer analysis based on 454 reads, which resulted in a 830 Mbp estimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Although the assembly size of the gadMor1 Atlantic cod genome assembly at Ensembl is 832 Mbp with 26.9 &#x0025; gaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], the amount of sequence in contigs for this assembly is 608 Mbp, considerably closer to the SGA PreQC estimate. The likely explanation for the large size of gadMor1 is that many of the contigs could not be placed into a scaffold, and a gap was created at that locus instead. These unplaced contigs are included in the output contigs, resulting in loci represented twice in the assembly, once as a gap and once as a contig. The assemblies created in this study all span approximately 650 Mbp, which is similar to the ALLPATHS-LG estimation. Given the consistently lower range of values of the current k-mer analyses and genome assembly lengths, we here choose 650 Mbp as a likely more accurate Atlantic cod genome size estimate.</p>

Compared to gadMor1 (20,095 predictions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], the gadMor2 annotation contains more predicted genes and significantly more sequence in the predicted transcriptome (32.2 Mbp and 52.9 Mbp, respectively).

With 2,621,997 SNPs, this corresponds to a (SNP) heterozygosity rate of 4.07 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x002D;3</sup> (one segregating site every 246 bp).

<p>We investigated to what extent different assemblers and sequencing technologies resulted in a difference in annotated TRs. Phobos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] was used to find all TRs with a unit size of 1-50 bp, at least 13 bp long (different from the TRs classified above), in the different cod assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>).

<p>The most prominent class of TRs in gadMor2 is dinucleotide TRs, which make up 48.7 &#x0025; of all annotated repeats, followed by mononucleotide, trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeats comprising only 7.6 &#x0025;, 6.3 &#x0025; and 6.3 &#x0025;, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The average length of dinucleotide repeats is 84.4&#x00B1;87.2 bp, at an average 97.3 &#x0025; identity. In total, dinucleotide repeats make up 5.7 &#x0025; of the entire gadMor2 assembly.

<title>Heterozygous TRs</title>
<p>We used lobSTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] to investigate the occurrence of heterozygous TRs (i.e., different repeat length between the same locus on the homologous chromosomes) in the sequenced cod&#x2019;s genome. lobSTR analyses TRs with unit length of 1-6 bp (i.e., STRs), and uses Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] to detect them in the genome assembly. lobSTR both annotates the STRs and discovers variation in STR length. In the sequenced individual, lobSTR annotated 980,400 STRs that passed filtering (1,182,796 in total, see Methods), of which 47,718 were heterozygous.</p>
<p>Compared to Phobos (which annotated 640,938 TRs of units 1-6 bp), lobSTR annotated almost twice as many STRs, and the distributions of the lengths of STRs between the two programs are quite different (Supplementary Figure 3), with lobSTR identifying relatively short STRs, and Phobos annotating relatively long STRs. Given that lobSTR is based on alignment of the 100 bp read length Illumina reads, and since the average length of a TR is 84.32 bp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>), lobSTR&#x2019;s ability to detect heterozygous STRs is limited to around 45 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. As an alternative, we used the intersection between TRs annotated by Phobos and indels annotated by either FreeBayes (using Illumina reads, 169,635 intersections) or PBHoney (using mapped PacBio reads, 43,521 intersections). The union of these two sets comprised 145,435 indels in the 640,938 STRs (1-6 bp unit size) annotated by Phobos, about three times as many as annotated by lobSTR alone. For TRs of unit sizes 1-50 bp, there are 183,898 indels in 876,691 TRs (21 &#x0025;). Altogether our results indicate that at least one-fifth of the TRs in the sequenced individual are heterozygous.</p>

<title>An improved genome assembly for Atlantic cod</title>
<p>We here present a new and significantly improved version of the Atlantic cod genome assembly with successful integration of different sequencing technologies. The final assembly (gadMor2) was created using a novel reconciliation method, aimed to combine the strengths of four separate assemblies to an integrated assembly that is maximized with regards to desired metrics, i.e. contig length, scaffold lengths, gene content and accordance with read data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The individual assemblies used for the reconciliation were based on different combinations of sequencing technologies and assembly programs and varied widely in quality along the metrics studied. Importantly, the inclusion of the long PacBio reads, which spanned many more repeats than other sequencing technologies, resulted in an assembly (CA454PB) with a contig N50 an order of magnitude larger than the other assemblies, and this contributed directly to the large contig N50 of the final assembly. To our knowledge, the specific approach used in generating CA454PB, where the raw, uncorrected PacBio reads were first trimmed and then assembled without correction, together with Illumina and 454 data (see Methods), has not been described previously. A similar approach was used in generating one assembly for Atlantic salmon (see Supplement to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]), but the sequence in that assembly did not contribute to the final assembly. End-sequenced BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes) libraries provide long-range information in the 100 kbp range, and we have such sequences available for Atlantic cod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The insert size distribution of the BAC-end library was bi-modal (Supplementary Figure 10 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]), which is not handled properly in the Celera Assembler. We therefore included this data in the Newbler assembly (NEWB454) only, which contributed this assembly having the largest N50 scaffold of the original assemblies. The assembly using a combination of 454 and Illumina sequencing reads (CA454ILM) was the most complete assembly with regards to genes as found by the assembly validation tools CEGMA and BUSCO. While the available Illumina sequencing read datasets did not exactly match the recommendations for ALLPATHS-LG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], the resulting assembly (ALPILM) performed better than gadMor1 with regards to N50 contig and scaffold metrics. Still, this assembly did contribute in the assembly reconciliation process, resulting in some longer scaffolds. Our results illustrate a dilemma for obtaining high-quality genome assemblies: different combinations of datasets and software using algorithms optimized for certain characteristics of the datasets yield assemblies that are of good quality on different combinations of desired quality criteria, but hardly ever on all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Assembly reconciliation helps solve this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], but even our integrated assembly does not rank best on every single metric evaluated. Further improvements in sequencing technology and assembly algorithms are necessary to make genome assembly a solved problem.</p>

</fig>
<p>Due to the fragmented nature of the first version of the Atlantic cod genome, gadMor1, gene-models were reconstructed during annotation using information from the stickleback gene annotation (i.e., ordering and orienting the contigs based on stickleback gene models), and was manually curated (Supplementary Note 17 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]). In contrast, the gadMor2 gene models were automatically annotated directly on the genome assembly. This automated annotation did not annotate pseudogenes, in contrast to the manual curated annotation for gadMor1. The difference in annotation might explain why the CEGMA validation results are slightly lower for the new reference genome since well-annotated gene models in stickleback would be transferred to gadMor1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The gadMor2 assembly shows fewer indications of potential assembly errors as detected by <italic>FRC<sup>bam</sup></italic> and by comparison to the linkage map, but more according to the REAPR program. This difference is associated with longer contigs and scaffolds in gadMor2, which enabled REAPR to estimate more long-range errors. The predicted transcrip-tome is larger in gadMor2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), although more genes are found with BUSCO in the gadMor1 predicted transcriptome. The genes BUSCO is designed to detect are often short (as conserved genes are often short [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]), which means they are more likely put together properly in the gene-model optimized gadMor1 assembly, since longer genes would be more likely to be fragmented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Causes of fragmentation of cod assemblies</title>
<p>To understand the fragmented nature of gadMor1, we first focused on the rate of heterozygosity, as substantial differences between the homologous chromosomes of diploid organisms can fragment an assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. We compared the heterozygosity rate of the gad-Mor2 genome assembly (same individual as gadMor1) to three other fish with genomes for which such data is available, i.e. the miiuy croaker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], three-spined stickleback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] and Atlantic herring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], and to the seq squirt <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], a species with extremely high heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The genomes for the fishes have been assembled to high contiguity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Although a direct comparison might be confounded by the differences in population structure and the individuals chosen for sequencing (in addition to different datasets and programs used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]), and with more uncertainty connected with calling indels correctly than with SNP calls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], there are substantial differences between the different species. gadMor1 had a N50 contig size of 2.3 kbp 1, substantially smaller than even <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic> which has an order of magnitude higher SNP rate than Atlantic cod. While the species with higher SNP rates seem to have smaller N50 contig size (disregarding cod), the sequencing and assembly strategies for the different organisms vary. For gad-Mor1, may have had some impact on the fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), but is not the main explanation.</p>
<p>Different combinations of sequencing technology and assemblers vary in their proportion of TRs present in the resulting genome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Assemblies with higher density in TRs also have more sequence in contigs (i.e., less sequence in gaps), indicating that TRs are more completely assembled. The more fragmented assemblies (ALPILM, NEWB454 and gad-Mor1) have a lower density of TRs and shorter TRs on average, suggesting that TRs led to fragmentation of the assembly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Indeed, these assemblies havea much higher proportion (40&#x002B; &#x0025;) of contig termini intersecting TRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) than the TR density of 10.9 &#x0025; in gadMor2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Only CA454PB and (the largely CA454PB derived) gadMor2 have about 10 &#x0025; of their contig termini intersecting TRs. The remaining gaps in CA454PB and gadMor2 are associated with a lack of sequence coverage and transposons longer than the PacBio read lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This illustrates the importance of the availability of the PacBio reads, which was the only read type able to span the multitude of TRs in the genome. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, gadMor2 has a much higher contiguity, while a large fraction of gaps in gadMor1 are flanked with TRs. Thus, our approach taken to assemble the genome has addressed the fragmentation that affected the gad-Mor1 assembly. In conclusion, the high occurrence of TRs in the cod genome has caused the fragmentation of gadMor1 and all assemblies except CA454PB and (the largely CA454PB derived) gadMor2. Without the inclusion of reads obtained from the PacBio technology, or similar sequencing technologies that can span long tandem repeats, assembly of genomes with a high density of TRs, such as the Atlantic cod&#x2019;s, to a high sequence contiguity will be significantly more challenging.</p>

<title>The Atlantic cod genome reveals an extraordinary high density of TRs</title>
<p>We have confirmed and extended previous results showing high genomic densities of STRs in Atlantic cod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>] in a sample comparing 68 genomes of eukaryotes (mostly vertebrates, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). While most of the species studied have fewer than 2.5 &#x0025; of bases in TRs, California sea hare, kangaroo rat and Atlantic cod have more than 6 &#x0025; bases in TRs. Atlantic cod has by far the highest density (amount of sequence in TRs) and frequency (the rate of TRs, Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) of tandem repeats in the whole genome assembly, coding regions and promoters, with only California sea hare having a higher frequency (but not density) of TRs in promoter regions, that is, more but shorter repeats.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Potential role of TRs in evolutionary processes in Atlantic cod</title>
<p>The mutation rates of TRs, and especially STRs, are orders of magnitude higher than that of other genomic sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. In the sequenced individual, we find that a fifth of the annotated TRs are heterozygous, with somewhat lower proportions in promoters (19 &#x0025;) and coding regions (12 &#x0025;). These results are based on the mapping of Illumina and PacBio reads, but are likely underestimations. Most of the TRs in cod have a short repeat unit, and these mutate by adding or removing, for instance, two nucleotides in the case of dinucleotide repeats. Small differences between two long alleles of a TR would likely not be captured in the analyses in this work, because the Illumina reads would not map well to these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>], and the PacBio reads might not give sufficient resolution.</p>
<p>In humans TRs are best known for connection with multiple diseases such as Huntington&#x2019;s Disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. In other species, variability (multiple alleles at a locus within a population) in TRs in promoter regions has been connected with diverse phenomena as behavior in voles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>] to skull form in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. In both <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and humans, some promoter regions contain TRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>], for which variation in length has been linked to variation in expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. TRs in promoter regions might also contribute to expression divergence in great apes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>] and might be connected to speciation in primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. There is also variability in TRs in genes leading to functional variation as in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> where TRs in cell-wall genes underlie variation that causes alterations in phenotype, with different genotypes have differences in adhesion, flocculation or biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. Further, in Hawaiian mints, variation in a gene coding for a flowering time protein is connected with colonization and radiation of the plant, with longer versions of the gene existing in younger populations and is suggested to contribute to morphological change and speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. It is interesting to note that Atlantic cod has a higher frequency of TRs than these species in both promoters and coding regions (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>
<p>The sequenced individual was from the North-East Arctic cod population, the largest cod population in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>], with a large effective population size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>]. Extrapolating the high mutation rate of TRs, and the observed level polymorphism in this single individual, suggests that most TRs are polymorphic at a population level. These polymorphic TRs will contribute substantially to standing levels of genomic variation in Atlantic cod populations within and in the vicinity of genes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Atlantic cod has an extraordinary amount of tandem repeats compared to other species. This repeat content has led to complications in assembling the genome, which has been overcome with the usage of the long PacBio sequencing reads and reconciliation of multiple assemblies. The large amount of tandem repeats are likely to have an evolutionary impact, since they should result in a large amount of repeat-associated genetic variation in Atlantic cod populations. It remains to be investigated how cod populations evolve under variable environmental conditions with respect to TRs, and whether selection for repeat variation can lead to rapid evolutionary adaptations.</p>

All Illumina libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 using V3 chemistry 100 bp paired end reagents.</p>
<p>PacBio SMRT sequencing was performed on PacBio RS instrument (Pacific Biosciences of California Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA) at Norwegian Sequencing Centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sequencing.uio.no/">www.sequencing.uio.no/</ext-link>) and at Menlo Park. Long insert SMRTbell template libraries were prepared at NSC (10kb insert size) and Menlo Park (22 kb insert size) according to PacBio protocols. In total, 147 SMRT cells were sequenced using C2 and XL polymerase binding and C2 and XL sequencing kits with 120 min acquisition. Approximately 7.6 Gb of library bases were produced from 10 kb SMRTbell libraries sequenced on 102 SMRT cells using C2/C2 chemistry (average polymerase read length of 3 kb). The 22 kb SMRTbell library was sequenced using C2/XL (22 SMRT cells, average polymerase read length of 4.5 kb) and XL/XL (23 SMRT cells, average polymerase read length of 5 kb) chemistry producing 5.5 Gb of library bases.</p>

Only half of the fragment reads were used in the assembly (Supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), selected as an option, to have the recommended coverage. The release R48639 of ALLPATHS-LG was used.</p>

<title><italic>Newbler assembly, NEWB454</italic></title>
<p>Newbler version 3.0 was used to assemble the 454 sequencing data together with BAC-ends previously generated for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], with the options &#x201D;&#x002D;large &#x002D;het &#x002D;repfill &#x002D;sio &#x002D;info &#x002D;a 0&#x201D;. In contrast to the Newbler assembly done for the first version of the Atlantic cod genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], we did not filter out 454 reads consisting entirely of short tandem repeats, as newer versions of the Newbler program are better able to deal with these reads.</p>
<p>In its output, Newbler gives a file with all scaffolds, including all unscaffolded contigs longer than 2 kbp, and a separate file with all contigs, regardless of their inclusion in a scaffold. Using BLAT version 3.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>] we mapped the flanking sequences of SNPs in the linkage map (personal communication, Sigbj&#x00F8;rn Lien) (n&#x003D;9355) to all contigs. For each mapped SNP, the longest contig to which it mapped was added to the primary output, with the rationale that sequences with SNPs should be included in the assembly. The final assembly thus contain all scaffolds, all contigs longer than 2 kbp and the longest unplaced contigs with a mapped SNP.</p>

<title><italic>Celera Assembler assembly based on 454 and Illumina reads, CA454ILM</italic></title>
<p>Celera Assembler&#x2019;s meryl (SVN snapshot dated 2nd of April 2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] was used to count kmers in the two paired end Illumina read libraries, of 180 bp and 300 bp insert sizes and of length 100 bp.</p>
<p>FLASH version 1.2.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>] was used to merge the overlapping reads from the 180 bp library using default options.</p>
<p>The merTrim program, also from Celera Assembler, was used to correct Illumina reads by changing infrequent kmers to frequent kmers: starting from the first (last) frequent kmer in a read, if the next (previous) kmer is infrequent, then the most recently added base must be an error. To correct it, the three substitution changes are tested; if all kmers spanning this base are now frequent, the change is accepted. If not, the four insertion and one deletion changes are tested; likewise, if all kmers spanning this change are now frequent, the change is accepted. Otherwise, the base is left unchanged. Finally, the read is trimmed to the largest region with all kmers designated as frequent kmers.</p>
<p>Celera Assembler was used to remove duplicate reads from the 300 bp and 5 kbp Illumina reads libraries with its run runCA-dedupe pipeline.</p>
<p>All 454 reads were converted from &#x002E;sff files to &#x002E;fastq and &#x002E;frg files using Celera Assembler&#x2019;s sffToCA with options &#x201C;&#x002D;linker flx &#x002D;linker titanium &#x002D;insertsize ins_size std_ins_size &#x002D;trim chop &#x002D;libraryname lib_name &#x002D;output output_name&#x201D;, with insert sizes and standard deviations at 1100, 320; 1230, 350; 1440, 440; 1760, 470; 2650, 700; 7000, 1900; 19000, 4750 for the different sequencing libraries increasing in insert size (Supplementary Table 1). The insert sizes and standard deviations were gathered from the output of a Newbler assembly which calculated this.</p>
<p>The 454 reads were error corrected using the mer-Tim program, as above, and trimmed as described in Priifer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>], which removes duplicated pairs of reads, error-prone ends of reads, reads with sequence not confirmed by other reads and chimeric reads. Because the insert length distribution of the paired reads from the 20 kbp 454 mate pair library showed a bimodal distribution (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]), and because Illumina mate pair libraries contain contamination with pair of reads with the opposite orientation, the scaffolds from this assembly were used to filter out reads from the 20 kbp 454 library and the 5k Illumina library by mapping the reads to the scaffolds using BWA-MEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], and removing any pair of reads that mapped closer than 10 kbp and 2 kbp, respectively.</p>
<p>After the error correction steps, all 5 kbp mate pair Illumina reads, 6x coverage of the 300 bp insert size Illumina reads and 25x of the merged 180 bp insert size Illumina reads were assembled together with all the 454 reads. Seqtk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>] from November 2012 was used to extract these reads.</p>

</fig>
<p>The assembly contain all paired 454 reads, 25x of merged reads from the 180 bp insert size Illumina library and the trimmed PacBio reads, and was run with Celera Assembler 8.2 alpha. To accommodate vastly different error rates between the Illumina/454 and PacBio reads, overlaps were computed using a different percentage maximum allowed error (inverse of percentage identity) cutoff for each pair of technologies being overlapped. Overlaps between Illumina and 454 reads were computed to a maximum of 6 &#x0025; error and minimum overlap of 100 bp; overlaps between an Illumina/454 read and a PacBio read were computed to a maximum of 20 &#x0025; error, also with a minimum overlap of 100 bp; overlaps between two PacBio reads were computed to a maximum of 40 &#x0025; error and minimum overlap of 1000 bp. The bogart unitig construction algorithm will pick, for each read end, the longest overlap and use only those for constructing initial unitigs, similar to the BOG algorithm in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Bogart uses clusters of partially aligned reads (discovered via pre-computed overlaps) to detect junctions between repeat and nonrepeat sequence. If a detected repeat is spanned by either a read or a mate-pair, the repeat is left intact, otherwise, the unitig is split into at least three pieces:one for each side of the repeat, and at least one for the repeat itself.</p>
<p>The rest of the assembly process was run as normal, aside from much higher error rate acceptance at all steps and a non-default selection of unique unitigs. Because PacBio reads confuse Celera Assembler&#x2019;s classification of unique unitigs (which can be used as seeds for creating contigs) and non-unique unitigs (often repeats that could be placed several times in the assembly), we ran the classification tool markRepea-tUnique by hand, specifying that unique unitigs could not have a single reads spanning more than 90 &#x0025; of its length, up to 15 &#x0025; of the unitig could have a depth of only 3 reads, and must have had at least 200 reads and be at least 10,000 bp long.

<title><italic>Validation</italic></title>
<p>To evaluate assembly quality, several validation tools were applied. Both REAPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] and <italic>FRC</italic><sup>bam</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] use paired Illumina reads to evaluate an assembly, giving a measure of the number of potential errors. Instead of using the raw reads, we used error corrected reads dumped from the ALLPATHS-LG assembly, reducing the running time of both the alignment step and the tools themselves.</p>
<p>Isoblat was used to determine how much of the New-bler transcriptome of 454 and Sanger reads was aligned to the different assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. It was run with default options.</p>
<p>CEGMA is a tool that annotates 458 highly conserved genes in an assembly, and it can be used to assess the completeness of the genome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Version 2.4 was applied to all different versions of the assemblies.</p>
<p>BUSCO is similar to CEGMA in that it assesses the completeness of a genome by trying to find a set of universal single-copy orthologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. In this study, we used the actinopterygii specific set of 3698 genes to investigate the completeness of the assemblies generated here.</p>
<p>9355 of SNPs have been used to produce a linkage map (personal communication, Sigbjorn Lien). We used blat_parse.py to compare the linkage map to different assemblies to evaluate the completeness and long-range correctness. Briefly, this involved mapping the flanking sequences of the SNPs to the assembly using BLAT version 3.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>] and options &#x201D;&#x002D;noHead &#x002D;maxIntron&#x003D;100 genome.fasta flank&#x002D; ing_sequences.fasta&#x201D; and then parsing the output file while comparing with the order of the SNPs in the linkage map. A conflict with the linkage map is defined when a sequence had SNPs mapped to it belonging to more than one linkage group. Some SNPs mapped equally well to more than one linkage group, and these were excluded since we could not confidently judge which mapping was correct.</p>

<title>Merging of assemblies</title>
<p>Each assembly was aligned against itself using nucmer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>], and any sequences fully contained in another sequence with more than 98 &#x0025; identity were removed. Scaffolds were split with a split_asm_lg.py (available on the github repository together with the other scripts mentioned in this section) if they conflicted with the linkage map. A scaffold in conflict is split into three pieces, from the start for the scaffold following one linkage group to the last basepair in the flanking sequence of the last SNP in that linkage group, and from the first basepair in the flanking sequence of the first SNP in another linkage group. The middle piece is not used since we do not know where exactly the transition from linkage group to another happens. Sequences shorter than 1000 bp were removed to better facilitate the whole assembly alignment process.</p>
<p>The four assemblies selected for merging were aligned together using Mugsy. Mugsy uses nucmer from the Mummer package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>] to find similar sequence in different assemblies and subsequently refines the alignment. It outputs a MAF (Multiple Alignment Format) file, consisting of blocks of multiple alignments with information where exactly in the sequences the alignment is (starting at 100 bp and ending at 300 bp in scaffold X in assembly Y for instance), which was
parsed by merge_asms.py. Based on validation criteria described above, one assembly was chosen as the skeleton (CA454ILM), and a second assembly was chosen as the sequence contributing part (CA454PB). The CA454ILM assembly was chosen as skeleton because it was the most complete with regards to genes, and CA454PB was chosen as sequencing contribution assembly was chosen because it had the least gaps. A first pass through the alignment blocks of the first assembly was used to close gaps using the sequences from the CA454PB assembly, or the sequence in each alignment block with the least amount of missing bases. A second pass through the alignment blocks of the first assembly tried to connect scaffolds from the first assembly (CA454ILM) using scaffolds from other assemblies spanning two scaffolds in CA454ILM. Mugsy was run with these options:</p>

<p>A repeat library for MAKER gene annotation (see below) was created by running RepeatModeler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] version 1.0.8 on the finished genome assembly with default options.</p>
<p>We also created a repeat library specifically for annotation of transposable elements (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/uio-cels/Repeats">github.com/uio-cels/Repeats</ext-link>). First, RepeatModeler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] version 1.0.8 was run on only the scaffolds longer than N50. LTRharvest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] and LTRdigest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], both parts of genometools (version 1.5.7), were used to detect LTR retrotransposons and TRIMs. LTRharvest found LTR retrotransposons with LTRs larger than 100 nt, smaller than 6000 nt and with 1500 to 25000 nt between, with a target site duplication (TSD) length of 5 nt. TRIMs were detected by lowering the LTR length requirements to a minimum of 70 nt and a maximum of 500 nt with maximum 1500 nt of internal sequence. Harvested putative LTR retrotransposons were filtered using LTRdigest, which checked for tRNA binding sites. In addition, LTRdigest used Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles to identify retrotransposon enzymes (from the GyDB HMM profile collection of retrotransposon specific enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>]). Elements without both tRNA binding sites and a retrotransposon specific enzyme were discarded.</p>
<p>We used scripts provided by Ning Jiang, Megan Bowman and Kevin Childs (Michigan State University) to perform the next analyses. Only elements containing primer binding sites (PBS) and/or a polypurine tract (PPT) was kept, and only if at least half of the PBS or PPT sequence were located in the internal regions of the putative element and only if the distance between the LTRs and the PPT/PBS sequence were less than 20 bps. Elements that passed this test were subjugated to further filtering where sequence gaps of &#x2265;50 nt were discarded. MUSCLE version 3.8.31 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>] was used to align flanking sequences, and elements with &#x2265; 60 &#x0025; similarity in flanking sequences was excluded.</p>
<p>Nested LTR retrotransposons were detected by using RepeatMasker with the left LTR sequences of the putative elements and a library of transposases (from a curated library included in the software TEseeker v1.04 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>]). Consensus sequences were produced after all vs. all comparisons using BLASTN. Finally, no elements of different families shared 80 &#x0025; sequence over 90 &#x0025; of their length.</p>
<p>RepeatClassifier, which is a program included in RepeatModeler, was used to classify the elements. As LTR retrotransposons and TRIMs contain tandem repeats in their long terminal repeats, RepeatClassifier classified some elements as being tandem repeats. These elements were renamed to being LTR retro-transposons or TRIMs, while those that were classified into specific LTR families kept their new classification. TransposonPSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>] was also run. TransposonPSI uses PSI-BLAST to detect distant homology between genomic sequences and a TE library bundled with the program. Contrary to the other programs, TransposonPSI does not output the consensus sequences of elements detected, which made it necessary to perform an additional clustering step. The output sequences were clustered using CD-HIT-EST 4.6.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>] with a similarity cutoff of 80 &#x0025;. The relative high amount of dinucleotide repeats in the Atlantic cod genome assembly, led to a large fraction of sequence being labeled as transposons of the CACTA superfamily, as the CACTA representative in the TransposonPSI library contained a tandem repeat that spurred false alignments. Thus, elements were only named CACTA if two sources agreed in the classification, the other source being the results of a BLASTX search against the repeat peptide database provided with Repeat-Masker (version 4.0.6).</p>
<p>As the detection tools might detect repetitive non-TE genes such as gene families, the sequences were checked for alignments (using BLASTX) with sequences in the curated protein database of UniProtK-B/SwissProt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>], which was downloaded November 20th 2015. Sequences were also checked against the repeat peptide database that comes with distributions of the RepeatMasker software. Sequences with matches in the UniProtKB/SwissProt database, but not in the repeat peptide database were discarded. The BLASTX search against repeat peptides in the database also served to classify some of the unclassified elements.</p>
<p>Some sequences remained unclassified, and a collection of HMM profiles was downloaded from the Dfam database (Dfam.org) and HMMER3 was run using the &#x2018;nhmmer&#x2019; module. This further classified some elements into LTR retrotransposons, LINEs, SINEs or DNA transposons. The <italic>de novo</italic> library was merged with known eukaryotic repeat sequences from RepBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>] (version 20150807) and served as input for Repeat-Masker.</p>

<title>Investigating heterozygosity</title>
<p>To investigate the heterozygosity of this individual of Atlantic cod, we mapped the 300 bp insert size Illumina sequencing library to the genome assembly using bwa mem version 0.7.9a with the &#x002D;M option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Samtools version 1.1 was used to sort the bam files.</p>

<p>SNP and indel calling was done on the merged bam file using FreeBayes version v0.9.14-17-g7696787 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], and SNP and indel calls with a quality more than 20 were kept with &#x2018;vcffilter &#x002D;f &#x201C;QUAL &#x00BF; 20&#x201D;&#x2019;. Vcfstats was run on the resulting VCF file, giving the number of SNPs, MNPs, indels and complex regions.</p>
<p>We also mapped all PacBio reads using blasr from SMRT-Analysis 2.3.0, and called indels using PB-Honey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>] giving all indels larger than 20 bp. This numbered 70,278.</p>

<title>Genome wide short tandem repeat analysis</title>
<p>Tandem repeats of unit size 1-50 bp were detected with Phobos version 3.3.12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], options set were &#x201D;&#x002D;s 12 &#x2013; outputFormat 0-U 50&#x201D;, i.e. requiring a minimum score of 12 for each tandem repeat, that is, the TR needed a score above 12, i.e. at least 13 mononucleotides, 7 dinucleotide, 5 trinucleotide repeat units, etc., Phobos native format as output and up to a motif, or unit, size of 50 bp. A minimum score of 12 would mean that mono-, di-, and trinucleotides repeats had to have a minimum length of 13, 14 and 15 bp to exceed the minimum score, 13, 7 and 5 repeated units respectively. A range of 1-50 bp was chosen in accordance with Mayer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. A config file was then provided for the sat-stat version 1.3.12 program, giving a diverse output of file with different statistics and a gff file:</p>

<p>In addition, STRs were detected with lobSTR 4.0.

A lobSTR index was created with the bed file and the genome, and allelotype classified the STRs using the Illumina 300PE library previously mapped with BWA, using these options:</p>

<p>In addition to the different cod assemblies analyzed, we downloaded all assemblies from Ensembl release 81 (n &#x003D; 68) (including Atlantic cod) and the California sea hare.</p>
<p>Star et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] released three different assemblies, one based on Newbler, one on Celera Assembler and a gene-model optimized, annotated version of the New-bler assembly, which is the one available from Ensembl and indicated herein as gadMor1. In gadMor1 contigs were reshuffled according to stickleback proteins during annotation, which resulted in significant improvements with regards to gene model construction compared with the original assembly. In all comparisons between different cod assemblies performed for this work, we compared to the gadMor1 assembly, since it is annotated and likely the one most used.</p>

<title>Contig terminus analysis</title>
<p>Contigs from the assemblies of ALPILM, NEWB454, CA454PB, CA454ILM, gadMor1 and gadMor2 were created with the cutN &#x002D;n 1 from seqtk version 1.0-r75, which cut at each gap (of at least one basepair, i.e. one or more Ns). The contigs were mapped against the gad-Mor2 assembly with BWA 0.7.12 and get_positions_&#x002D; non_soft_hard_clip.py was used to create a BED file with only the edges of contigs that map uniquely with a mapping quality of 3 or more.</p>
<p>The intersect option from bedtools version 2.24.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>] was used to find overlaps between the contig termini and indels based on PBHoney tails output, SNPs, indels, MNPs and complex regions from mapping Illumina reads (300 bp insert size) to the genome, STRs called by Phobos, lack of coverage by Illumina, 454 and PacBio reads (zero depth as determined by mapped reads and bedtools genomecov), transposons and low complexity regions from RepeatMasker.</p>

<title>Heterozygous tandem repeats</title>
<p>We used bedtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>] 2.24.0 to find the intersecting between the indels called by FreeBayes and PBHoney, and the TRs as annotated by Phobos. Indels were filtered based on depth (at least 5 reads) and genotype (0/1, heterozygous).</p>

<p>In the annotation of Atlantic cod, some genes were annotated that consist predominantly of TRs. Since these were in the annotation, they have some evidence in the form of protein or transcriptome alignment, and have an open reading frame. However, they seem to have no significant similarity with proteins from Swis-sProt/UniProtKB, and were removed based on this. This left 19,035 genes for this particular analysis.</p>
