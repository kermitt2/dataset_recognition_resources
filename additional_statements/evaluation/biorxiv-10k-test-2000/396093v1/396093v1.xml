<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Aluminium in acid soils is a hindrance to crop growth. Nonetheless, Brazilian Cerrado possesses many species such as <italic>Qualea grandiflora</italic>, which are adapted to acid soils with large amounts of Al and accumulate this metal in its tissues and organs. Nonetheless, the mechanisms involved in these processes are poorly understood, mainly at molecular level. Thus, a root proteomic analysis was accomplished to identify Al-responsive proteins in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants. Concomitantly, a root growth analysis of plants grown with and without Al supplementation was conducted to determine the effects of Al on the whole plant. Subsequently, proteins from both treatments were identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS in a label-free fashion. From the 2,520 identified proteins, 410 were differentially abundant between the two treatments, which were associated with carbohydrate metabolism, redox activity, stress response and catabolism of organic compounds. Furthermore, Al was crucial for the growth and development of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>. In fact, this species may have an Al-dependent metabolism. Moreover, it was possible to correlate plant growth to Al-upregulated proteins that were directly involved in cell wall synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, genetic information processing, and amino acid metabolism. Additionally, this work provides an extensive dataset of Al-regulated protein in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>, which will be crucial to understanding the functions of Al in this species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aluminium (Al) is highly abundant in soils worldwide where it is found in different chemical species. In acidic conditions (pH &#x003C; 5.5), these compounds are found as Al<sup>&#x002B;3</sup>, which constitutes one of the most toxic form of Al, which is limiting for crop production. Nevertheless, there are plants that do not resent the presence of Al<sup>&#x002B;3</sup>, and some of which are commonly found in the Brazilian Cerrado. The Cerrado biome is a neotropical savannah whose soils are usually acid, with low fertility and high Al contents [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Minerals play many crucial roles in plants. To determine the importance or essentiality of nutrients is necessary to verify the following criteria: 1) the element absence impairs the growth of the plant preventing it to complete its life cycle; 2) the signs of an element deficiency can only be reverted, exclusively, with its supplementation; 3) the element integrates a molecule or partakes of an essential biochemical reaction in the plant. These issues are termed as essentiality criteria. It has been suggested that some Cerrado plants, compulsorily, need Al to grow [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nonetheless, the importance of Al for these plants, including for <italic>Qualea grandiflora</italic> Mart., has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>The Cerrado encompasses about 2 million km<sup>2</sup> and represents 23&#x0025; of the Brazilian territory. This biome is regarded as the savannah with the highest biodiversity in the world and contains a large percentage of endemic plants [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite that, the Cerrado has been rapidly degraded, and its natural vegetation replaced by crops such as soybean, corn, and cotton. Therefore, the Cerrado is among the top 25 hotspots in the world [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Based on that, it is crucial to undergo efforts to study its native flora, which have enormous potential for medicinal, pharmaceutical, food as well as it constitutes a gene bank for plant genetic improvement.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, several Cerrado plant species not only tolerate Al but also require it for proper growth and development. These plants usually belong to the families Rubiaceae, Melastomataceae, and Vochysiaceae. For instance, several species of <italic>Miconia</italic> spp (Melastomataceae), <italic>Palicourea rigida</italic> (Rubiaceae) and many plants of the genera <italic>Vochysia</italic> and <italic>Qualea</italic> (Vochysiaceae) need Al to grow and develop [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>Qualea grandiflora</italic> Mart. (Vochysiaceae) has been chosen to investigate the metabolic role of this metal in native plants. Minerals play various crucial roles in plants. <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> is a tree that reaches up to 15 m height and occurs in different phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado. This plant can accumulate about 5.0 g of Al.kg<sup>-1</sup> of dry matter, and it is considered a compulsory Al-accumulating species [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Several genes and proteins associated with different metabolic pathways are induced in response to abiotic stimuli. The proteins encoded by the responsive genes to abiotic elicitors have also been located in various cell compartments such as cell wall, membranes, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. At the molecular level, there are many reports on Al-responsive genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, wheat, citrus, rice, soybean, tomato and many others plant species [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Besides, the information given by these studies is associated with Al tolerance/resistance in response to a stress elicited by this metal. For instance, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the absence of <italic>STOP1</italic> activity, a gene that encodes a zinc finger-like protein [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and <italic>AtALMT1</italic>, which encodes a malate transporter protein caused hypersensitivity to Al [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Also, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, increased expression of <italic>WAK1</italic>, a gene encoding a cell wall kinase, significantly enhances Al tolerance [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that protein interacts with AtGRP3, a glycine-rich protein to control root size [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In fact, the outcome of AtWAK1/AtGRP3 interaction is usually cell elongation repression, which consequently results in shorter roots [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been proposed that only free AtWAK1 (no AtGRP3 interaction) augments Al tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As consequence, <italic>Arabidopsis grp3-1</italic> knockout mutants have longer roots and a higher tolerance to Al, mimicking the overexpression of <italic>AtWAK1</italic> gene [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, proteomics has been used to identify Al-responsive proteins. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Wang et al. (2014)</xref> found 106 differentially abundant proteins from Al-treated rice roots and observed that the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis processes were upregulated by Al. In addition, all glycolysis/gluconeogenesis related genes were more expressed in Al-tolerant rice cultivar than in the sensitive [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This fact suggests energy availability is crucial for Al-tolerance.</p>
<p>To date and to the best of our knowledge, data on genes and proteins involved in Al metabolism and accumulation from Cerrado plants are rare, and there is no proteomic study in plants where the lack of Al maybe stressful. Therefore, the present investigation is part of an ongoing research project directed towards unravelling the role of Al in native species. Accordingly, <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants were grown with and without Al supplementation with the purpose of quantifying the abundance of Al-responsive proteins. The differential abundance of proteins allowed the drawing of an initial picture of which metabolic pathways are either up or downregulated due to the presence of this metal.</p>

<title>Plant materials, growth conditions and treatments</title>
<p><italic>Qualea grandiflora</italic> Mart. (Vochysiaceae) seeds were sterilized, put to germinate in a germination chamber and then cultivate in sterile vermiculite. Forty <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants (20 per treatment) were watered every two days with 1/5 MS (Murashige and Skoog) salts [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], pH 4.2-4.5, supplemented or not with AlCl<sub>3</sub> (150 &#x00B5;M). Root samples of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> from Al-treated and no-Al treatments were collected after 90 days of cultivation. Each biological replicate was composed of the whole root system from six <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants, and three biological replicates of each treatment were analysed. Subsequently, the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in a freezer at &#x2212;80 &#x00B0;C for protein extraction.</p>

<title>Growth analysis</title>
<p>For growth analysis, each treatment was composed of 20 <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants grown with or without Al in three replicates. At 120<sup>th</sup> day of cultivation, the following parameters were analysed: shoot length, root length, root fresh and dry weights, and photosynthetic pigment contents. For fresh weight, <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants were removed from vermiculite, slightly dried on paper towel and weighed. For dry weight, roots were dried in an oven at 72 &#x00B0;C, for 72 h and then weighed.</p>
<p>Six leaf discs of 0.5 cm in diameter from three different plants of each treatment were placed in microcentrifuge Eppendorf tubes containing 2 ml DMF (N, N -dimethylformamide-HCON (CH<sub>3</sub>) <sub>2</sub>). The tubes were wrapped in aluminium foil and stored for 48 h at 4 &#x00B0;C. Afterwards, the absorbance of each extract was measured at the wavelengths of 663.8 nm, 646.8 nm and 480 nm on a Thermo Spectronic spectrophotometer. Therefore, the contents of chlorophylls a and b, and carotenoids was calculated as proposed by Wellburn (1994), as follows:</p>

<p><italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> leaf samples of plants cultivated for 120 days from both treatments were fixed overnight in Karnovsky fixative in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) at 4 &#x00B0;C. The leaf samples were: green leaves from Al-treated plants, green leaves and yellow leaves from non-treated plants. Subsequently, the leaf samples were post-fixed in 1&#x0025; osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>) in the dark for 30 min. Then, the samples were dehydrated in a graded acetone series (30&#x0025;, 50&#x0025;, 70&#x0025;, 90&#x0025;, 100&#x0025;). Afterwards, the samples were infiltrated in acetone:SPURR (v/v) and embedded in SPURR (100&#x0025;) resin for 24 h each step. Ultrathin sections (60 nm) were made on an ultramicrotome and then mounted on nickel grids (300 mesh) and observed on the transmission electron microscope (Jeol JEM 1011) at 60 KV.</p>

<title>Root protein extraction</title>
<p>Approximately 100 mg of each root sample were ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Then, the powder was added to a solution of 10&#x0025; (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 0.07&#x0025; (v/v) &#x03B2;-mercaptoethanol in cold acetone, and the resulting suspension was thoroughly mixed by vortexing, and then incubated for 3 h at 4 &#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4 &#x00B0;C. Then, the supernatant was removed, and the remaining pellet was washed five times with 10&#x0025; (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in acetone until the total disappearance of pigments. The pellet was dried using a Speed-Vac concentrator and resuspended in rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 250 mM TEAB, pH 8.5). Protein concentration was determined by using Qubit<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> 2.0 assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and extracted protein quality was assessed in 10&#x0025; SDS-PAGE.</p>

<title>Protein digestion</title>
<p>The extracted proteins (200 &#x03BC;g) were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 60 min at 56 &#x00B0;C and alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 60 min at 37 &#x00B0;C in the dark. Then, the samples were diluted in 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (ammonium bicarbonate), pH 8.1. Subsequently, the alkylated proteins were digested with trypsin (1:50 v/v &#x2013; Promega, Madison, USA) at 37 &#x00B0;C for 16 h. After digestion, the resulting peptide solution was acidified with 0.1&#x0025; trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. Then, the supernatant was desalted in homemade microcolumns (C<sub>18</sub> stage tips), vacuum-dried, and resuspended in 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formic acid. After, the sample was quantified by Qubit<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> 2.0 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) for further analysis by liquid nano-chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer.</p>

<title>Chromatography and nano LC-MS/MS analysis</title>
<p>The tryptic peptides were applied to an Ultimate 3000 liquid chromatographer (Sunnyvale, USA) for reversed phase nano-chromatography as following: three technical replicates of 1 &#x03BC;g from each biological replicate were injected into a trap column (2 cm &#x00D7; 100 &#x03BC;m), containing C<sub>18</sub> 5 &#x03BC;m particles. The samples were eluted to an analytical column (32 cm &#x00D7; 75 &#x03BC;m, C<sub>18</sub> 3 &#x03BC;m), and then to the ionization source of the spectrometer. The elution gradient was composed of 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formic acid in water (solvent A), and 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B), in a gradient of 2&#x0025; to 35&#x0025; solvent B for 180 min.</p>
<p>The eluted fractions were placed in the ionization source of the LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) and were analysed in DDA (data dependent acquisition) mode, produced MS1 spectra in the Orbitrap analyser (resolution of 120,000 FWHM at 400 m/z) in the range of 300-1650 m/z. For each MS1 spectrum, the 15 most intense ions with charge greater than 2 were automatically chosen and directed to high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. Repeated fragmentation of the same precursor was prevented by dynamic exclusion for 90 s. The configuration for HCD was: insulation window 2.0 m/z, automatic gain control (AGC) of 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> and maximum fill time (maximum TI) of 100 ms, with collision energy normalized to 35&#x0025; and threshold for the selection of 3000.</p>

<title>Database search and label-free quantification</title>
<p>The files obtained from the mass spectrometer were analysed using the software Progenesis IQ for alignment of the MS1 peaks found in the chromatograms, extracted ion chromatogram (XIC)-based quantification and normalization. A first statistical analysis was performed before the identification of the MS1 features, to filter for identification only those presenting ANOVA p-values &#x003C; 0.05.</p>
<p>After the peptide peaks were quantified and grouped, the identification of proteins was performed using Peaks 7.0 software, which deduced sequences from the fragmentation information and searched the sequence database of the <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> transcriptome deposited at the NCBI (National Centre for Biotechnology Information), BioProject PRJNA358394 (130.704 <italic>Searched Entries</italic>). The search parameters used were: precursor ion mass error tolerance of 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance of 0.05 Da, carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (fixed modification) and deamidation and methionine oxidation (variable modification). Trypsin was selected as the digestion enzyme, and up to two missed cleavage sites per peptide were allowed.</p>
<p>The identified proteins were filtered at a rate of 1&#x0025; for false discovery rate (FDR), and a minimum of one unique peptide per protein was required for identification.</p>
<p>The protein identification information was imported into the Progenesis IQ software, which combined them with previously generated quantitative data. Multivariate PCA analysis was performed in Progenesis to evaluate the grouping of replicates and conditions, as well as to cluster the abundance profiles. In this study, a protein was considered differentially abundant when it presented fold-change &#x2265; 1.5 with p &#x2264; 0.05 after the ANOVA test at the protein level.</p>

<title>Al Influence on Shoot and Root Growth</title>
<p>A growth analysis of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> shoots and roots was performed to investigate whether the morphological differences observed between the treatments were associated with the lack of Al supplementation. The results indicated that Al was critical for growth and development of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants. Note that leaves from Al-supplemented plants were greener than those from non-treated plants. Moreover, it is noteworthy that shoots and roots from Al-treated plants were considerably higher and the roots were longer and more branched (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, after 120 days of cultivation the average length of shoot of Al-treated plants was about 14&#x0025; higher than shoots from non-treated plants. In roots this difference was even greater and reached 24&#x0025; in favour of plants grown with Al (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of Al-responsive proteins in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots</title>
<p>Gel-free and label-free approach were used to determine the proteomic changes in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots grown with or without Al-supplementation. A total of 2,520 distinct proteins were identified in both treatments by using a transcriptome sequence database and PEAKS and PepExplorer software. For the identification of differentially abundant proteins, it has been considered a fold-change &#x2265; 1.5 and a p-value &#x2264; 0.05 (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots a total of 410 differentially abundant Al-responsive proteins were identified (Supplementary Table 2), and most of which upregulated, totalizing 274 proteins (67&#x0025;). Complementarily, the remaining 136 (33&#x0025;) were downregulated in response to Al.</p>
<p>The differentially abundant proteins were catalogued according to their functional categories established by GO terms (Blast2GO), and the proteins are depicted with individual identification, the number of peptides, score and fold change values (Supplementary Table 2).</p>

<title>Functional classification of Al-responsive proteins</title>
<p>The 410 Al-regulated proteins were analysed and classified within the following GO terms as determined by Blast2GO 4.1: biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC) and molecular functions (MF). It is important to say that the actual number of Al-responsive proteins may be different from the summation of all categories, since some proteins can be classified into multiples groups.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> depicts the main biological processes induced by Al in roots of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>. Therefore, some proteins involved in response to stimulus (7&#x0025;), biological regulation (4&#x0025;), metabolic process (28&#x0025;), cellular process (34&#x0025;), single cellular process (23&#x0025;), and cellular component organization/biogenesis (4&#x0025;) were differentially abundant.</p>

<p>The most enriched BP categories in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots were metabolic processes whose proteins were associated with nitrogen compound metabolism, biosynthetic process, organic substance metabolism, catabolic process, regulation of cellular process, single organism metabolism, and primary metabolism.

<p>In addition, the main cellular components associated with Al response in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots were located at plasma membrane, cell wall, plastid, mitochondrion, and ribosomal subunits, as well as the extracellular compartment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

<p>Concerning the molecular function category of Al-responsive proteins, most of them were associated with binding activity (40&#x0025;), catalytic activity (53&#x0025;), and structural molecule activity (7&#x0025;) as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>.</p>

Compared with no Al treatment, 272 (66.3&#x0025;) out the 410 differentially abundant proteins were annotated in the KEGG database and assigned to 117 different metabolic pathways. Also, the results showed that differentially abundant proteins were mainly involved in genetic information processing, followed by carbohydrate metabolism, cellular processes, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and lipids (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<label>4.1.</label>
<title><italic>Qualea grandiflora</italic> required Al for growth and development</title>
<p>Al is harmful to many plant species. Nonetheless, <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> belongs to a category of plants that requires Al to grow and develop [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the focus of the current investigation is the proteome of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots, the data on shoot growth, morphology and ultrastructural chloroplast features are crucial to establish the general health condition of plants from both treatments. The primary observation is that <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> growth was stimulated by Al. Also, the morphological analysis of shoots from plants that did not receive Al revealed severe signs of stress such as low shoot elongation and chlorosis.</p>
<p>Leaf chlorosis is usually associated with either mineral deficiency [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or mineral toxicity [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> case, the results showed that the lack of Al negatively affected chlorophylls and carotenes contents, and, at the subcellular level, the chloroplast integrity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, low photosynthetic pigment contents and chloroplast deformities could indicate that an oxidative stress process took place. For instance, the moss <italic>Taxithelium Nepalense</italic>, exposed to toxic amounts of Pb and Cd had lower chlorophyll content and chloroplast abnormalities as well as increased levels of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Besides, in rice and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the NADPH thioredoxin reductase (NTRC), a REDOX system, is considered essential to protect chloroplasts [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, it has been shown that <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> chloroplasts store Al, which does not affect their functionality and structure [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, the current results strongly suggest that Al starvation is highly harmful to <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants.</p>
<p>Concerning roots, the results also support the idea that the absence of Al is a source of stress for <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>. Based on the morphological and root growth data, this hypothesis appears quite reasonable as the lack of Al made the roots shorter, less branched, and with lower biomass. Additionally, as it is discussed below, these morphological and growth data are coherent with the proteomic analysis of roots since Al induced the upregulation of several metabolic routes, as well as cellular processes and molecular functions that are crucial for plant growth and development.</p>

<label>4.2.</label>
<title>Proteomic analysis showed that Al treatment upregulated <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> primary metabolism associated processes favouring root growth and development</title>
<p>Proteomic analysis has been a valuable tool to study the effects of Al exposure in many plants. In <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>, 410 Al-responsive differentially expressed proteins were identified, which were associated with various biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC) and molecular functions (MF). The majority (62&#x0025;) of the Al-responsive proteins in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots were associated with cellular and metabolic processes such as nitrogen compound metabolism, biosynthetic process, catabolism, and primary metabolism. All these processes are crucial during plant growth and development.</p>
<p>Besides, proteins related to cellular components such as ribosomes, cell membranes, mitochondria, and plastids had their abundance increased in Al-treated plants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Conversely, STRING (protein-protein interaction) analysis revealed that stress-related proteins were downregulated in Al-treated <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). The fact that stress-related pathways were downregulated in plants treated with Al shows that Al did not induce stress in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> as it does in many species. Moreover, this fact strengthens the hypothesis that this plant may have an Al-dependent metabolism.</p>
<p>To unveil which metabolic pathways are modulated in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots by Al, a KEGG analysis was performed to identify proteins and respective metabolic routes responsive to this metal. Thus, Al-responsive metabolic pathways were, to a great extent, associated with primary metabolism components. Consequently, aspects of the primary metabolism that involve carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, and aspects of genetic information processing will be further discussed considering their importance of Al for the growth and development of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>.</p>
<sec id="s4b1">
<label>4.2.1.</label>
<title>Al induced upregulation of proteins involved in synthesis of cell wall components as well as in the regulation of its properties</title>
<p>Al can interact with various extra and intracellular structures and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects of Al on many plants [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the cell wall is the first site to perceive Al presence, which triggers the response to it [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Plant Al response will be dependent upon specific characteristics such as sensitivity, tolerance and/or resistance to this metal.</p>
<p><italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> root proteomic analysis revealed 23 cell wall-related proteins which had their abundance increased in roots of Al-treated plants (Supplementary Table 3). It is remarkable that none of the downregulated proteins was associated with the cell wall in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots. Consequently, the upregulation of this number of proteins in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots treated with Al is strongly compatible with the results of root growth analysis presented here. Growing tissues and organs have a high demand for the synthesis and well-structured cell walls.</p>
<p>A comparison between root proteomes from two rice varieties with different levels of Al-tolerance revealed how Al affected cell wall differentiation, and ultimately root growth [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. When Al-sensitive rice plants (var. Kasalath) were exposed to Al, there was a significant inhibition of root growth [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Inversely, the Al-treated tolerant variety (var. Koshihikari) had significantly lower root growth inhibition compared with the sensitive plant [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These distinct responses to Al were directly related to the modifications in the abundance of cell wall-related proteins, where some of the proteins were downregulated [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, it was suggested that the differences in abundance of cell wall proteins might have affected the physicochemical properties of the wall, and consequently cell elongation, which was considered a significant Al-related stress response [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Hence, the maintenance of cell wall integrity and properties could be considered an essential feature for plant Al tolerance mechanisms, since cell growth and expansion is directly associated with the physicochemical characteristics of the wall [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Among the 23 Al responsive cell wall proteins found in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> several enzymes play critical roles in cell wall structural integrity, properties, and synthesis. Among the identified proteins there were germin-like proteins, pectinesterases, a fasciclin-like arabinogalactan (8), polygalacturonases, and two alpha-galactosidases (Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>For instance, germins and germin-like proteins (GLPs) are ubiquitously found in plants and have been associated with various developmental and biological processes including cell wall deposition and structure [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, two extra-cellular-matrix associated GLPs were investigated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The authors hypothesized that GLPs proteins might be a class of receptors in the extra-cellular-matrix due to their number of sequences and expression patterns. Therefore, they would be able to respond accordingly to a vast diversity of external environmental factors [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. If this is true, GLPs could play a role in recognition of Al in the extra-cellular-matrix in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> triggering a chain of developmental events in its roots.</p>
<p>Also, pectinesterases are crucial for cell wall integrity. These enzymes control the degree of methyl-esterification of pectins, which is directly associated with cell adhesion and cell wall stiffness [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Plant pectins are synthesized highly methyl-esterified, and pectin de-esterification enhances the adhesion properties of the cell wall [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, pectinesterases act in a very controlled manner and regulate the degree of pectin methyl-esterification just after its deposition in the cell wall [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This process is critical for plant development, and any disturbance in this process may lead to abnormalities in the cell wall [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that, in Al-sensitive plants, the accumulation of Al alone may result in increased cell wall stiffness through the cross-linking of pectin methyl residues, which inhibits cell wall loosening required for root growth [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, in sensitive plants, root tips are the primary sites of Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> toxicity, and most of the Al in roots are found in the cell wall [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is not observed in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>. On the contrary, in this plant, the whole process of root growth and development benefits from Al presence.</p>
<p>The other proteins mentioned above strongly support this statement. Arabinogalactan proteins are present in cell walls and directly involved in plant growth and development, cell adhesion, cell division, and many other developmental processes [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For instance, fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins were highly present in the cortex and vascular tissues of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Fasciclin domains are associated with cell adhesion in many organisms such as plants, fungi, animals, and algae [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Besides, lower expression of these proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants induced the formation of thinner and looser cell walls [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It has been speculated that these structural proteins interact with other cell wall components to maintain the structure of the wall [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Additionally, two types of proteins found in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots, the alpha-galactosidases, and polygalacturonases may regulate development by playing a role in cell wall loosening and, thereby, facilitating cell wall expansion [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Besides, polygalacturonases play a crucial role in root cap development by degrading demethylated pectin allowing the natural sloughing off outer root cap cells [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Root caps are essential for root growth because they protect the root apical meristem as well as facilitates soil penetration and exploration.</p>
<p>Moreover, a putative alpha-galactosidase located at the cell wall of barley leaves was essential for leaf elongation and expansion [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots, an alpha-galactosidase gene was co-expressed with <italic>AGAMOUS-LIKE42</italic> (<italic>AGL42</italic>), a transcription factor whose expression is proper of root stem cells [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This fact might suggest that these enzymes could help to maintain the integrity of root apical meristem, which would favour root growth and development.</p>
<p>It is also worthy to point out that cell wall synthesis is directly dependent on the primary metabolism. Therefore, it is not a coincidence that, in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots, Al promoted the upregulation of primary metabolic pathways, which is shown by the fact that about 62&#x0025; of all primary metabolism-related proteins had their abundance increased. Furthermore, KEGG analysis identified 66 proteins with increased relative abundance were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, essential to produce the buildings blocks of cell wall components. Therefore, the increase in cell wall protein abundances in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants grown with Al indicates an active role of Al in cell wall synthesis and expansion of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots.</p>

<title>Lipid metabolism in roots of Q. grandiflora</title>
<p>The comparative analysis of differentially abundant proteins in response to Al in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots revealed 20 proteins involved in lipid metabolism whose abundances increased in response to Al. A KEGG analysis showed that fatty acid degradation pathways were significantly enriched (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Thus, the most abundant regulated proteins associated to fatty acid degradation were: acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH5), acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (atoB), acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase 1 (ACAA1), enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MFP2) and alcohol class-P dehydrogenase (ADH1).</p>
<p>Consistent with <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> data, in hydrangea (<italic>H. macrophylla</italic>), also an Al-accumulating plant, a KEGG analysis showed that &#x201C;lipid metabolism&#x201D; was significantly enriched in roots and leaves in response to this metal [<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, the presence of Al increases the abundance of proteins associated with lipid metabolism in hydrangea, which may reflect on plasma membrane functions [<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Besides, it is believed that the activation of this metabolic pathway in these plants is to maintain plant metabolism and growth by producing energy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is noteworthy that enzymes capable of producing substrates for TCA and electron transport chain were upregulated in Al-treated <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants. For instance, the acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), an enzyme that catalyses the first step in fatty acid beta-oxidation in peroxisomes and affects various physiological process such as seed oil storage, lipid membrane turnover, senescence, synthesis of some plant hormones, and, consequently plant growth and development [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Fatty acid beta-oxidation results in the formation of acetyl-CoA that can be used in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Similarly, the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH5) was another protein whose abundance increased with Al. Besides, this enzyme belongs to a large family of enzymes that oxidate alcohols to aldehydes and concomitantly reduce NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to NADH [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Also, it has been established that ADH5 is found in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], where it prevents the accumulation of formaldehyde.</p>
<p>Finally, the last example of an enzyme associated with lipid metabolism that might have an impact on <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> growth and development is the acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (atoB). This enzyme condensates two acetyl-CoA molecules to form acetoacetyl-CoA, which is the first enzymatic step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, which comprise a wide range of molecules of high biological significance such as carotenoids, chlorophylls, and plastoquinone. Moreover, isoprenoids are components of the cytokinin phytohormonal class, including, the most common cytokinin, the zeatin [<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Cytokinins are synthesized in various plant organs; however, one of the main sites of cytokinin synthesis is roots [<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In fact, until recently, cytokinins were believed to be synthesized exclusively in roots. These hormones affect several physiological and morphogenetic events including cell division, vascular differentiation, apical dominance, senescence, sink and source balance, and consequently nutrient uptake [<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, the upregulation of <italic>ACOX, ADH5</italic>, and <italic>atoB</italic> may have contributed to the fact that Al-treated <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots had better growth rate and accumulated more biomass.</p>

<title>Genetic information processing and respective associated cellular components were positively responsive to Al in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots</title>
<p>It is noteworthy that the KEGG analysis indicated that about 30&#x0025; of the differentially abundant proteins were related to genetic information processing, which is the highest among all categories catalogued (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). That is not a coincidence. Concomitantly, elevated levels of ribosome-associated proteins as wells as those related to nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms strengthen the idea of highly intense processing of genetic information. Moreover, enrichment analysis (STRING) of metabolic pathways was coincident with KEGG findings, indicating that ribosomal proteins, amino acid metabolism, and biosynthesis, pyrimidine, and purine metabolism were responsive to Al in roots of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s4c1">

<title>Nucleotide and amino acid metabolism in roots of Q. grandiflora and Al</title>
<p>Proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism showed altered abundances in response to Al in roots of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>. Therefore, four proteins associated with purine anabolic pathways had their abundances significantly increased, and two proteins decreased in response to this metal. Regarding pyrimidine anabolism, five proteins were found with increased abundance in Al-treated plants. This fact may indicate that Al upregulated the synthesis of these nitrogenous bases.</p>
<p>Al is known to have a high affinity for oxygen donor compounds such as inorganic phosphate, nucleotides, RNA, DNA, and proteins. In sensitive plants, the binding of Al to these compounds will result in structural damages, especially in roots, since this organ is the first to have contact with this metal. However, this does not appear to be true for <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>. The results seem to point to an increase in nucleotide metabolism to likely meet the demands of nucleic acid synthesis and genetic information processing during plant growth.</p>
<p>Plant growth is based on two factors, cell division and cell elongation, which is the principal component of plant growth. Cell elongation requires large amounts of cell wall synthesis, as discussed above. Although cell division also requires cell wall synthesis, to a considerably lesser extent, DNA replication and RNA synthesis are a sine qua non condition for cell division. Furthermore, pyrimidine and purine are the backbones of these nucleic acids. As roots from Al-treated <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants grew and developed significantly better than those from non-treated plants, they need to synthesize these compounds more intensely. This fact may be the basis for pyrimidine and purine related proteins to be positively responsive to Al in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots.</p>
<p>Concerning amino acids metabolism, the significantly higher abundance of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS) may point to an increased synthesis of amino acids [<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and control of gene expression [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], indicating active cell proliferation [<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Cysteine and aspartate are precursors of methionine synthesis. Besides SAMS, the enzymes malate dehydrogenase (MDH1), MDH2, aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASD), and AGXT2 (alanine-glyoxylate transaminase) also had their abundance increased in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> in response to Al. The enzyme ASD plays a key role in amino acid synthesis in several organisms, including higher plants [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Malate dehydrogenases are enzymes of wide occurrence in living organisms whose principal substrate is the oxaloacetate and are involved in several metabolic pathways, which includes amino acid synthesis [<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Nonetheless, SAMS might be implicated in metabolic pathways that go beyond amino acid metabolism. This enzyme is necessary for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) biosynthesis [<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. SAM is the principal methyl donor for the vast majority of transmethylation reactions [<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These reactions are accomplished by SAM-dependent methyltransferases and crucial for the synthesis of many cellular components such as cell wall, lignin, as well as for RNA capping and epigenetic regulation of gene expression [<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thereby, SAMS is directly involved in genetic information processing.</p>
<p>Besides, to the best of our knowledge, the upregulation of SAMS observed in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> in response to Al has no parallel in crop plants. For instance, in rice plants, this enzyme was downregulated under Al stress [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, in rye and rice, the transcripts and/or protein levels of SAMS also decreased in response to Al [<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, the upregulation of SAMS might indicate its involvement in many cellular and metabolic processes that have been induced to cope with <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> growth and developmental needs. To accomplish that, all processes involved in genetic information processing play essential roles. Consequently, <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> may require Al to maintain its metabolism functional.</p>

<title>Other metabolic processes responsive to Al in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots and respective putative role</title>
<p>GO term analysis of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots showed that several other cellular components were responsive to Al treatment. Among which there were plasma membrane and integral membrane components as well as proteins associated with mitochondria and plastids (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Furthermore, the most active molecular functions of proteins were related to catalytic and binding activities (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Therefore, a few aspects that involve cellular components and protein molecular functions that have not yet been addressed and are crucial for plant growth and development will be further discussed.</p>
<sec id="s4d1">
<label>4.4.1.</label>
<title>Redox associated enzymes were upregulated in roots of Q. grandiflora plants grown with Al</title>
<p>In <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>, several redox associated proteins were identified in plants supplemented with Al. Compared with no Al treatment, it was found that 58 and 27 redox associated proteins were up and downregulated, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). For instance, formate dehydrogenase (FDH) was upregulated in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots. FDHs are versatile enzymes and often associated with response to environmental changes [<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> this enzyme is involved in responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli, and its abundance increased in the presence of Al [<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Moreover, in <italic>Vigna umbellata</italic> this enzyme confers greater tolerance to Al<sup>&#x002B;3</sup> [<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In <italic>V. umbellata</italic>, there was a rapid FDH accumulation in root apices after Al-exposure. Furthermore, in this plant Al<sup>&#x002B;3</sup> was considered the inducer of <italic>VuFDH</italic> expression [<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>
<p>FDHs catalyse the oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide resulting in the formation of NADH. Moreover, in plants, these enzymes are localized in mitochondria and supply organisms with energy and reducing power in the form of ATP [<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Also, formate oxidation by FDHs may be coupled with the oxidative phosphorylation [<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Compared with no Al-treatment, Al supplementation was an abiotic stimulus for <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants, instead of a stress eliciting agent. Therefore, FDHs might help to keep the energy supply steady, which can explain the higher biomass accumulation of Al-treated plants. Additionally, the upregulation of proteins such as FDH may also have conferred an evolutive advantage to these plants, which could have contributed to the adapt <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> to the Cerrado edaphic conditions.</p>
<p>Another class of proteins that in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> had their abundance significantly altered in response to Al was the antioxidant enzymes that play a role against oxidative stress. In <italic>Q. grandiflora,</italic> most antioxidant enzymes had their abundance diminished. Conversely, in roots of sensitive tomato plants exposed to Al, proteins such as monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and selenium-proteins (not found in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>), all with redox activities were positively regulated [<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Also, the disulphide isomerase (PDI), a protein that repairs denatured proteins was also upregulated in sensitive tomato plants [<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Likewise, in rice, which is one of the most Al tolerant cultures, the antioxidant proteins SOD, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 2 (SAMS) are consistently induced by Al [<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thereby, Al tolerance is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple proteins, distinct biological processes and a broad variety of metabolic response. As discussed, the metabolic response may differ from species to species. Nevertheless, either in sensitive or tolerant plants, it appears that Al induces oxidative stress response mechanisms. In <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> case, our data support the idea that Al is not a stress elicitor.</p>

<title>Al affected organic acids metabolism in Q. grandiflora</title>
<p>In <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots, it was observed a possible upregulation of glyoxylate metabolism due to an increased abundance of proteins such as malate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (MDH1/MDH2), formate dehydrogenase (FDH), catalase (CAT), acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (atoB), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) and glycine H cleavage system (GCSH) in plants treated with Al. These results suggest that oxalate biosynthesis in roots of Al grown <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants was active and may assist in the capture and accumulation of this metal in this plant.</p>
<p>Organic acids such as oxalate and citrate have often been involved in the process of tolerance and accumulation of Al in various plants, such as wheat and buckwheat [<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In plants, there are three routes for oxalate biosynthesis: the glyoxylate, the ascorbate, and the oxaloacetate pathways [<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. For example, in rice, glyoxylate was an efficient precursor for oxalate biosynthesis, which may be a product of the glyoxylate cycle [<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p>
<p>It is important to note that there are studies that correlate organic acids to chelation and Al-transportation. Hence, oxalate can chelate Al<sup>3&#x002B;</sup> and form with it a stable complex. Plants release organic acids to prevent Al-toxicity, both externally (rhizosphere) and internally [<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In buckwheat, an Al-tolerant species, when oxalate secretion is suppressed by an anion channel inhibitor, e.g., phenylglyoxal, root elongation is inhibited in the presence of Al [<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This fact demonstrates the role of organic acids in response to Al in plants. This phenomenon is also seen in other plants such as Hydrangea macrophylla [<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Additionally, in <italic>Melastoma malabathricum</italic> L. (Melastomataceae) Al transportation is suggested to take place in the xylem, probably in the form of Al-citrate complexes [<xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The type of organic acid involved in Al response may vary with the species. For instance, <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. secretes malate [<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> L. [<xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], <italic>Zea mays</italic> L. [<xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and <italic>Fagopyrum esculentum</italic> Moench exudates oxalate in response to Al [<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p>
<p>As mentioned, in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> the increases in abundance of several enzymes of this glyoxylate route have been observed. It seems that the increase of oxalate biosynthesis in Al-accumulating plants is a default component in response to Al. Although there are no studies on the function of these organic acids in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots, these compounds might be involved in the capture and transportation of Al in this species. Nonetheless, a metabolic profile of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> may help to determine the function of these compounds in this plant.</p>
<p>Another possibility involves the upregulation of malate dehydrogenases (MDH) in plants treated with Al. There are several MDH isoforms in plants, which have been located in various cellular compartments such as cytoplasm, peroxisomes, chloroplasts, and mitochondria [<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Furthermore, these enzymes play many physiological functions. For instance, in mitochondria, mMDH plays a role in TCA cycle where it oxidizes malate to OAA to form citrate [<xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Al stimulates the synthesis and root efflux of citrate in several plant species [<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that Al is transported to shoots as Al-citrate complexes through xylem vessels [<xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and, maybe, citrate could play a role in Al transportation in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> as well. It is interesting that a metabolomic analysis of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots has shown a citrate content significantly higher in Al-treated plants (Silva, unpublished results). This matter is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Besides, MDH isoforms are involved in the transport and utilization of malate and OAA as well as in the availability of NAD in several organelles [<xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wang et al. (2015)</xref> associated the high expression of an MDH (GhmMDH1) in transgenic cotton plants with a more efficient uptake of insoluble phosphorus (Al-P, Fe-P, or Ca-P). <italic>GhmMDH1</italic>-overexpressing cotton plants that were supplied exclusively with these forms of insoluble P developed longer roots with higher biomass than wild-types plants [<xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p>
<p>This fact is highly relevant because Al-treated <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> plants had longer roots and higher root biomass as well. As mentioned previously, Cerrado soils are acid and abundant in Al, and thereby, have high levels of insoluble P. It is possible that these edaphic conditions were a significant factor in the evolutive process of native species. Therefore, there was a selective pressure that favoured plant adaptations to deal with these harsh environmental conditions. Consequently, the <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> MDHs might have evolved to work with insoluble P due to Cerrado soils properties. It is not inconsistent to think that, maybe, these plants have MDHs that work better in the presence of Al than without it. Nonetheless, this is another exciting hypothesis that requires testing.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present work indicates that Al is a required for the growth and development of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic>. LC-MS-MS analyses provided a comprehensive inventory of Al-responsive proteins in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that Al-treatment induced systemic changes in the proteome of <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> roots. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a link between changes in protein abundance and various metabolic pathways in response to Al, as well as interactions between these differentially regulated proteins.</p>
<p><italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> proteome revealed that Al was necessary for the metabolism of this species and directly involved in: a) enhancement of primary metabolism &#x2013; cell wall synthesis, methylation cycle, protein synthesis; b) increased genetic information processing; c) redox activity; and, d) organic acid metabolism. These results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of native Al-accumulating plants as well as their way of dealing with it. Moreover, the current investigation has expanded knowledge on this topic and enhanced our toolkit for the genetic improvement of cultivated plants more resistant to Al.</p>
<p>Although no conclusion can be drawn about the essentiality of Al in <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> metabolism, the data supports the idea that this metal has a metabolic role to play in this plant. Therefore, <italic>Q. grandiflora</italic> does resent Al starvation, which leads to a proposal of an Al-dependent metabolism for this species. Nonetheless, the level of dependency has yet to be determined.</p>
