<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Dyslipidemia is common among patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the genetic evidence for the link between blood lipids and ALS is unclear. We assessed the associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) with ALS, using summary results from genome-wide association studies. PRS of LDL-C (OR&#x003D;1.17; 95&#x0025;CI 1.11-1.23) and TC (OR&#x003D;1.15; 95&#x0025;CI 1.09-1.21) were significantly associated with a higher risk of ALS, whereas no association was noted for PRS of TG and HDL-C. Although linkage disequilibrium score regression indicated weak genetic correlations between lipids and ALS, several genetic variants known to up-regulate LDL-C and TC levels were shown to be associated with a higher risk of ALS. This study demonstrates a clear polygenic link between LDL-C, TC and ALS, and suggests that inherited dyslipidemia might be an etiological part of ALS development.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Dyslipidemia is common among patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Higher-than-expected levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and low/high-density lipoprotein ratio (LDL-C/HDL-C) have been reported among patients with ALS by some but not all studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> In a recent observational study we found that patients with ALS had increased levels of apolipoprotein B and LDL-C up to 20 years before diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8"><sup>8</sup></xref> Because muscle atrophy is a contributing factor to metabolic dysregulation and little is known on the earliest onset of muscle atrophy in ALS, it is unclear whether dyslipidemia plays a causal role in ALS or represents purely an early non-motor sign of ALS.</p>
<p>Genetic loci regulating blood LDL-C, TC, TG and HDL-C have been identified in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been shown to be predictive of circulating lipid trajectories.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11"><sup>11</sup></xref> To this end, we aimed to test the associations of LDL-C, TC, TG and HDL-C, indicated by their corresponding SNPs derived PRS, with the risk of ALS, using the recently published GWAS result of ALS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12"><sup>12</sup></xref> As a positive comparison, we also conducted a similar analysis for the association of LDL-C with coronary artery disease (CAD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title>
<p>PRS of LDL-C and TC were both significantly associated with ALS risk (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table</xref>). The associations were similar when using either European-ancestry or trans-ethnic GWAS results of lipids, although the best-fitted P<sub>T</sub>s were lower and the numbers of SNPs included in the best-fitted quantiles were smaller when using European-ancestry GWAS results of lipids. In the analyses using European-ancestry GWAS results of lipids, the best-fitted P<sub>T</sub>s were 5&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup> for both LDL-C and TC to predict ALS, with odds ratio (OR) of 1.17 (95&#x0025; confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.23, P&#x003D;8.82&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>) and 1.15 (95&#x0025; CI 1.09-1.21, P&#x003D;8.17&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>) per standard deviation of the PRS for LDL-C and TC, respectively. SNPs in the best-fitted P<sub>T</sub> quantiles explained 0.08&#x0025; (LDL-C) and 0.07&#x0025; (TC) of the variance of ALS. In contrast, PRS of TG and HDL-C were not associated with ALS.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In the reverse PRS analyses, in which ALS was used as the base whereas LDL-C, TC, TG and HDL-C were used as the targets, no clear association was noted for any of the studied lipids.</p>
<p>Statistically significant associations were noted in all bi-directional analyses of LDL-C and CAD (P&#x003C;9&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;37</sup>). In the best-fitted P<sub>T</sub> quantiles of LDL-C, less than 500 SNPs explained about 0.25&#x223C;0.60&#x0025; variance of CAD, and ORs for PRS of LDL-C on CAD were around 1.45&#x223C;1.56. The associations for PRS of CAD with LDL-C were weaker but still statistically significant.</p>
<p>Using both European-ancestry and trans-ethnic GWAS results of lipids, the associations between PRS of LDL-C and TC with ALS were similar and statistically significant across quantiles with P<sub>T</sub> &#x003C; 0.005 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>). Similar results were noted for the quantiles including only genome-wide significance SNPs (P<sub>T</sub>&#x2264;5&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>), the variance of ALS explained by these SNPs was very close to the largest variance explained by the best-fitted quantile (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>).</p>

<p>LD score (LDSC) regression was performed to calculate the heritability and genetic correlation between the base and target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> The genetic correlations (rg) between blood lipids and ALS were weak (rg&#x2264;0.06) and not statistically significant (P&#x2265;0.47) (data not shown). The genetic correlation between trans-ethnic LDL-C and CAD was moderate and statistically significant (rg&#x003D;0.21, 95&#x0025;CI 0.13-0.29, P&#x003D;1.22&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>). The SNP-based univariate heritability of LDL-C, CAD and ALS estimated from LDSC regression was 0.20 (95&#x0025;CI 0.11-0.29), 0.10 (95&#x0025;CI 0.08-0.12) and 0.05 (95&#x0025;CI 0.03-0.07), respectively.</p>
<p>In the Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, 62 of the 63 SNPs specifically associated with LDL-C or TC were found in the ALS GWAS. The combined effect of these SNPs on ALS was null (OR&#x003D;1.00, 95&#x0025;CI 1.00-1.01, P&#x003D;0.13). Some individual SNPs were however significantly associated with ALS risk (P&#x003C;0.05, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Among the alleles up-regulating LDL-C or TC, five were associated with a higher ALS risk, including alleles in the loci close to very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (<italic>VLDLR</italic>), Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1 (<italic>NPC1L1</italic>), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1, Mitochondrial (<italic>GPAM</italic>), LDL receptor (<italic>LDLR</italic>) and topoisomerase I (<italic>TOP1</italic>) genes.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Using different polygenic methods on summary GWAS results of blood lipids and ALS, the present study demonstrated a clear polygenic link between LDL-C, TC and ALS. We found that PRS of genome-wide significant SNPs that are known to increase LDL-C and TC levels were associated with a higher risk of ALS. Several genetic variants involved in the regulation of LDL-C and TC were further shown to be associated with the risk of ALS.</p>
<p>The recent finding that ALS patients had consistently elevated levels of apolipoprotein B and LDL-C during the 20 years before diagnosis suggests that dyslipidemia might either be a risk factor for ALS or a prodromal non-motor symptom of ALS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8"><sup>8</sup></xref> The present findings support the former notion by demonstrating clear genetic evidence that dyslipidemia, in terms of high LDL-C and TC levels specifically, is not purely secondary to ALS but represents an independent risk factor for ALS. Among the 63 genome-wide significant loci specifically associated with LDL-C or TC, five showed clear associations with a higher risk of ALS (P&#x003C;0.05, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The fact that these loci are either involved in the cholesterol transportation (<italic>VLDLR</italic>, <italic>LDLR</italic>, <italic>NPC1L1</italic>) or lipid modification (<italic>GPAM</italic>) processes, sheds light on the potential cellular pathways underlying the link between dyslipidemia and ALS. More specifically, mutations in the <italic>NPC1L1</italic> gene are also associated with Niemann-Pick type C disease, which is an inherited metabolic disorder with accumulation of LDL-C and sphingomyelin in the viscera and central nervous system and shares phenotypic features with ALS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
<p>Genetic correlations between blood lipids and ALS were weak and non-significant when estimated by LDSC regression. Similar weak correlations have been reported between ALS and other neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer&#x0027;s disease, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and multiple sclerosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18"><sup>18</sup></xref> One potential exception is schizophrenia, demonstrating a genetic correlation of 0.14 with ALS. PRS of schizophrenia was also reported to predict ALS risk, with a best P<sub>T</sub> of 0.20. This best P<sub>T</sub> quantile included 189,492 SNPs, and explained 0.12&#x0025; of ALS variance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18"><sup>18</sup></xref> The SNP-based heritability of ALS from the GWAS data we used was 7&#x0025;, whereas previous family and twin studies reported a heritability of ALS as high as 60&#x0025;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19"><sup>19</sup></xref> Potential explanations for this large difference might include the smaller sample size of ALS GWAS in comparison to GWAS of lipids or CAD, and also potentially due to the special polygenic rare variants architecture of ALS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
<p>Unlike several more common complex diseases (e.g., CAD, schizophrenia), low-frequency or rare alleles have been suggested to explain more heritability of ALS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12"><sup>12</sup></xref> Because GWAS focus on common SNPs and usually require minor allele frequency to be larger than 1&#x0025; in the population, they cannot capture potential effects of rare variants. Family and twin studies on the other hand capture all genetic effects from both common and rare variants. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-1D</xref> illustrate that the explained variance of ALS diminished as more SNPs were included, and the associations of the corresponding PRS with ALS became weaker and not statistically significant. Therefore, deep sequencing for rare variants in future ALS studies might be essential, to understand the genetic mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation and ALS. In parallel, molecular studies are also needed to shed light on pathogenic mechanisms of the suggested cellular pathways related to lipid processing and ALS risk.</p>

<sec id="s4a"><title>Data</title>
<p>All data used in this study were summary GWAS results of blood lipids, ALS and CAD, in both European-ancestry and trans-ethnic populations. GWAS results on LDL-C, TC, TG and HDL-C were accessed from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, including &#x223C;100,000 European-ancestry (95,454 for LDL-C; 100,184 for TC; 96,598 for TG; and 99,900 for HDL-C; 2.69 million SNPs) and 188,577 trans-ethnic (2.44 million SNPs) individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> GWAS results on ALS were accessed from the Project MinE GWAS Consortium, including 36,052 European-ancestry individuals (N<sub>case</sub>&#x003D;12,577; 8.71 million SNPs).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12"><sup>12</sup></xref> GWAS results on CAD were accessed from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium, including 86,995 European-ancestry (N<sub>case</sub>&#x003D;22,233; 2.42 million SNPs) and 124,305 trans-ethnic (N<sub>case</sub>&#x003D;60,801; 9.46 million SNPs) individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b"><title>Polygenic analyses</title>
<p>In order to check the directionality of the association between PRS for lipids and ALS, we performed bi-directional PRS analyses using PRSice v1.25,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20"><sup>20</sup></xref> in which ALS caseness was used first as target (outcome) and then as base (exposure). In the base data, we clumped linkage disequilibrium (LD) linked SNPs by using HapMap_ceu_all genotype as the reference (release 22, 60 individuals, 3.96 million SNPs), and used the parameter settings recommended in PRSice; a clumping threshold of p1&#x003D;p2&#x003D;0.5, a LD threshold of r<sup>2</sup>&#x003D;0.05 and a distance threshold of 300Kb. We grouped independent SNPs into different quantiles with gradually increasing P value thresholds (P<sub>T</sub>, ranging from 0 to 0.5). We standardized PRS of each quantile before we calculated their effects on the target. The P<sub>T</sub> of the quantile that explained most variance of the target was defined as the best-fitted P<sub>T</sub>.</p>
<p>We performed LDSC regression by LDSC v1.0.0 to calculate the heritability and genetic correlation between base and target, using information from all available (directly genotyped and imputed) SNPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Finally, we conducted a MR analysis taking advantage of information on 63 loci that are known to be specifically associated with LDL-C or TC (the top SNP in each genome-wide significant locus, P&#x003C;5&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>), but not other lipids. The 63 SNPs were considered as instrumental variables; their individual and combined effects on ALS were calculated and plotted using &#x201C;metafor&#x201D; package in R.3.2.3.</p>
