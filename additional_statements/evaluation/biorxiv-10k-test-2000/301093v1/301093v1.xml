<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Basic HLH proteins heterodimerize with class I HLH/E proteins to promote transcription. Here we show that E proteins differentially co-operate with proneural bHLH transcription factors sharpening their neurogeneic activity. We find that inhibiting BMP signaling or its target ID2, in the chick embryo spinal cord, impairs the neuronal production from progenitors expressing ATOH1/ASCL1, but less severely that from progenitors expressing NEUROG1/2/PTF1a. We define the mechanisms of this differential response as a dual co-operation of E proteins with proneural proteins. E proteins synergize with bHLH proteins when acting on CAGSTG motifs, thereby facilitating the neurogenic activity of ASCL1/ATOH1 which preferentially bind to such motifs. Conversely, E proteins restrict the strong neurogenic potential of NEUROG1/2 by directly inhibiting their preferential binding to CADATG motifs. Since we find this mechanism to be conserved in corticogenesis, we propose this dual co-operation of E proteins with bHLH proteins as a novel though general feature of their mechanism of action.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The correct functioning of the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) relies on the activity of a large variety of neurons that can be distinguished by their morphologies, physiological characteristics and anatomical locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zeng &#x0026; Sanes, 2017</xref>). Such heterogeneity is generated during the phase of neurogenesis, once neural progenitors have been regionally specified and are instructed to exit the cell cycle and differentiate into discrete neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guillemot, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Neuronal differentiation and subtype specification are brought together by a small group of transcription factors (TFs) encoded by homologues of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene families <italic>Atonal</italic>, <italic>Achaete</italic>-<italic>Scute</italic>, <italic>Neurogenins/dTap</italic> and <italic>p48/Ptf1a/Fer2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bertrand et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al, 2014</xref>). These TFs represent a subgroup of the class II of helix-loop-helix proteins and all share a typical basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) structural motif, where the basic domain mediates direct DNA binding to CANNTG sequences (known as E-boxes) and the HLH region is responsible for dimerization and protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bertrand et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Massari &#x0026; Murre, 2000</xref>). They are generally expressed in mutually exclusive populations of neural progenitors along the rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gowan et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lai et al, 2016</xref>). They are typically referred to as proneural proteins, since they are both necessary and sufficient to switch on the genetic programs that drive pan-neuronal differentiation and neuronal subtype specification during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guillemot, 2007</xref>). This unique characteristic is also illustrated by their ability to reprogram distinct neural and non-neural cell types into functional neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Masserdotti et al, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Regulating the activity of these proneural proteins is crucial to ensure the production of appropriate numbers of neurons without prematurely depleting the pools of neural progenitors. In cycling neural progenitors, the transcriptional repressors HES1 and HES5 act in response to Notch signalling to maintain proneural TF transcripts oscillating at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Imayoshi &#x0026; Kageyama, 2014</xref>). The proneural proteins are also regulated at the post-translational level. Ubiquitination and phosphorylation have been reported to control their stability, modify their DNA binding capacity or even terminate their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ali et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ali et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Quan et al, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the activity of these proneural proteins is highly dependent on protein-protein interactions, and particularly on their dimerization status. It is generally admitted that these TFs must form heterodimers with the more broadly expressed class I HLH/E proteins in order to produce their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang &#x0026; Baker, 2015</xref>). In this way, the activity of proneural proteins can be controlled by upstream signals that regulate the relative availability of E proteins. Members of the Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) family represent such regulators. As they lack the basic domain required for direct DNA-binding, ID proteins sequester E proteins through a physical interaction and thereby produce a dominant-negative effect on proneural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Massari &#x0026; Murre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang &#x0026; Baker, 2015</xref>). Hence, several sophisticated regulatory mechanisms are available during development to control proneural protein activity and fine-tune neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) contribute to multiple processes during the formation of the vertebrate CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Le Dreau &#x0026; Marti, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu &#x0026; Niswander, 2005</xref>). Yet it is only in the past few years that their specific role in controlling vertebrate neurogenesis has begun to be defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choe et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Le Dreau et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Le Dreau et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Segklia et al, 2012</xref>). During spinal cord development, SMAD1 and SMAD5, two canonical TFs of the BMP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Massague et al, 2005</xref>), dictate the mode of division that spinal progenitors adopt during primary neurogenesis. Accordingly, strong SMAD1/5 activity promotes progenitor maintenance while weaker activity enables neurogenic divisions to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Le Dreau et al, 2014</xref>). This model explains how inhibition of BMP7 or SMAD1/5 activity provokes premature neuronal differentiation and the concomitant depletion of progenitors. However, it does not explain why the generation of distinct subtypes of dorsal interneurons are affected differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Le Dreau et al, 2012</xref>), nor how BMP signaling affects the activity of the proneural proteins expressed in the corresponding progenitor domains.</p>
<p>Here, we have investigated these questions, extending our analysis to primary spinal neurogenesis along the whole dorsal-ventral axis. As such, we identified a striking correlation between the requirement of canonical BMP activity for the generation of a particular neuronal subtype and the proneural protein expressed in the corresponding progenitor domain. Inhibiting the activity of BMP7, SMAD1/5 or their downstream effector ID2 strongly impaired the production of neurons by spinal progenitors expressing either ATOH1 or ASCL1 alone, while it had a much weaker effect on the generation of the neuronal subtypes derived from progenitors expressing NEUROG1, NEUROG2 or PTF1a. We found that this differential responsiveness originates from a dual, E-box dependent mode of co-operation of the class I HLH/E proteins with the proneural proteins. E proteins interact with proneural proteins to aid their interaction with CAGSTG E-boxes, facilitating the ability of ASCL1 and ATOH1 to promote neurogenic divisions and hence, neuronal differentiation. Conversely, E proteins inhibit proneural protein binding to CADATG motifs, consequently restraining the ability of NEUROG1/2 that preferentially bind to these motifs to trigger neurogenic division and promote neuronal differentiation. Similar results were obtained in the context of corticogenesis, suggesting that this differential co-operation of E proteins with the distinct proneural proteins is a general feature of their mode of action.</p>

<title>The canonical BMP pathway differentially regulates the generation of spinal neurons derived from progenitors expressing ASCL1/ATOH1 or NEUROG1/NEUROG2/PTF1a</title>
<p>We previously reported that BMP7 signalling through its canonical effectors SMAD1 and SMAD5, is differentially required for the generation of the distinct subtypes of dorsal spinal interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Le Dreau et al, 2012</xref>). Here, we extend this analysis to the generation of neuronal subtypes produced in the ventral part of the developing chick spinal cord. Inhibiting BMP7 or SMAD1/5 expression by <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation of specific sh-RNA-encoding plasmids at stage HH14-15 produced a significant reduction in the generation of p2-derived Chx10<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (V2a) and Gata3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>(V2b) subtypes 48 hours post-electroporation (hpe), whereas Evx1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (V0v), En1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (V1) interneurons and Isl1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> motoneurons were not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). These results revealed a correlation whereby the requirement of the canonical BMP pathway for the generation of discrete spinal neuron subtypes is linked to the proneural protein expressed in the corresponding progenitor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The neuronal subtypes strongly affected by BMP7/SMAD1/5 inhibition (dI1, dI3, dI5: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) were generated from spinal progenitors expressing ATOH1 (dP1) or ASCL1 alone (dP3, dP5). By contrast, all the neuronal subtypes deriving from spinal progenitors expressing either NEUROG1 alone (dP2, dP6-p1) or NEUROG2 (pMN) were much less severely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Intriguingly, the V2a/b interneurons that display intermediate sensitivity to BMP7/SMAD1/5 inhibition are derived from p2 progenitors that express both ASCL1 and NEUROG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Misra et al, 2014</xref>), while the relatively insensitive dI4 interneurons are derived from dP4 progenitors that express PTF1a together with low levels of ASCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Glasgow et al, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>These correlations were particularly interesting in view of recent genome-wide ChIPseq studies that identified the optimal E-box (CANNTG) motifs bound by these TFs: ATOH1 and ASCL1 both preferentially bind to CAGCTG E-boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borromeo et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castro et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klisch et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lai et al, 2011</xref>), whereas the optimal motif for NEUROGs is CADATG (where D stands for A, G or T: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Madelaine &#x0026; Blader, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seo et al, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, most of the E-boxes bound by PTF1a in the developing spinal cord correspond to the CAGCTG motif favored by ASCL1 and ATOH1, yet PTF1a can bind to the NEUROG-like CAGATG motifs in a significant proportion of its targets genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borromeo et al, 2014</xref>). These observations suggested that the sensitivity of a given progenitor domain to canonical BMP activity originates from the intrinsic DNA-binding preferences of the different proneural bHLH TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In many cell contexts, BMP signaling is mediated by ID proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Genander et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hollnagel et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Moya et al, 2012</xref>), which physically sequester class I HLH/E proteins to produce a dominant-negative effect on proneural proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While this hypothetical signaling cascade could explain the response of spinal progenitors expressing ASCL1 or ATOH1 to altered canonical BMP activity, it would not explain the relative insensitivity of the progenitors expressing NEUROG1, NEUROG2 or PTF1a. Therefore, we tested the veracity of these functional relationships to identify the basis of this differential response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>ID2 acts downstream of the canonical BMP pathway to differentially regulate the generation of spinal neurons derived from progenitors expressing ASCL1/ATOH1 or NEUROG1/NEUROG2/PTF1a</title>
<p>To test whether ID proteins are involved in canonical BMP signalling during spinal neurogenesis, we focused on ID2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), not least because canonical BMP signalling is necessary and sufficient to promote <italic>cId2</italic> expression in the developing spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Le Dreau et al, 2014</xref>). Moreover, <italic>cId2</italic> expression closely overlaps that described for the canonical BMP activity: restricted to the dorsal spinal cord early during patterning and later spreading ventrally within the ventricular zone during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Le Dreau et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Le Dreau et al, 2014</xref>). Inhibition of endogenous ID2 activity was triggered by <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation of a sh-RNA specifically targeting chick <italic>Id2</italic> transcripts (sh-Id2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A-E</xref>). This ID2 inhibition caused premature cell-autonomous differentiation at 48 hpe similar to that provoked by inhibiting SMAD1/5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-K</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Le Dreau et al, 2014</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of a murine ID2 construct reduced the proportion of electroporated cells that differentiated into neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2-figure supplement 2F,G</xref>). ID2 overexpression could also partially impede the premature differentiation caused by both sh-Id2 and sh-Smad5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I-K</xref>). Similar results were obtained when measuring the activity of the pTubb3:luc reporter 24 hpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).</p>

<p>We next analysed the consequences of ID2 inhibition on the generation of the different subtypes of spinal neurons, detecting a significant dose-dependent reduction in the generation of many neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M,N</xref>). The overall phenotype caused by ID2 inhibition was comparable to that triggered by inhibiting BMP7, SMAD1 or SMAD5: the neuronal subtypes deriving from progenitor domains expressing either ATOH1 or ASCL1 alone were globally more sensitive to ID2 inhibition than those derived from progenitor domains expressing NEUROG1, NEUROG2 or PTF1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>). Together, these results confirmed that ID2 acts downstream of the canonical BMP pathway in spinal neurogenesis and that it regulates distinctly the generation of spinal neurons derived from progenitors expressing ASCL1/ATOH1 and NEUROG1/NEUROG2.</p>

<title>ID2 and E proteins counterbalance each other&#x2019;s activity during spinal neurogenesis</title>
<p>We wondered whether ID2 contributes to spinal neurogenesis by sequestering E proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, we analysed the expression of these class I HLH genes during spinal neurogenesis. Transcripts from the <italic>cTcf3/E2A</italic> gene, which encodes the E12 or E47 alternative splice isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Murre et al, 1989</xref>), were readily detected in the ventricular zone throughout the dorsal-ventral axis of the developing spinal cord, with apparently no domain-specific pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Holmberg et al, 2008</xref>). Transcripts from the chicken HEB orthologue <italic>cTcf12</italic> were detected in the transition zone, following a dorsal-to-ventral gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Previous studies reported that <italic>E2</italic>-<italic>2</italic> transcripts were barely detected in the developing murine spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sobrado et al, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>The overexpression of E47 or TCF12 both produced a significant increase in the proportion of differentiated cells, a phenotype that was reverted by the concomitant electroporation of ID2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-J</xref>). To inhibit the endogenous activity of E proteins, we took advantage of an E47 construct carrying mutations in its basic domain (E47bm) that acts in a dominant-negative manner over E proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhuang et al, 1998</xref>). Electroporation of E47bm inhibited neuronal differentiation in a cell autonomous manner, and it fully compensated for the premature differentiation caused by both E47 and TCF12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). The E47bm construct also rescued to a large extent the premature differentiation triggered by sh-Id2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K-O</xref>). Together, these results appear to confirm that the role played by ID2 during spinal neurogenesis depends on its ability to sequester E proteins.</p>

<title>E47 co-operates distinctly with ASCL1/ATOH1 and NEUROG1/NEUROG2 to fine-tune neurogenic divisions during spinal neurogenesis</title>
<p>The results we obtained so far suggested that E proteins themselves might co-operate differently with the distinct proneural proteins during spinal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the consequences of expressing the mutant E47bm on the generation of spinal neuron subtypes. There was a marked reduction (&#x2265; 50&#x0025;) in the generation of Lhx2/9<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (dI1) and Tlx3<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (dI3/dI5) interneurons, which derive respectively from progenitors expressing ATOH1 and ASCL1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,F</xref>). By contrast, electroporation of E47bm affected to a lesser extent (&#x003C;25&#x0025;) the generation of Lhx1/5&#x002B; (dI2/dI4/dI6-V1) or Isl1&#x002B; (MN) neuronal subtypes deriving from progenitors expressing NEUROG1 alone (dP2, dP6-V1), PTF1a (dP4) or NEUROG2 (pMN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>). Hence, ATOH1 and ASCL1 appeared to be much more dependent on the activity of E proteins than NEUROG1, NEUROG2 and PTF1a to promote appropriate neuronal differentiation.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we evaluated how E47 gain-of-function would modulate the neuronal differentiation induced when ASCL1, ATOH1, NEUROG1 and NEUROG2 are overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-O</xref>). From 24 hpe onwards, all 4 proneural bHLH proteins caused premature differentiation in a cell-autonomous and concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). The presence of E47 accentuated the mild increase in neuronal differentiation provoked by ASCL1 at 24 hpe, and more significantly at 48 hpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-H</xref>&#x2019;). Accordingly, E47 provoked a significant reduction in the average number of electroporated cells generated 48 hpe of ASCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). A similar tendency, albeit less pronounced, was observed when E47 was combined with ATOH1, especially in terms of the reduced average number of EP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells generated 48 hpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I-J&#x2019;,O</xref>). Addition of E47 had the opposite effect when combined with NEUROG1 or NEUROG2: it significantly reduced the proportion of EP<sup>&#x002B;</sup>;HuC/D<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells obtained at 24 hpe and consequently increased the final numbers of EP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells observed at 48 hpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K-O</xref>). These results suggested that E47 differentially regulates the ability of ASCL1/ATOH1 and NEUROG1/NEUROG2 to promote cell cycle exit.</p>
<p>To assess cell cycle exit, a fluorescent cytoplasmic-retention dye that is only diluted on cell division was added at the time of electroporation and its mean fluorescence intensity was measured in FACS-sorted electroporated (GFP<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) cells 48 hours later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>). This assay demonstrated that E47 itself increased the mean Violet intensity, and further enhanced the mild increase caused by ASCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>), indicating that E47 facilitates ASCL1&#x2019;s ability to promote cell cycle exit. E47 had an opposite effect when combined with NEUROG1, significantly reducing the strong increase in Violet intensity caused by NEUROG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>), thereby confirming that E47 restricts NEUROGl&#x2019;s ability to promote cell cycle exit.</p>
<p>We next studied how E47 influences the respective abilities of ASCL1 and NEUROG1 to regulate the balance between the 3 different modes of division that spinal progenitors can undergo during neurogenesis: symmetric proliferative divisions (PP), asymmetric divisions (PN), and symmetric neurogenic divisions (NN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Le Dreau et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Saade et al, 2013</xref>). To this end, we took advantage of the pSox2:eGFP and pTis21:RFP reporters that are specifically active during progenitor-generating (PP&#x002B;PN) and neuron-generating (PN&#x002B;NN) divisions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Saade et al, 2013</xref>). The effects of E47, ASCL1 and NEUROG1 on their activities were assayed 16 hpe by immunohistochemistry or quantified by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R</xref>). E47 caused a significant decrease in the proportion of pSox2:eGFP<sup>&#x002B;</sup>;pTis21:RFP<sup>-</sup> (PP) cells and a reciprocal increase in the proportion of pTis21:RFP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (PN&#x002B;NN) neurogenic divisions relative to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S,S&#x2019;,V</xref>). While we did not detect any significant change in the proportions of PP, PN and NN cells in response to ASCL1 alone in these conditions, we did observe an increase in neurogenic divisions at the expense of proliferative divisions when ASCL1 was combined with E47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4T,T&#x2019;,V</xref>). Conversely, E47 significantly restrained NEUROG1&#x2019;s ability to trigger neurogenic divisions at the expense of PP divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4U,V</xref>). Assessing the activity of the pSox2:luc reporter confirmed these results, further showing that E47 facilitates the ability of both ASCL1 and ATOH1 to repress pSox2 activity, whereas it restricts the repressive effects of both NEUROG1 and NEUROG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these results revealed that E47 co-operates distinctly with ASCL1/ATOH1 and NEUROG1/NEUROG2 to fine-tune neurogenic divisions during spinal neurogenesis.</p>

<title>E47 co-operates distinctly with ASCL1 and NEUROG1 in an E-box dependent manner and through physical interactions</title>
<p>To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential co-operation of E proteins with the distinct proneural proteins, we focused on the interaction of E47 with ASCL1 and NEUROG1. A DNA-binding deficient version of NEUROG1 (NEUROG1-AQ, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sun et al, 2001</xref>), was unable to transactivate the NEUROG-responsive pNeuroD:luc reporter or to promote neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, the ability of NEUROG1 to trigger neuronal differentiation during spinal neurogenesis depends on its transcriptional activity, as previously reported for ASCL1 and ATOH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nakada et al, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Genome-wide ChIP-seq studies have established that the preferential E-box motifs bound by ASCL1, E47 and NEUROG1 correspond respectively to CAGCTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borromeo et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castro et al, 2011</xref>), CAGSTG (where S stands for C or G: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lin et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pfurr et al, 2017</xref>) and CADATG (where D stands for A, G or T: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Madelaine &#x0026; Blader, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seo et al, 2007</xref>). In the light of these intrinsic preferences, we tested how E47 modulates the abilities of ASCL1 and NEUROG1 to bind to DNA and activate transcription via different E-boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 5-figure supplement 2A</xref>). E47 acted in synergy with both ASCL1 and NEUROG1 to drive transcription of the pkE7:luc reporter under the control of 7 CAGGTG repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). By contrast, E47 and ASCL1 only weakly transactivated the pNeuroD:luc reporter, the promoter of which contains 9 CADATG E-boxes and 1 CAGGTG box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). A similar result was obtained with a version of the pNeuroD:luc reporter in which the single CAGGTG motif was destroyed by mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 5-figure supplement 2B</xref>), reinforcing the idea that both E47 and ASCL1 preferentially bind to CAGSTG sequences. Intriguingly, E47 markedly reduced the ability of NEUROG1 to enhance pNeuroD:luc activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). A similar result was obtained with the mutated version of the pNeuroD:luc reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 5-figure supplement 2C</xref>), ruling out the possibility that specific E47 binding to the single CAGGTG motif in this promoter caused this inhibition. <italic>In vitro</italic> ChIP assays demonstrated that E47 can bind to and enhance ASCL1 binding at the 7 CAGGTG-containing promoter region of the pkE7:luc reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with the notion that their heterodimerization is required for optimal binding and subsequent transcriptional activation. By contrast, E47 caused a significant reduction in the amount of NEUROG1 bound to the promoter region of the pNeuroD:luc reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The fact that E47 itself bound to this promoter region suggested that E47 and NEUROG1 compete for binding to CADATG motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), although E47 cannot transactivate them as potently as NEUROG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Together, these results revealed that E47 acts in synergy with both ASCL1 and NEUROG1 when binding to its own optimal E-box (CAGSTG), while it somehow impedes NEUROG1 from binding to CADATG motifs.</p>

<p>To confirm that the differential co-operation of E47 with ASCL1 and NEUROG1 is due to a direct physical interaction, we compared the activity of tethered constructs that were designed to produce homodimers of ASCL1 (A-A) and NEUROG1 (N-N), or heterodimers with E47 (A-E, N-E: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure 5-figure supplement 3A-C</xref>). Consistent with the results obtained with monomers, A-E heterodimers were significantly more potent than A-A homodimers in driving pkE7:luc activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure 5-figure supplement 3D</xref>), while N-N homodimers transactivated pNeuroD:luc much more strongly than N-E heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure 5-figure supplement 3E</xref>). A-A and A-E promoted similar neuronal differentiation 48 hpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H-J,M</xref>), but the average number of EP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells obtained after A-E electroporation was significantly less than after A-A electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>), suggesting that A-E promotes early neurogenic divisions more potently than A-A. This idea was supported by the ability of A-E to repress pSox2:luc activity at 20 hpe, unlike A-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure 5-figure supplement 3F</xref>). As for NEUROG1, N-N was significantly more potent than N-E at promoting neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K-M</xref>), at reducing the average number of EP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells generated 48 hpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>) and at repressing pSox2:luc activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure 5-figure supplement 3F</xref>). Thus, the tethered constructs performed like the monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-V</xref>), supporting the conclusion that E47 facilitates the ability of ASCL1 and restrains that of NEUROG1 to trigger neurogenic divisions during spinal neurogenesis.</p>

<title>E47 co-operates differentially with ASCL1 and NEUROG1/NEUROG2 during corticogenesis</title>
<p>We were interested to determine if this differential co-operation of E47 with the distinct proneural proteins could be extended to other regions of the developing CNS. We tested this hypothesis in the developing cerebral cortex, as NEUROG1/2 and ASCL1 all contribute to neurogenesis in this region in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al, 2014</xref>). The development of the cerebral cortex in birds actually shows unexpected similarities to mammalian corticogenesis, including the conservation of its temporal sequence of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dugas-Ford et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Suzuki et al, 2012</xref>). As in mammals, corticogenesis in the chick embryo originates from a region of the dorsal pallium expressing PAX6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Suzuki et al, 2012</xref>). From E3 to E5, an early phase of corticogenesis produces the first SOX2<sup>-</sup>;HuC/D<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cortical neurons, which are generated specifically from PAX6<sup>&#x002B;</sup>;TBR2<sup>-</sup> radial glia-like progenitors that divide at the apical surface, as in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>). Cortical TBR2<sup>&#x002B;</sup> progenitors that divide basally, similar to mammalian intermediate progenitor cells, appear at around E5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D-D</xref>&#x201D;). The cortical neurons produced during this early phase express TBR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure 6-figure supplement 1A</xref>), as well as other markers typically expressed by mammalian deep-layer neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dugas-Ford et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Suzuki et al, 2012</xref>).

Both NEUROG1 and NEUROG2 triggered significant neuronal differentiation in the developing cerebral cortex in a cell autonomous and dose-dependent manner, whereas ASCL1 overexpression had only a minor effect <italic>per se</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I-L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure 6-figure supplement 1B</xref>). E47, which itself had no obvious effect at this concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I,M,Q</xref>), significantly increased neuronal differentiation when combined with ASCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J,N,Q</xref>). Conversely, E47 markedly reduced the ability of NEUROG1, and to a lesser extent that of NEUROG2, to promote neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K-Q</xref>). These results suggest that E47 also co-operates differentially with ASCL1 and NEUROG1/2 in the context of cortical neurogenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Class I HLH/E proteins are generally described as obligatory and permissive co-factors for proneural proteins, which must form heterodimers to become active and regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang &#x0026; Baker, 2015</xref>). The main findings of this study are that the co-operation between E proteins and proneural proteins might be more complex than originally thought. Indeed, our results revealed that E proteins can facilitate or restrain the transcriptional activity of proneural bHLH TFs depending on the E-boxes involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Model of the dual co-operation of E proteins with proneural proteins.</title>
<p>In neural progenitors, ID proteins (ID) physically sequester E proteins (E), thereby regulating their ability to interact with ASCL1 and ATOH1 (A) or NEUROG1/2 (N). When E protein availability is limited, ASCL1/ATOH1 cannot bind optimally to high affinity CAGSTG E-box motifs, resulting in poor regulation of their target genes and favouring symmetric proliferative (PP) divisions and hence, progenitor maintenance. The release of E proteins from IDs allows heterodimerization with ASCL1/ATOH1, resulting in optimal binding to CAGSTG motifs, correct regulation of the target genes and the appropriate increase in neurogenic asymmetric (PN) and self-consuming (NN) divisions. In the absence of E proteins, NEUROG1/2 bind to high affinity CADATG motifs, possibly as homodimers, and regulate the expression of target genes in an exacerbated manner. This deregulation results in excessive neurogenic divisions that cause premature neuronal differentiation and depletion of the progenitor pool. In the presence of E proteins and when N-E heterodimers are formed, the activity of NEUROG1/2 is moderated and the proportions of the different modes of divisions are balanced appropriately to sustain the progenitor population while promoting correct neuronal differentiation.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>On the one hand, our results support a revised model whereby E proteins synergize with proneural proteins specifically at CAGSTG E-boxes, the preferential motifs of E proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lin et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pfurr et al, 2017</xref>). Therefore, E proteins facilitate the activity of the proneural proteins that share their preferential binding to CAGSTG motifs, such as ASCL1 and ATOH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borromeo et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castro et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klisch et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lai et al, 2011</xref>). Inhibiting the activity of endogenous E proteins by expressing the E47bm mutant strongly impaired the generation of interneurons derived from spinal progenitors that express ATOH1 or ASCL1 alone. Conversely, enhancing the expression of E47 reinforced the ability of ATOH1 and more markedly, that of ASCL1 to promote neuronal differentiation. Our results suggest that this results from the capacity of E47 to increase the ability of these proneural proteins to trigger neurogenic divisions at the expense of proliferative ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Such co-operation appears to be particularly crucial in the case of ASCL1, whose overexpression could barely increase neurogenic divisions <italic>per se.</italic> These observations support a growing body of evidence that ASCL1 possesses a mild neurogenic potential. For instance, the broad dP3-dP5 domain of spinal progenitors, in which ASCL1 is expressed alone or in combination with PTF1a, expands at the end of the first neurogenic wave before producing large numbers of dILA/B neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borromeo et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wildner et al, 2006</xref>). Later on, ASCL1 is also involved in promoting oligodendrogenesis in both the developing brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al, 2014</xref>). Moreover, recent studies have reported cell cycle promoting-genes among the targets bound by ASCL1 in the ventral telencephalon and that it also sustains the proliferation of adult neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castro et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Urban et al, 2016</xref>), suggesting that its mild neurogenic ability might actually be required to sustain long-term production of the neural lineages. Whether the ability of ASCL1 to maintain neural progenitor pools is related to its dependence on the availability of E proteins is an intriguing hypothesis that would be worth testing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our findings demonstrate that E proteins inhibit proneural protein binding to CADATG motifs. In consequence, E proteins restrict the activity of the proneural proteins that preferentially bind to these motifs, such as NEUROG1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Madelaine &#x0026; Blader, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seo et al, 2007</xref>). Since E47 restrains the capacity of NEUROG1/2 to promote neuronal differentiation in the context of both spinal neurogenesis and corticogenesis, this would appear to be a general feature of their behaviour. Early E47 depletion was recently shown to increase the production of both TBR1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and SATB2<sup>&#x002B;</sup> neurons at mid-corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pfurr et al, 2017</xref>). In fact, the loss of E47 in early cortical progenitors, for which NEUROG2 constitutes the main proneural protein, causes premature neuronal differentiation. This is consistent with our model and it contrasts with the block in neuronal differentiation that would be expected if E47 was essential for NEUROG2 activity.</p>
<p>Our results also suggest that NEUROGs do not necessarily need to form heterodimers with E proteins to trigger neuronal differentiation. Indeed, NEUROG1/2-dependent differentiation is only mildly affected by the loss of E47 activity, and forced NEUROG1 homodimers more efficiently drive CADATG dependent transcription and neuronal differentiation than NEUROG1-E47 heterodimers. Similarly, NEUROG2 homodimers better transactivate neuronal differentiation genes than NEUROG2-E47 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al, 2012</xref>), and EMSA experiments suggest that multiple combinations of proneural homo- and heterodimers exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Henke et al, 2009</xref>). The physiological relevance of such proneural homodimers is worthy of further study but to date, our attempts to determine whether NEUROG1 homodimers are formed <italic>in vivo</italic> during spinal neurogenesis remain inconclusive for technical reasons (data not shown). Nevertheless, the strong capacity of NEUROGs to trigger neurogenic divisions independent of E proteins, including self-consuming NN divisions, correlates well with the fact that neural progenitors expressing NEUROG1/NEUROG2 are usually depleted during the neurogenic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Simmons et al, 2001</xref>). Together, these results support the notion that E proteins are required to dampen the capacity of NEUROGs to trigger neurogenic divisions, thereby avoiding the premature depletion of neural progenitor pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>This dual mode of action of E proteins in conjunction with ASCL1/ATOH1 or NEUROG1/NEUROG2 would also explain why modulating canonical BMP activity affects differently the generation of the distinct neuronal subtypes produced during primary spinal neurogenesis. Inhibiting BMP7 or SMAD1/5 would result in the release of E proteins from their complexes with IDs. In turn, this would facilitate ATOH1 and ASCL1 activity, prematurely increasing the proportion of neurogenic divisions undertaken by the corresponding dP1 and dP3/dP5/p2 progenitors, causing their premature differentiation and exhaustion, and ultimately leading to a production of fewer neurons. As NEUROGs are less dependent on E proteins, the inhibition of canonical BMP signalling only mildly impairs the generation of the neuronal subtypes that derive from progenitors expressing NEUROG1/NEUROG2.</p>
<p>In summary, the results presented here led us to propose that E proteins fine-tune neurogenesis by buffering the activity of the distinct proneural proteins. As such, these data add another layer of sophistication to the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity of proneural bHLH proteins and hence, neurogenesis.</p>

Plasmids were diluted in RNAse-free water at the required concentration [0 to 4 &#x03BC;g/pl] and injected into the lumen of the caudal neural tube or the right cerebral ventricle using a fine glass needle. Electroporation was triggered by applying 5 pulses of 50 ms at 22.5 V with 50 ms intervals using an Intracel Dual Pulse (TSS10) electroporator. Electroporated chicken embryos were incubated back at 37C and recovered at the times indicated (16-48 hours post-electroporation).</p>
