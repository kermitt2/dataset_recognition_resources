<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Accurate detection of extracellular chemical gradients is essential for many cellular behaviors. Gradient sensing is challenging for small cells, which experience little difference in ligand concentrations on the up-gradient and down-gradient sides of the cell. Nevertheless, the tiny cells of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> reliably decode gradients of extracellular pheromones to find their mates. By imaging the behavior of polarity factors and pheromone receptors during mating encounters, we found that gradient decoding involves two steps. First, cells bias orientation of initial polarity up-gradient, even though they have unevenly distributed receptors. To achieve this, they measure the local fraction of occupied receptors, rather than absolute number. However, this process is error-prone, and subsequent exploratory behavior of the polarity factors corrects initial errors via communication between mating partners. The mobile polarity sites convert the difficult problem of spatial gradient decoding into the easier one of sensing temporal changes in local pheromone levels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemical gradients provide cells with critical information about their surroundings, allowing them to navigate via chemotropism (gradient-directed growth) or chemotaxis (gradient-directed migration). For example, axons steer their growth up gradients of netrin to form new synapses, social amoebae crawl up gradients of cAMP to aggregate into fruiting bodies, sperm swim up gradients of chemoattractants to find eggs, and neutrophils migrate up gradients of peptides shed by bacteria or cytokines secreted by other cells of the immune system to eliminate pathogens from mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alvarez, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Swaney, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">von Philipsborn and Bastmeyer, 2007</xref>). In each case, cells sense external signals via G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), leading to cytoskeletal reorganization that produces directional growth or movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Insall, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The sequence of molecular events that transduce extracellular chemical signals to produce gradient-directed outputs is perhaps best understood in the genetically tractable budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> Yeast are non-motile unicellular fungi, and haploid yeast cells of mating type <bold>a</bold> can mate with haploids of mating type &#x03B1; to yield diploids. The haploids secrete peptide pheromones that bind GPCRs on cells of the opposite mating type (&#x03B1;-factor is sensed by Ste2 in <bold>a</bold> cells, and <bold>a</bold>-factor is sensed by Ste3 in &#x03B1; cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wang and Dohlman, 2004</xref>). Pheromone-bound receptors activate heterotrimeric G-proteins to generate GTP-G&#x03B1; and free G&#x03B2;&#x03B3;. G&#x03B2;&#x03B3; in turn recruits two key scaffold proteins, Ste5 and Far1, from the cell interior to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nern and Arkowitz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Butty, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pryciak and Huntress, 1998</xref>). Ste5 recruitment leads to activation of the MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1, which induce transcription of mating-related genes and arrest the cell cycle in G1 phase in preparation for mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pryciak and Huntress, 1998</xref>). Ste5-induced MAPK activation also promotes cytoskeletal polarization, but Far1 recruitment is required to orient the cytoskeleton towards the mating partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Matheos, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pryciak and Huntress, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Valtz, et al., 1995</xref>). Far1 transduces the pheromone gradient by providing spatial information to the conserved Rho-family GTPase Cdc42, which is the master regulator of cell polarity in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bi and Park, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nern and Arkowitz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Butty, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nern and Arkowitz, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>To establish a polarized axis, Cdc42 becomes concentrated and activated at a site on the cell cortex referred to as a &#x201C;polarity patch&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bi and Park, 2012</xref>). The localized active Cdc42 then acts through formins to orient linear actin cables towards the site, and the cables deliver secretory vesicles that mediate local growth and fusion with a mating partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pruyne and Bretscher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Evangelista, et al., 1997</xref>). Polarity establishment is thought to involve a positive feedback loop whereby local GTP-Cdc42 promotes activation of further Cdc42 in its vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Johnson, et al., 2011</xref>). Cdc42 is activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Cdc24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zheng, et al., 1994</xref>), which is recruited to the polarity patch by the scaffold protein Bem1, which is itself recruited to the patch by Cdc42 effectors, providing a mechanism for positive feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kozubowski, et al., 2008</xref>). Cdc24 also binds directly to Far1, and the G&#x03B2;&#x03B3;-Far1-Cdc24 complex is thought to enhance GEF-mediated Cdc42 activation at sites with elevated levels of free G&#x03B2;&#x03B3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nern and Arkowitz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Butty, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nern and Arkowitz, 1998</xref>). Mutations that disrupt Far1-Cdc24 binding do not affect polarity establishment <italic>per se</italic>, but they completely abolish the ability to properly orient polarity with respect to the pheromone gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nern and Arkowitz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Butty, et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, Far1 provides a direct spatial connection between upstream receptor-pheromone binding and downstream Cdc42 activation, allowing the cells to exploit the pheromone gradient to find their partners.</p>
<p>Like other eukaryotic cells, yeast are thought to compare the ligand concentrations across the cell to determine the orientation of the gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arkowitz, 2009</xref>). If the distribution of pheromone-activated receptors reflects the pheromone gradient, then G&#x03B2;&#x03B3;-Far1-Cdc24 complexes will be enriched up-gradient, spatially biasing activation of Cdc42 to kick off positive feedback at the right location for mating. However, the accuracy of such global spatial gradient sensing is limited by the small yeast cell size (&#x223C;4 &#x03BC;m diameter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berg and Purcell, 1977</xref>), and simulations constrained by experimental data on binding and diffusion parameters suggested that the process would be inaccurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lakhani and Elston, 2017</xref>). Indeed, when yeast are exposed to artificial, calibrated pheromone gradients, polarized growth often starts in the wrong direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Moore, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Segall, 1993</xref>). Such cells can nevertheless correct initial errors by moving the polarity site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dyer, et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Moving a Cdc42 patch that is constantly being reinforced by positive feedback seems counterintuitive, but time-lapse imaging revealed that the patch &#x201C;wandered&#x201D; around the cortex of pheromone-treated cells on a several-minute timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dyer, et al., 2013</xref>). Wandering was dependent actin cables and vesicle traffic, which serves to perturb the polarity patch (Savage et al 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dyer et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">McClure et al. 2015</xref>). New pheromone receptors are delivered to the polarity site, and after binding pheromone the receptors are rapidly internalized and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hicke, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hicke and Riezman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schandel and Jenness, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jenness and Spatrick, 1986</xref>). As a result, pheromone receptors and their associated G proteins become concentrated in the vicinity of the polarity site, generating a sensitized region of membrane that can detect the local pheromone concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">McClure, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Suchkov, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayscough and Drubin, 1998</xref>). As the polarity site wanders around the cortex, this receptive &#x201C;nose&#x201D; would sample pheromone levels at different locations. Studies of cells treated with uniform pheromone concentrations showed that when pheromone levels are high, the patch stops moving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">McClure, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dyer, et al., 2013</xref>). In principle, this &#x201C;exploratory polarization&#x201D; mechanism can explain error-correction by positing that movement of the patch continues until cells sense high pheromone levels indicating that the patch is directed towards a mating partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hegemann and Peter, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The extent to which yeast cells rely on global spatial sensing to orient the formation of a polarity patch, versus exploratory polarization after the patch has formed, remains unclear. A recent study found that when cells were placed in an artificial pheromone gradient in a microfluidics device, initial patch formation was random with respect to the gradient, and orientation occurred by exploratory polarization and &#x201C;local sensing&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hegemann, et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is unclear whether similar results might apply to different pheromone gradients, or to more physiological conditions in which gradients are generated by mating partners.</p>
<p>To better understand how yeast actually locate their mating partners, we imaged mating events in mixed populations of <bold>a</bold> and &#x03B1; cells. We found evidence for both global spatial sensing and error correction by exploratory polarization. Encounters between partners were characterized by (i) rapid and non-random initial clustering of polarity proteins biased towards the partner; (ii) an &#x201C;indecisive phase&#x201D; in which dynamic polarity sites relocalized in an apparent search process; and (iii) a &#x201C;committed phase&#x201D; in which cells polarized stably towards mating partners, culminating in fusion. Transition from indecisive to committed behavior was associated with a rise in MAPK activity. Initial polarization was surprisingly accurate given that it occurred despite a highly non-uniform (and thus potentially misleading) distribution of receptors. We found that the variation in receptor density was corrected for via &#x201C;ratiometric&#x201D; sensing of the ratio of occupied vs unoccupied pheromone receptors across the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bush, et al., 2016</xref>). In aggregate, our findings reveal how yeast cells can overcome the challenges imposed by small cell size and lack of cell mobility to locate mating partners.</p>

<title>Indecisive and committed phases of mating cell polarization</title>
<p>To observe how cells find their mates, we mixed <bold>a</bold> and &#x03B1; cells expressing differently colored polarity probes, Bem1-GFP (&#x03B1;) and Bem1-tdTomato (<bold>a</bold>), and imaged them at 2 min resolution (Video 1). Fusion events were identified from movies and the cells were tracked back to their time of &#x201C;birth&#x201D; (the cytokinesis that preceded the mating event). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> (top) illustrates selected frames from a representative mating cell. This cell formed a faint initial cluster of Bem1 just 4 min after birth (blue panel), which then fluctuated in intensity and moved erratically around the cell cortex for 34 min before stably polarizing adjacent to a mating partner (orange panel). After another 16 min the two cells fused, as seen by the mixing of red and green probes. We designate the time between initial cluster formation (T<sub>ic</sub>) and stable polarization (T<sub>p</sub>) as the &#x201C;indecisive phase&#x201D;, reflecting the erratic behavior of the polarity probe. We designate the time between stable polarization (T<sub>p</sub>) and fusion as the &#x201C;committed phase&#x201D; of mating, reflecting the strong and stably located polarity site.</p>

<p>To quantify the degree of Bem1 polarization, we used a metric that uses the pixel intensity distribution within the cell to assess the degree of signal clustering (hereafter, &#x201C;clustering&#x201D;: see methods). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> (graph) illustrates that Bem1 clustering fluctuated during the indecisive phase but remained high during the committed phase. This pattern was characteristic of mating cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), supporting the idea that mating involves a two-stage process. A similar two-stage process was observed for cells expressing fluorescent versions of Spa2, a polarisome component that binds and helps to localize the formin Bni1 (Video 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pruyne, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fujiwara, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sheu, et al., 1998</xref>). Analysis of cells expressing both Bem1 and Spa2 probes revealed that although (as described previously) Spa2 clusters were more tightly focused than Bem1 clusters, the probes clustered, dispersed, and moved together (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). As for Bem1, Spa2 clustering fluctuated during the indecisive phase and remained stably high during the committed phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We conclude that cells undergo a reproducible pattern of polarization during mating, with sequential indecisive and committed phases.</p>
<p>The earliest observable clustering of polarity factors occurred shortly after birth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>: median time 4 min after initiating cytokinesis). This initial clustering was usually weak and frequently at a different location than that of the final stable polarization (see below). During the ensuing indecisive phase, cells appeared to search for mating partners, often assembling polarity clusters adjacent to different potential partners before settling at a final location (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The duration of the indecisive phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>: median 42 min) was very variable, ranging from 10 to 120 min. This is consistent with a search process that would take a variable amount of time depending on the availability and proximity of potential mating partners. In contrast, the subsequent committed phase was consistently about 20 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), which we speculate is the time required to remodel the local cell walls to allow for cell fusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Commitment is synchronous for both partners</title>
<p>In our protocol, cells of each mating type are proliferating asynchronously before they are abruptly mixed. Thus, in a large majority of cases, one cell of each mating pair is born (i.e. enters G1 phase) before the other. Nevertheless, fusion is a unitary event that occurs at the same time for both. This means that the &#x201C;first-born&#x201D; partner must extend one or both phases of polarization while the &#x201C;second-born&#x201D; partner completes the previous cell cycle and &#x201C;catches up&#x201D; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Does the first-born locate and commit to its partner first, and then wait (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, top), or does the first-born remain indecisive until the second-born has caught up (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, bottom)? We found no difference in the average duration of the committed phase between first and second-born cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), and partners in each individual mating pair generally committed at nearly the same time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Conversely, the indecisive phase was significantly longer in first-born cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), suggesting that first-born cells remain indecisive while second-born cells complete the cell cycle, and that cells only polarize stably towards partners that are in G1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, bottom).</p>

<p>Synchronous commitment implies that there is some communication between partners that occurs only when both are in G1 phase of the cell cycle. As the only known mode of communication is via the secretion of pheromones, the simplest hypothesis to explain why commitment must wait until both cells are in G1 would be that pheromone secretion changes when cells enter G1. To assess the rate of pheromone synthesis, we introduced a fluorescent reporter whose production was driven by the major &#x03B1;-factor gene (MF&#x03B1;1) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Achstetter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Singh, et al., 1983</xref>). Reporter signal fluctuated regularly through the cell cycle, rising in G1 and falling (due to dilution) after bud emergence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). This result suggests that first-born cells would detect lower levels of pheromone until their partners entered G1, and that stable polarization towards a partner (commitment) may be triggered by increased pheromone signaling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Commitment coincides with an increase in MAPK activity</title>
<p>One consequence of pheromone signaling is the activation of the mating MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wang and Dohlman, 2004</xref>). To monitor MAPK activity in mating cells, we introduced a recently developed single-cell MAPK sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Durandau, et al., 2015</xref>) into our strains together with the Spa2 probe. The MAPK sensor is a fluorescent probe that moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm when it is phosphorylated by active MAPK. In the absence of pheromone, the sensor was predominantly nuclear, although the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio fluctuated somewhat through the cell cycle, peaking during anaphase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and video 3). In a mating mix, the sensor distribution became uniform prior to fusion, reflecting an increase in MAPK activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and video 4). To quantify the degree of nuclear concentration of the MAPK sensor, we measured the coefficient of variation (CV) in pixel intensity across the cell. When the probe is nuclear, the bright nuclear and dim cytoplasmic pixels yield a high CV, but when the probe distribution is uniform there is a low CV. We found considerable cell-to-cell variability in this signal, which could be largely accounted for by differences in the level of expression of the probe (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A, B</xref>). This variability could be reduced by normalizing the CV to the maximum and minimum CV for each cell, and we developed a MAPK activity metric based on the normalized CV of the probe (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>).</p>

<p>In mating cells, MAPK activity fluctuated but then climbed to a plateau about 20 min prior to fusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). As this was similar to the clustering behavior of polarity probes, we directly compared MAPK activity with Spa2 clustering in individual mating cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). These measures aligned well with one another in most cells, with both Spa2 clustering and MAPK activity fluctuating during the indecisive phase before rising to a stable plateau during the committed phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). A cross-correlation analysis of Spa2 clustering and MAPK activity during the indecisive phase revealed that they fluctuated in tandem (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). This correlation suggested that MAPK activity might promote stable polarization, or that polarization might lead to an increase in MAPK activity, or both.</p>
<p>To more directly ask whether an increase in MAPK activity promotes stable polarization, we induced MAPK activity in the absence of pheromone by expressing a membrane-tethered version of the MAPK scaffold Ste5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pryciak and Huntress, 1998</xref>). As MAPK activity increased and the MAPK sensor exited the nucleus, Spa2 switched from faint and mobile clustering to become strongly polarized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). The timing varied from cell to cell, but all cells with induced MAPK eventually arrested and formed strong polarity patches (data not shown). Thus, elevated MAPK signaling is sufficient to induce polarization.</p>

<title>Relation between pheromone sensing and polarization</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that at some point during the indecisive phase, MAPK activity rises, triggering the strong and stable polarization characteristic of the committed phase. But what would make the MAPK activity increase at that point? One possibility is that pheromone secretion is tied to polarity site behavior, so that pheromone is secreted from transient and erratically changing locations during the indecisive phase. Prior work has shown that cells have a sensitized &#x201C;nose&#x201D; enriched in receptors and G proteins surrounding the polarity site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">McClure, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Suchkov, et al., 2010</xref>), so if two cells happen to orient their polarity sites towards each other during the indecisive phase, one cell would emit pheromone in the immediate vicinity of receptors on the partner cell. That would produce a higher pheromone signal than when polarity clusters point away from each other (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To visualize the location of &#x03B1;-factor secretion, we imaged Sec4-GFP, a Rab GTPase highly concentrated on the secretory vesicles that deliver &#x03B1;-factor to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mulholland, et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Walch-Solimena, et al., 1997</xref>).

<p>Putting together our findings thus far, we propose that mating cells undergo the following sequence of events. As cells undergo cytokinesis, newborn cells in G1 phase detect enough pheromone in their surroundings to arrest the cell cycle and initiate a weak and mobile level of polarization. Cells in G1 also increase their rate of pheromone production, signaling to potential partners that they are ready to mate. As mobile polarity clusters explore the surrounding pheromone landscape during the indecisive phase, they also locally secrete pheromones to be sensed by their partners. When potential partners orient their polarity clusters towards each other, both cells perceive higher pheromone concentrations, leading to a simultaneous rise in MAPK activity in each partner. Higher MAPK activity leads to stronger polarity, and when MAPK activity crosses some threshold, the polarity clusters stop moving, now properly facing their partners. This leads to sustained high MAPK signaling during the committed phase, maintaining polarity until fusion can occur.</p>

<title>Gradient sensing before initial polarity clustering</title>
<p>The view of the mating process outlined above proposes an important role for polarity clusters in tracking pheromone gradients to locate partners, as recently suggested by other studies which noted mobile polarity sites in cells exposed to uniform pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">McClure, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dyer, et al., 2013</xref>) or artificial pheromone gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hegemann, et al., 2015</xref>). This idea differs markedly from the traditional view, in which initially unpolarized G1 cells first sense the pheromone gradient and only then polarize, generally in the right direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ismael and Stone, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ismael, et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Suchkov, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arkowitz, 2009</xref>). These views are not mutually exclusive, and it could be that significant gradient sensing takes place prior to the initial clustering of polarity factors. Indeed, we found that in our mating mixtures, cells biased the locations of their initial clusters towards their eventual mating partners (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), suggesting that a form of global spatial gradient sensing occurs in the few minutes between cell birth and initial clustering. In contrast, we found no bias towards the previous cytokinesis site (neck) under our conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The directional bias towards partners was similar in first-born and second-born cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Among second-born cells, those that formed their initial clusters within 60&#x00B0; of their partners took less time to commit than those whose initial clusters were less well-oriented (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>: median indecisive phase duration 32 min vs 48 min). Thus, gradient sensing before polarity cluster formation can shorten the search for a partner.</p>

<title>Non-uniform pheromone receptor distribution</title>
<p>How would spatial gradient sensing occur? Studies in other model systems like <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> indicated that receptors and their coupled G proteins were distributed uniformly around the cell surface, with active G proteins reflecting the external ligand gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Janetopoulos, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jin, et al., 2000</xref>). Receptor distribution has been harder to assess in yeast cells, for technical reasons stemming from the rapid secretion and recycling of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Suchkov, et al., 2010</xref>). Transit of pheromones and pheromone receptors through the secretory pathway is rapid (5-10 min)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Losev, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Govindan, et al., 1995</xref>). In the presence of &#x03B1;-factor, Ste2 is then endocytosed on a 10-min timescale and delivered to the vacuole for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hicke, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hicke and Riezman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schandel and Jenness, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jenness and Spatrick, 1986</xref>).

Moreover, the GFP moiety survives intact in the vacuole following receptor degradation, yielding a high vacuolar fluorescence signal. To partially resolve these issues, we tagged Ste2 with sfGFP, which matures on a 6-min timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Khmelinskii, et al., 2012</xref>). Although bright vacuoles remained, the surface Ste2-sfGFP was clearly visible (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), allowing us to assess Ste2 distribution. In cells that were not exposed to &#x03B1;-factor, Ste2 distribution varied throughout the cell cycle, accumulating in the bud (enriched at the tip) and depleted in the mother during bud growth, and then accumulating at the neck during cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). G1 cells displayed quite variable Ste2 distributions, ranging from nearly uniform to highly polarized (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>: left).

<p>The non-uniform receptor distribution poses a significant problem for accurate gradient sensing, because cells would be preferentially sensitive to pheromone on the side where receptors are enriched, which would not necessarily correspond to the side facing a mating partner. To directly observe the relationship between Bem1 clustering and Ste2 distribution, we imaged MAT<bold>a</bold> cells carrying both Ste2-sfGFP and Bem1-tdTomato, mixed with MAT&#x03B1; cells in mating reactions. If receptor density impacts the location of initial clustering, we would expect that Bem1 clustering would occur preferentially on the side with higher Ste2 signal. Individual cells clustered Bem1 at various different locations relative to the Ste2 distribution, and in several cells the initial Bem1 cluster formed adjacent to a mating partner even though Ste2 was concentrated at the opposite end of the cell (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Averaging revealed no clear spatial correlation between the location of Bem1 initial clustering and the Ste2 distribution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). We conclude that cells are able to perform a surprisingly accurate degree of gradient sensing prior to polarization, despite having non-uniform receptor distributions.</p>

<title>Effect of changing receptor distribution on gradient sensing</title>
<p>To probe the degree to which receptor distribution influences the accuracy of gradient sensing, we sought to manipulate receptor distribution. Ste2 distribution reflects a dynamic balance between polarized secretion of new Ste2, slow diffusion at the plasma membrane, and retrieval by endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Suchkov, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Valdez-Taubas and Pelham, 2003</xref>). Endocytosis is more rapid for ligand-bound Ste2 (which undergoes phosphorylation and ubiquitination) than for unbound Ste2 (which is endocytosed at a slower basal rate)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hicke, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Terrell, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hicke and Riezman, 1996</xref>). To manipulate Ste2 distribution, we used Ste2 mutants that either lacked endocytosis signals (Ste2<sup>7XR-GPAAD</sup>, allowing accumulation all over the membrane) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ballon, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Terrell, et al., 1998</xref>) or had a constitutively active strong endocytosis signal (Ste2<sup>NPF</sup> yielding a highly polarized distribution with a bias toward the mother-bud neck)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tan, et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A, B</xref>). As endocytosis is needed for Ste2 degradation, Ste2<sup>7XR-GPAAD</sup> was more abundant than Ste2 or Ste2<sup>NPF</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), and in halo assays cells expressing Ste2<sup>NPF</sup> were slightly less sensitive to pheromone while cells expressing Ste2<sup>7XR-GPAAD</sup> were more sensitive to pheromone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Correspondingly, in mating mixes cells with Ste2<sup>NPF</sup> sometimes re-entered the cell cycle despite being adjacent to potential partners, while cells with Ste2<sup>7XR-GPAAD</sup> were more likely to remain arrested and mate (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>).

Cells that budded instead of committing to a partner were recorded as never entering the committed phase. Among the cells that successfully mated, indecisive phases had similar durations, suggesting that indecisive phase dynamics were unaffected by the changes in receptor distribution.</p>

<title>Ratiometric sensing of receptor occupancy</title>
<p>One way to correct for variations in receptor density would be to measure the local ratio of ligand-bound to unbound receptors (i.e. ratiometric sensing). If cells were to respond to the spatial distribution of the <italic>ratio</italic> of active/total receptors, rather than the spatial distribution of active receptors, then differences in the local receptor density would not distort a cell&#x2019;s ability to determine the orientation of the pheromone gradient. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bush, et al., 2016</xref>) proposed a mechanism for ratiometric sensing by Ste2, based on the observation that the RGS protein (regulator of G-protein signaling) Sst2 binds to unoccupied Ste2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ballon, et al., 2006</xref>). Pheromone-bound Ste2 loads GTP on G&#x03B1;, whereas unbound Ste2-Sst2 promotes GTP hydrolysis by G&#x03B1;, so the level of activated G&#x03B1; depends on the ratio between pheromone-bound and unbound Ste2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Although originally proposed as a global mechanism to integrate signaling from all Ste2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bush, et al., 2016</xref>), in principle this mechanism could also apply locally to extract the gradient of pheromone from the spatial distribution of bound/unbound receptor.</p>

We found that two copies of hsRGS4 expressed from the <italic>SST2</italic> promoter were sufficient to restore wildtype pheromone sensitivity (as judged by halo assays) to cells lacking endogenous Sst2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). Compared with cells containing Sst2, cells with hsRGS4&#x00D7;2 were significantly worse at orienting at their initial Bem1 clusters towards their partners (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). Instead, the initial clusters in hsRGS4&#x00D7;2 cells were strongly biased towards the previous mother-bud neck (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>), a region of high receptor density (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Indeed, a direct comparison showed that unlike wild-type cells, hsRGS4&#x00D7;2 cells displayed a strong tendency to establish initial clusters of Bem1 at sites enriched for Ste2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Thus, gradient sensing depends on the endogenous RGS protein Sst2, which may assist in this process by linking G&#x03B1; GTP hydrolysis to the location of unbound receptor.</p>
<p>If the inaccurate gradient sensing exhibited by hsRGS4&#x00D7;2 cells is indeed due to disruption of ratiometric sensing, then the orientation defect of hsRGS4&#x00D7;2 should be corrected if the cells were to have uniformly distributed receptors (i.e. ratiometric sensing should be unnecessary if receptor density is uniform). We used the more uniformly distributed Ste2<sup>7XR-GPAAD</sup> to test this hypothesis, and found that Ste2<sup>7XR-GPAAD</sup> restored the accuracy of initial Bem1 clustering to wildtype levels in hsRGS4&#x00D7;2 cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D,E,F</xref>). These findings suggest that yeast cells use Sst2-dependent local ratiometric sensing of receptor occupancy to extract accurate information from the pheromone gradient despite having non-uniform receptor density.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>Initial polarity cluster location is surprisingly accurate</title>
<p>The rapid diffusion of peptide pheromones and the small size of the yeast cell led to the expectation that there would be only a small difference in pheromone concentration between the up-and down-gradient sides of the cell. This poses a fundamental difficulty in extracting accurate directional information in the face of molecular noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berg and Purcell, 1977</xref>). Indeed, a recent study on cells responding to a 0.5 nM/&#x03BC;m pheromone gradient found that initial polarity cluster location was close to random with respect to the gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hegemann, et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, simulations of gradient sensing suggested that even with uniformly distributed receptors and error-free interpretation of the ligand-bound receptor distribution, the signal from such gradients would be obscured by molecular noise and diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lakhani and Elston, 2017</xref>). In principle, time-averaging of the ligand-bound receptor distribution could extract the signal from the noise, but we show that initial clustering of polarity factors occurs 5.1 &#x002B;/-2.7 min from cell birth, which is too fast to allow for significant time averaging given the slow timescale of yeast pheromone-receptor binding and dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bajaj, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Raths, et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jenness, et al., 1986</xref>). If pheromone levels were high enough, however, this rapid polarization may be able to take advantage of pre-equilibrium sensing and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ventura, et al., 2014</xref>), a proposed mechanism in which directionality is inferred from the rates of pheromone binding rather than steady-state distributions.</p>
<p>Two other factors make it even harder for yeast cells to extract accurate spatial information from pheromone gradients. First, the polarity circuit in yeast contains strong positive feedback sufficient to allow symmetry-breaking polarization in the absence of a directional cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chiou, et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Johnson, et al., 2011</xref>). This allows cells to polarize in random directions when treated with uniform pheromone concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dyer, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Strickfaden and Pryciak, 2008</xref>), and would be expected to enable noise-driven polarization in random directions in cells responding to a shallow pheromone gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chou, et al., 2008</xref>). Second, we found that yeast cells do not have uniform receptor distributions. The polarized secretion, slow diffusion, and subsequent endocytosis of pheromone receptors resulted in significant receptor asymmetry, with (on average) three-fold more concentrated receptors on one side of the cell than the other. This creates a receptor gradient that is significantly steeper than the assumed pheromone gradient detected by the cells. As the receptor gradient is randomly oriented with respect to the mating partner, this poses a serious hurdle in accurate gradient detection.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties enumerated above, we found that the location of initial polarity factor clustering in mating mixtures was highly non-random and surprisingly accurate, with more than 40&#x0025; of cells clustering within 30&#x00B0; of the correct direction and less than 5&#x0025; of cells clustering in the opposite segment (a random process would have 17&#x0025; of cells polarizing in each of these segments). This finding suggests that physiological pheromone gradients may be considerably steeper than previously assumed, and/or that cells possess unappreciated mechanisms to overcome the difficulties in accurate gradient detection discussed above.</p>

<title>Orientation accuracy is enhanced by ratiometric sensing</title>
<p>One way to avoid being misled by an asymmetric receptor distribution would be to compare the local <italic>ratio</italic> of occupied and unoccupied receptors, rather than simply the density of occupied receptors, across the cell surface. An elegant mechanism to extract information about the fraction of occupied receptors was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bush, et al. (2016)</xref>. Because the RGS protein Sst2 binds to unoccupied receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ballon, et al., 2006</xref>), those receptors promote GTP hydrolysis by G&#x03B1;. Conversely, occupied receptors catalyze GTP-loading by G&#x03B1;. Thus, the net level of GTP-G&#x03B1; reflects the fraction (and not the number) of occupied receptors on the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bush, et al., 2016</xref>). For this mechanism to promote <italic>local</italic> ratiometric sensing requires additionally that a pheromone-bound receptor diffuse slowly relative to its lifetime at the surface (&#x223C;10 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jenness and Spatrick, 1986</xref>), so that information about where receptors were when they bound to pheromone is not lost. Similarly, GTP-G&#x03B1; and G&#x03B2;&#x03B3; must diffuse slowly relative to the timeframe for G&#x03B1; GTP hydrolysis and G protein re-association, so that information about where they were when they became activated is not lost.</p>
<p>We found that when RGS function was delocalized by replacing Sst2 (which binds unoccupied receptors) with an equivalent amount of hsRGS4 (which binds the plasma membrane), the accuracy of initial polarity clustering was severely compromised. Instead of polarizing towards potential partners, these cells assembled polarity clusters at regions where receptors were concentrated (often at the site of the last cell division or neck). Thus, abrogating the Sst2-based ratiometric sensing mechanism allowed cells to be misled by the asymmetric receptor distribution. Accurate orientation could be restored to these cells by manipulations that made receptor distribution more uniform. In sum, our findings suggest that local ratiometric sensing compensates for uneven receptor distribution and allows more accurate polarization towards mating partners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Why is receptor distribution non-uniform?</title>
<p>Blocking receptor endocytosis allowed receptors to accumulate all over the cell surface in a much more uniform distribution than that seen in wild-type cells. In our mating conditions, this promoted a slightly more accurate orientation of initial polarity factor clustering towards mating partners, and a small improvement in mating efficiency. Why, then, would cells internalize their receptors and create the need for error correction by ratiometric sensing? One possible answer stems from the fact that wild yeast (unlike lab strains) are able to switch mating type. Without receptor endocytosis, cells may be unable to clear pre-existing receptors during mating type switching, generating a situation in which cells arrest in response to their own newly secreted pheromones after a switch. We speculate that receptor endocytosis is necessary to clear the membrane of old receptors when switching mating types, and that receptor asymmetry is the price that cells pay for this advantage.</p>

<title>Error correction following initial clustering of polarity factors</title>
<p>Although initial polarity clusters were biased to occur near potential mating partners, the process was error-prone and about 60&#x0025; of cells failed to orient initial polarity within 30&#x00B0; of the correct direction. Nevertheless, these cells did eventually polarize towards partners and mate successfully, indicating the presence of a potent error correction mechanism. We found that after initial clustering, polarity factor clusters relocated erratically during an &#x201C;indecisive phase&#x201D; of variable duration (48 &#x002B;/-24 min). Even cells that had correctly assembled initial polarity clusters close to mating partners exhibited an indecisive phase, although of somewhat shorter duration. During this phase, clusters fluctuated in intensity (concentration of polarity factors in the cluster), extent (broader vs more focused clusters), location, and number (transiently showing no cluster or 2-3 clusters instead of a single cluster). The dynamic polarity clusters were able to polarize actin cables, as we detected frequent accumulation of secretory vesicles at cluster locations. We suggest that this erratic behavior represents a search process in which weak polarity clusters act both as sources of pheromone secretion and locations of pheromone sensing, allowing communication between potential mating partners. At the end of the indecisive phase, cells developed strong and stable polarity sites correctly oriented towards their partners.</p>
<p>The strongest evidence that partners are engaged in communicating with each other during the indecisive phase is that mating pairs ended the indecisive behavior nearly simultaneously (within 5 min of each other). As one partner was born before the other, the durations of their indecisive phases were often quite different, but they transitioned to stable polarization together. Strengthening of the polarity cluster was correlated with an increase in mating MAPK activity, and synthetic induction of MAPK without pheromone led to a similar strengthening of polarity clusters. We speculate that during the indecisive phase, the cells are exposed to a dynamic and constantly changing pheromone landscape. When a mobile polarity cluster is distant from its partner&#x2019;s cluster, both cells detect relatively low levels of pheromone, leading to intermediate levels of MAPK activity. But if clusters happen to point directly at each other, each cell detects a higher pheromone concentration, leading to an increase in MAPK activity. Increased MAPK then strengthens and stabilizes the polarity cluster, perhaps leading to increased local pheromone secretion and hence increased signaling in a positive feedback loop.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3e">
<title>Exploratory polarization as a mechanism for partner selection</title>
<p>Because the search strategy discussed above depends on polarized pheromone secretion and detection, we call this process &#x201C;exploratory polarization&#x201D;. This behavior is strikingly similar to the &#x201C;speed dating&#x201D; behavior recently described for mating cells of the distantly related fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Merlini, et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bendezu and Martin, 2013</xref>). In that system, potential mating partners exhibit a prolonged period in which they sequentially assemble and disassemble a weak polarity cluster at multiple locations. Clusters that happen to assemble in the vicinity of a cluster from a mating partner become strengthened and stabilized, presumably due to detection of a higher pheromone level. Thus, distantly related yeasts that mate under very different physiological circumstances (rich nutrients for budding yeast, starvation conditions for fission yeast) appear to have converged on a common and highly effective search strategy.</p>
<p>Exploratory polarization is flexible and responsive to dynamic external conditions. We found that cells abruptly reduced their level of pheromone production when they transitioned from G1 to S phase. Thus, if a potential partner were to enter the cell cycle, a cell would quickly detect reduced pheromone signaling and resume the search for other potential partners. We also noticed that cells with two potential partners nearby could transiently orient clusters towards both partners. However, that situation was unstable and cells only strengthened one polarity cluster and committed to one partner. The basis for restricting polarity to a single site in mating cells is unknown, but may be due to a competition phenomenon as documented for vegetative yeast cells that pick a single bud site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chiou, et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wu, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Howell, et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>An additional elegant feature of exploratory polarization is that it converts a very difficult problem (extracting directional information from shallow and noisy pheromone gradients) into a much easier one (detecting a sharp temporal increase in local pheromone level).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Yeast cells locate mating partners via a combination of ratiometric spatial sensing and exploratory polarization. Ratiometric sensing of the fraction of occupied receptors compensates for uneven receptor density at the cell surface, allowing cells to decode the pheromone gradient and tentatively identify the locations of potential mating partners. There follows an indecisive period of exploratory polarization in which cells can rapidly scan for partners, wait for nearby potential partners to finish the cell cycle, and identify suitable partners by reciprocal communication through pheromone secretion at the polarity sites. When partners&#x2019; polarity clusters align, cells detect higher pheromone levels, leading to increased MAPK activation and stabilization of the polarity site. The partners then enter a committed phase of about 20 minutes with stable polarization and high MAPK activity, after which they fuse.</p>

<p>To make the MF&#x03B1;1 reporter, the MF&#x03B1;1 promoter (506 base pairs upstream of the ATG) was amplified with primers that added <italic>Apa</italic>I and <italic>Hind</italic>III sites, and cloned upstream of a reporter protein with the first 28 residues of Psr1 fused to GFP, followed by the <italic>ADH1</italic> 3&#x2019;-UTR, in a plasmid with a pRS305 (<italic>LEU2</italic>) backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sikorski and Hieter, 1989</xref>).

Digestion at the <italic>PpuM</italic>I in the LEU2 sequence was used to target integration at <italic>leu2</italic>.</p>
<p>To induce MAPK activation without adding pheromone, we generated a plasmid, DLB4239 (pRS305<italic>-</italic>STE5<sub><italic>5&#x2019;UTR</italic></sub><italic>-</italic> STE5<sub><italic>3&#x2019;UTR</italic></sub><italic>-</italic> P<sub>ADH1</sub>-GAL4BD-hER-VP16-P<sub>GAL1</sub>-STE5-CTM), that can be used to replace the endogenous <italic>STE5</italic> locus with two genes: (i) a hybrid transcription factor that activates Gal4 target genes in response to estradiol (GAL4BD-hER-VP16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Takahashi and Pryciak, 2008</xref>), and (ii) a <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter driving expression of a membrane-targeted version of Ste5 (P<sub>GAL1</sub>-STE5-CTM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pryciak and Huntress, 1998</xref>).

<title>Analysis of polarity factor clustering</title>
<p>To quantify the degree of clustering of the polarity probes Spa2-mCherry, Bem1-tdTomato, and Bem1-GFP, we calculated a &#x201C;deviation from uniformity&#x201D; metric from maximum projections of fluorescent z-stack images. Deviation from uniformity, referred to here as clustering (CL), compares the cumulative distribution of pixel intensities in an actual cell, with that in a hypothetical cell with the same range of pixel intensities that are uniformly distributed. That is, CL measures how different the pixel intensity distribution is from a uniform distribution, which reflects the degree to which the signals are clustered.</p>
<p>An elliptical region of interest (ROI) was drawn around each cell at each time point. Raw pixel intensities (p) within each ROI were normalized to a minimum of 0 and maximum of 1:

<p>CL approaches a maximum of 1 when a small fraction of pixels exhibit near the maximum intensity, while most pixels are clustered near the minimum intensity &#x2013; as seen in a highly polarized cell. CL is sensitive to the size of the patch, and the distribution of intensities within the patch &#x2013; a small patch with sharp edges yields a high CL, while a broad patch with graded edges yields a low CL.

As demonstrated in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Durandau, et al., 2015</xref>), the sensor relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon phosphorylation by Fus3 or Kss1, and the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio of the sensor reflects the MAPK activity. We used the coefficient of variation (CV) of pixel intensities measured from maximum projection images to approximate the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of the probe. The CV was quite variable from cell to cell, but that variability could be limited by normalization. To approximate MAPK activity (m), an elliptical ROI was drawn around each cell at each time point using ROI_TOI_QUANT_V8. CV was measured for each cell for the 60 minutes prior to fusion, and normalized to a minimum of zero and maximum of 1. Because CV falls as MAPK activity rises was scored as:

<title>Analysis of receptor distribution</title>
<p>Membrane distribution of Ste2-sfGFP and Bem1-tdTomato were measured from medial plane fluorescent images. Using FIJI software, fluorescence intensity was averaged across the width of a 3-pixel-wide line tracing the membrane of each cell, drawn with the freehand tool. For comparison of peak location (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>) the values for individual linescans were normalized by subtracting the background fluorescence, dividing by the maximum point in the linescan, and multiplying by 100 get the &#x0025;-maximum value. For comparison of receptor uniformity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>) the values of individual linescans were normalized by subtracting the background, and bringing each cell to an integral of 1. To generate average distributions, splines were fit to each Ste2 linescan using the smooth.spline function in R, with a 0.75 smoothing factor. The normalized curves for Ste2 or Bem1 from the previous step were then centered on the maximum from the Ste2 spline fit and averaged.</p>

<p>Cells were grown to mid-log-phase (OD<sub>600</sub> &#x2248; 0.4) at 30&#x00B0;C overnight in YEPD (1&#x0025; yeast extract, 2&#x0025; peptone, 2&#x0025; dextrose). Cultures were diluted to 2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL, and 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells were spread on YEPD plates in triplicate using sterile glass beads. Plates were allowed to dry for several minutes, and then 2 &#x03BC;L of 1 mM, 500 &#x03BC;M, and 100 &#x03BC;M &#x03B1;-factor was spotted in three separate spots on each plate. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 30&#x00B0;C, and then images were taken using a Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR&#x002B; system. Using FIJI software, circles were fit to the zone of arrest surrounding each &#x03B1;-factor spot, and the diameter of the circles was measured in pixels.</p>

<p>Cell cultures were grown in triplicate overnight to mid-log phase in YEPD. 10<sup>7</sup> cells were collected by centrifugation, and protein was extracted by TCA precipitation as described (Keaton et al., 2008). Electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described (Bose et al. 2001). Polyclonal anti-Cdc11 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used at 1:5000 dilution and monoclonal mouse anti-GFP antibodies (Roche) were used at 1:2000 dilution. Fluorophore conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse (IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG, LI-COR) and rabbit (Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Invitrogen) antibodies were used at 1:10000 dilution. Blots were visualized and quantified with the ODYSSEY imaging system (LI-COR). All values were normalized to a Cdc11 loading control.</p>
