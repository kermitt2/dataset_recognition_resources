        <p>Sanfilippo disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type III, MPS III) is a severe metabolic disorder caused by accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS), one of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), due to a genetic defect resulting in a deficiency of GAG hydrolysis. This disorder is characterized as the most severe neurological form of MPS, revealing rapid deterioration of brain functions. Among therapeutic approaches for MPS III, one of the most promising appears to be the substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Genistein (5, 7-dihydroxy-3- (4-hydroxyphenyl)-4<italic>H</italic>-1-benzopyran-4-one) is an isoflavone that has been used in SRT for MPS III. In this report, we tested effects of other flavonoids (apigenin, daidzein, kaempferol and naringenin) on GAG synthesis. Their cytotoxicity and anti-proliferation features were also tested. We found that daidzein and kaempferol inhibited GAG synthesis significantly. Moreover, these compounds were able to reduce lysosomal storage in MPS IIIA fibroblasts. Interestingly, although genistein is believed to inhibit GAG synthesis by blocking the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor, we found that effects of other flavonoids were not due to this mechanism. In fact, combinations of various flavonoids resulted in significantly more effective inhibition of GAG synthesis than the use of any of these compounds alone. These results, together with results published recently by others, suggest that combination of flavonoids can be considered as a method for improvement of efficiency of SRT for MPS III.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are inherited metabolic disorders, caused by mutations leading to dysfunction of one of enzymes involved in degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes (Beck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2007a</xref>; Neufeld and Muenzer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2001</xref>). Depending on the nature of the deficient enzyme, eleven types and subtypes of MPS are already recognized. Partially degraded GAGs accumulate in cells of MPS patients, causing dysfunction of tissues and organs, including the heart, respiratory system, bones, joints and central nervous system (CNS). In MPS types characterized by the storage of heparan sulfate (HS), one of the GAGs, neurological symptoms are among the most severe ones (Neufeld and Muenzer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2001</xref>). Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been developed for various types of MPS, and registered to date for three of them (types I, II and VI), such a treatment is ineffective for neurological symptoms as the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain-barrier (for reviews, see Beck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">b</xref>). The second therapy used in a relatively large fraction of MPS patients, bone marrow transplantation, has been shown to be efficient to some extent in MPS type I, but not in MPS III (Sanfilippo disease) (Beck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">b</xref>), an MPS type characterized by the most severe CNS dysfunctions among mucopolysaccharidoses (for recent discussion, see W&#x119;grzyn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recently, 5, 7-dihydroxy-3- (4-hydroxyphenyl)-4<italic>H</italic>-1-benzopyran-4-one), known also as genistein or 4&#x2032;, 5, 7-trihydroxyisoflavone, has been demonstrated to be an inhibitor of GAG synthesis in fibroblasts of patients suffering from various types of mucopolysaccharidoses, including MPS III (Piotrowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>). Importantly, a decrease in lysosomal GAG storage was noted after incubation of the cells with genistein (Piotrowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>). Subsequent studies indicated that genistein may be effective in treatment of mice suffering from MPS IIIB (one of four subtypes of MPS III) and MPS II, including improvement in CNS in short-term treatment of animals with the latter disease and complete correction of behavior in long-term treatment of animals with the former disease (Friso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>; Malinowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). In pilot clinical studies, it was demonstrated that treatment of patients suffering from MPS IIIA and MPS IIIB with a genistein-rich isoflavone extract resulted in statistically important improvement of all tested parameters (when mean values from all patients were compared), including cognitive functions, assessed by using a special psychological test (Piotrowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>). The effects of genistein on neurological parameters in MPS animals and humans were assumed to be due to an ability of this isoflavone to cross the blood-brain-barrier, which was demonstrated previously (Tsai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>The mechanism of the genistein-mediated substrate reduction therapy (SRT) was proposed to be due to inhibition of phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by this isoflavone (Jakobkiewicz-Banecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>). This therapeutic approach is promising (Jakobkiewicz-Banecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>), however, it is also clear that further studies are necessary to optimize this procedure. For example, Arfi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>) tested various isoflavones for their activities in correction of GAG lysosomal accumulation in MPS IIIA and MPS VII fibroblasts, and found that some of the tested compounds are as efficient as genistein in decreasing GAG storage in MPS cells, and combination of different compounds from this group may be more efficient than one single flavonoid. Therefore, in this work we tested effects of some other already known flavonoids&#x2014;not only isoflavones (genistein and daidzein, as studied by Arfi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>), but also a flavone (apigenin), a flavonol (kaempferol) and a flavanone (naringenin)&#x2014;on GAG synthesis, considering that these compounds might be potentially useful in optimization of SRT for MPS.</p>

        <title>Cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities of flavonoids</title>
        <p>We have tested different natural flavonoids for their activities as inhibitors of GAG synthesis, and thus, for their potential use in SRT for MPS. Apart from genistein, a previously investigated isoflavone, four compounds were tested: apigenin (a flavone), daidzein (an isoflavone), kaempferol (a flavonol) and naringenin (a flavanone) (see Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for their formulas).

        <p>Potential medicines should reveal low cytotoxicity and acceptable antiproliferative activity, thus, we have tested these features of the tested flavonoids. We found low cytotoxicity, assessed as LC<sub>50</sub>, of all tested compounds (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The LC<sub>50</sub> value was &gt;100&#xA0;&#x3BC;M for each tested compound, and estimation of exact values of this parameter was not possible due to low solubility of flavonoids in water (and thus in the cell culture medium). Moreover, all compounds had the IC<sub>50</sub> value higher than that of genistein in the antiproliferative activity assay (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Since genistein had been shown previously to be a relatively safe compound for treatment of MPS in both animals and human patients (Klein and King <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>; Malinowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>; Piotrowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>), we suggest that safety features of the tested flavonoids maybe acceptable at this stage of the study, though more detailed experiments, including tests on animals, are necessary to prove their safety for organisms.

        <title>Effects of flavonoids on GAG synthesis</title>
        <p>Effects of flavonoids on GAG synthesis were tested in cultures of fibroblasts. Various concentrations of flavonoids were added to cell cultures and synthesis of GAGs was measured by estimation of the amount of incorporated precursor, [<sup>35</sup>S]sulfate. This method was chosen as in mammalian cells the incorporation of <sup>35</sup>S from radioactive Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> into macromolecules occurs almost exclusively into GAGs (Kato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1995</xref>). An inhibition of GAG synthesis was found in the presence of all tested compounds, though the most pronounced impairment of production of GAGs was observed in the presence of kaempferol, and statistically significant differences relative to untreated cells were observed only for kaempferol, daidzein and genistein (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Due to low solubility of apigenin and genistein in water, these compounds could not be tested at the concentration of 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;M.

Interestingly, such combinations resulted in more effective inhibition of GAG production relative not only to particular compounds used at the same concentration alone (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), but also to particular compounds used at the concentration as high as the sum of concentrations of all tested flavonoids (compare Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Therefore, additive effects of various flavonoids on impairment of GAG synthesis can be assumed.

        <title>Decreased lysosomal storage in the presence of flavonoids</title>
        <p>In the treatment of MPS patients, an actual level of lysosomal storage rather than kinetics of GAG synthesis is crucial. Therefore, we have tested effects of flavonoids on changes in lysosomal storage in MPS IIIA fibroblasts. To assess the storage, we used electron microscopic techniques, as described previously (Jakobkiewicz-Banecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>; Piotrowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>). Examples of abnormal (stored) structures, occurring in MPS IIIA cells, are presented in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.
<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#xA0;4</label><caption><p>Different lysosomal structures observed in fibroblasts of the MPS IIIA patient. Electron microphotographs present: lysosome of lamellar and electron-dense structures (<bold>a</bold>), lysosome of amorphous, flocculent and electron-lucent structures (<bold>b</bold>), and complex lysosomal structure (autophagolysosome) with storage material of different electron density (<bold>c</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11011_2011_9233_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
        <p>The fibroblasts were cultured in the absence and presence of various flavonoids, and the abnormal structures were observed under electron microscope and counted. We observed a significant decrease in the number of various abnormal structures in MPS IIIA cells after treatment of the cultures with apigenin, daidzein, kaempferol and naringenin (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that all tested compounds are effective in elimination of lysosomal storage from MPS cells, despite the fact that only some of these flavonoids (daidzein and kaempferol) caused statistically significant inhibition of GAG synthesis, while the levels of the inhibition by apigenin and naringenin did not reach statistical significance (compare Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

        <title>Effects of flavonoids on the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor</title>
        <p>Results of previous studies suggested that genistein impairs GAG synthesis due to its inhibitory effect on the kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Thus, it was proposed that in the presence of genistein the EGFR is underphosphorylated, which correlates with impaired expression of genes coding for enzymes required for GAG synthesis (Jakobkiewicz-Banecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test whether tested flavonoids impair GAG synthesis by the same mechanism as that proposed for genistein, we have measured efficiency of phosphorylation of EGFR in the presence and absence of investigated flavonoids. However, we found that contrary to genistein and a synthetic inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase&#x2014;PD168393 (used as an additional positive control), none of the tested flavonoids revealed statistically significant inhibiton of EGFR phosphorylation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Therefore, it appears that these compounds impair GAG synthesis by the meachanism different from that identified for genistein.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Substrate reduction therapy has recently been shown to be a promising strategy for treatment of neuronopathic forms of mucopolysaccharidoses and other lysosomal storage diseases (Jakobkiewicz-Banecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>). This therapeutical strategy is based on the use of relatively small molecules, including drugs that may cross the brain-blood-barrier and act in the central nervous system. Studies on MPS II and MPS III, the MPS types in which the neurological symptoms are severe or extremely severe, respectively, indicated that genistein, a natural isoflavone, can be effective in treatment of some symptoms, including behavior and cognitive abilities, in both mouse models and human patients (Friso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>; Malinowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>; Piotrowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>). Nevertheless, efficiency of this treatment was not high enough to cure all symptoms in patients, therefore, searching for possibilities to improve SRT for MPS is desirable.</p>
      <p>One possibility to achieve higher efficiency of inhibition of GAG synthesis could be the use of the siRNA technology to silence genes responsible for expression of enzymes involved in GAG production, as proposed recently (Dziedzic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2009</xref>; Kaidonis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>). However, the current procedures of delivery of siRNA to central nervous system are not efficient enough to ensure effective treatment.</p>
      <p>Another option would be to use different compounds that can inhibit GAG synthesis. Roberts et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>) demonstrated that rhodamine B is an effective inhibitor of GAG production in vitro and in vivo (in the MPS IIIA mouse model). However, the toxicity profile of rhodamine B appears to be not acceptable for its use as a drug for humans (Roberts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>; Roberts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>). Although recent studies suggest that a long-term treatment with low doses of rhodamine B is safe for mice (Roberts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>), it is not clear whether the safety profile is the same for humans and whether treatment with such low doses may be effective in alleviation of MPS symptoms. Therefore, we search for other compounds that might be effective in treatment of MPS.</p>
      <p>Flavonoids, as compounds relative to genistein that has been demonstrated previously to be an inhibitor of GAG synthesis (Piotrowska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>), are natural candidates for drugs able to manage neurological symptoms of MPS. Therefore, we have tested effects of four different flavonoids in assays for GAG synthesis, lysosomal structures and phosphorylation of EGFR. In addition, their cytotoxicity and proliferation inhibition activity were tested.</p>
      <p>Our studies revealed that apigenin (a flavone), daidzein (an isoflavone), kaempferol (a flavonol) and naringenin (a flavanone) caused a decrease in the efficiency of GAG synthesis, though only daidzein and kaempferol caused statistically significant differences relative to untreated cells. Nevertheless, in the presence of all these compounds, lysosomal storage in MPS IIIA fibroblasts was significantly decreased. Since all the tested flavonoids, when used at moderate (up to 30 or 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;M, depending on the solubility of the compound) concentrations, revealed acceptable profiles in cytotoxicity and proliferation inhibition assays, either in MPS-derived cells (this report) or normal cells (Matsuo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2005</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>; Kwack et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>), it appears that they can be considered as potential drugs. Obviously, further tests, including those with animal models, are necessary to prove their safety for organisms.</p>
      <p>Interesting results were obtained when combinations of various flavonoids at their low concentration (10&#xA0;&#x3BC;M) were tested. Many such combinations appeared to be more effective in GAG synthesis inhibition than particular compounds tested separately, even when total flavonoid concentrations were the same. A report by Arfi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>) has been published recently, in which various isoflavones (daidzein, glycitein, formononetin, prunetin and biochanin) were tested for their activities in correction of GAG lysosomal accumulation in MPS IIIA and MPS VII fibroblasts. Although different methods of estimation of efficiency of these compounds in regulation of GAG metabolism were used by us (this report) and by Arfi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>), similar conclusions can be drawn from both studies. Namely, some flavonoids (e.g. kaempferol and various isoflavones) are as efficient as genistein in decreasing GAG storage in MPS cells, and combination of different compounds from this group may be more efficient than one single flavonoid. The latter conclusion appears to be reasonable in the light of our results indicating that flavonoids tested in this work (daidzein, kaempferol and naringenin) inhibit GAG synthesis by a mechanism different from that demonstrated for genistein. Namely, contrary to genistein, other flavonoids were not effective in inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation. Although the exact mechanism(s) of their action as GAG synthesis inhibitors remain(s) to be elucidated, differences in means by which various flavonoids impair GAG production may explain their synergistic effects when they were used in mixtures.</p>
      <p>Knowing the mechanism of genistein-mediated inhibition of GAG synthesis, which likely depends on inhibition of EGFR autophosphorylation (Jakobkiewicz-Banecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>), one might propose that other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be considered as putative drugs in MPS treatment. However, there are serious problems with a potential use of such inhibitors in therapies for children suffering from MPS. First, synthetic compounds influencing activities of tyrosine kinases are generally strong inhibitors (Sherman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>; Takeuchi and Ito <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2010</xref>), while GAGs are compounds necessary for development and proper functions of many tissues and organs (Bulow and Hobert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>; Li and Richards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>), thus, complete or very strong inhibition of their production would not be desired, especially in children. Second, SRT for inherited metabolic diseases, like MPS, must be considered as a long-term therapy, potentially for the whole life. Since there are various toxic and/or adverse effects of synthetic inhibitors of tyrosine kinases reported in literature, including effects on thyroid function and thyroid hormone metabolism (Sherman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>), diarrhea (Medina and Goodin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>; Sanford and Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>), nausea (Medina and Goodin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>), skin toxicity (Li and Perez-Soler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>), and cardiac toxicity (manifested as congestive heart failure) (de Azambuja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Medina and Goodin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>), their use in treatment of MPS patients for many years appears rather unlikely. Therefore, the use of natural flavonoids, which are relatively weak inhibitors of GAG synthesis with marginal, if any, adverse effects, could be one of the most promising options for SRT in MPS.</p>
