        <sec>
          <title>METHODS</title>
          <p>Ptn transcripts and protein were localized by in situ and immunohistochemistry and Ptn mRNA was quantitated by Northern blot and qRT-PCR. Ptn function was examined by addition of hPTN protein to rat ventral prostate organ cultures, primary human fetal prostate fibroblasts, prostate cancer associated fibroblasts, and BPH1 epithelia.</p>

          <title>RESULTS</title>
          <p>During development, <italic>Ptn</italic> transcripts and protein were expressed in ventral mesenchymal pad (VMP) and prostatic mesenchyme. Ptn was localized to mesenchyme surrounding ductal epithelial tips undergoing branching morphogenesis, and was located on the surface of epithelia. hPTN protein stimulated branching morphogenesis and stromal and epithelial proliferation, when added to rat VP cultures, and also stimulated growth of fetal human prostate fibroblasts, prostate cancer associated fibroblasts, and BPH1 epithelia. <italic>PTN</italic> mRNA was enriched in patient-matched normal prostate fibroblasts versus prostate cancer associated fibroblasts. <italic>PTN</italic> also showed male enriched expression in fetal human male urethra versus female, and between wt male and ARKO male mice. Transcripts for <italic>PTN</italic> were upregulated by testosterone in fetal human prostate fibroblasts and organ cultures of female rat VMP. Ptn protein was increased by testosterone in organ cultures of female rat VMP and in rat male urethra compared to female.</p>

          <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
          <p>Our data suggest that in the prostate Ptn functions as a regulator of both mesenchymal and epithelial proliferation, and that androgens regulate Ptn levels. <italic>Prostate 71:305&#x2013;317, 2011</italic>. &#xA9; 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Stromal&#x2013;epithelial interactions are involved in the regulation of prostate organogenesis and tumorigenesis. During prostate development, androgen action in mesenchyme regulates proliferation and differentiation of the prostatic epithelium, and in turn the epithelium regulates differentiation of the mesenchyme. Importantly, paracrine signaling from the mesenchyme to the epithelium acts to (1) specify prostatic epithelium identity, (2) induce bud formation, (3) elicit prostatic bud growth and ductal branching, (4) promote differentiation of secretory epithelia, and (5) specify the types of secretory proteins that are expressed, reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. This suggests that mesenchyme is the source of potent paracrine factors, yet few studies have endeavored to directly identify them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The stroma is also involved in neoplastic prostate growth (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) exhibit a variety of functional differences relative to normal stroma (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Tumor stroma is no longer able to restrain prostatic epithelial proliferation, but instead CAFs stimulate tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
      <p>To determine which molecules and pathways are active within developmental mesenchyme, we performed serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) gene profiling of inductive mesenchyme of the ventral mesenchymal pad (VMP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This identified mesenchymal expression of pleiotrophin (Ptn) and suggested a localization to the VMP. Fgf10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, BMP 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, Scube1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, Notch2, Dlk1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and Wnt 5a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> have previously been shown to be expressed in prostate mesenchyme and most of these have a functional role in prostate organogenesis. Since androgens stimulate prostate organogenesis via the mesenchymal compartment, this has led to the hypothesis that there may be &#x201C;andromedins&#x201D; made by the mesenchyme that act upon epithelia and which are produced in response to androgens. However, there is no direct evidence that &#x201C;andromedins&#x201D; identified in developing prostate are essential for androgen action, and there is controversy regarding direct or indirect regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
      <p>Ptn is a secreted, highly conserved cytokine, and belongs to a novel two member family of heparin binding molecules, sharing structural and functional similarities with midkine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Ptn is an 18 kDa protein, also known as heparin affin regulatory peptide (HARP) and heparin-binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM). Ptn protein interacts with heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) at the extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Biological actions of Ptn are reported to be mediated by at least three different receptors; receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, RPTB/&#x3BE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, syndecan-3 (<italic>N</italic>-syndecan) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. <italic>Ptn</italic> is responsive to regulation by steroid hormones, and <italic>Ptn</italic> transcript levels are upregulated in the presence of dihydrotestosterone or estradiol, in vitro and in vivo, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>
      <p>Ptn plays a key role in cellular growth and differentiation and has been implicated as playing an important role during development. <italic>Ptn</italic> expression is present in tissues during late embryogenesis and perinatal growth, and expression usually decreases around the time of birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Ptn is most frequently reported in tissues derived from mesoderm and in organs where mesenchymal&#x2013;epithelial interactions play an important role, such as the salivary gland, lung, pancreas, kidney, and mammary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In branching organs Ptn may also be important for branching morphogensis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Ptn has not previously been studied in the developing prostate, although it is reported to play a role in prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. <italic>Ptn</italic>-deficient mice have no gross anatomical abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and it has been proposed that <italic>Ptn</italic> and midkine, which are often co-expressed, might compensate for each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Mice lacking both Ptn and midkine show female infertility and reproductive abnormalities though no effects upon male fertility or reproductive anatomy were reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>
      <p>Ptn has diverse activity in vitro, stimulating the proliferation of a wide range of cells including epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, and also stimulates progenitor cells in primary culture to enter lineage-specific differentiation pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Ptn expression is associated with inflammatory diseases and tumor growth progression, and Ptn may recruit stromal tissue and vasculature to tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. <italic>Ptn</italic> expression has been observed in prostate, ovarian, testicular, pancreatic and breast cancer, solid gliomas, neuroblastomas, melanomas, and in several malignant cell lines of different origin, reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have examined the expression, distribution and function of Ptn in the developing prostate, as it was previously suggested to show mesenchymal expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, and we hypothesized that it may function as a paracrine regulator of prostate development. <italic>Ptn</italic> expression was restricted to VMP and mesenchyme of the VP as well as the smooth muscle of the urethra. Ptn protein was located in the mesenchyme and at the surface of epithelial cells, and displayed a gradient showing the highest levels at the tips of epithelial ducts. Recombinant hPTN increased proliferation and branching morphogenesis in cultures of VP organs grown in vitro, and stimulated the growth of fibroblasts derived from developing prostate and prostate cancer and prostate epithelial cells. Expression of <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA and protein was increased by androgens in developmental mesenchyme, and showed sexually dimorphic expression.</p>

      <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Isolation and Culture of Primary Human Cells</title>
        <p>Human fetal prostate tissue was obtained following medical termination of pregnancy. Consent was obtained in accordance with UK guidelines and the study was approved by the Lothian Research Ethics Committee. The bladder and urethra were excised, and the prostate microdissected prior to either RNA isolation or primary culture of embryonic prostate fibroblasts (hEPFs). Human adult prostate tissue was obtained from patients undergoing surgery at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh. Primary CAFs were derived from tissue obtained from patients at the time of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Patient consent was obtained prior to surgery and the study was approved by ethical review (MREC 02/5/63). To culture primary stromal cells from embryonic or cancer samples, tissue specimens were cut into small pieces (1 mm &#xD7; 1 mm &#xD7; 1 mm), and plated on a flask coated with fetal calf serum (FCS). Primary cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1&#xD7; penicillin/streptomycin and CAFs were tested for tumorigenic activity in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Tissue Isolation From Rodents</title>
        <p>Prostate and VMP tissues were microdissected from the urogenital tract of Wistar rats and ARKO mice. The day of copulatory plug observation was taken as e0.5, and day of birth was designated P0. Animal procedures were conducted in accordance with UK law regulated by the Home Office. The P0 female bladder and urethra were removed and dissected to isolate the urethra adjacent to the bladder termed the VSU, which comprised the <italic>V</italic>MP, <italic>s</italic>mooth muscle, and <italic>u</italic>rethral epithelia. Additionally, P0 VMP and ventral prostate (VP, from males) were microdissected.</p>
        <p>ARKO mice were produced by mating female mice heterozygous for the X-linked hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-Cre transgene with male ARflox mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. This resulted in females carrying one deleted allele and one wild-type (WT) allele of the X-linked AR gene, which were subsequently mated to produce ARKO males and control littermates. ARKO males were identified by examination upon dissection and lacked prostate and Wolffian derived organs.</p>

        <title>RNA Extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR</title>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy&#x2122; Mini kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) and RNA quality was measured on the Agilent 2100 Bioanlayser (Agilent Biotechnologies, Santa Clara, CA). Quantitative PCR's were performed on ABI 7500 machine, using the PowerSybr PCR mastermix (ABI, Warrington, UK). Transcript abundances were normalized to <italic>tbp</italic>/<italic>TBP</italic> expression. The PCR primer sequences are provided below:</p>

        <p><italic>Ptn</italic> was identified in the rat female VMP by LongSAGE transcriptional profiling with a ratio of 74:63 tags between the VMP/VSU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The VSU consists of <italic>V</italic>MP, <italic>s</italic>mooth muscle and <italic>u</italic>rethra and transcripts enriched or specific to the VMP are diluted in the VSU relative to pure VMP. Using Northern blot and qRT-PCR, <italic>Ptn</italic> transcript levels were &#x223C;2.6-fold (Northern) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and 1.5-fold (qRT-PCR, data not shown) higher in the VMP than VSU. The temporal expression of <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA in the prostate was studied by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). <italic>Ptn</italic> was most abundant during the neonatal (P0) and perinatal period (P4, P10) and expression subsequently decreased until adulthood. There was also evidence of higher Ptn levels in males versus females at e17.5 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). To examine the spatial distribution of <italic>Ptn</italic> in the male and female UGT, whole-mount in situ hybridization was used to localize <italic>Ptn</italic> transcripts. <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA was observed in the female in VMP and urethral stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>), and in the male in the prostatic mesenchyme (all lobes) and the urethral stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>). Additionally, to determine whether <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA distribution was affected by testosterone, <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA was localized in male VPs grown in culture &#xB1;T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1E,F</xref>). Organ growth was stimulated by testosterone, and <italic>Ptn</italic> was present in mesenchymal cells throughout the VP, and the distribution of <italic>Ptn</italic> was similar between organs grown with or without testosterone. There was no evidence of epithelial <italic>Ptn</italic> expression (insets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1E,F</xref>) though our studies do not rule out low level epithelial expression or expression within epithelial subsets.</p>

        <title>Ptn Protein Localization in the Male and Female Urethra and Prostate</title>
        <p>Ptn protein was localized in the male and female urethra and prostate by immunohistochemistry, and showed a similar pattern to the in situ hybridization data. Ptn was observed in the VMP, periurethral mesenchyme and smooth muscle layer of the female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>, arrows), and the mesenchyme, periurethral mesenchyme, and smooth muscle of the prostate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). The strongest mesenchymal Ptn staining in the VP was at the periphery. Ptn was also localized to the ductal epithelia of the VP, where a gradient of Ptn expression was observed; Ptn was present at the tips of the ducts and was absent proximal to the urethra. Additionally, Ptn expression was examined in VP organs cultured &#xB1;T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>,D) and Ptn distribution was similar to the VP in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>); androgens did not alter Ptn distribution. To examine the precise localization of Ptn in VP epithelia, we co-localized Ptn with &#x3B2;-catenin, a cell surface marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2E,F</xref>). Ptn was expressed in the mesenchyme of the VP, and Ptn and &#x3B2;-catenin were co-expressed at the cell surface of ductal epithelial cells. The gradient of Ptn expression was confirmed with strong Ptn staining at the ductal tips and less staining proximal to the urethra. Additionally, co-localization of Ptn with p63 showed that Ptn was associated with both p63 positive and p63 negative cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Ptn distribution was partially inverse to the pattern associated with smooth muscle differentiation around epithelial ducts. We propose that, since <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA was not observed in epithelia, Ptn at the epithelial surface was derived from the mesenchyme.</p>

        <title>Ptn Is Involved in Prostatic Growth and Branching</title>
        <p>The role of Ptn in prostate growth and morphogenesis was investigated using cultures of VP organs grown in vitro and treated with testosterone and recombinant hPTN protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). Addition of testosterone led to an increase in organ size and branching; however, addition of hPTN had relatively modest effects either in the presence or absence of testosterone (n = 5 experiments, 45 organs). The two dimensional area of VP organs grown &#xB1;T, &#xB1;3 &#xB5;g/ml hPTN was measured using NIH imaging software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>, and Supplementary Table A). Addition of hPTN to VP organs had no statistically significant effect upon organ area, in the presence (<italic>P</italic> = 0.11) or absence (<italic>P</italic> = 0.4) of testosterone. hPTN (Peprotech) was added to organ cultures at physiological levels (&#x223C;0.94 &#xB5;g/ml tissue volume) as used previously, to determine a functional response in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. To investigate a role for hPTN in branching morphogenesis, the number of epithelial bud tips around the periphery of VPs cultured &#xB1;T and &#xB1;hPTN were counted. The number of tips was expressed as a ratio to organ perimeter (tips per 1,000 pixels perimeter) to control for changes in organ size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>, and values are listed in Supplementary Table B). Treatment of VPs with hPTN caused an increase in the number of tips/1,000 pixels perimeter in the presence (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) or absence (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) of testosterone, and we suggest that Ptn has a role in increasing branching morphogenesis in the prostate.</p>

        <p>The effect of hPTN upon embryonic human prostate fibroblasts and adult CAFs was measured by proliferation assay (MTT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref> and Supplementary Table E). Addition of hPTN (1 &#xB5;g/ml) in the absence of testosterone and hPTN (200 ng/ml&#x2013;1 &#xB5;g/ml) in the presence of testosterone, led to a statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, one-way ANOVA) increase in the number of embryonic human prostate fibroblasts. We next examined the effect of Ptn upon the proliferation of adult prostate CAFs. Average values for cancer associated fibroblasts, derived from eight patients are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5B</xref> (and Supplementary Table F). Addition of recombinant hPTN protein (200 ng/ml&#x2013;1 &#xB5;g/ml) in the absence of testosterone or 1 &#xB5;g/ml hPTN in the presence of testosterone led to a statistically significant increase in CAF cell number (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (one-way ANOVA).

BPH1 cells were used as a model of non-tumorigenic human prostate epithelia which do not express a functional androgen receptor, and thus testosterone was not added to the treatment groups.

        <title>Differential Expression of <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA Between Normal and Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts, and Males and Females</title>
        <p>To examine if <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA was differentially expressed between CAFs and NPFs, we compared <italic>Ptn</italic> transcript levels in eight pairs of functionally tested patient-matched NPF and CAF samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. qRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>) determined that there was between 1.6- and 2.5-fold (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05&#x2013;0.001) less <italic>Ptn</italic> expression in CAFs compared to NPFs in 5 of 8 samples. In samples 3 and 6, <italic>Ptn</italic> increased in CAFs versus NPFs and this indicates the heterogeneity inherent in patient CAF samples. CXCL12 was found to be increased in six of eight of the CAF samples, similar to findings in breast cancer stroma (data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Next, we investigated whether <italic>Ptn</italic> exhibited sexually dimorphic expression in the developing human urethra and prostate. <italic>Ptn</italic> transcript expression was compared between the male and female human urethra (15&#x2013;18 weeks) by qRT-PCR and Northern blot. qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>PTN</italic> mRNA expression demonstrated <italic>PTN</italic> transcript levels were 1.5-fold higher in the male compared to female (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>). Northern blot analysis determined <italic>PTN</italic> transcript expression was &#x223C;2-fold higher in the male compared to female (data not shown). <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>), and protein (1.3-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6H</xref>) expression was also higher in e17.5 male versus female rat UGT, where there is little difference in tissue morphology. We have shown sexually dimorphic expression of <italic>Ptn</italic> in the developing UGT and as Ptn is expressed in the mesenchyme only of the rat and human prostate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, it is not due to the presence of prostatic ducts in the male and their absence in female.</p>

        <title>Ptn Expression Is Increased by Androgens and Androgen Receptor</title>
        <p>To determine whether androgens were involved in the regulation of <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA expression we examined its expression in feminized ARKO male mice that lack AR and which cannot respond to androgens. <italic>Ptn</italic> transcripts were measured by qRT-PCR in the UGT of ARKO males, wt males, and wt females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref>). As controls, we included Nkx3.1 a gene expressed in epithelia and known to be androgen regulated, as well as Fgf10, a mesenchymally expressed gene unlikely to be regulated by androgens. Nkx3.1 mRNA levels, were substantially higher in wt males compared to ARKO males and females (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOVA) consistent with its epithelial expression, while Fgf10 mRNA levels were similar in all three groups. <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA was 1.6-fold lower in ARKO males and wt females (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOVA), compared to wt males, suggesting that androgens and AR increase <italic>Ptn</italic> transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref>). Next, we examined whether <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA levels were affected by testosterone using female VMP organ rudiments grown in vitro (&#xB1;T). Female VMP was cultured for 24 hr followed by 6 or 24 hr of treatment with testosterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6D</xref>). VMPs (n = 4, 40 organs) and not VPs were used for this experiment to minimize the potential carry over of residual testosterone in male VPs. No changes in gross tissue morphology of the stroma or epithelia were observed during treatment of VMPs for 6&#x2013;24 hr in vitro. The results, expressed as fold difference in <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA expression relative to &#x2212;T were as follows: &#x2212;T = 1 versus +T 6 hr = 1.07 &#xB1; 0.03 (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.3), &#x2212;T versus +T 24 hr = 2.22 &#xB1; 0.29 (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). <italic>Ptn</italic> transcript levels were upregulated by testosterone in cultures of rat female VMP. We next examined the effects of testosterone upon <italic>PTN</italic> mRNA levels in primary human embryonic prostate fibroblast cells (n = 3), treated &#xB1;T for 6 and 24 hr. The fold difference in <italic>PTN</italic> mRNA levels were: &#x2212;T = 1 versus +T 6 hr = 1.52 &#xB1; 0.09 (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0082) and &#x2212;T versus +T 24 hr = 1.20 &#xB1; 0.08 (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.046) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6E</xref>). To determine if <italic>PTN</italic> mRNA expression in CAFs was androgen-regulated, <italic>PTN</italic> mRNA was measured in CAFs grown in the presence or absence of testosterone for 6 or 24 hr (n = 3) by qRT-PCR and Northern blotting (Supplementary Fig. 3). <italic>PTN</italic> transcript levels in CAFs showed very small changes in response to testosterone at any of the time points. We determined AR mRNA and protein expression in CAFs by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (data not shown), prior to performing the experiments. We note that throughout our studies Ptn transcript levels were detectable in females or the absence of testosterone, and that androgens and AR increased these levels. This suggests that there is a component of Ptn expression which is androgen independent.</p>
        <p>To determine whether Ptn protein expression was regulated by androgens, we examined sexually dimorphic expression of Ptn and its response to androgens in vitro. We examined Ptn protein expression in developing male and female rat prostate/urethra (e17.5, e19.5, and P0) using Western blot analysis, and observed sexually dimorphic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6F</xref>). Also, we measured Ptn in VSU organs grown &#xB1;T for 24 or 48 hr using Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6G</xref>) (n = 3, 38 organs). Quantification of Ptn protein in VSU organs grown in the presence of testosterone was expressed as fold difference relative the absence of testosterone at each time point. The data were as follows: &#x2212;T versus +T 24 hr = 1.6 &#xB1; 0.1 (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), &#x2212;T versus +T 48 hr 2.1 &#xB1; 0.1 (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6H</xref>). The data demonstrated that Ptn protein was upregulated by testosterone in cultures of rat female VMP. Quantification of Ptn protein in the prostate was expressed as fold difference relative to the female urethra at each time point. The results were as follows: e17.5 female versus e17.5 male = 1.3 &#xB1; 0.1 (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.057), e19.5 female versus e19.5 male = 2.2 &#xB1; 0.3 (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.014), P0 female versus P0 male = 2.5 &#xB1; 0.2 (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.007) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6H</xref>). Ptn protein levels showed a sexually dimorphic expression, with higher Ptn expression in the male versus female.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>We propose that Ptn signaling is involved in regulation of growth and branching morphogenesis in the developing prostate, and that <italic>Ptn</italic> expression is increased by androgens. We identified <italic>Ptn</italic> in a gene profiling study of VMP mesenchyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> which is a specialized area of mesenchyme that contains prostate inductive activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Given the importance of VMP mesenchyme in regulating prostate organogenesis, the identification of molecules that can mediate its effects is important and we propose that Ptn is one of many paracrine regulators made in VMP mesenchyme that regulate prostate growth. <italic>Ptn</italic> expression is associated with the development of organs that are regulated by epithelial&#x2013;mesenchymal interactions and has also been described as a proto-oncogene. <italic>Ptn</italic> expression in the mesenchyme plays a role in the developing kidney, lung, and mammary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, and has been localized to the stroma of adult prostate, and prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The role of Ptn in organogenesis has been difficult to examine given co-expression and redundancy of midkine; however, mice doubly null for Ptn and midkine show female infertility and reproductive abnormalities but no effects in males have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Were Ptn an essential mediator of androgen action, loss of Ptn might be expected to show impairment of masculinization similar to that seen in Tfm or ARKO mice, and such molecules remain to be identified.</p>
      <p>We suggest that Ptn is a factor that regulates the proliferation of human and rodent prostatic stromal and epithelial cells in developmental and disease models. Given that transcripts for <italic>Ptn</italic> are stromal, it suggests that Ptn functions as an autocrine regulator of stroma and a paracrine regulator of epithelia. The paracrine function of Ptn is supported by the localization of Ptn on the surface of epithelial cells in growing ductal tips, where Ptn protein was abundant, in contrast to its absence from ducts proximal to the urethra. It will be important to establish the expression patterns of the three receptors that bind Ptn and transduce its signal, as this will define Ptn responsive cells within the stromal and epithelial compartments, and these may include key subsets of cells such as progenitors. Co-localization of Ptn with &#x3B2;-catenin on the surface of epithelial cells is notable since &#x3B2;-catenin is a substrate of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase RPTB/&#x3BE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, a well-studied Ptn receptor. Ptn is known to interact with the extracellular matrix of undifferentiated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and Ptn distribution patterns similar to our observations have been reported in the mouse genital tubercle, where Ptn is expressed in the mesenchyme and on the surface of epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Ptn is also expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme and on the basement membrane of the uteric bud at the onset of kidney development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. A gradient of Ptn is present in the uteric bud, similar to our findings in VP epithelia. Sakurai et al suggested Ptn may be acting as &#x201C;a classic morphogen&#x201D; of the mesenchyme that induced phenotypic changes in epithelia according to its concentration. We observed that Ptn had a small effect on branching morphogenesis at the periphery of the developing prostate in vitro, and established that it did not lead to mis-differentiation of stroma or epithelia when examined by immunohistochemistry for p63 or SMA (Supplementary Fig. 2). Furthermore, addition of hPTN to VPs in culture led to a significant increase in the number of bud tips and an increase in the stromal and epithelial cell proliferative rate at the periphery of the organs in the absence of testosterone. We propose that Ptn functions as a classic morphogen in the developing prostate, since it is made by inductive mesenchyme of the VMP and shows similar activities in other organs such as kidney and genital tubercle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p>
      <p>Ptn has been shown to be mitogenic for a variety of fibroblast, epithelial and endothelial cell lines, including normal human prostate (PNT1A) and prostate cancer epithelial lines (DU145, PC3, and LNCaP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. We examined the effect of hPTN on primary human prostate embryonic fibroblasts, cancer associated fibroblasts and BPH1 cells in vitro, and found that addition of hPTN led to a significant increase in cell proliferation. <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA and protein are expressed in the stromal cells of normal adult prostate, prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and Ptn protein is also expressed in prostate tumor epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Surprisingly, when we examined <italic>PTN</italic> mRNA expression levels in matched pairs of CAFs/NPFs, five out of eight samples showed lower levels of <italic>PTN</italic> transcripts in CAFs compared to NPFs, and a recent study has confirmed a reduction of <italic>PTN</italic> in reactive prostate cancer stroma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Breast cancer studies have reported conflicting data on <italic>PTN</italic> mRNA regulation in normal and cancer cells, reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Different approaches to attenuate Ptn function in tumor cells were found to decrease tumor growth in vivo, thus constitutive Ptn signaling was a rate-limiting factor in the pathogenesis of these tumors.</p>
      <p>In the developing prostate and normal adult prostate the effects of androgens upon epithelial cells are mediated via AR that is expressed in the mesenchyme or stroma, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. However, there is little knowledge of the genes and pathways that mediate the effects of androgens on normal prostate growth or exactly how the paracrine effects of androgens are mediated. <italic>PTN</italic> mRNA exhibited a sexually dimorphic pattern of expression in the human fetal prostate/urethra; <italic>PTN</italic> transcript levels were higher in the male, with elevated androgen levels, compared to the female. Similarly there were lower levels of <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA in the urethra of female mice and ARKO males (that lack AR) when compared with wt male mice. Ptn protein also showed a sexually dimorphic difference between male and female rat urethra/prostate. Both Ptn mRNA and protein were upregulated by testosterone in organ cultures of the female VMP. We have shown that androgens increase Ptn levels in several different systems; however, Ptn expression is evident in females or the absence of androgens, which indicates there is an androgen independent element of Ptn expression. Gene profiling studies have confirmed the correlation between androgen levels and <italic>Ptn</italic> transcript levels in the prostate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Such correlative data do not provide direct evidence for Ptn function as an &#x201C;andromedin,&#x201D; which would require direct experimental proof. Since prostate cancer is sensitive to androgens, we examined whether <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA was affected by exposure to testosterone in three CAF isolates. Surprisingly, we found that T did not significantly alter <italic>Ptn</italic> mRNA levels in CAFs (Supplementary Fig. 3). There are several possible explanations for this, however, we suggest that it may reflect dysregulation of androgen signaling in CAFs and contributes to their pro-tumorigenic signaling.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Our data suggest that in the prostate Ptn functions as a regulator of both mesenchymal and epithelial proliferation, and that androgens regulate Ptn levels.</p>
