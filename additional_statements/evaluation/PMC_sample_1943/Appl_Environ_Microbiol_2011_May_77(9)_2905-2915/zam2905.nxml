        <p>1-Butanol, an important chemical feedstock and advanced biofuel, is produced by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> species. Various efforts have been made to transfer the clostridial 1-butanol pathway into other microorganisms. However, in contrast to similar compounds, only limited titers of 1-butanol were attained. In this work, we constructed a modified clostridial 1-butanol pathway in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> to provide an irreversible reaction catalyzed by <italic>trans</italic>-enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase (Ter) and created NADH and acetyl-CoA driving forces to direct the flux. We achieved high-titer (30 g/liter) and high-yield (70 to 88% of the theoretical) production of 1-butanol anaerobically, comparable to or exceeding the levels demonstrated by native producers. Without the NADH and acetyl-CoA driving forces, the Ter reaction alone only achieved about 1/10 the level of production. The engineered host platform also enables the selection of essential enzymes with better catalytic efficiency or expression by anaerobic growth rescue. These results demonstrate the importance of driving forces in the efficient production of nonnative products.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>1-Butanol, a potential fuel substitute and an important C<sub>4</sub> chemical feedstock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), is naturally synthesized by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> species using a pathway that involves multiple coenzyme A (CoA)-activated intermediates (hereinafter called the CoA-dependent pathway). Various attempts have been made to transfer the CoA-dependent 1-butanol pathway to more tractable organisms, such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> (0.55 to 1.2 g/liter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> (2.5 mg/liter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus brevis</named-content> (300 mg/liter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas putida</named-content> (580 mg/liter), and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content> (120 mg/liter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). These low titers of heterologous 1-butanol production demonstrate the difficulty in transferring this pathway to nonnative hosts and are in sharp contrast to the high titers of related compounds, such as ethanol (50 g/liter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), isobutanol (20 to 50 g/liter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and isopropanol (40 to 140 g/liter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), produced by recombinant <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strains using related pathways. Examination of these high-titer production processes revealed that all of the pathways involve a decarboxylation reaction near the end products, in which the irreversible release of CO<sub>2</sub> serves as a driving force to pull fluxes to the desired compounds. Such a strategy is also present in fatty acid synthesis, which involves decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA in the chain elongation step. In contrast, when the clostridial CoA-dependent 1-butanol pathway is transferred to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>, no significant driving force exists to direct the carbon flux through the five reversible steps starting from acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

Shown on the right is the 1-butanol production pathway engineered in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> from <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. acetobutylicum</named-content> (boxed). Acetyl-CoA initiates the NADH-consuming reactions. A total of four NADH molecules is needed to make one 1-butanol molecule. Enzymes that utilize NADH directly as the electron donor (Ter) are coupled more tightly to the NADH driving force than the enzymes that require additional electron transfer mediators (Bcd). Elimination of Pta, involved in acetate production, not only increased the pools of available acetyl-CoA but also reduced ATP synthesis, both of which can be used as driving forces to increase 1-butanol production.

      <p>We reason that a significant driving force is necessary to achieve high-titer production, whereas driving forces are not as important in proof-of-concept production approaches. For 1-butanol, we define high titers as those greater than the toxicity level, which is about 10 g/liter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). When examined in this light, driving forces can be found in almost all successful metabolic engineering strategies and may exist in several different forms, including (i) release of a gaseous molecule (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>) which escapes out of the cell through diffusion and becomes diluted in the gas phase, (ii) irreversible reactions or polymerization (e.g., glycogen and polyhydroxyalkanoate), (iii) ATP draining by futile cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) or disruption of ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), (iv) transfer of electrons to an external sink (e.g., respiration and hydrogen production), or (v) product removal by phase separation. Therefore, metabolic engineering or synthetic biology strategies for high-titer production can be summarized and recast in two steps: (i) the creation of a driving force and (ii) coupling of the driving force to the desired pathway.</p>
      <p>Since the clostridial CoA-dependent pathway for 1-butanol synthesis is reversible on both thermodynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and enzymatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) grounds, the presence of an artificial driving force would be essential to achieve high-titer production. The clostridial 1-butanol synthesis pathway utilizes both NADH and reduced ferredoxin (Bcd-EtfAB complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) as sources of reducing power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). If it is possible to reconstruct the 1-butanol pathway to utilize only NADH as the reducing cofactor, then the accumulation of NADH can be used as a driving force for 1-butanol production. The NADH driving force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) could be established by deleting the mixed-acid fermentation reactions (ethanol, lactate, and succinate) in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>. The resulting strain, JCL166 (&#x394;<italic>adhE</italic> &#x394;<italic>ldhA</italic> &#x394;<italic>frd</italic>), lost its ability to grow anaerobically due to the lack of NADH-consuming pathways as an electron sink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Such a strain is unable to recycle NADH, thereby creating a driving force for reactions that consume NADH. Similar strategies have been successfully applied to the production of (<sc>d</sc>/<sc>l</sc>)-lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), succinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), and <sc>l</sc>-alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>.</p>
      <p>To couple the NADH driving force effectively to the target 1-butanol pathway, the crotonyl-CoA reduction step catalyzed by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium acetobutylicum</named-content> butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase complex (Bcd-EtfAB) must be modified to utilize NADH as the direct reducing equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Challenges in the detection of Bcd-EtfAB <named-content content-type="genus-species">in vitro</named-content> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and measurement of intracellular pathway intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) also suggest that this step is deficient in the production of 1-butanol in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>. Another class of enzymes available to catalyze the reduction of crotonyl-CoA is the <italic>trans</italic>-enoyl-CoA reductase (Ter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The <named-content content-type="genus-species">Treponema denticola</named-content> Ter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) has been shown to possess significant specific activity toward crotonyl-CoA reduction using NADH as a direct reducing equivalent without flavoproteins or ferredoxin. This NADH-dependent enzyme could potentially facilitate tighter coupling of 1-butanol production with the NADH driving force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In addition, our <named-content content-type="genus-species">in vitro</named-content> enzyme assays suggest that the Ter-catalyzed reduction is irreversible, which may serve as an irreversible driving force to channel the carbon flux toward 1-butanol. However, when the <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. denticola</named-content> Ter was utilized in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) for 1-butanol production, only 0.25 g/liter of 1-butanol was accumulated. This result suggests that additional factors need to be considered to drive high flux into the 1-butanol pathway.</p>
      <p>The condensation reaction of acetyl-CoA to make acetoacetyl-CoA in the CoA-dependent 1-butanol pathway may be another limiting step because of its unfavorably high Gibbs energy change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). To facilitate this reaction, in this work we chose <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>'s acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AtoB), involved in acetoacetate degradation, instead of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (Thl), because of its higher specific activity (AtoB, 1,078 U/mg, versus Thl, 216 U/mg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). These enzymes all exhibit reversible kinetics that strongly favor the acetoacetyl-CoA cleavage reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), therefore highlighting the need for a strong driving force to channel carbon flux into the recombinant 1-butanol pathway. In addition to the synthetic NADH driving force, the major acetyl-CoA-consuming enzyme phosphate acetyltransferase, encoded by <italic>pta</italic>, was also deleted to build an acetyl-CoA driving force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) coupled with the use of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> AtoB to provide a better link to the 1-butanol pathway.</p>
      <p>Using the NADH and acetyl-CoA driving forces coupled with the irreversible Ter reaction, we attained high-titer production of 1-butanol (15 g/liter or 30 g/liter with <named-content content-type="genus-species">in situ</named-content> product removal). In contrast, our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) used the Bcd-EtfAB complex instead of Ter. Without effective coupling to the driving forces, only 550 mg/liter of 1-butanol was achieved in semianaerobic conditions and about 40 mg/liter was attained under anaerobic conditions. Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) that used the <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. denticola</named-content> Ter without a significant acetyl-CoA driving force resulted in about 250 mg/liter of 1-butanol anaerobically. These results suggest the importance of driving forces in achieving high-titer production.</p>

        <p>Plasmid pEL11 was constructed by inserting the <italic>crt-hbd</italic> fragment into pJCL17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The <italic>crt-hbd</italic> fragment was created by individually amplifying <italic>crt</italic> with primers crtfxba and crtrSOE and <italic>hbd</italic> with hbdfSOE and hbdrxba using pJCL60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) as a template. The two pieces were then connected together by splicing by overlap extension (SOE) and further amplified with crtfxba and hbdrxba. The resulting <italic>crt-hbd</italic> fragment and pJCL17 were both digested with XbaI and ligated to give pEL11. To make pEL12, pJCL17 was digested with SphI and XbaI and ligated with the <italic>crt-hbd</italic> fragment cut with the same pair of restriction enzymes amplified by crtfsph and hbdrxba using pEL11 as a template.</p>
        <p>To clone individual <italic>ter</italic> genes from various organisms, the <italic>ter</italic> gene was amplified with PCR from the corresponding genomic DNA purchased from ATCC. For <named-content content-type="genus-species">Treponema denticola</named-content>, the resulting fragment of <italic>ter</italic> amplified with Tdeterfacc65 and Tdeterrsal was digested and ligated into pCS106 cut with Acc65I and SalI to yield pIM8.

The primers used for this PCR were Tviterfacc65 and Tviterrbam. The resulting DNA fragment was double digested with Acc65I and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pCS106 to give pEL16.

A needle (20 G by 1 1/2 in.; BD) was inserted through the rubber cap of the glass tube with the other end attached to a Millipore PES (polyethersulfone) filter (0.22 &#x3BC;m). Oxygen in the headspace and medium were then evacuated through the needle by repeated vacuuming and refilling of nitrogen and hydrogen in the anaerobic transfer chamber. The needles were removed from the caps inside the anaerobic chamber. The sealed tubes were then taken out and wrapped with parafilm and tape to prevent bursting of the caps (when cells grow, pressure builds up due to CO<sub>2</sub> release).

On the next day, the overnight culture was inoculated at 1% into 5 ml (test tube for anaerobic preculture) or 20 ml (250-ml screw cap flasks for microaerobic preculture) of fresh TB&#x2013;2% glucose medium (unless otherwise noted). The cultures were grown at 37&#xB0;C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4 to 0.6 and then induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for another 1 to 2 h aerobically.</p>
        <p>For microaerobic production, the 20-ml induced cultures were allowed to grow and produce at 37&#xB0;C in the 250-ml screw cap flasks for a few days, and samples were taken under aerobic conditions.</p>

        <title>Bioreactor production of 1-butanol.</title>
        <p>Strain JCL299 bearing plasmids pEL11, pIM8, and pCS138 was used in the fermentation for bioreactor production of 1-butanol. The overnight preculture was inoculated in LB containing the appropriate antibiotics and allowed to grow at 37&#xB0;C in a rotary shaker (250 rpm).</p>
        <p>1-Butanol fermentation was performed in a 1-liter stirred-tank bioreactor (Applikon Biotechnology, Schiedam, Netherlands), using a working volume of 0.35 liters. The bioreactor was inoculated with 4 ml of overnight preculture, and 0.1 mM IPTG was added at the time of inoculation to induce the expression of the enzymes involved in the 1-butanol production pathway. Dissolved oxygen (DO) during the aerobic stage was maintained above 20% with respect to air saturation by raising the stirrer speed (from 200 to 600 rpm). The cells were grown at 30&#xB0;C under aerobic conditions in batch mode until the optical density reached about 8. Then, 2 vvm (volume of gas per volume of liquid per minute) of nitrogen was bubbled through the bioreactor with two goals: (i) to switch to anaerobic conditions and (ii) to accomplish <named-content content-type="genus-species">in situ</named-content> gas stripping of 1-butanol. Upon the anaerobic switch, intermittent linear feeding of glucose solution (500 g/liter) was initiated to maintain a glucose concentration of between 10 and 20 g/liter. The evaporated 1-butanol was condensed using two Graham condensers connected in series. The exhaust gases from the fermentor were bubbled in a trap cooled with ice and then circulated through condenser 1 maintained at 4&#xB0;C. After that, gas continued circulating through a second equal loop. The pH was controlled at 6.8 at all times by the automatic addition of 2 M NaOH solution. Fermentation samples were collected to determine cell growth, 1-butanol production, organic acids, and glucose concentrations.</p>

        <p>Error-prone PCR was performed using a GenemorphII random mutagenesis kit (Strategene) with plasmids pEL16, pCS127, and pCS128 as templates to amplify the specific <italic>ter</italic> gene. The initial template concentration was maintained at around 300 to 500 ng for a cycle number of 30. The following primers were used: Tviterfacc65 and Tviterrsal for pEL16, Fjoterfacc65 and Fjoterrsal for pCS128, and Fsuterfacc65 and Fsuterrsal for pCS127. The resulting fragments were gel purified and digested with Acc65 and SalI, followed by DpnI to cut any remaining methylated DNA. The digested PCR products were then ligated into pCS106 cut with the same pair of enzymes. The ligation mixture was transformed into commercial E-Shot DH-10B T1<sup>R</sup> electrocompetent cells (Invitrogen). The transformed cells were rescued in 10 ml LB in 250-ml screw cap flasks for 1 h, and 10 &#x3BC;l of the cells were plated on LB plates with kanamycin to calculate the library size. At the same time, kanamycin (50 mg/liter) was added to the 10-ml rescued culture. A mutant library size of between 0.5 and 1 million was achieved.</p>
        <p>On the next day, the mutant libraries were miniprepped and cotransformed with pEL11 into JCL166. The resulting cells were plated on LB&#x2013;1% glucose with appropriate antibiotics and incubated at 37&#xB0;C anaerobically for the next few days. Single colonies were picked based on size, restreaked on fresh LB-glucose plates, and then incubated anaerobically to isolate single colonies again. Plasmids were retrieved from the potential positive cells, and XbaI was used to cut pEL11, leaving behind only the plasmid containing the mutant <italic>ter</italic>. The digested mixture was again transformed into XL-1 Blue to obtain the pure mutant plasmid, followed by DNA sequencing. The production and growth rescue tests were then repeated to confirm the validity of the <italic>ter</italic> mutants. The three most successful mutant plasmids were digested with Acc65 and SalI to retrieve the mutagenized <italic>ter</italic> coding region, followed by ligation into the empty medium-copy-number plasmid pCS106 cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids were sequenced and named pHJ2, pHJ3, and pHJ6.</p>

        <title>Implementation of the strategy: <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. denticola</named-content> Ter rescued anaerobic growth.</title>
        <p>To implement the NADH driving force scheme for 1-butanol production, JCL166 (&#x394;<italic>adhE</italic> &#x394;<italic>ldhA</italic> &#x394;<italic>frd</italic>) was used as the host. This strain cannot grow anaerobically without a heterologous NADH-consuming pathway being expressed. To rescue JCL166 for anaerobic growth, the modified CoA-dependent 1-butanol pathway was overexpressed. The four genes <italic>atoB</italic> (<named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>), <italic>adhE2</italic> (<named-content content-type="genus-species">C. acetobutylicum</named-content>), <italic>crt</italic> (<named-content content-type="genus-species">C. acetobutylicum</named-content>), and <italic>hbd</italic> (<named-content content-type="genus-species">C. acetobutylicum</named-content>) were expressed as an artificial operon under P<sub>L</sub>lacO1 promoter control on the high-copy-number plasmid pEL11, and the <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. denticola</named-content> Ter was cloned onto the medium-copy-number plasmid pIM8 by itself for ease in replacing different Ter-equivalent genes, including Bcd-EtfAB, in and out of the system. The expression of <italic>E. coli atoB</italic> and the native <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> gene set (<italic>hbd</italic>, <italic>crt</italic>, <italic>bcd-etfAB</italic>, and <italic>adhE2</italic>) in JCL166 failed to rescue its anaerobic growth, suggesting that the 1-butanol pathway did not couple effectively to the NADH driving force. The replacement of Bcd-EtfAB with <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. denticola</named-content> Ter successfully restored anaerobic cell growth of JCL166 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In addition, with aerobic growth followed by anaerobic fermentation, JCL166 transformed with plasmids pEL11 and pIM8 yielded 1.8 g/liter of 1-butanol in 24 h compared to only 0.1 g/liter generated by an equivalent construct harboring Bcd-EtfAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In contrast, the 1-butanol titer (550 mg/liter) achieved previously by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) using the Bcd-EtfAB complex required semianaerobic conditions with precultures grown in minimal medium.</p>

AdhE2 showed significantly lower activities than the other enzymes, which may be attributed to its oxygen sensitivity and/or insolubility. Interestingly, we found that Ter is irreversible, based on the <named-content content-type="genus-species">in vitro</named-content> enzyme assay results. Ter uses NADH directly as the electron donor, presumably through a hydride transfer mechanism, which typically is reversible (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase or alcohol dehydrogenase). However, we could not detect Ter activity in the reverse direction with surplus levels of butyryl-CoA and NAD<sup>+</sup>. The irreversibility of Ter may provide an additional driving force for the 1-butanol production.</p>

        <p>Like its <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> counterpart, <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. acetobutylicum</named-content> AdhE2 also contains an iron-coupled motif, which makes it potentially oxygen sensitive. Currently, <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. acetobutylicum</named-content> AdhE2 is the only bifunctional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase that has been clearly demonstrated to act on butyryl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).

Plasmid pEL12 was constructed by deleting <italic>adhE2</italic> on plasmid pEL11 while keeping the other genes. With only AtoB, Hbd, Crt, and Ter overexpressed on plasmids pEL12 and pIM8, 1-butanol production dropped below 0.05 g/liter in 24 h, and the strain failed to restore anaerobic growth of JCL166 (data not shown). Since no formation of butyrate was detected from various 1-butanol production strains, the indigenous butyrate synthetic enzymes may not be actively expressed. Thus, without AdhE2, the only carbon outlet for the 1-butanol pathway was interrupted, and the flux stopped due to backward inactivation of the pathway or metabolic toxicity from intracellular accumulation of acyl-CoA compounds. These results verified the activity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. acetobutylicum</named-content> AdhE2 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and its significant contribution to the production of 1-butanol in the recombinant strain.</p>

        <title>Higher 1-butanol titer achieved under anaerobic conditions and neutral pH.</title>
        <p>Upon the replacement of Bcd-EtfAB with Ter in the synthetic 1-butanol pathway, the effect of oxygen on 1-butanol productivity was determined by analyzing different 1-butanol production conditions, microaerobic and strictly anaerobic. Contrary to what was reported previously using the Bcd-EtfAB complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), where a small amount of oxygen was necessary to achieve higher 1-butanol productivity, the highest accumulation of 1-butanol was observed under fully anaerobic conditions in this case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This phenomenon may be an indication of tighter coupling of the 1-butanol pathway with the synthetic NADH driving force upon the replacement of Bcd-EtfAB with Ter and, thus, no need for respiration to recycle the excess NADH. This result also demonstrates the sufficiency of every essential enzyme under strictly anaerobic conditions for 1-butanol production. The presence of oxygen weakened the NADH driving force due to the activity of aerobic respiration. The divergence of carbon flux from 1-butanol into biomass was shown by the increase in cell density and decrease of the 1-butanol titer under the microaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The beneficial effect of oxygen as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) may be attributed to the inefficiency of Bcd-EtfAB for NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration.</p>
        <p>Because solventogenesis in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> species is triggered by the low pH resulting from the butyric and acetic acid secretion during the acidogenic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), we set out to investigate whether low pH (around 5.5) is also critical for heterologous enzyme activities and 1-butanol production in the recombinant <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strain. Although no butyrate was produced and no solventogenic regulation occurred in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strain, the effect of pH change due to acetate and pyruvate production may alter the biochemical property of the enzymes. Time courses of 1-butanol fermentation using strain JCL166 transformed with plasmids pEL11 and pIM8 were performed for 4 days, where the pH for one set of cultures was adjusted to 7 daily while the other set was left unadjusted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, neutral pH still appeared to be beneficial for <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> growth and the 1-butanol production rate. This suggests that low pH is not required for the <named-content content-type="genus-species">in vivo</named-content> activity of the nonnative 1-butanol enzymes.</p>

        <title>Increasing the NADH driving force by Fdh overexpression improved 1-butanol productivity.</title>
        <p>To further increase the intracellular NADH driving force, formate dehydrogenase (Fdh) from <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. boidinii</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) carried on plasmid pCS138 was overexpressed to oxidize formate into CO<sub>2</sub> and NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The production profiles of the strains (JCL166 transformed with plasmids pEL11 and pIM8) with and without <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. boidinii</named-content> Fdh overexpression are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>. The Fdh-overexpressing strain showed decreased formate secretion, while the strain without <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. boidinii</named-content> Fdh accumulated more pyruvate as a sink for the excess carbon flux due to the redox requirement of the 1-butanol pathway. This observation is consistent with the stoichiometric balance of the 1-butanol pathway, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. The introduction of Fdh slightly improved the production rate and yield of 1-butanol in the first few days of fermentation; however, the Fdh<sup>&#x2212;</sup> strain gradually reached the 6.5-g/liter cumulative titer, 60% of the theoretical yield (maximum theoretical yield, 0.41 g/g of glucose), and 0.07 g/liter/h productivity achieved by the Fdh<sup>+</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This result suggests that there may be other limiting factors in the 1-butanol pathway that are unrelated to the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. Nevertheless, the stepwise improvement of the 1-butanol titer from that of the wild type is reflected by the increasing intracellular NADH levels in the corresponding strains, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>.</p>

        <title>The modified 1-butanol pathway without the NADH driving force performed poorly.</title>
        <p>Interestingly, when the same heterologous pathway genes carried on plasmids pEL11 and pIM8 were expressed in a wild-type host (JCL16) without the artificial NADH driving force, the anaerobic 1-butanol production was dramatically reduced, to less than 0.5 g/liter in 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting that the NADH driving force is more important than the irreversible Ter step. On the other hand, when plasmid pCS138 harboring Fdh was introduced to increase the NADH driving force, in addition to plasmids pEL11 and pIM8, the 1-butanol productivity in JCL16 doubled. The significance of the NADH driving force in 1-butanol production is in sharp contrast to the case of isobutanol, where an intrinsic driving force with CO<sub>2</sub> evolution effectively drives the production. Thus, the same wild-type host (JCL16) was able to accumulate a considerable amount of isobutanol (40 g/liter in the wild type versus 50 g/liter in the engineered host) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) when the synthetic genes were introduced. These results suggest that the artificial NADH driving force did play an important and specific role in channeling the carbon flux into the synthetic CoA-dependent 1-butanol pathway.</p>

        <title>Increasing the acetyl-CoA driving force significantly elevated 1-butanol production.</title>
        <p>To build the acetyl-CoA driving force, the phosphate acetyltransferase (<italic>pta</italic>) involved in acetate synthesis was deleted in strain JCL166. The resulting strain JCL299 (&#x394;<italic>adhE</italic> &#x394;<italic>ldhA</italic> &#x394;<italic>frd</italic> &#x394;<italic>pta</italic>), transformed with plasmids pEL11, pIM8, and pCS138, increased 1-butanol production significantly and reached a titer of 15 g/liter and a yield of about 88% of the theoretical in 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), comparable to the levels achieved by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> species. Production of 1-butanol continued after cells entered the stationary phase. Medium analysis revealed that more than 85% of the 1-butanol synthesized resulted from glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Glycerol had no observable contribution, while yeast extract appeared to be an important nitrogen source that enhanced cell growth and helped lead to higher titers of 1-butanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The significant elevation in the glucose consumption rate and, hence, the 1-butanol productivity might have resulted from a decreasing ATP/ADP ratio upon the elimination of Pta, similar to the effects observed upon the disruption of ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and activation of a futile cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Thus, deletion of the <italic>pta</italic> gene might have played a dual beneficial role, building up the acetyl-CoA driving force and decreasing the ATP pool. Overall, we have achieved more than 10-fold increases in 1-butanol titers via the NADH and acetyl-CoA driving forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and b). While the NADH driving force was required to direct carbon flux into the reversible 1-butanol pathway, the acetyl-CoA driving force coupled with an increased glucose consumption rate was the major contributor to the high-flux production of 1-butanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Selection of Ter homologues and mutants.</title>
        <p>The NADH driving force created by a cell's inability to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup> anaerobically without an external electron acceptor can also be used as a selection platform to improve enzymes and pathways that consume NADH. On the basis of protein sequence homology with the <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. denticola</named-content> Ter, we identified three additional candidate Ter proteins from various organisms, including <named-content content-type="genus-species">Treponema vincentii</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Fibrobacter succinogenes</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavobacterium johnsoniae</named-content>, in order of decreasing homology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).

        <p>To demonstrate that the NADH surplus created in the host can be used as a selection pressure for optimizing the 1-butanol pathway, we subjected the three Ter homologues from <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. vincentii</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">F. succinogenes</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">F. johnsoniae</named-content> to error-prone PCR mutagenesis followed by cotransformation with plasmid pEL11 into strain JCL166. Anaerobic growth was then examined on LB-glucose plates incubated at 37&#xB0;C for the next 1 to 3 days. Potential positive mutants were isolated based on colony size, purified, sequenced, and confirmed to have 1-butanol production by retransformation with plasmid pEL11 into JCL166. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, a few first-round mutants of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">F. succinogenes</named-content> Ter successfully restored anaerobic growth of JCL166 and demonstrated an encouraging 1-butanol titer of 1.5 g/liter in 24 h with aerobic growth followed by anaerobic fermentation, comparable to the level achieved with <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. denticola</named-content> Ter. The three best mutants of <named-content content-type="genus-species">F. succinogenes</named-content> Ter carry the identical amino acid substitution Met11Lys, in addition to other silent mutations that may have contributed to the optimization of protein expression and stability in the heterologous system. The importance of the single Met11Lys substitution was confirmed by reintroducing this mutation, using site-directed mutagenesis, into the wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">F. succinogenes ter</named-content> gene, followed by anaerobic 1-butanol production using the resulting Ter variant. The success in the mutation and selection of Ter homologues established the basis for strain and/or enzyme evolution for NADH-consuming pathways using this platform, even under conditions of incomplete NADH balance.</p>

        <title>Continuous product removal as a driving force successfully doubled the 1-butanol titer.</title>
        <p>To further strengthen the driving force and to minimize the adverse effects of 1-butanol toxicity, fermentation was conducted using a 1-liter stirred-tank bioreactor with continuous gas stripping. Strain JCL299 harboring plasmids pEL11, pIM8, and pCS138 was grown aerobically at 30&#xB0;C to an optical density close to 8 prior to switching to completely anaerobic conditions by means of bubbling nitrogen. Both the <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. denticola</named-content> Ter and the <named-content content-type="genus-species">F. succinogenes</named-content> Ter Met11Lys mutant were tested in individual fermentation experiments to compare their performance. Continuous removal of 1-butanol from the production medium in the pH-controlled fed batch fermentor led to nearly 30 g/liter of 1-butanol in 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) with intermittent linear feeding of glucose. The two Ter enzymes performed practically the same. Yield was maintained at approximately 70% of the theoretical throughout the fermentation period, with productivity of around 0.18 g/liter/h. In conclusion, gas-stripping effectively minimized the toxic effect of 1-butanol on the production culture and successfully created a stronger entropic driving force to channel carbon flux toward the end product 1-butanol.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>This work demonstrates the importance of driving forces in high-titer 1-butanol synthesis in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>. With the NADH and acetyl-CoA driving forces coupled with Ter, the 1-butanol production in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> achieved a level comparable to the levels produced by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> species in flasks and batch fermentors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), with productivity of 0.2 g/liter/h, titers of 15 g/liter in flasks and 30 g/liter in the fermentor, and yields of approximately 88% of the theoretical in flasks and 70% of the theoretical in the fermentor. The artificial driving force created by NADH accumulation is similar to the transition from butyrate to 1-butanol production in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> that is induced upon the addition of more reductive substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). The deletion of <italic>pta</italic> showed a significant effect on 1-butanol production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting that the acetyl-CoA driving force is also important. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, the use of the irreversible Ter reaction without any driving force (strain JCL16) produced only one-third the amount of 1-butanol produced by the strain with the NADH driving force (JCL166), which accumulated about one-third the amount of 1-butanol produced by the strain with both NADH and acetyl-CoA driving forces (JCL299). These results indicate the effectiveness of the NADH and acetyl-CoA driving forces in high-titer production systems.</p>
      <p>The effectiveness of the NADH driving force as a selection pressure for optimizing the 1-butanol pathway was also demonstrated by our success in retrieving positive Ter mutants with improved catalytic activity or protein expression from the anaerobic-growth rescue platform. This general scheme of alleviating the anaerobic redox imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) caused by the inactivation of NADH-consuming reactions with target production pathways is applicable to systems where directed evolution is desired. Coupling of the desired reaction(s) as the primary NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration route to the growth phenotype allows the evolution of target enzymes for higher catalytic efficiency, alternative substrate utilization, change of cofactor specificity, and greater robustness.</p>
      <p>The stoichiometric redox balances of the 1-butanol pathway in different production strains are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. While 1-butanol synthesis (D) requires 4 mol of NADH for 1 mol of 1-butanol, glycolysis (A) can only provide 2 mol of NADH from 1 mol of glucose. Therefore, the maximum theoretical yield of 1-butanol relies on the host cell's ability to generate additional NADH from pyruvate. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate formate lyase (Pfl) converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and formate with no generation of NADH. As a result, 2 molecules of glucose are necessary to balance the NADH requirement of the synthetic 1-butanol pathway with pyruvate secretion (E), which was observed from the production strain without <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. boidinii</named-content> Fdh overexpression. On the other hand, overexpression of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. boidinii</named-content> Fdh allows 2 additional mol of NADH to be generated from formate (C) and fulfills the redox demand of the 1-butanol synthesis pathway (F). The introduction of Fdh effectively balances NADH for the 1-butanol pathway with 1 molecule of glucose and raises the molar theoretical yield to 100%.</p>
      <p>Whereas solventogenic acetone-butanol-ethanol (3:6:1) fermentation from the obligate anaerobe <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> has to occur after the acidogenic phase that is required for ATP synthesis and redox balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), the synthesis of 1-butanol in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> allows higher flexibility in the culture conditions, with lower levels of by-products. The tractability of nonnative hosts compared to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> species and the high 1-butanol titer demonstrated in this work present a promising alternative to the traditional acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation for 1-butanol production. The efficiency of the CoA-dependent clostridial 1-butanol pathway under high-flux conditions as illustrated in this work also suggests its industrial potential for the synthesis of related alcohols and chemicals in nonnative systems. Understanding the role of driving forces would facilitate metabolic engineering efforts to achieve high-titer production in various organisms.</p>
