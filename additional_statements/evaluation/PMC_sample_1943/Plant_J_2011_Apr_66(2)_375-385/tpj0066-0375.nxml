      <abstract>
        <p>Circadian clocks are biological timekeepers that allow living cells to time their activity in anticipation of predictable environmental changes. Detailed understanding of the circadian network of higher plants, such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, is hampered by the high number of partially redundant genes. However, the picoeukaryotic alga <italic>Ostreococcus tauri</italic>, which was recently shown to possess a small number of non-redundant clock genes, presents an attractive alternative target for detailed modelling of circadian clocks in the green lineage. Based on extensive time-series data from <italic>in vivo</italic> reporter gene assays, we developed a model of the <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> clock as a feedback loop between the genes <italic>TOC1</italic> and <italic>CCA1</italic>. The model reproduces the dynamics of the transcriptional and translational reporters over a range of photoperiods. Surprisingly, the model is also able to predict the transient behaviour of the clock when the light conditions are altered. Despite the apparent simplicity of the clock circuit, it displays considerable complexity in its response to changing light conditions. Systematic screening of the effects of altered day length revealed a complex relationship between phase and photoperiod, which is also captured by the model. The complex light response is shown to stem from circadian gating of light-dependent mechanisms. This study provides insights into the contributions of light inputs to the <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> clock. The model suggests that a high number of light-dependent reactions are important for flexible timing in a circadian clock with only one feedback loop.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The majority of life on earth is greatly affected by the daily rhythms of sunlight, a fact that is reflected by the near-ubiquity of circadian clocks in living organisms. The oscillations of these daily clocks enable organisms to match their activities to the rhythmic environment by entraining to light and other cues. Circadian clocks in eukaryotes consist of multiple interlocked transcriptional feedback loops between sets of clock genes, in addition to environmental inputs that include light- and temperature-sensing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dunlap <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Plants are particularly dependent on sunlight, and their clocks link processes such as metabolism and growth to the rhythmic daylight to maximize fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dodd <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Harmer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Graf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Maintaining appropriately timed circadian rhythms is complicated by several environmental variables. First, temperature variations greatly affect biochemical reaction rates, requiring temperature compensation that is realised by balancing partially redundant clock components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gould <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Akman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Second, intrinsic noise and fluctuations in light intensity and quality require the oscillations to be robust against such perturbations, which favours networks with interlocked feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Smolen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Finally, seasonal changes in day length require the clock components to oscillate with the appropriate amplitude and phase over a wide range of photoperiods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Roenneberg and Merrow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Eriksson and Millar, 2003</xref>). These factors suggest that even the simplest circadian clocks are intricate systems, with many components and interactions.</p>
      <p><italic>Ostreococcus tauri</italic>, described as the smallest free-living eukaryote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Courties <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>), is a marine unicellular alga with a minimal genome and a correspondingly simplified circadian clock. It possesses only a subset of the clock genes known in land plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Knowledge from Arabidopsis and the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Corellou <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> suggest the existence of a negative transcriptional feedback loop between <italic>TOC1</italic> and <italic>CCA1</italic> at the core of the <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> circadian clock. CCA1 protein, which is expressed in the night and early morning, is known to repress <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription by binding to the evening element motif in the <italic>TOC1</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Harmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Corellou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The TOC1 protein has a sharp expression peak in the evening, and appears to induce <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription thereafter.</p>
      <p>Importantly, the <italic>PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR</italic> (<italic>PRR</italic>) and <italic>LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL</italic> (<italic>LHY</italic>)/<italic>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1</italic> (<italic>CCA1</italic>) families each have a single homolog (<italic>TOC1</italic> and <italic>CCA1</italic>) in the <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Corellou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), compared with five and eight, respectively, in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Harmer, 2009</xref>). The <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> clock appears to have few components even in comparison with other chlorophyte algae, such as <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Schulze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). It has been suggested that results from over-expression of <italic>TOC1</italic> might not be fully explained by a single negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Corellou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, it is worthwhile pursuing the single-loop hypothesis in order to define which results it can fully account for, and where its specific limitations lie. We have constructed a mathematical model using with the known components as a formal test of the single-loop hypothesis.</p>
      <p>In addition to its reduced genomic complexity, <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> is easy to propagate and manipulate, and can readily be subjected to various and/or drug treatments in microplates within a single experiment. The expression of individual clock genes can be quantified <italic>in vivo</italic> through recently developed transcriptional and translational luciferase reporter lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Corellou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), allowing differentiation of the effects of an experimental treatment between transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. These factors make <italic>Ostreococcus tauri</italic> an ideal organism for a systems biology approach to understand the circadian clock in the green lineage.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have acquired a large set of experimental data in order to develop a mechanistic model of the <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). The model reproduces the behaviour of the biological system over a wide range of light/dark input cycles, including the transient behaviours that follow a change of inputs. Detailed examination of the model's response to changes in photoperiod shows how a clock with only two genes at its core may generate a complex phase response. Finally, we show that, even under complicated light regimes, the model generates experimentally testable and useful predictions, providing directions for future research into this minimal biological clock.</p>

Processes are drawn in blue for synthesis, red for degradation, and black for conversion or transport, and may be regulated by one or more components. Hollow arrows, bars and arrows with bars indicate positive and negative regulation and absolute requirement, respectively. TOC1 protein exists in two activation states, with light-regulated conversion from inactive (act@0) to active (act@1). Degradation of TOC1 protein is light-induced and only the active form is degraded. CCA1 protein exists in both the cytosol (nuc@0) and the nucleus (nuc@1), and is subject to light-induced degradation at the same rate in both compartments. &#x2018;acc&#x2019; (yellow) is the &#x2018;light accumulator&#x2019;, which, by regulating <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription, links the overall gene expression levels to the amount of light received by the organism.</p>

      <p>The timing and shape of TOC1 and CCA1 expression and the differences between transcriptional and translational reporters yield valuable information on the dynamics of the underlying biochemical processes that may be incorporated into the mathematical model. The modelling is based on the behaviour of the central clock genes under a wide array of light conditions. Special consideration has been given to the response of the clock to changes in the photoperiod, including the transient behaviour as the oscillator adapts to new conditions. Photoreceptors are not explicitly included in the model, nor are the pathways by which they affect the core clock genes. Although modelling of such details is clearly a future possibility, assuming sufficient knowledge is obtained about these details in <italic>Ostreococcus</italic>, we consider here only the effects that light, directly or indirectly, may have on biochemical reaction rates in the core clock. The ordinary differential equations and parameters of the model are described in the Experimental procedures and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Appendix S1</xref>. The model equations have previously been used in a mathematical context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Akman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), but here we introduce and motivate the model from a biological viewpoint, and describe its workings and implications in detail.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Observations under light/dark cycles</title>
        <p>Before explaining the design and function of the model, we discuss the experimental observations over the course of a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (L:D 12:12), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>. We refer to the times at which the light is switched on and off as dawn and dusk, respectively. In the experiments, the TOC1&#x2013;LUC level rose towards the end of the day and peaked sharply at dusk. Post-transcriptional processes are known to be important in the regulation of TOC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Djouani-Tahri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and the data suggest that TOC1 protein is degraded more rapidly in the dark, in addition to a reduction or cessation of transcription caused by the increasing CCA1 level and the onset of darkness.</p>
        <p><italic>CCA1</italic> transcription was sustained throughout the night, with CCA1&#x2013;LUC peaking 2&#x2013;4 h before dawn, at which point TOC1&#x2013;LUC had already fallen to a low level. At dawn, the onset of light triggered a sharp rise in CCA1&#x2013;LUC for 1&#x2013;2 h, leading to a second peak in the early morning. This morning peak was also seen for pCCA1::LUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, both CCA1&#x2013;LUC and pCCA1::LUC show a transient dip at dusk, which delays the increase in expression at that time. Together, these observations suggest that the <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription rate is higher in the light, even though most <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription is timed to occur in the dark.</p>
        <p>After the morning peak, the level of CCA1 fell throughout the day. About 4 h before dusk, the TOC1 reporter levels began to increase, with timing that was consistent with the picture of CCA1 as a repressor of <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription. The increase in <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription was followed by an increase in the levels of the CCA1 reporters an hour or two before dusk.</p>
        <p>Changing the day length from 12 h affects the timing of clock gene expression, and reveals causal relationships between the clock genes and the light inputs. In addition, shape changes in the luminescence curves reveal specific details about other molecular processes, e.g. light dependence of degradation rates. In <italic>Ostreococcus</italic>, a notable difference between long and short photoperiods was the relative size of the CCA1&#x2013;LUC morning peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>). Entrainment under a longer photoperiod (L:D 16:8) resulted in higher expression in the morning peak, whereas a shorter photoperiod (L:D 8:16) reduced its level compared with results for the L:D 12:12 conditions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

        <title>Model construction</title>
        <p>Based on the data presented and cited above, we believe that TOC1 is the main regulator of <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription, either directly or indirectly, in <italic>Ostreococcus</italic>. Any model based on this assumption must account for the observed delay between the TOC1&#x2013;LUC peak at dusk and the CCA1&#x2013;LUC peak in the later part of the night. The same problem exists in Arabidopsis, although the timing of gene expression is different. In the first Arabidopsis clock model described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Locke <italic>et al.</italic> (2005a)</xref>, transport of TOC1 from cytosol to nucleus created the necessary delay, but the profile of TOC1 mRNA and protein was inconsistent with experiments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Locke <italic>et al.</italic> (2005b)</xref> solved this by introducing a hypothetical transcription factor, X, located between TOC1 and <italic>CCA1</italic> in the loop. However, they also mentioned another possibility: &#x2018;either the active form of TOC1 is present at a far lower concentration than bulk TOC1 protein, perhaps in a complex, or &#x2026; an additional, TOC1-dependent component is the direct activator of <italic>LHY</italic> and <italic>CCA1</italic>&#x2019;.</p>
        <p>We do not follow the Arabidopsis clock model in introducing an unknown component to delay the signal from TOC1 to <italic>CCA1.</italic> Instead, we explore the alternative (and no less parsimonious) hypothesis that TOC1 can exist in two states: inactive and active. Under this hypothesis, TOC1 is synthesized in the inactive form, and is slowly activated in the dark to give a broad peak of active TOC1, and thus <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription, in the later half of the night. We cannot experimentally observe the hypothetical activation of TOC1, because only total TOC1&#x2013;LUC is measured. However, for the model to be consistent with the experimental profile of total TOC1, it is necessary for the active form of TOC1 to be present at a significantly lower level than the inactive form. Consequently, the model may be very similar, in terms of its equations, to one in which &#x2018;active TOC1&#x2019; is replaced by a distinct, post-transcriptionally regulated transcription factor. For example, the majority of inactive TOC1 could be degraded and never activated. The detail of this mechanism is not crucial, however. In the model presented here, all TOC1 passes from the inactive to the active form (see below).</p>
        <p>To explain the CCA1 morning peak and its transient nature, the model assumes that the active form of TOC1 is a stronger activator of <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription, but also more rapidly degraded, in the light than in the dark. Any active TOC1 remaining at dawn causes a short-lived increase in <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription. In addition, the model requires a higher CCA1 protein degradation rate in the light than in the dark, as indicated by the differences between pCCA1::LUC and CCA1&#x2013;LUC profiles in the experiments (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). The model is able to reproduce qualitatively the correlation between photoperiod and the <italic>CCA1</italic> morning peak, solely through transcriptional regulation of <italic>CCA1</italic> by TOC1 protein. This is possible because, in the model, the length of the night is important in determining the amount of active TOC1 that remains to activate <italic>CCA1</italic> at dawn. The mechanism in the model represents a hypothesis that is quantitatively consistent with the data. It was identified by our computational approach and can be understood as described below.</p>
        <p>As originally conceived, the model included degradation of both the active and inactive forms of TOC1 protein, as well as light-dependent conversion between the two forms. The process of fitting model parameters to match the experimental data eliminated some of these reactions because they were redundant, resulting in a model in which TOC1 must be activated before it can be degraded. Consequently, the rate at which a pool of TOC1 is degraded in the model depends on what fraction is in the active form. According to the best fitted parameter values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>), the rate of TOC1 activation, which is higher in the dark than in the light, is a bottleneck to TOC1 degradation. Thus, total TOC1 in the model was degraded more quickly in the dark, even though the active form was more stable in the dark. The model's dynamic behaviour, using this mechanism, was consistent with the data on total TOC1 and on the activation of <italic>CCA1</italic> under various light:dark cycles.</p>
        <p>Experiments showed that, if the day is shortened by an early dusk, the pTOC1::LUC reporter level nevertheless increased at around the predicted time of dusk in the L:D 12:12 cycle, but to a lower level than it otherwise would (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). The level of <italic>TOC1</italic> expression was roughly proportional to the photoperiod (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3</xref>), despite the absence of light. Such a response suggests that the processes that control the <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription rate effectively retain a memory of the amount of light received by the cell. We cannot identify the positive regulators of <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription, but photoreceptor signalling and/or metabolic state might be involved. To describe this process in the model, we have placed <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription under the positive control of a &#x2018;light accumulator&#x2019; component (&#x2018;acc&#x2018; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>), whose value slowly approaches 1 in constant light and 0 in constant darkness.</p>
        <p>The equations in our model include diffusion of CCA1 between the cytosol and the nucleus, but this diffusion rate is maximized in the best fitted parameter set, and thus we may consider cytosolic and nucleic CCA1 to be in rapid dynamic equilibrium.</p>

        <title>Modelling transient behaviour</title>
        <p>The relative simplicity of the <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> system, coupled with high experimental reproducibility and time resolution, has enabled us to fit the model directly against many measured time courses. This differs from the approach taken for Arabidopsis, where development of successive clock models was aided by reduction of noisy biological data into more robust measures, such as the period and phase of oscillations. Fitting the model using a least-squares-like cost function (see Experimental procedures) gives weight to all features of the time courses, including phase and shape, at the expense of classical circadian observables, such as period in constant light.</p>
        <p>Plant clock models have hitherto primarily considered limit cycle oscillations, which represent the behaviour after long entrainment periods. In contrast, a majority of the experiments used for fitting the <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> clock model contain a change in the photoperiod, transfer of the cells into constant light, or both. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref> shows that the model is able to track the levels of the measured clock components across these changes in the light conditions. Such tracking requires the model to reproduce the amplitude, period, phase and general shape of expression as the conditions change, which is more challenging than reproducing only the phase and period of oscillations. In general, the simulations and experiments show a high level of agreement. The differences between model simulations and data are quantified by a local sum square error, normalized to the error value for a straight line through the data, such that an error of 1 indicates a model output as bad as a straight line. The best parameter set has an error of 0.39. Thus the model can explain over 60% of the variation in measured luminescence levels when averaged across all 144 experiments used to fit the model (see Experimental procedures).</p>

        <title>The effects of photoperiod</title>
        <p>The relationship between photoperiod and phase holds information about the overall function of the clock and the contributions of the individual clock components. A change in photoperiod causes a phase response in the clock components, which can be quantified by the shift in timing of the peaks and troughs compared to the preceding entrainment period. We have performed a series of experiments in which the photoperiod was changed from 12 h to any length between 2 and 22 h, in increments of 2 h, by altering the time of dusk or dawn. In one version of the experiments, the photoperiod was only altered for a single day before release into constant light (LL), in order to reveal when and how the phase of the clock is sensitive to transitions between light and dark. In other experiments, the cells were exposed to the new photoperiod for 3 days, which is sufficient for the <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> clock to reach stable entrainment, revealing both the transient effects of photoperiod entrainment and the effects of photoperiod on phase in LL.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref> shows the effects on CCA1&#x2013;LUC when cells were transferred from L:D 12:12 into constant light, and when the final night was either extended or shortened. Progressively later dawns caused greater phase delays. However, the delays were less than they would be if an extended night caused a complete resetting of the clock. Similarly, an earlier dawn caused a phase advance. The size of the phase advance is greatest when dawn is 6 h earlier than in the preceding L:D 12:12 cycle. Smaller phase advances were observed in response to even earlier dawns. These data show that the resulting clock phase is not locked directly to either dawn or dusk, but instead shows a complex response to the perturbation. This flexibility in circadian phase was also observed in the results for 3 days of altered photoperiod (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The model predicts the first peak in LL to occur earlier than it did experimentally, and over-estimates the period of the oscillations, probably due to the small amount of LL data used in the model fitting (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S2</xref>). However, it is clearly able to reproduce the overall experimental phase response. Such a complex response to the light input signal has been observed in other organisms (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Edwards <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), but it was surprising to see in the model. Experience from other clock models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Locke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Akman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) indicates that interlocked feedback loops, which this model lacks, are required for such non-trivial relationships between clock phase and light input.</p>
        <p>Closer comparison between photoperiods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>) sheds light on how both dawn and dusk are important in setting the phase of the oscillator in the present model. Under short days, the dark-induced transformation of TOC1 protein into its active form causes the levels of CCA1 mRNA and protein to peak earlier, whereas the longer night results in less TOC1 at dawn and consequently a smaller peak of CCA1 in the morning, which in turn causes an earlier CCA1 trough that enables an earlier peak in TOC1 mRNA and protein. Under long days, the additional <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription before dusk leads to higher CCA1 protein levels at dawn, but has little impact on the CCA1 trough. However, the longer days allow TOC1 protein to keep rising, leading to later and higher peaks of both TOC1 and CCA1 protein. The varying contributions of these mechanisms offer an explanation as to how the clock model can avoid locking its oscillations to either dawn or dusk. Circadian gating of input signals is sometimes seen as the task of an external &#x2018;<italic>zeitnehmer</italic>&#x2018;comprising additional molecular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Roenneberg and Merrow, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">McWatters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), but here gating of the light input signal is a property of the oscillator mechanism. Our results indicate that a single feedback loop may indeed be capable of generating the complex phase response observed in <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

        <title>Contributions of light inputs</title>
        <p>The biological system, like the model, may rely on circadian gating of the input signal into various parts of the loop. It is therefore of interest to explore the roles that the individual light inputs play in the model, so that understanding of the model can direct future experimental work. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S3</xref> summarizes the effects that light has on the behaviour of the model at various time points. However, light enters the model in five different places, and it is not easy to determine what each light input contributes to the function of the system as a whole. This is an issue that is largely separate from the question of what photoreceptor pathways are involved in controlling the biological clock, and can be addressed though simulations.</p>
        <p>The model has four light-regulated reaction rates, each with separate rate constants for light and dark. We have disabled one light input at a time by setting its rate constants to identical values to mimic the effects of switching a hypothetical regulator on or off. A slightly different approach was used for regulation of <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription through the &#x2018;light accumulator&#x2019;, because the relevant model parameter represents a time scale rather than a rate constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref>). From this analysis, we are able to deduce the role of each light input in the model.</p>

          <p>All five light inputs contribute to the model's dynamics in distinct ways. This finding suggests that the dynamics are highly dependent on the parameters, with considerable flexibility in adjusting the model's rhythmic behaviour.

        <p>A major advantage of the clock model is that it can generate experimentally testable hypotheses.

Over-expression of <italic>CCA1</italic> or <italic>TOC1</italic> was introduced into the model equations as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Appendix S1</xref>. For each of the two genes, the level of over-expression was adjusted to make the model fit the change in luminescence level between wild-type and mutants under constant light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7</xref>).

        <title>Skeleton photoperiod</title>
        <p>The response to new regimes of light input is highly relevant to test the <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> clock model, particularly with respect to circadian gating. Circadian clocks in animals and plants can be entrained to a skeleton photoperiod, where light is supplied near dusk and dawn but the remaining part of the subjective day is dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Pittendrigh and Minis, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hillman, 1972</xref>). Because of the low total amount of light that the cells receive in such experiments, we have also considered the response of <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> to a skeleton skotoperiod where light is added in the middle of the subjective night.</p>
        <p>We have tested the clock model against experiments under both types of skeleton photoperiod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3</xref>). Cells were transferred from L:D 12:12 to the test cycle, then to LL. As expected, the overall shape of the luminescence response was correctly predicted by the model under both conditions. However, the model exhibited noticeable deviations from the experimental observations for the skeleton photoperiod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8b</xref>), especially for the timing of CCA1&#x2013;LUC expression after release into constant light. The skeleton experiments were performed under a lower light intensity than the experiments used for model fitting, and the limited duration of light appears to be insufficient for oscillations to be sustained to the extent that the model predicts. Accordingly, we adjusted the model parameter that corresponds to the light intensity, reducing the effect of light on the &#x2018;light accumulator&#x2019; by 70% to match the decreased amplitude of CCA1&#x2013;LUC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref> shows that this adjustment is sufficient to make the model correctly predict the peak time for CCA1&#x2013;LUC in constant light following the skeleton photoperiod. The predictions from the modified model also match the experimental data for the morning peak in CCA1&#x2013;LUC under the complete (non-skeleton) light/dark cycles that preceded the transfer to skeleton photoperiods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S4</xref>), further supporting the parameter adjustment. Low light was predicted to have little effect on clock gene expression under skeleton skotoperiod cycles, consistent with the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8a</xref>). In particular, the phase in LL was predicted and observed to agree with data from complete photoperiods of the higher light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5a</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that, under low light, the system is sensitive to the total amount of light rather than the light intensity itself.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have developed a mathematical model of the <italic>Ostreococcus tauri</italic> circadian clock as a feedback loop between <italic>TOC1</italic> and <italic>CCA1</italic>, guided by experimental observations under many light conditions. The model reproduces the dynamics of transcriptional and translational luciferase reporters for both genes, over a range of photoperiods, and is even able to predict the transient response of the clock when the light conditions are altered. This detailed model fitting was made possible by the high reproducibility of the luminescence data from <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> cell cultures. The model's ability to match these data, and to predict the cell's rhythmic responses to genetic and environmental perturbations, supports the validity of the proposed clock gene circuit. Systematic examination of the model's behaviour helped us to explain and predict how the <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> circadian clock can produce complex light responses, despite having a minimal number of genes compared with higher plants.</p>
      <p>Some biochemical processes underlying the model remain to be elucidated. In particular, the mechanism by which TOC1 protein regulates <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription is not known in any species. Recent results suggest the possibility of direct DNA binding via the CCT domain of TOC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Tiwari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The Arabidopsis clock models described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Locke <italic>et al.</italic> (2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2006)</xref> included the hypothetical component X as the delaying link between TOC1 expression and later <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription. The <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> model presented here eliminates X, like the latest Arabidopsis clock model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pokhilko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Instead, these models include an activated form of TOC1, which, in our model, is light-dependent. As previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Locke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005b</xref>), these are two interpretations of a fundamentally similar, TOC1-dependent activation of <italic>CCA1</italic> expression.</p>
      <p>Protein phosphorylation is important in regulating circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gallego and Virshup, 2007</xref>), and provides a possible mechanism for both the activation and degradation of TOC1. In Arabidopsis, there is a complex interplay between the PRR and TOC1 proteins, with important consequences for the phosphorylation, interactions, degradation and nuclear localization of TOC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Fujiwara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Similar mechanisms may operate in <italic>Ostreococcus</italic>, where TOC1 is the only homologue of the higher-plant PRRs. However, in contrast to these proteins, <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> TOC1 possesses a phosphate-receiving aspartate residue in its receiver domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Corellou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). If TOC1 is a functional response regulator, then time- or light-dependent transfer of phosphate to this residue may affect TOC1 function.</p>
      <p><italic>TOC1</italic> transcription showed an unexpected light response that was required for the model to match the data. The total light fluence received over the past cycle activates <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription via the model's &#x2018;light accumulator&#x2019;. This behaviour was directly indicated by the data for various photoperiods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S6</xref>) and skeleton cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S4</xref>), but is unusual among clock models. Rapid light responses were sufficient to model calcium levels and microarray data in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dalchau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), as well as detailed profiles of clock gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Edwards <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pokhilko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Either a regulatory photoreceptor or a metabolic product of photosynthesis could be responsible for the integration of light signals. Commitment to cell division also depends on the total fluence received by <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> cells, whereas the timing of cell division is gated by the clock and locked to dawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Moulager <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Translation of the key G<sub>1</sub> protein cyclin A, which is required for S-phase entry, depends on a similar light accumulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Moulager <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Thus a common mechanism might link <italic>TOC1</italic> transcription and cell-cycle progression.</p>
      <p>In general, the clock model predicted CCA1 dynamics better than TOC1 dynamics. The obvious interpretation is that the regulation of CCA1 is more accurately described in the model, but this is not necessarily true given the feedback nature of the system. Our experimental results tested the limits of detailed predictions. For example, CCA1&#x2013;LUC expression appeared almost saturated in simulations of the <italic>TOC1-ox</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that <italic>CCA1</italic> transcription in the model is too sensitive to small changes in the TOC1 protein level. This indicates that only a quantitative adjustment is required to a future model. In contrast, the model cannot account for an additional peak of TOC1&#x2013;LUC expression in response to an early dawn (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that another regulator gains importance under these conditions. The model also highlights evidence that CCA1 is not controlled solely by TOC1. Under skeleton photoperiods, CCA1&#x2013;LUC responded differently to light pulses at dawn and dusk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>). The model and data indicate that TOC1 is at a low level at both times, suggesting a similar response to light. These results suggest that <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> contains an additional component that regulates CCA1 in a time-dependent fashion. Under normal conditions, its impact may be small, because our model lacking this component accurately matched data for complete light/dark cycles.</p>
      <p>A common theme in circadian systems is the presence of multiple, interlocking feedback loops, suggesting that such complexity typically improves fitness. Day length changes with the seasons, and multiple feedback loops are necessary if some clock outputs are to be entrained to dawn and others to dusk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Pittendrigh and Daan, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Rand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Troein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). It is natural, therefore, to expect that a clock with a single feedback loop would only be capable of following dawn or dusk, as observed for the Arabidopsis clock models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Edwards <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). However, our model demonstrates that even a single loop can produce complex phase relationships, provided there are multiple paths by which light enters the system. We have shown that the malleability of the model's response to light stems from circadian gating of the various light-dependent reactions, which have distinct effects on the system's behaviour. At the most general level, we conclude that a high number of light inputs may be required for flexible biological timing in any circadian clock with a simple circuit or few components.</p>

        <title>Model construction</title>
        <p>The basis for our model is time-course data from a large number of experiments and replicates, in which cultures of the transcriptional and translational reporter lines were exposed to light/dark (L:D) cycles of various lengths, and to transitions between various L:D cycles and/or into constant light (LL). Assuming stochastic effects to be small in these cell population data, we used ordinary differential equations, with variables for the mRNA and protein concentrations of TOC1 and CCA1. As described in Results, the model postulates inactive/active forms of TOC1 and cytosolic/nucleic CCA1. The full model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Appendix S1</xref>) explicitly includes the reporter constructs (luciferase fusion proteins or luciferase mRNA and protein). The core equations are:</p>

        <title>Parameter optimization</title>
        <p>The model's light inputs are the result of testing many possibilities. Modulation by light was only retained where it was required by the best parameter sets. To fit parameters, we repeatedly applied both a genetic algorithm and local optimizers, starting from the best of many initially random parameter guesses. The cost function was defined as the root mean square (RMS) of a local least-squares error measure across 144 experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S2</xref>). For each experiment, the system was simulated using a particular light input signal, starting from variable values that were themselves parameters to be fitted. Scaling between experimental and simulated data was calculated for each sample point individually, using a weighted 72 h time window, and the sum square error was calculated from this local scaling (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Appendix S1</xref> for details). This cost function ensures that long-term trends in the data have little impact. Before the RMS averaging, the error for each experiment was normalized against the would-be error of a flat line, so any useful model would have a total cost well below 1. Our final best parameter set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>) has a cost of 0.391.</p>
        <p>The period of CCA1&#x2013;LUC in constant light is somewhat too long in the model (25.4 h, compared with 24 h in experiments). This is partly explained by the long period of the TOC1&#x2013;LUC reporter. Also, there was no explicit fitting of the period, and the experiments only include short periods of LL.</p>

The values were multiplied by exp(<italic>t</italic>/<italic>&#x3B8;</italic>), where 100 h &#x2264; <italic>&#x3B8;</italic>&#x2264; 240 h. The simulated data were scaled using an arbitrary factor to match the observed level in each plot.</p>
