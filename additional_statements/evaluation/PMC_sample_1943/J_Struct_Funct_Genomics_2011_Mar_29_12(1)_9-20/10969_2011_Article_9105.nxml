        <p>The three dimensional atomic structures of proteins provide information regarding their function; and codified relationships between structure and function enable the assessment of function <italic>from</italic> structure. In the current study, a new data mining tool was implemented that checks current gene ontology (GO) annotations and predicts new ones across all the protein structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The tool overcomes some of the challenges of utilizing large amounts of protein annotation and measurement information to form correspondences between protein structure and function. Protein attributes were extracted from the Structural Biology Knowledgebase and open source biological databases. Based on the presence or absence of a given set of attributes, a given protein&#x2019;s functional annotations were inferred. The results show that attributes derived from the three dimensional structures of proteins enhanced predictions over that using attributes only derived from primary amino acid sequence. Some predictions reflected known but not completely documented GO annotations. For example, predictions for the GO term for copper ion binding reflected used information a copper ion was known to interact with the protein based on information in a ligand interaction database. Other predictions were novel and require further experimental validation. These include predictions for proteins labeled as unknown function in the PDB.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The number of available three dimensional protein structures has increased rapidly over the past decade, due in part to the work of the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Structural variety has also increased as there has been a systematic effort by the PSI to cover the various types of protein structures found in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Representatives from protein sequence families are selected that are likely to have structures different from those already available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A counterpart to the increase in structural variety is an increase the number of different functions associated with the structures, and the breadth of different functional categories represented has expanded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Protein structure can dictate function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and the correspondences between protein structure and biological function provide a means to automatically assess function <italic>from</italic> structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Given an under-characterized protein, structural similarity can first be detected with that of known function. If the similarity is high enough then functional equivalence can be inferred; and the functional annotation from the characterized protein can be transferred. Computational methods are available to detect structural similarity and to aid with the transfer of functional annotation. Example online servers that provide predicted annotations using a host of structural comparison and annotation methods include MarkUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], ProKnow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and ProFunc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These servers identify specific structure/function correspondences. ProKnow and ProFunc consider these correspondences and additionally predict protein function based on the Gene Ontology (GO) classification system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>GO provides a systematic means to partition functional space, and it has the advantage of being both machine and human readable. Applications used for functional annotation based on GO terms using three-dimensional structural information have been the subject of many reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Comparable methods are available to predict protein function according to GO terms using the information that can be retrieved based only a protein&#x2019;s primary amino acid sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Information from primary sequence and three dimensional structure provide complementary contributions to prediction models of protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Overall prediction accuracy is expected to be highest when both forms of information are used together.</p>
      <p>Methods for the assessment of a protein&#x2019;s function based on three dimensional structure and primary amino acid sequence can be improved in different ways. The accuracy of the correspondences between structure and function can be improved, and more structure/function correspondences can be identified. Fundamental questions remain as to how and where knowledge of a protein&#x2019;s three dimensional structures can extend that which can gained through sequence alone for the application of functional assessment and prediction. For what functions is either information sufficient? Where can the combination of structural and sequence information be used to improve functional prediction accuracy over that obtained using the information that can be retrieved based on the primary sequence alone?</p>
      <p>In the current study, a systematic approach was made to evaluate functional annotations across the entire set of protein structures in the PDB. Protein attributes were assembled from the PSI Structural Biology Knowledgebase (SBKB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and other open biological databases. These attributes were examined with regard to their presence in a group of structures that had a given GO term annotation versus structures those that were not assigned with that GO term. The Adaboost classification algorithm, as implemented within the icsiBoost program, was used to identify those protein attributes that differed between the two groups and created classification models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The classification models that were created for all of the GO terms were evaluated against all of the structures in the PDB. As examples of the utility of the predictions made, a review was done for predictions made for protein structures labeled in the PDB as unknown function.</p>

        <title>Assembly of protein attributes</title>
        <p>The assembly of protein attributes for each protein structural chain in the PDB was divided into three automated steps: data download, parsing, and integration. The computer programs for the analysis were written in Python, and there were supplementary scripts written in BASH shell and SQL. A list of the programs and their utilities are given in the supplemental data and are available upon request. Downloaded data file formats included csv, tsv, XML, owl, sdf and txt files. The time stamp for the current releases from each data source was 1 Sep 2010.</p>
        <p>The following protein attributes were assembled. Cellular and biochemical pathway assignments were extracted from BioCyc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], CellMap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], HumanCyc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], INOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and the NCI Pathway Interaction Database (PID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Small molecule associations were obtained from BioCyc, BindingDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], HumanCyc, DrugBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], ChEBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], ChEMBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and SMPDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A common nomenclature for the small molecules called the InChIKey was used, where available, across the small molecules resources of ChEBI, DrugBank, ChEMBL, and SMPDB. The resources SNPs3D and MIM provided disease associations of the protein structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Molecular functions, biological processes, cellular locations were based on the Gene Ontology classification system as assigned in SIFTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Enzyme classifications were as assigned as in the EC2PDB database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Structural domains were identified according to the databases CATH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and SCOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Sequences domain assignments were identified through the Pfam resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>
        <p>Groups of structurally related proteins were found based on the jFatCat alignment algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. At the time of download of precomputed jFatCat structural comparisons as available from the PDB, there were 18,590 groups of structures that corresponded to the number sequence clusters that had more than 40% identity in sequence. The precomputed structural comparisons had been done in an all-versus-all fashion across the representatives from the sequence clusters. To estimate the probability of structural similarity, a Bonferroni correction was made that divided a normally acceptable threshold <italic>P</italic> value of 0.01 for a single comparison by the total number of comparisons. That gave a <italic>P</italic> value threshold to detect significant structural similarity of 5.37&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>. All structures below that threshold were kept in the structural comparison group, and the name of each group was based on the name of the structural representative of that group. The FEATURE resource provided predictions of functional sites within the protein structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The prediction models of FEATURE were run against all the structures in PDB. A given functional site was assigned to a given structure if the structural similarity of the model to the structure was higher than a threshold value of similarity at which the model had more than 99% specificity.</p>

        <title>Dataset generation</title>
        <p>GO term classification was done on the protein structure chain level for all protein structural chains in the PDB. Representative chains were selected from groups of amino acid sequences that were exact matches and 100% identical. A study by Devos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] demonstrated that proteins with higher than 95% sequence identity can vary with regard to their annotations. Representatives at 100% sequence identity were used here to limit the loss of different strings of annotations associated with the structures when classification models were created. Of the total of 155,269 sequences chains in the PDB that had counterparts available as three dimensional structures, 45,803 nonidentical representative chains were selected. Gene ontology term assignments for these representative chains were found in an automated manner. The assignments were based on correspondences between Pfam domains and GO terms as available from the Pfam resource. If a protein structural chain had a given Pfam domain, it was associated with the corresponding GO term.</p>
        <p>All chains assigned to a given GO term were collected and referred to as the positive set. All attributes were retrieved for these chains. Values for each of the attributes were found. Pfam domains were excluded as attributes if they had a direct association with the given GO term according to the information from the Pfam database. A negative set contained ten times the number of chains as the positive set. Chains in the negative set were randomly selected from all those that were not known to be associated with the given GO term. In the selection process, all chains that did not have the given GO term were assigned as the initial set of candidates. Each of these candidates was then checked against the following two exclusion criteria. Candidates that had a known GO term assignment that fell below the given GO term with regards to an ancestral lineage of the GO term hierarchy were excluded. Candidates that had Pfam assignments that had a direct correspondence with the given GO term were also excluded. A random number generator was used to choose instances for the negative set from the remaining candidates. Candidates were added to the negative set until their number set reached ten times that of the positive set.</p>
        <p>The process of creating positive and negative sets of protein chains with attribute values was done for all of the GO terms. Terms that had ten or greater members in the positive set were kept for further analyses. Of the total number of 1,105 terms in the GO hierarchy, 655 GO terms had greater than or equal protein chain members that were non-identical in sequence as available from the PDB.</p>

        <title>Prediction model generation</title>
        <p>For each of the GO term datasets assembled, the Adaboost classification algorithm, as implemented within the icsiBoost program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], was applied. Java code was implemented to run each GO term dataset so as to pass the information about the attribute values of the protein chains from the positive and negative sets. In each of the iterations of boosting in the learning cycle of the Adaboost algorithm, the icsiBoost program used a decision stump learner to assess each attribute value with regard to its presence or absence in the positive and negative sets. The percentages in the positive and negative sets for each attribute value were translated into rules for deciding to which set a given protein belongs given the attribute value. Classifications models consisted of the accumulated set of rules based on the attribute values. A ten-fold cross-validation procedure was implemented in Java to test the accuracy of each classification model. Each fold utilized 90% of the positive and negative sets for training and 10% for testing. The ratio of positive and negative instances in the training sets and test sets were kept in same proportion, 1:10. The statistical parameters of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, overall accuracy, and the area under the receiver operator curve were calculated to estimate each classification model&#x2019;s accuracy.</p>
        <p>The following provides further details regarding the classification algorithm. A decision stump learner was applied to modify the weights of the rules found upon each iteration of boosting. The coefficients (<italic>a</italic><sub>1,</sub><italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>, &#x2026;, <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>) were calculated to find the contribution that each iteration had to the final classification model.

        <title>Predictions of GO term associations across the entire PDB</title>
        <p>All of the attributes present in the structures that had a given GO term formed the attribute complement for that term. Values of the attribute complement of the given GO term were found for all the chains in the PDB. The classification model created for each GO term was used to classify each chain as associated or not associated with that term based on the values of the chain&#x2019;s attribute complement. Potentially new predictions were evaluated in two steps. The first step was to remove chains already known to have the given GO annotation. These known associations were either through direct assignment or inferred through the GO term hierarchy: if there was assignment lower in the hierarchy then the chain had the given term. The second step was to include only predictions above a threshold probability of 0.95<italic>.</italic> A schematic of the method is presented in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Standard data mining techniques were used.

        <p>Each of the classification models created for the GO terms was evaluated by a ten-fold cross-validation. Accuracy measurements were averaged across all the 655 models that were created for GO terms with greater than ten non-identical protein chain members from the PDB. The average measurements of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and area under the receiver operator curve are presented in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The classification models created with information from structure plus sequence were compared to those created with primary sequence information alone. Structure plus sequence included information from the jFatCat, FEATURE, SCOP, and CATH resources in addition to the attributes from the resources based on the protein sequence information only.

        <p>The accuracy measurements were broken down according to the level within the GO hierarchy at the first thirteen levels. Results for the positive predictive values for those levels are shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The positive predictive value measures the percentage of correct positive predictions, that is the percentage of structures correctly predicted to have a given GO term annotation.

Results for the values of the area under the receiver operator curves (AUC) for the different GO term levels are shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The AUC provides a measure of the accuracy of positive and negative predictions, i.e. predictions to have or to not have a given GO term annotation.

With the information provided by structure and sequence, the classification models produced 48,829 GO annotation predictions that were made across the entire PDB, and 454 predictions were made for structures labeled in the PDB as unknown function. Using information derived only from protein sequence, the number of predictions across the entire PDB was 53,748; and there were 251 for the subset of structures with unknown function. A comparison of the predictions was made for each protein chain as to whether it was predicted by a model derived from information from structure and sequence or sequence alone. The number of predictions made with structure and sequence but not with sequence alone was 11,854 for the entire PDB and 254 for proteins with unknown function. The percentage of the predictions for structures with unknown function was 2%. In contrast, the number of predictions made with sequence alone and not made using structure and sequence information was 16,782 for the entire PDB and 51 for structures of unknown function. The percentage of predictions for proteins with unknown function proteins was 0.3%. A protein structure of unknown function was approximately seven times more likely to be characterized using the models generated with structure plus sequence information as compared to those using information only from knowledge of the protein&#x2019;s sequence, 2% divided by 0.3%.

        <p>A utility of using information form structure and sequence rather than sequence alone is apparent in the data presented Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The group &#x201C;B not A&#x201D; are predictions using information from sequence only that were not found among those predictions made using information both structure and sequence. The observation of &#x201C;B not A&#x201D; predictions indicates that these predictions were negated after structural information was added to that from sequence to create the classification models. The result is consistent with the observed higher positive predictive value (PPV) that is associated with classification models created with structure and sequence information, as compared to those created with information from sequence alone. Overall, the &#x201C;B not A&#x201D; predictions are not as viable as those made using information from both structure and sequence.</p>
        <p>The classification models created with information from sequence and structure had a higher sensitivity than those created with information from sequence alone. Compare columns A and B for the sensitivity measures in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Further as shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, there was a significantly higher sensitivity for models created with sequence and structural information, based on paired <italic>t</italic>-tests, at similarity levels of 100, 95, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, and 40% identity. At 30% sequence identity and below, the average performance of models created with sequence and structural information were not significantly different than the average performance of the models created with sequence information alone.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#xA0;5</label><caption><p>Plot of the average of sensitivity of the classification models at different levels of protein sequence identity.

One test set for each GO term was selected for the analysis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10969_2011_9105_Fig5_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p>
        <p>The difference in the sensitivity measures was also found to <italic>increase</italic> when sequence similarity between the target protein and the known instances in the training set of the given classification model <italic>decreased</italic> from 100% sequence identity to 50% identity. See Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. At the level 50% was observed the maximum of the differences with the mean difference of 0.13482&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;0.196. At the level 100% the difference was 0.02805&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;0.0604. A paired <italic>t</italic>-test between the differences between the methods at the levels 50 and 100% was significant, and the <italic>P</italic> value calculated for this difference was 0.002070. The observation that structural information makes a relatively larger contribution to the prediction sensitivity as sequence similarity is decreased indicates that structural information extends that from sequence to a greater extent at 50% identity as compared to 100% identity. A reason is that different sequences can adopt the same three-dimensional structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>
        <p>For the analysis presented in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, sequence identity was estimated by extracting pairs of protein chains in clusters of sequences at a given level of sequence identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], as provided at the URL &lt;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://resources.rcsb.org/">ftp://resources.rcsb.org/</ext-link>&gt; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The level of sequence identity was determined by the closest match between the given protein and any protein in the training set that was used to create the classification model. Each classification model for each GO term was generated using 90% of the positive and negative examples. The models were applied to the remaining 10% side aside as the test sets. One test set was used for each GO term. Calculations were done across all GO terms with greater than 10 nonidentical members.</p>

        <title>Example predictions</title>
        <p>The following are examples of predictions of GO term annotations for the protein structures that are labeled in the PDB as unknown function. These protein structures have been solved through the PSI and are listed in the functional sleuth section of the SBKB at the URL &lt;http://<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sbkb.org/KB/unkstrucs.txt">http://sbkb.org/KB/unkstrucs.txt</ext-link>&gt;. Predictions may provide leads or clues to facilitate further experimental characterization of the structures of unknown function, as outlined by an NIH notice (NOT-GM-08-123).</p>
        <p>The structure of the protein APE2225 from <italic>Aeropyrum pernix K1</italic>, PDB+2ns9, is predicted to participate in the biological process called response to biotic stimulus, GO+0009607. As evidence that the prediction is correct, the protein was reported to have structural similarity with proteins that have the Bet v onefold that are involved in stress response and defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The protein lp_2219 from <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>, PDB+3hfq, is predicted to have the molecular function of amine dehydrogenase activity, GO+0030058, and to participate in the process of methylamine metabolism, GO+0030416. Evidence to support the prediction is that the protein was picked up in a screen for genes that contribute to nitric oxide generation in that organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p>
        <p>A third prediction is for the crystal structure of the protein AF1396 from <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic>, PDB+2nwi. It is predicted to participate in the process of regulation of DNA-dependent transcription, GO+0006355. The protein has been demonstrated to be remotely related in sequence, through a reciprocal PSI-BLAST search, to the UbiC transcription regulator-associated (UTRA) domain that resides within GntR transcription regulators and other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The UTRA domain binds to different cellular ligands, e.g. histidine, sugars and fatty acids, to activate or repress transcription in response these ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. A comparison between the UTRA binding domain from the GntR transcription regulator from <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, PDB+3lhe, with the structure of AF1396 is shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The overall topology of the proteins and the placement of the ligand binding pockets are structurally similar.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#xA0;6</label><caption><p>Comparison of the structure of the protein GntR (<italic>left</italic>), a protein with known transcription regulatory activities in response to cellular ligands, and the structure of AF1396, which was predicted to have transcription regulatory activity.

Further, the cavities of the ligand pockets, which are shown as surfaces on the front of the models, are similarly placed</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10969_2011_9105_Fig6_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig></p>
        <p>The solution crystal structure of the protein psuG (TM1464) from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], PDB+1vkm, was predicted to participate in the metabolism of RNA, GO+0016070. The protein functional role was initially described as a possibly being involved in the biosynthesis of the blue pigment indigoidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], but that was subsequently stated to be incorrect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Evidence that the prediction that psuG has a role in RNA metabolism comes from a study that demonstrated the protein is a pseudouridine-5&#x2032;-phosphate glycosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Also, a protein YeiN, which is homologous of the psuG protein, is also involved in the hydrolysis of pseudouridine as part of the breakdown of RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The finding that the homolog of YeiN is involved the catabolism of RNA further corroborates the prediction that the psuG is involved in RNA metabolism.</p>
        <p>The protein structure shikimate 5-dehydrogenase orthologue YdiB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], PDB+1npd, is predicted to have the molecular function of 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase activity, GO+0003855. Evidence from the literature that support the prediction includes the following. An investigation of the crystal structure and biochemical characterization was done for a novel shikimate dehydrogenase, protein HI0607 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. HI0607 protein&#x2019;s crystal structure is similar to that of AroE and YdiB, and it catalyzes the oxidation of shikimate with NADP<sup>+</sup>. The YdiB protein was found to be a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reductions of dehydroquinate to quinate <italic>and</italic> dehydroshikimate to shikimate in the presence of either NADH or NADPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. An attribute that was used for the prediction of the 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase activity of YdiB was its assignment to the binding of 3-dehydroquinate, as given in ChEBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. ChEBI derived that information from KEGG enzyme database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], based on the EC number for quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase of 1.1.1.282 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The example highlights the complexity of functional assignment, and the importance of integration of information from different data sources. YbiB is a bifunctional enzyme with different but related enzymatic activities.</p>

        <title>Computational challenges and bottlenecks addressed</title>
        <p>The methods and technologies utilized here overcame some of the challenges of prediction of function from structure and sequence. The enabling technologies included a large scale integration of protein attributes from varied biological resources as available in the SBKB and other databases, the use of state of the art data mining algorithms, and new computer code implementations that allowed for large datasets of proteins and attributes to be analyzed. A result of the large scale integration effort was that connections between varied resources allowed for annotations that are synonymous with GO term annotations to be identified. The integration of information from varied sources provides a means to find equivalence in meaning between resources and a way to infer the synonymous annotation counterparts based on the GO term nomenclature. For example, for the GO term copper ion binding, GO+0005507, there were 956 known annotations. An additional 1,536 annotations were inferred based on copper ion associations with protein chains as available from the ligand interaction resources ChEBI, ChEMBL, SMPDB, and DrugBank. Integration thereby provides a means to identify synonymous annotations. The observation highlights the need to expand the annotations of GO terms based on information in primary biological databases.</p>
        <p>The following are two examples of new code implementations and their utility. The number of iterations used for the Adaboost classification algorithm have been shown empirically to minimize classification error as the number of iterations is made large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], e.g. setting the number to 1,000 or higher. For some classification models of the GO terms, a run of 1,000 iterations was more than that required to minimize errors. A Java class was created to monitor the training and test errors as the iterations progressed. When test set error remained unchanged or increased over a range of four hundred iterations, the iterations were discontinued. The total computation time was reduced to 3&#xA0;weeks of 3&#xA0;weeks as compared to 2&#xA0;months without the early stopping procedure implemented. Calculations were done on a local high performance computer cluster (HPCC) that had 136 processors and an average RAM of 1.6&#xA0;GB. The icsiBoost program itself also provided advances that enabled the study. A parallel version of the program allows iterations of the boosting analyses to be run in parallel.</p>

Some differences with these methods with the current method, which is referred to as <italic>k</italic>nowledge prediction of a functional <italic>role</italic> or Krole, are outlined. Overall the Krole method provides an estimate of the prediction probability which varies from 0 to 1. Such estimates are relevant to experimentalists when a protein is checked for possible functional assignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. ProKnow and ProFunc provide a likelihood score that is not normalized to a probability estimate for each GO term prediction. In addition, a conceptual difference between Krole and ProKnow is regarding which predictions are presented. ProKnow presents all predictions where there was no direct assignments of a protein with a given GO term annotation. A prediction was not considered here if the predicted term was an ancestor within a lineage of a known term for the protein based on the GO term hierarchy. Such annotations are implied by the hierarchy.</p>
        <p>A comparison of the performance Krole versus Profunc and Proknow was also done. The ProKnow analysis the accuracy measurement of positive predictive value decreases as the depth of the hierarchy is increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Here we report values that the positive predictive values remain consistently high as the depth of the hierarchy is increased, as shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. For ProFunc, each prediction requires a scan to be executed across the slate of analysis programs which is computationally demanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; and scans are not available for all the protein structural chains in the PDB. The current method uses precomputed values to build the prediction models, and predictions are available across all the chains.</p>
