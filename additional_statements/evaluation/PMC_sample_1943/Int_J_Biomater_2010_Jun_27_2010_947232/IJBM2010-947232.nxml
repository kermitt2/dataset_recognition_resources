      <abstract>
        <p>The main objective of this paper was to investigate the effect of transmission of force on bone cells that were attached to a deformable membrane. We functionalized a silastic membrane that measured 0.005 inches thickness and coated it with an extra cellular matrix (ECM) protein, fibronectin (FN). MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells were cultured on the functionalized FN-coated membrane after which cell attachment and proliferation were evaluated. We observed an immediate attachment and proliferation of the bone cells on the functionalized membrane coated with FN, after 24 hours. Upon application of a mechanical force to cells cultured on the functionalized silicone membrane in the form of a dynamic equibiaxial strain, 2% magnitude; at 1-Hz frequency for 2&#x2009;h, the osteoblast cells elicited slightly elevated phalloidin fluorescence, suggesting that there was reorganization of the cytoskeleton. We concluded from this preliminary data obtained that the engineered surface transduced applied mechanical forces directly to the adherent osteoblast cells via integrin binding tripeptide receptors, present in the FN molecules, resulting in the enhanced cellular attachment and proliferation.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Modified and deformable bioactive substrates can enhance osteoblast adhesion and proliferation.  The surface reactivity and interfacial adhesion of such substrates to bone cells can be attributed to the nature/type of surface modifications and functionalized layers attached to the bioactive materials.  Bone cells transduce changes in the mechanical environment through adhesion molecules that link them to the extracellular matrix (ECM).  The modifications and deformations of substrates are therefore likely to influence the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].  Very few studies to date, have examined the combined effect of both mechanical stress and materials surface properties on bone cell function. This paper;therefore, investigates the effect of mechanical stimulus and substrate surface characteristics on osteoblasts attachment and proliferation.  We hypothesized that the proliferation stage of osteoblastic cells to strain responses <italic>in vitro</italic> could be determined by the combined effect of applied mechanical strain and surface properties of a substrate.  This paper will, thus, serve as a fundamental study in understanding mechanotransduction processes in bone cells seeded on modified bioactive substrates.  </p>

        <title>1.1. Effect of Mechanical Stress on Bone Cells</title>
        <p>Bone cells respond to mechanical stimulation and as a result, bone architecture is strongly influenced by mechanical force through a mechanism by which bone cells adapt to mechanical loading.  Previous studies that have reported on the responses of bone cells to mechanical stimuli varied widely and therefore lacked consensus on what mechanisms of mechanotransduction were physiologically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].  Minimal strains have been reported to occur in bone cells as a result of applied mechanical stresses under physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].  Some reported studies have suggested, however that strain rate correlated with bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. One study had suggested that mechanical forces were transmitted to cells through the extra cellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and recently published evidence suggested that the ECM-cell surface receptors (the integrins) may act as mechanoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].    In one study that focused on the mechanosensitivity of human bone derived cells, the authors demonstrated the frequency and cycle number dependence of the proliferative response of human osteoblast-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].  That study further surmised that those two effects should not be considered separately since they were interrelated.  In a recent study, however, a device was developed that enabled application of sinusoidal micromotions of amplitudes between 5&#x2013;50&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m and applied loads up to 1000&#x2009;Pa on cells,<italic> in vitro,</italic> to analyze the bone-implant interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].   In another recent and related study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], some investigators reported that short periods of applied physiological mechanical stresses induced immediate early gene expression and growth in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts.  </p>
        <p>Various techniques have been proposed and used<italic> in vitro</italic> by several investigators to study mechanostimulation of bone cells.  Such studies have often used systems that included cell culture with controlled delivery of a mechanical input like hydrostatic pressure, fluid shear stress, and a substrate strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">13</xref>].  Apparatuses devised in the laboratory for such studies included a variety of complex systems that featured mechanical inputs of varied degrees of precision and homogeneity although early efforts in cell culture mechanostimulus were of a nonquantitative nature.  Glucksmann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">14</xref>] who pioneered cell mechanostimulus studies utilized several biological-loading models like endosteal cell cultures from embryonic chick tibiae.  Quantitation in cell mechanostimulus studies was achieved by the landmark study of Rodan and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">15</xref>], which involved preparations of a variety of cells and explants as well as hydrostatic pressurization of suspended bone cells and tensile straining.   Techniques for mechanical stimulation of cells that have been employed in the past, included use of hydrostatic pressure, axial compression, longitudinal mechanical straining, out-of-plane systems, and fluid shear stress systems.  Special purpose systems were developed to study the combined effect of fluid stress and substrate deformation concurrently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">18</xref>].  Among the various mechanostimulus systems used, there was a strong preference for the longitudinal systems that were designed to effectively apply mechanical deformation to bone cells seeded on deformable membranes.  In a most recent study, however, the authors confirmed that although mechanical stress was essential for the survival of cells and the maintenance of tissues, the mechanisms of cellular response to mechanical stress were not fully elucidated due to the diversity of mechanical stresses and mechanosensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">19</xref>].  </p>
        <p>In this study, we developed and designed a system that enhanced the attachment and proliferation of bone cells to a deformable membrane.  The objectives of this study were to anchor osteoblast cells to a substrate that was chemically functionalized and then modified with protein molecules; and to ascertain whether the combined effect of substrate modifications and applied equibiaxial mechanical strain could cause a change in the cytoskeletal architecture of the adherent bone cells.</p>

      <title>2. Materials and Methods</title>
      <p>Prior to anchorage of cells to the substrate with attached protein molecules, the silicone membrane was functionalized by exposure to ultra violet radiation (UVO).  The substrates were then characterized using the established surface characterizations tools such as contact angle goniometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS).  Bone cells (MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts) were then seeded onto the biomimetic surface, followed by evaluation of the cell function to determine changes in the cytoskeletal organization of the adherent cells. </p>

        <title>2.5. Application of Mechanical System to the Silicone Membranes</title>
        <p>The design and characterization of the system to apply mechanical forces to the cell culture consisted of an apparatus capable of deforming a compliant substrate and generating reproducible mechanical strains, mimicking <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.  This was to ensure the maintenance of cell viability during cell culture, attachment to the membrane and deformations that mimicked <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions and the possibility of imaging the system for real-time data acquisition.    Controlling the cell environment meant providing conditions of 37&#xB0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 100% humidity.  These conditions were achieved in this experiment using a cell chamber.  Application of mechanical forces to cells seeded on the membranes conformed to techniques reported by Banes and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].  The cell stretching device that incorporated the four-point bending system was fabricated at the Department of Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology, School of Dental Medicine, the University of Pennsylvania. The silicone membranes were attached to polystyrene cylinders with an O-ring, under sterile conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).  The cylinder was screwed into a base with a glass window resting on another O-ring to create a chamber. </p>
        <p>The apparatus designed as a four-point bending system was capable of deforming a compliant substrate in order to generate a reproducible mechanical strain.  It provided a sinusoidal waveform and an equibiaxial stress within a frequency range of 0.2&#x2009;Hz&#x2013;2.0&#x2009;Hz for a period of 2 hours under an atmosphere of 100% humidity, comparable to physiological conditions.  As a result of applying loads up to 1000&#x2009;Pa, to produce strain rates of up to 4%, the membranes experienced strain regimes of 200&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic><italic>&#x3B5;</italic>&#x2013;2500&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic><italic>&#x3B5;</italic> in all four directions.  The cells were seeded on the membranes at a concentration of 100,000&#x2009;cells/cm<sup>2</sup> for 24 hours, after which the membranes were subjected to a uniform equibiaxial strain.  A 2% equibiaxial strain was applied at a frequency of 1&#x2009;Hz, in this experiment, because these conditions were postulated to be physiological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].   The experiments were terminated after 2&#x2009;h and the cellular responses were evaluated.

          <title>2.8.3. Cytoskeletal Organization in Response to Mechanical Forces</title>
          <p>The cytoskeletal organization of cells was evaluated by staining actin filaments with phalloidin, after applying 2% dynamic equibiaxial strain exerted cyclically at 1&#x2009;Hz frequency (Figures 6(a) to 8(b)).  The MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells that were subjected to strain for 2&#x2009;h displayed a significant level of actin fluorescence (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(a) </xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(a)</xref>). Although no preferential orientation was observed, there was however, a significant increase in actin filament fluorescence at the cell periphery. On the nonstretched FN-coated membrane, the actin filaments remained organized. The fluorescence intensity was generally considerably lower than the level displayed by the stretched cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(b)</xref>).</p>

        <title>2.9. Discussion</title>
        <p>The Frost mechanostatic theory assumed that the application of biophysical forces was supposed to be translated into a cellular response, thereby allowing the cellular organism to adapt to its mechanical environment.  These biophysical forces involved a physiological strain range of 200&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic><italic>&#x3B5;</italic> &#x2264; &#xD7; &#x2264;5000&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic><italic>&#x3B5;</italic>.  A strain regime below 200&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic><italic>&#x3B5;</italic> resulted in a net bone loss; while between 200&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic><italic>&#x3B5;</italic> and 2500&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic><italic>&#x3B5;</italic>, the strain regimes were described as physiological.  Above 5000&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic><italic>&#x3B5;</italic> the strain regime was described as pathological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].  In this and other models that have been developed to mimic the physiological environment, the mechanical stimuli were reported to occur <italic>in vivo</italic> and included fluid shear, hydrostatic compression, uniaxial stretch and biaxial stretch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].  In line with the objective of this study which was to engineer a deformable silicone membrane capable of enhancing osteoblast cellular attachment and proliferation; the UVO-activated silicone membranes were first physisorbed with the extracellular matrix protein, FN, which provided ligands for integrin receptors.  This functionalized silicone-biomolecule (FN) substrate promoted attachment and proliferation of the bone cells, in conformity with data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] reported in previous studies.  </p>
        <p>The data we obtained, after subjecting the osteoblast-like cells to the dynamic equibiaxial strain via the functionalized FN-coated silicone membrane, indicated that there were noticeable changes in the cytoskeletal architecture with minimum cell damage. Our data indicated that the modified silicone surfaces transduced mechanical stimuli directly to the attached cells, in conformation with a recent study that reported a direct effect of mechanical stimuli on osteoblast-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], probably through integrin receptors present in FN.  The functionalized silicone surfaces created by exposure to UVO radiation, prior to attaching the FN molecules, counteracted the possibility of cell loss due to application of mechanical strain. The silicone substrate was probably bound directly to the attachment domain (RGD) of the FN molecule. </p>
        <p>Variations in the physical characteristics of the silicone membrane had been linked to the formation of an oxide layer after exposure of membrane to the UVO radiation, causing the formation of an excess of oxygen bridges with the functionalized silicone membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].  The extent of the functionalization time was maintained at 0 to 30&#x2009;min UVO exposure time, in order to preserve the elastic characteristics of the membranes.  Certain factors that might have contributed to promoting the adherence of osteoblast cells to the functionalised FN-coated engineered silicone surfaces included the RGD integrin receptors present in FN molecules, which might have bound to the subunits of the osteoblast-like cells' integrin receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">20</xref>].  In addition, one of the major factors that promoted the adhesion of osteoblasts was the modified surface topography of the silicone membrane.  That is, increased surface roughness as evidenced by data obtained in this study, enhanced attachment of the osteoblast cells, as had been reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">31</xref>].  </p>
        <p>In order to assess the impact of mechanical forces on the attached bone cells, a dynamic equibiaxial tensile strain was imposed on the cellular-attached, FN-coated Si surfaces.  The preliminary data obtained in this study indicated that cellular response in the physiological environment may be due to the applied equibiaxial strain to the membrane.  That is, the applied strain caused the transduced forces in the membrane to be transmitted to the attached cells.  There was therefore an even distribution of the dynamic equibiaxial strain across the silicone membrane which was ensured by the design of the setup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">33</xref>].  </p>
        <p>It was also evident from this study that the strain mechanisms involving a transfer of strain to the osteoblast layer tend to modulate cell function. We observed that the osteoblast cells that were subjected to equibiaxial strain displayed a significant change in morphology evidenced by slight elevation in actin filament staining (indicated by confocal microscopy images).  This was in conformity with earlier reports by Toma and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">34</xref>], Wang and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">35</xref>] and Meazzini and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and a more recent data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">36</xref>] which showed that cells responded to the applied force by changing their morphology.  The morphological change could probably be linked to remodelling of the cytoskeletal structure of the cells.  The attachment and proliferation of cells on the silicone substrate was thus enhanced, confirming the statement that applied forces to the membrane altered osteoblast cellular function.    The results also suggested that the applied forces were directly transmitted to the cells via the cytoskeletal system as a result of the linkage between the osteoblast and the membrane through the Fn-integrin receptors.    </p>
        <p>The data obtained in this study indicated that we have engineered a system that employed functionalization method to activate surfaces of silicone membranes in order to enable linkage of various biomolecules, proteins, and cells.   Furthermore, bone cell adherence and proliferation were more enhanced on strained, functionalized silicone-RGD (FN molecules) surfaces.  As a result of the elastic characteristics of the functionalized silicone surfaces, further mechanisms by which bone cell functions could be physiologically influenced through mechanical strains could be explored.</p>
