      <abstract>
        <p>Ears are the seed-bearing inflorescences of maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) plants and represent a crucial component of maize yield. The first step in the formation of ears is the initiation of axillary meristems in the axils of developing leaves. In the classic maize mutant <italic>barren stalk fastigiate1</italic> (<italic>baf1</italic>), first discovered in the 1950s, ears either do not form or, if they do, are partially fused to the main stalk. We positionally cloned <italic>Baf1</italic> and found that it encodes a transcriptional regulator containing an AT-hook DNA binding motif. Single coorthologs of <italic>Baf1</italic> are found in syntenic regions of brachypodium (<italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>), rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), and sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>), suggesting that the gene is likely present in all cereal species. Protein&#x2013;protein interaction assays suggest that BAF1 is capable of forming homodimers and heterodimers with other members of the AT-hook family. Another transcriptional regulator required for ear initiation is the basic helix-loop-helix protein BARREN STALK1 (BA1). Genetic and expression analyses suggest that <italic>Baf1</italic> is required to reach a threshold level of <italic>Ba1</italic> expression for the initiation of maize ears. We propose that <italic>Baf1</italic> functions in the demarcation of a boundary region essential for the specification of a stem cell niche.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The developmental plasticity of plants, that is, the ability of plants to modify their morphology according to different environmental stimuli, relies on the production and activity of axillary meristems. Axillary meristems form in the axils of leaf or bract primordia on the adaxial (upper) side of the region where the primordium and the main stem join (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Leyser, 2006</xref>). Formed postembryonically during both vegetative and reproductive development, axillary meristems are eventually responsible for the establishment of secondar<italic>y</italic> axes of growth, such as lateral branches and flowers. The production and activity of axillary meristems determine the overall elaboration of different plant architectures and, during reproductive development, of different inflorescence morphologies in all flowering plants.</p>
      <p>In the case of maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>), two distinct inflorescences, the tassel and the ear, are borne on separate parts of the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kiesselbach, 1949</xref>). Whereas the apical male inflorescence, the tassel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), derives directly from the shoot apical meristem formed during embryogenesis, the female inflorescences, the ears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), derive from axillary meristems that are formed soon after germination in the axils of leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1I</xref>). During vegetative development, several basal axillary meristems may originate lateral branches, also known as tillers. Other axillary meristems form buds that remain quiescent until the plant switches to reproductive development and are enclosed in the prophyll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kiesselbach, 1949</xref>). During reproductive development, the highest axillary buds transition to ear formation. Therefore, a prerequisite for the formation of maize ears is the initiation of a series of axillary meristems in the axils of leaves that occurs very early in development. In both ear and tassel development, the primary apical meristems (also called inflorescence meristems) produce additional axillary meristems that are eventually responsible for the formation of all reproductive structures. In maize, these axillary meristems are named for the structures that they form: branch meristems form tassel branches, spikelet-pair meristems form spikelet pairs, spikelet meristems form spikelets, and floral meristems form florets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McSteen et al., 2000</xref>). Spikelets are grass-specific structures bearing florets, and in maize they are paired, with one spikelet being pedicellate and the other sessile.</p>

      <p>Axillary meristem initiation involves the correct positioning of the meristem anlagen, followed by the delineation of the boundaries for proper primordium separation, and then the establishment of the meristem itself. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <italic>thaliana</italic>, the transport of the hormone auxin in and out of the emerging primordium by the activity of polar auxin transporters, an essential step in primordium positioning, is followed by upregulation of boundary genes and the concomitant expression of meristem identity and maintenance genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>). The establishment of primordium boundaries and the formation of new meristems are therefore deeply interconnected processes, and the boundary region is thought to be important for communication between the axillary meristem and the leaf primordium. Genes affecting boundary formation are generally involved in promoting meristem initiation as well. A number of transcription factors have been described as having a role in axillary meristem formation and lateral organ separation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, such as <italic>CUP SHAPED COTYLEDONS1,2,3</italic> (<italic>CUC1,2,3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hibara et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>LATERAL SUPPRESSOR</italic> (<italic>LAS</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greb et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shuai et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>LATERAL ORGAN FUSION1,2</italic> (<italic>LOF1,2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), and <italic>REGULATOR OF AXILLARY MERISTEMS1</italic> (<italic>RAX1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2006</xref>), all showing a boundary-specific mRNA expression pattern. Functional orthologs of some of these genes have been also found in both maize and rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), and the role of auxin transport seems conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McSteen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallavotti et al., 2008b</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, mutations affecting axillary meristem formation during vegetative development do not necessarily affect reproductive development. In <italic>las</italic> mutants, for example, despite defects in the initiation of vegetative axillary meristems, floral meristems form normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greb et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>In maize, many aspects of the regulation of axillary meristem initiation are common to both vegetative and reproductive development, and mutations that affect axillary meristem development usually impair the formation of both vegetative and reproductive axillary structures (tillers, spikelets, and florets). The <italic>barren stalk1</italic> (<italic>ba1</italic>), <italic>Barren inflorescence1</italic> (<italic>Bif1</italic>), <italic>bif2</italic>, and <italic>sparse inflorescence1</italic> (<italic>spi1</italic>) mutants of maize all have inflorescences devoid or depleted of branches, spikelets, and flowers. With the exception of the semidominant <italic>Bif1</italic>, these mutants are also impaired in tiller formation, as seen in double mutant combinations with <italic>teosinte branched1</italic> (<italic>tb1</italic>), a highly tillered mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doebley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ritter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McSteen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barazesh and McSteen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallavotti et al., 2008a</xref>). One of the most striking phenotypes is observed in the <italic>ba1</italic> mutants, in which plants with the most severe alleles completely lack vegetative and reproductive branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ritter et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Ba1</italic> encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallavotti et al., 2004</xref>) that is phosphorylated by the Ser-Thr kinase BIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McSteen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Skirpan et al., 2008</xref>), which is known to be involved in polar auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skirpan et al., 2009</xref>). Whereas the identity of the <italic>Bif1</italic> gene is still unknown, <italic>Spi1</italic> was shown to encode an enzyme involved in auxin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallavotti et al., 2008a</xref>). <italic>Ba1</italic> and its rice ortholog <italic>LAX1</italic> are also expressed in a specific boundary region adaxial to the initiating axillary meristems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komatsu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallavotti et al., 2004</xref>), they are both required for the formation of these meristems, and the LAX1 protein was also reported to move from the site of expression into the newly forming meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oikawa and Kyozuka, 2009</xref>). The role of <italic>Ba1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has yet to be determined, although a putative ortholog has been recently identified by phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woods et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>The mechanisms regulating axillary meristem initiation in vascular plants are unclear. Traditionally, it was considered that axillary meristems develop either from cells that originate in the shoot apical meristem (detached-meristem theory) or from cells that acquire a meristematic identity (de novo theory). However, analyses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) suggest that both forms of axillary meristems exist in the same plant and might reflect opposite extremes of the same process regulated by the same genetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long and Barton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greb et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leyser, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Leyser, 2006</xref>). The number of taxa possessing both forms of axillary meristem initiation has yet to be investigated, but in rice, a careful expression analysis of a series of genes regulating axillary meristem formation supports the de novo origin of axillary meristems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oikawa and Kyozuka, 2009</xref>). Identifying genes that regulate axillary meristem initiation and are restricted to grasses will provide support to the hypothesis that monocots (or at least grasses) and eudicots have lineage-specific mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oikawa and Kyozuka, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we report the identification of a new regulator of axillary meristem formation in maize, the <italic>Barren stalk fastigiate1</italic> (<italic>Baf1</italic>) gene. <italic>Baf1</italic> encodes a putative transcriptional regulator containing an AT-hook DNA binding motif and a conserved domain of unknown function, called the Plant and Prokaryote Conserved (PPC) domain. <italic>Baf1</italic> coorthologs are present in different grasses, and four potential coorthologs were identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, albeit without strong support. We show that BAF1 can form homo- and heterodimers with other putative AT-hook DNA binding proteins, revealing a previously unrecognized aspect of this protein family. Mutations in <italic>Baf1</italic> give rise to plants that either lack ears or produce fusion defects, suggesting that <italic>Baf1</italic> is involved in demarcating the boundary region where the axillary meristem is forming and plays a role in axillary meristem initiation. We show by genetic and expression analysis that <italic>Baf1</italic> functions upstream of <italic>Ba1</italic> in this pathway.</p>

        <title>The <italic>baf1</italic> Mutant Has Defects in Tassel and Ear Development</title>
        <p><italic>baf1-ref</italic> is a recessive mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coe and Beckett, 1987</xref>) originally identified by Charles R. Burnham in the 1950s. <italic>baf1-ref</italic> mutant plants are characterized by a more compact tassel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref>). Normal tassels carry several basal long branches, derived from the activity of branch meristems, emerging from the central spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In <italic>baf1</italic> mutant tassels, the primary branches are borne in a more upright orientation than in normal tassels, hence the name fastigiate, indicating a cluster of erect branches. A slight increase (of 3.73 branches on average) in the number of tassel branches was also observed in the <italic>baf1-ref</italic> mutant compared with normal plants when introgressed in the maize inbred line B73 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, these branches appeared to be slightly shorter compared with normal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The barren stalk denomination refers to the tendency of <italic>baf1</italic> mutant plants to be earless.

        <p>A leaf, its axillary meristem, and the associated internode together make up a developmental unit referred to as a phytomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galinat, 1959</xref>). In wild-type plants, the internode of an ear-bearing phytomer typically develops an indentation to accommodate the mature inflorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). When ears form in <italic>baf1-ref</italic> mutants, the proximal region of the ear branch develops fused to the internode, and no indentation is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The fusion occurs mainly between the stem internode and the first internode of the lateral branch bearing the ear that is sometimes unusually elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure1</ext-link> online). Occasionally, the fusion also includes the basal part of the prophyll. Often a notch is formed in the stem, likely caused by the mechanical stress posed by the elongating internode fused to the axillary bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When ears form, they are generally shorter than normal and show unorganized rows of kernels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

        <p><italic>baf1-ref</italic> mutants are also defective in the formation of paired spikelets. Spikelets are formed by spikelet-pair meristems, very short branches that produce one terminal and one lateral spikelet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McSteen et al., 2000</xref>). In the <italic>baf1</italic> mutant, there is a tendency to form more single spikelets in tassel branches (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1, Figure 1C</xref>) but not on the central spike of the tassel. We found an increase of more than sevenfold in the percentage of single spikelets borne on tassel branches (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This may result from the smaller size of branch meristems and the consequent smaller than normal group of meristematic cells available for the formation of spikelet-pair meristems, which initiate on the flanks of branch meristems. We therefore measured the radial size of the base of tassel branches in both mutant and wild-type plants and found a significant decrease in <italic>baf1-ref</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>An additional mutant allele of <italic>Baf1</italic> was identified segregating in an M2 family generated by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis in the inbred line A619 (<italic>baf1-IL</italic>). The tassel defects observed in <italic>baf1-IL</italic> mutant plants were similar to those described above for <italic>baf1-ref</italic> mutants, although there was no increase in the number of primary tassel branches (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). <italic>baf1-IL</italic> plants showed a completely earless phenotype and failed to complement the <italic>baf1-ref</italic> mutant. In <italic>baf1-IL</italic> seedlings, the axillary buds that would normally give rise to ears fail to initiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm that the <italic>baf1</italic> mutant is defective in the initiation of axillary meristems, we crossed both <italic>baf1</italic> alleles to the <italic>tb1</italic> mutant of maize, defective in the repression of axillary meristem outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doebley et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>tb1</italic> mutant plants are characterized by bushy growth, with a large number of tillers. In addition, ears are replaced by masculinized inflorescences borne on lateral branches with elongated internodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doebley et al., 1997</xref>). In wild-type maize, ears normally form at the apex of a lateral branch atop a series of suppressed internodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kiesselbach, 1949</xref>). <italic>tb1 baf1-IL</italic> double mutant plants had significantly fewer tillers than did <italic>tb1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that the <italic>baf1</italic> mutation affects axillary meristem initiation, but when an axillary meristem is formed, <italic>baf1</italic> does not seem to influence its subsequent outgrowth. The analysis of these crosses also showed that the earless phenotype, rather than depending on a particular mutant allele, is influenced by the genetic background because <italic>baf1-IL</italic> mutant plants segregating in this cross were not always earless (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, a closer look at the base of the lateral inflorescences in these double mutants showed complete fusion of the first elongated internode of the branch to that of the main stem (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure 1</ext-link> online).</p>

        <p>To understand better the organ fusion phenotype of the developing <italic>baf1-ref</italic> ears, we analyzed sections of wild-type and mutant ears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Longitudinal sections of axillary meristems during vegetative development reveal subtle differences, such as a less pronounced groove between the upper leaf and the prophyll in <italic>baf1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, arrowheads). Transverse sections of wild-type ears have an obvious cellular separation layer between the stem and the base of the ear prophyll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>, arrowheads). This layer is eventually resolved into two distinct structures, the axillary bud and the indentation of the internode. In <italic>baf1-ref</italic> plants, this separation layer is clearly missing throughout the sections and vascular strands are also formed in this area. These defects eventually result in the organ fusion observed in mature ears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also sectioned the base of the tassel branches prior to anthesis (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure 2</ext-link> online). The erect tassel branch phenotype has also been observed in other mutants, such as the <italic>ramosa2</italic> (<italic>ra2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bortiri et al., 2006</xref>) and the <italic>ramosa1 enhancer locus2</italic> (<italic>rel2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallavotti et al., 2010</xref>) mutants, both involved in regulation of spikelet-pair meristem determinacy. The axils of the tassel branches bear a specific structure, the pulvinus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galinat, 1959</xref>), whose cells are responsible for the opening of the tassel branch angle at anthesis. We sectioned and stained the area at the base of the tassel branches and found that <italic>baf1-ref</italic> mutant branches are significantly thinner, and their pulvinal cells, stained blue, are formed but reduced in numbers (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure 2</ext-link> online). These defects appear different from what was previously reported for both <italic>ra2</italic> and <italic>rel2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallavotti et al., 2010</xref>), in which cellular and structural organization is affected.</p>

        <title><italic>Baf1</italic> Encodes a Putative AT-Hook DNA Binding Protein</title>
        <p>The <italic>Baf1</italic> locus was originally mapped to the short arm of chromosome 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coe and Beckett, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neuffer et al., 1997</xref>). To clone <italic>Baf1</italic>, we crossed the <italic>baf1-ref</italic> allele, in an unknown genetic background, into the inbred line B73 to generate an F2 mapping population. We first identified two simple sequence repeat markers (umc1893 and umc1586) in proximal and distal linkage to the <italic>Baf1</italic> locus. Subsequently, a small population of 141 homozygous mutant plants was used to narrow the region containing the <italic>Baf1</italic> locus to between newly developed molecular markers MAGIv4_59303 and MAGIv4_46990 (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Syntenic regions of both sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>) and rice were analyzed for predicted genes in the corresponding interval, and a few potential candidate genes were sequenced in the <italic>baf1-ref</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). One of these gene models, <italic>GRMZM2G072274</italic>, carried a 151-bp deletion starting at position +654 in the predicted coding sequence and a small insertion (GGTGGA), presumably a footprint of a transposition event, that caused a frame shift of the corresponding protein sequence. We therefore sequenced the <italic>baf1-IL</italic> mutant at the same locus and identified at position +121 a single nucleotide change that created a premature stop codon (CAG changed into TAG). The occurrence in both <italic>baf1-ref</italic> and <italic>baf1-IL</italic> mutants of two independent mutations in the coding sequence of the same gene confirmed that <italic>GRMZM2G072274</italic> corresponded to the <italic>baf1</italic> gene.</p>

        <p><italic>Baf1</italic> is an intronless gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) with a coding sequence of 1026 bp, highly enriched in GC (75%). The predicted protein sequence of 341 amino acids carries an AT-hook DNA binding motif at the N terminus, centered around a Gly-Arg-Pro tripeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aravind and Landsman, 1998</xref>), and a PPC domain, also identified as Domain of Unknown Function 296 (DUF296), in the middle portion of the protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). The combination of a single AT-hook motif and the PPC domain is a feature observed only in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujimoto et al., 2004</xref>). AT-hook motif-containing proteins are generally considered a class of transcriptional regulators that bind to AT-rich regions and make chromatin more accessible to other transcription factors, possibly through changes in the structure of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aravind and Landsman, 1998</xref>). An obvious prerequisite for transcriptional regulator activity is the nuclear localization of the encoded protein. To test for nuclear localization, we transiently expressed a BAF1-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion using a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) cells, and, as expected, we observed a specific nuclear localization for the BAF1-YFP fusion protein but not for YFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>), consistent with BAF1&#x2019;s predicted role as a transcriptional regulator.</p>

        <p>The AT-hook genes differ considerably in GC content. The eudicot sequences are 47.9 to 61.2% GC, whereas the monocot sequences (mostly grasses) are 68.4 to 76.7% GC. In the conserved AT-hook motif, the bias is even more striking, with the eudicots being 48.1 to 62.7% GC, whereas the monocots are 69.9 to 78.8% GC. <italic>Baf1</italic> itself is near the higher end of the monocot range, with 75.7% GC over the entire gene and 78.2% in the AT-hook motif. The effect of this bias on gene function is unknown, but it does affect the ability to recover an accurate phylogeny. In analyses of the AT-hook motif alone, the eudicot and grass sequences formed separate clades, corresponding to low and high GC content respectively. Broader taxonomic sampling, in particular the addition of more nongrass monocots, will likely make it easier to recover the phylogenetic signal.</p>
        <p>The <italic>Baf1</italic> (Zm <italic>Baf1A</italic>) genomic region shows good synteny with rice, sorghum, and <italic>Brachypodium</italic> (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure 4</ext-link> online), consistent with the results from the phylogenetic analysis. Immediately downstream of <italic>Baf1</italic> is an endopeptidase (A) followed by a phosphopyruvate hydratase (B), and immediately upstream of <italic>Baf1</italic> is a microtubule motor activity protein (C) whose positions are conserved on rice chromosome 6, <italic>Brachypodium</italic> chromosome 1, sorghum chromosome 10, and maize chromosome 9, but are lacking from maize chromosome 6 (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure 4</ext-link> online). It therefore seems that <italic>GRMZM5G88968</italic> (Zm <italic>Baf1B</italic>), the duplicate of Zm <italic>Baf1A</italic>, is the only remaining open reading frame from the corresponding region of chromosome 6 following the maize-tripsacum duplication event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaut and Doebley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bomblies and Doebley, 2005</xref>).</p>

        <title>BAF1 Can Form Homodimers and Can Heterodimerize with Different AT-Hook Motif-Containing Proteins</title>
        <p>To identify potential interacting partners of the BAF1 protein and understand its mode of action further, we used a yeast two-hybrid system. We screened an immature ear (2 mm) cDNA library in a <italic>pAD-GAL4</italic> vector using a <italic>BD:Baf1</italic> fusion construct truncated at the C terminus but containing the full AT-hook and PPC domains (<italic>Baf1&#x394;762</italic>). This was necessary to prevent the self-activation of the reporter genes observed with the full-length <italic>Baf1</italic> construct, attributable to the C terminus of the BAF1 protein. We assayed the interactions using two reporter gene systems, growth on His-lacking media and &#x3B2;-galactosidase activity. This screen identified a short list of potential interactors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Notably, two of the recovered clones encoded other members of the AT-hook protein family. Both clones encoded truncated fusion proteins that were missing the N terminus. We focused on one of these (<italic>GRMZM2G029096</italic>), also expressed in developing inflorescences, and cloned the corresponding full-length coding sequence; we named it <italic>Baf1r-1</italic> (<italic>Baf1related-1</italic>). <italic>Baf1r-1</italic> is also an intronless gene and encodes a protein of 351 amino acids with a domain organization similar to that of <italic>Baf1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), although the overall sequence identity of BAF1 and BAF1R-1 proteins is only 52%. This clone was used to confirm the interaction with BAF1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also confirmed the interaction of BAF1 and BAF1R-1 with an in vitro pull-down assay, using a glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-BAF1 fusion protein bound to glutathione-coupled beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, we detected interaction of BAF1 with itself in both yeast (BD:BAF1&#x394;762/AD:BAF1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and in vitro pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These data suggest that AT-hook and PPC domain-containing proteins can form homo- and heterodimers in vitro and in vivo, a previously unrecognized property of this family of transcriptional regulators.</p>

        <p>We investigated the domain of <italic>Baf1</italic> expression using mRNA in situ hybridizations during maize vegetative and reproductive development. At the seedling stage, <italic>Baf1</italic> expression was observed in a narrow domain adaxial to the developing axillary meristems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, arrowhead). After the switch to reproductive development, we observed a similar narrow domain of expression in both immature tassels and ears. The expression domain seemed to mark a boundary between the newly forming spikelet-pair meristems and the inflorescence meristems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>) and in spikelet-pair meristems borne on tassel branch meristems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In later stages, a similar expression pattern was observed in developing spikelets in positions where new floral meristems were forming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), and it remained adaxial to the lower floral meristems during floral organ development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, arrowheads).</p>

        <p>To determine if the expression of <italic>Baf1</italic> coincides with the suppressed bract domain, we used as a marker the maize <italic>FILAMENTOUS FLOWER</italic> ortholog <italic>Zyb15</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Juarez et al., 2004</xref>), whose expression is observed in initiating suppressed bracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whipple et al., 2010</xref>). Consecutive sections of the flanks of inflorescence meristems hybridized with both <italic>Baf1</italic> and <italic>Zyb15</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6G</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6L</xref>) show that the expression domains of the two genes do not overlap, but rather they seem expressed initially in adjacent regions, with <italic>Baf1</italic> expressed above the suppressed bract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6H</xref>). Since maize inflorescence development is acropetal, <italic>Baf1</italic> expression is also observed below the suppressed bract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6H</xref> and P1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6J</xref>), as an axillary meristem primordium starts to develop (P2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6J</xref>). The distinct domains of expression for <italic>Baf1</italic> and <italic>Zyb15</italic> are clearly observable in later stages of meristem development, such as in developing spikelet meristems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6L</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that initial <italic>Baf1</italic> expression marks a specific boundary domain flanking the apical meristem and that this domain remains adaxial to both the suppressed bract and the meristem primordium as it continues to develop.</p>

        <p>The very specific domain of expression of <italic>Baf1</italic> was remarkably similar to the expression pattern of the bHLH transcription factor <italic>Ba1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallavotti et al., 2004</xref>). Consecutive sections of wild-type ear inflorescences hybridized with either <italic>Baf1</italic> or <italic>Ba1</italic> probes showed that the two genes are indeed expressed in overlapping domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). We next evaluated <italic>ba1-ref</italic> <italic>baf1-ref</italic> double mutant plants and found an extremely severe phenotype: barren tassels with neither branches nor spikelets and no ears. These phenotypes result from the lack of axillary meristem initiation at every stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ritter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallavotti et al., 2004</xref>).

        <p>To verify if <italic>Baf1</italic> could regulate the expression of <italic>Ba1</italic>, we performed quantitative RT-PCR of <italic>Ba1</italic> on pools of homozygous and heterozygous <italic>baf1-IL</italic> seedlings in the original A619 background. In these samples, although <italic>Ba1</italic> expression was not completely lost, it was severely reduced (approximately eightfold) compared with wild-type seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). To assess the extent of meristem development in these seedlings, we used in situ hybridizations of the <italic>Knotted1</italic> (<italic>Kn1</italic>) gene, which encodes a homeobox transcription factor expressed in meristematic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jackson et al., 1994</xref>). It is clear from these in situ hybridizations that axillary meristems are not initiated in mutant seedlings but are visible in wild-type samples (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure 5</ext-link> online).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Here, we report the isolation of BAF1, a putative transcriptional regulator required for the formation of maize ears. Phylogenetic and genomic analyses estimate that clear coorthologs of <italic>Baf1</italic> are restricted to grasses, although four <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes are possibly close relatives, despite lack of strong Bayesian support. We show that <italic>Baf1</italic> functions in the early steps of axillary meristem initiation as a boundary determinant for the axillary meristem primordium, and, accordingly, <italic>baf1</italic> mutants show fusion defects between the newly developing axillary meristems and the leaf or bract axils.

        <title><italic>Baf1</italic> Reveals a New Function and Properties of AT-Hook DNA Binding Proteins in Plants</title>
        <p><italic>Baf1</italic> encodes a putative transcriptional regulator containing an AT-hook DNA binding motif and a PPC domain of unknown function (DUF296). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, these combined features are found in 29 members of the AT-hook type DNA binding family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsushita et al., 2007</xref>), whereas AT-hook motifs alone, in single or multiple copies, can be found in proteins from a wide range of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aravind and Landsman, 1998</xref>). AT-hook transcriptional regulators are generally considered architectural transcriptional regulators, making chromatin more accessible for DNA binding, possibly through structural changes. They are predicted to bind AT-rich DNA regions, such as the matrix attachment regions, putative structural components of nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morisawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujimoto et al., 2004</xref>). Several AT-hook DNA binding proteins with a similar domain organization to BAF1 have been described in plants. They were mainly identified by yeast one-hybrid or activation-tagging screens and have been implicated in jasmonate signaling, gibberellin biosynthesis, senescence, and hypocotyl elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vom Endt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsushita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Street et al., 2008</xref>). Recently <italic>GIANT KILLER</italic> (<italic>GIK</italic>), another AT-hook transcriptional regulator, was identified as a target of the floral homeotic protein AGAMOUS. <italic>GIK</italic> has been proposed to regulate the expression of multiple genes involved in patterning and differentiation of floral organs, and its activity is associated with epigenetic modifications at the targeted genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ng et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>The <italic>baf1</italic> mutants are distinct from other <italic>barren</italic> mutants in that they are still capable of forming tassels with most branches, spikelets, and florets, whereas they often fail to produce ears. Another mutation that also affects ear formation without affecting tassel fertility is <italic>ba2</italic>, first reported, together with <italic>ba1</italic>, in the 1920s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmeyr, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neuffer et al., 1997</xref>). No <italic>Ba2</italic> gene has been isolated yet, and the original mutation might have been lost from mutant collections (see Methods). <italic>baf1</italic> loss-of-function mutants show defects in the formation of axillary meristems, a previously unknown role for AT-hook transcriptional regulators. The main defects of <italic>baf1</italic> mutants are observed in the first axillary meristems formed, during both vegetative and reproductive development (i.e., the axillary meristems formed at the axils of leaves after germination [from which ears eventually develop] and the branch meristems in the tassel, which in <italic>baf1</italic> give rise to smaller branches fused at the base to the central spike and borne in an upright position). However, we also observed that the tassel branches of <italic>baf1</italic> mutants have a higher percentage of solitary versus paired spikelets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that some spikelet-pair meristems fail to initiate one of the spikelet meristems. The formation of single spikelets correlates with a reduction in tassel branch size observed in <italic>baf1</italic> mutants, whereas in the central spike, spikelet meristems form normal paired spikelets. The formation of floral meristems is not visibly affected in tassels and ears, suggesting that other factors may act redundantly with <italic>Baf1</italic> or that the role of <italic>Baf1</italic> is restricted mainly to vegetative axillary meristems and branch meristems. <italic>Baf1</italic> is expressed in developing spikelet and floral meristems as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that redundancy with similar AT-hook transcriptional regulators may exist. At least one other gene belongs to the BAF1 clade and several others are found in clades ii and iii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We also showed that the <italic>Baf1r-1</italic>, which belongs to a different clade (Clade B), encodes a protein capable of interaction with BAF1 in yeast and in vitro assays. Together with the ability of BAF1 proteins to homodimerize, these data suggest that homo- and heterodimerization of AT-hook/PPC domain-containing proteins, a previously uncharacterized feature of this family of transcriptional regulators, may play a role in their mechanism of action and that other genes related to <italic>Baf1</italic> may work in the same pathway.</p>

        <title><italic>Baf1</italic> Is Conserved in Grasses</title>
        <p>Zm BAF1 appears to be a protein without much similarity to other known proteins in the gene family. Orthologous genes were identified in sorghum, rice, and <italic>Brachypodium</italic>, but the BAF1 clade might have been produced by a duplication event prior to the divergence of Commelinid monocots based on the position of the ginger sequence <italic>DY363105</italic> in Clade A-iii, and BAF1 has no immediate relatives in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We find weak evidence, with little support (0.63 posterior probability), for clade A that includes the BAF1 clade and the groups that we have called eudicot grade, and clades ii and iii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Based on the phylogenetic analysis, it is therefore unclear if any of the four <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes belonging to the eudicot grade is a possible ortholog of <italic>Baf1</italic>. Based on the lack of a <italic>Baf1</italic> duplicate in sorghum and rice and the partial synteny among noncoding regions of maize chromosomes 6 and 9, the <italic>Baf1</italic> paralog in maize (<italic>GRMZM5G88968/Baf1B</italic>) appears to have been produced by the maize tetraploidy event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaut and Doebley, 1997</xref>).</p>
        <p>The AT-hook proteins are at least as old as the land plants and have radiated extensively among the seed plants. It appears that the ancestral land plant may have had a single gene but that duplications occurred independently in the bryophytes, lycophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. All studied angiosperms have multiple members of this gene family; the phylogeny indicates that at least four loci were present in the ancestor of the flowering plants. Additional duplications in the grasses are consistent with the well-documented whole-genome duplication at the origin of the grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paterson et al., 2004</xref>) and the additional duplication in the history of <italic>Zea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaut and Doebley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bomblies and Doebley, 2005</xref>). As additional monocot sequences become available in the databases, it is likely that the details of gene duplications in this gene family will become clearer and many of the relationships will become better supported.</p>
        <p>A microarray analysis of the rice mutant <italic>lax1</italic> uncovered an AT-hook DNA binding protein called <italic>b-2</italic> whose expression was downregulated in the <italic>lax1</italic> mutant compared with wild-type rice plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Furutani et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>LAX1</italic> encodes a bHLH transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komatsu et al., 2003</xref>), the ortholog of the maize gene <italic>Ba1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallavotti et al., 2004</xref>). In situ hybridizations of <italic>b-2</italic> in developing panicles showed that <italic>b-2</italic> had a similar expression pattern to <italic>LAX1.</italic> Furthermore, <italic>b-2</italic> was expressed in <italic>lax</italic> mutant panicles, therefore suggesting that <italic>b-2</italic> did not function downstream of <italic>LAX1</italic> and that the observed downregulation of <italic>b-2</italic> expression was likely a secondary effect of the inherent lack of axillary meristems in <italic>lax1</italic> mutants. <italic>b-2</italic> maps in the region syntenic to where the <italic>Baf1</italic> locus is located (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure 4</ext-link> online), corresponds to <italic>Os06g04540</italic>, and is likely the rice ortholog of <italic>Baf1</italic>. Therefore, we can infer that, in accordance with the phylogenetic analysis, the function of <italic>Baf1</italic> may be conserved between rice and maize and likely in all grasses.</p>

        <title>The Role of <italic>Baf1</italic> in Axillary Meristem Initiation</title>
        <p>During reproductive development in maize, a major role in phytomers is played by axillary meristems, at the expense of both leaf development and internode elongation. In situ hybridizations of <italic>Baf1</italic> and <italic>Zyb15</italic>, a marker for suppressed bract primordia, showed that <italic>Baf1</italic> expression marks a domain adaxial to the <italic>Zyb15</italic> expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6H</xref>). Based on our analysis, <italic>Zyb15</italic> expression seems to precede that of <italic>Baf1</italic> during reproductive development (P1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6J</xref>), and during vegetative development, leaf primordia are clearly visible before <italic>Baf1</italic> is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The specification of a boundary domain at the flanks of the inflorescence meristem represents the first discernible step in the pathway for axillary meristem initiation, marked by the expression of both <italic>Baf1</italic> and <italic>Ba1</italic>, whose expression patterns overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). This boundary domain remains distinct from the domain of the suppressed bract primordium and remains adaxial to axillary meristems throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6L</xref>). The fusion defects observed in early axillary meristem development of <italic>baf1</italic> mutants also indicate that organ fusion occurs between the primordia formed by axillary meristems (the prophyll and the first basal internode) and the internode above it. Therefore, <italic>Baf1</italic> seems to function in establishing a boundary region required for axillary meristem initiation and separating the emerging axillary buds from the stem internode. In <italic>baf1</italic> mutants, this boundary is partially or totally lost, and, as a consequence, axillary meristems either do not form, as observed during vegetative development, or remain smaller if they do form, as noticed in tassel branch meristems.</p>
        <p>Several mutations are known to make maize plants earless, such as <italic>ba1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ritter et al., 2002</xref>) and loss-of-function alleles of <italic>Kn1</italic>, a homeobox gene whose product specifies meristematic cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kerstetter et al., 1997</xref>). In both mutants though, the tassel is also affected, making it an almost or completely sterile inflorescence. <italic>Ba1</italic> and <italic>Baf1</italic> are expressed in an overlapping narrow domain, whereas <italic>Kn1</italic> is expressed in the meristematic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jackson et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>ba1 baf1</italic> double mutant plants fail to form axillary meristems, and the suppressed bracts are as visible as they are in <italic>ba1</italic> single mutant tassels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Baf1</italic> functions upstream of <italic>Ba1</italic> in the initiation of axillary meristems. In situ hybridizations revealing normal <italic>Baf1</italic> expression in <italic>ba1</italic> mutant tassels and quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridizations showing a dramatic decrease in <italic>Ba1</italic> expression in <italic>baf1</italic> mutant seedlings support the hypothesis that <italic>Baf1</italic> function precedes <italic>Ba1</italic> in the establishment of new meristems or that it is required for maintaining <italic>Ba1</italic> expression. <italic>Ba1</italic> expression is in turn needed for the development of a new meristem primordium that will subsequently express <italic>Kn1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ritter et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In <italic>baf1</italic> mutant tassels, <italic>Ba1</italic> expression levels are not affected (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure 6</ext-link> online). As mentioned above, it is possible that in the tassel other AT-hook transcriptional regulators function redundantly with BAF1, and this could explain why <italic>baf1</italic> tassels are not similar to <italic>ba1</italic> mutant tassels. It remains unclear if <italic>Baf1</italic> directly regulates <italic>Ba1</italic> expression in vegetative axillary meristems or alternatively if it is required for the correct establishment of the domain where <italic>Ba1</italic> is subsequently expressed. In <italic>baf1-IL</italic> seedlings, which lack visible axillary meristems (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure 5</ext-link> online), <italic>Ba1</italic> is still expressed, though at significantly lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This implicates other unknown factors in the regulation of <italic>Ba1</italic> expression and also suggests that a threshold level of <italic>Ba1</italic> expression is necessary for the initiation and development of these axillary meristems. The correct timing of expression, as well as stochastic changes in levels of <italic>Ba1</italic> influenced by the environment, may determine whether or not <italic>baf1</italic> mutants initiate axillary meristems in the axils of leaves during vegetative development and, hence, whether ears subsequently develop. Furthermore, the suppression of the earless phenotype in outcrosses of the <italic>baf1-IL</italic> allele with <italic>tb1</italic> also suggests the presence of genetic modifiers of the <italic>baf1</italic> phenotype that may influence the ability to form ears, a common occurrence also in <italic>kn1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kerstetter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vollbrecht et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Our analysis shows that <italic>Baf1</italic> likely functions in specifying a boundary domain where a new population of stem cells is established that will give rise to an axillary meristem. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, genes with a similar function have been previously reported, such as <italic>RAX1</italic>, <italic>CUC1,2,3</italic>, <italic>LOF1,2</italic>, and <italic>LAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greb et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hibara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Our phylogenetic analysis did not rule out the possibility that a functional ortholog may exist in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, whereas it clearly identified orthologous genes in the grass family. Therefore, it remains to be determined if other transcriptional regulators related to <italic>Baf1</italic> play the same role in dicotyledonous species or if in grasses AT-hook and bHLH transcriptional regulators, such as <italic>Ba1</italic>, have acquired a predominant role in the establishment of new axillary meristems throughout development.</p>

        <p>The <italic>baf1-ref</italic> allele was obtained from the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center (913E baf1). The <italic>baf1-IL</italic> allele was generated by EMS mutagenesis by the Maize Inflorescence Architecture Project and corresponds to 03IL-A619TR-1051 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gremlin1.gdcb.iastate.edu/MIP/EMSphenotypeDB/index.php">http://gremlin1.gdcb.iastate.edu/MIP/EMSphenotypeDB/index.php</ext-link>). In the course of this project, we realized that the <italic>ba2</italic> mutant seeds deposited at the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center (218E ba2 and 217H ba2 v4) carry the same mutation as the <italic>baf1-ref</italic> allele. Marty Sachs and Phil Stinard at the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center investigated the pedigree records dating back to the 1950s and provided a hypothesis on what it might have happened. When the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center moved to Illinois in 1953, it received a stock called ba2 from Cornell University that had been part of the COOP's collection since 1937. The same year it also received a baf1 stock from Charles R. Burnham. They were grown next to each other in the first crop in Illinois in 1953 and crossed together. When grown in 1954, none of the progeny from the cross were barren, suggesting that the two mutant loci were different. The baf1 stock that Burnham provided was originally called ba-s. At that time, Burnham's handwriting was difficult to read, and it is possible therefore that Burnham actually sent his <italic>ba-s</italic> mutant in 1953 and it was misread as ba2. From then on, only the Burnham ba2 was propagated and the original <italic>ba2</italic> allele, which maps on chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmeyr, 1931</xref>), was therefore lost. Burnham separately sent his <italic>ba-s</italic> to a maize geneticist and this was subsequently called <italic>baf1</italic> and listed separately at the Maize COOP from the ba2 stock.</p>
        <p>For double mutant analysis, the <italic>tb1</italic> (117D) mutant was obtained from the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center. The <italic>ba1-ref</italic> allele used for <italic>ba1 baf1</italic> double mutant analysis is in a mixed genetic background (A188/W23) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ritter et al., 2002</xref>). For <italic>tb1 baf1-IL</italic> double mutants, the <italic>baf1-IL</italic> mutation was genotyped by sequencing. For <italic>ba1 baf1-ref</italic> double mutants, <italic>baf1-ref</italic> was genotyped using the following primers: forward, 5&#x2032;-TCGTCGATCGGGACGCACCAGCTC-3&#x2032;; and reverse 5&#x2032;-AAGGAGGAGGGATTGAGTCTTAGC-3&#x2032;.</p>
        <p>For tassel measurements, we considered tassel length as the distance from the base of the first tassel branch to the tip of the tassel and branch number as the number of branches with more than two spikelets. Branch length and size were calculated on the four longest branches of any tassel. Branch size was calculated by hand-sectioning the base of the tassel branches, putting the sections on slides, and taking pictures under a light microscope. Measurements on these sections were taken using ImageJ software. Given that the branch sections are not perfectly round, but more often elliptical in shape, we measured the longest distance between two opposite margins. Student&#x2019;s <italic>t</italic> test was used to calculate statistical significance.</p>

        <title>Expression Analysis and Histology</title>
        <p>For in situ hybridizations, we used an antisense mRNA probe including the 3&#x2032;-untranslated region of the <italic>Baf1</italic> gene (primers: forward, 5&#x2032;-GCCCCGTACTGATCGATCGAATC-3&#x2032;; reverse, 5&#x2032;-AGACTGACATGCAGTTCCAAGC-3&#x2032;). The <italic>Ba1</italic>, <italic>Zyb15</italic>, and <italic>Kn1</italic> in situ probes and the protocol used for hybridization have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallavotti et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whipple et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in a Roche LightCycler apparatus using the QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The reactions were run on two pools of <italic>baf1/baf1</italic> and on two pools of +/<italic>baf1</italic> seedlings (three plants per pool). The seedling samples, without roots, were stripped of most leaves to minimize the dilution of mRNAs from meristematic cells. <italic>Ba1</italic> expression levels represent the average of seven technical replicates of two distinct biological pools relative to actin. Primers for RT-PCR of <italic>Rel2</italic> were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallavotti et al., 2010</xref>). For quantitative RT-PCR of both <italic>Ba1</italic> and <italic>Actin</italic>, we used the following primers: <italic>Ba1</italic> forward, 5&#x2032;-GTGGTTGGTGACAACGAGGT-3&#x2032;, and <italic>Ba1</italic> reverse, 5&#x2032;-CGAGGAAGATGCAAGAAGCAG-3&#x2032;; <italic>Actin</italic> forward, 5&#x2032;-CTCATGCTATTCTCCGTTTGG-3&#x2032;, and <italic>Actin</italic> reverse, 5&#x2032;-TCAGGCATCTCGTAGCTCTTC-3&#x2032;.</p>
        <p>For transient expression in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>), <italic>Baf1</italic> and <italic>YFP</italic> were amplified using the following primers: <italic>Baf1</italic> forward, 5&#x2032;-ATTCTAGAATGGATCCCGTGGCGGCGGCGCAC-3&#x2032;, and <italic>Baf1</italic> reverse, 5&#x2032;-AT<underline>GGATCC</underline>AGCAGCTTCGTACGGGGCGACGCGGC-3&#x2032;; <italic>YFP</italic> forward, 5&#x2032;-GAAGCTGCT<underline>GGATCC</underline>ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG-3&#x2032;, and <italic>YFP</italic> reverse 5&#x2032;-ATGAATTCCTAGGCCCCAGCGGCCGCAGCA-3&#x2032;. A <italic>Baf1-YFP</italic> PCR fusion product of the two fragments was subsequently obtained using <italic>Baf1</italic> forward and <italic>YFP</italic> reverse primers. This product was cloned in the pGREEN0229 vector, carrying a 35S promoter, using <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction sites. <italic>YFP</italic> was amplified (primers are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Table 2</ext-link> online) and cloned in the same vector using <italic>Sma</italic>I and <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction enzyme sites. <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> transformed with either <italic>BAF1-YFP</italic> or <italic>YFP</italic> constructs was washed in 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and infiltrated in tobacco leaves using a 3-mL syringe (without needle).

        <p>The procedure used for fixing tissue for staining of both tassel and ear sections has also been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallavotti et al., 2010</xref>). Toulidine Blue staining was performed by immersing the slides in a 0.1% solution (in 0.6% boric acid) for 2 min, followed by rinsing in water, whereas Safranin O-Alcian Blue (0.01 to 0.05% in 0.1 M Na acetate, pH 5.0) staining was carried out for 20 min, followed by rinsing in water. After drying, stained slides were mounted using Permount (Fisher).</p>

For targeted yeast two-hybrid assays, the prey genes were cloned in the pAD-GAL4 2.1 vector (Stratagene; primers and restriction sites are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Table 2</ext-link> online).</p>
        <p>For pull-down assays, we used the MagneGST pull-down system from Promega, and we followed the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Incubations of in vitro&#x2013;transcribed/translated products with GST fusion proteins bound to magnetic beads were performed for 2 to 4 h rotating at 4&#xB0;C. For immunoblots, we used monoclonal anti-HA (Covance) and anti-GST (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallavotti et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Baf1</italic> was cloned in pGEX-4TK (GE Healthcare) for expressing GST-BAF1 fusion protein using the primers and restriction sites listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Table 2</ext-link> online.

        <title>Phylogenetic Analysis</title>
        <p>Using ZmBAF1 as a query sequence, other AT-hook proteins were downloaded from a variety of gene and genome databases, to give a data set of 90 sequences with the conserved AT-hook motif (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Data Set 1</ext-link> online). The domain consists of 184 aligned amino acids, or 552 nucleotides, with only a couple of one-codon gaps inserted to improve alignments. Alignments were done on translations of the nucleotide sequences using MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edgar, 2004</xref>) and then were converted back to nucleotides preserving the reading frame. Preliminary phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm as implemented in MEGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tamura et al., 2007</xref>) and a Bayesian analysis implemented in MrBayes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001</xref>), consisting of two separate runs of 10 million generations and the General Time Reversible model of evolution with invariant sites and gamma distributed rates partitioned according to codon position run on the Grethor Parallel processing cluster at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. To improve the quality of alignments to explore the evolution of the sequences in more detail, the data set was pruned successively based on the results of the preliminary phylogenetic analyses. All sequences from seed plants formed a monophyletic group (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Figure 3</ext-link> online) so the outgroup sequences from <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> and <italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic> were removed. The preliminary analysis also identified a clade consisting of divergent monocot and dicot sequences, and these were also omitted from subsequent analyses. The remaining seed plant sequences were aligned based on amino acids in MacClade 4.08 for OSX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maddison and Maddison, 2003</xref>) and then returned to nucleotide sequences for analysis (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/tpc.111.084590/DC1">Supplemental Data Set 2</ext-link> online). The final Bayesian phylogenetic analysis consisted of two separate searches of 30 million generations using flat priors and the General Time Reversible model of sequence evolution with invariant sites and gamma distributed rates partitioned according to codon position with trees being sampled every 1000 generations. At the end of the run, the first 25% of trees were removed as burn-in and clade credibility values estimated using MrBayes.</p>
