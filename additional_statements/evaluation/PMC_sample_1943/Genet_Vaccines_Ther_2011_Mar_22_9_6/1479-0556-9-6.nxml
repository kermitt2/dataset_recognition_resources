        <sec>
          <title>Materials and methods</title>
          <p>A double suicide gene system with the KDR promoter, pcDNA3-KDRp-CDglyTK, was constructed and transfected into lung cancer cell lines L9981 and NL9980, and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. The efficiency and specificity of the double suicide gene system were assayed by in vitro cellular proliferation and apoptosis, as well as in vivo xenograft studies.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>The transgenic CD and TK genes were only expressed in L9981 and NL9980 but not in HepG2 cells. Pre-treating transfected cells with 5-Fc and GCV significantly reduced proliferation, enhanced apoptosis in L9981 and NL9980 but not in HepG2 cells. The tumor formed by L9981 and NL9980 cells with the double suicide gene system was much smaller in vivo.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Tumor-specific targeting gene therapy is a widely used anti-tumor method. Regulated expression of a suicide gene with the promoters can primarily destroy tumor cells and leave the surrounding tissues undamaged. The a-fetoprotein promoter (AFP) is such a representative to activate an exogenous gene expression specifically in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has been applied to targeted gene therapy for HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Nishino et al reported an approach to selectively kill c-Myc-expressing lung cancer cells by fusing the c-Myc gene promoter with TK gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that the KDR gene is specifically expressed in the vascular endothelial cells and some tumor cells. The expression level of KDR is correlated with the renewal rate of the vascular endothelial cells. The proliferation rate of the endothelial cells in tumor tissue is 500 times faster than that of the normal endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which leads to the higher levels of KDR gene in many human tumor endothelial cells. We hypothesized that KDR promoter driven double suicide gene could be used as tumor-specific targeting approach to kill the tumor cells. A KDR promoter-driven double suicide gene (CDglyTK) expression system, pcDNA3-KDRp-CDglyTK, was constructed in the present study. Our research showed that this system could selectively reduce proliferation, enhance apoptosis, and reduce tumor formation in vivo in lung cancer cells.</p>

        <title>Construction of pcDNA3-KDRp-CDglyTK plasmid vector</title>
        <p>A 1.3 kb gene fragment encoding CD gene (Genebank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="S56903">S56903</ext-link>) and a 1.1 kb fragment encoding TK gene (Genebank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="V00470">V00470</ext-link>) were amplified from a CD and TK expressing vector pcDNA3-CDTK (a gift from the Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology of Sichuan University, China) by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The oligonucleotides CD-5' (5'-<underline>AAG CTT</underline> AGG CTA GCA ATG TCG AAT AAC GCT-3'), which introduced a Hind III site (underlined in the sequence) to the 5' end of the CD gene, and CD-3' (5'-<underline> GGA TCC</underline> TCC ACG TTT GTA ATC GAT GGC TTC-3'), which introduced a BamH I site (underlined in the sequence) to the 3' end and changed the TGA (stop codon) to GGA, were used as primers to amplify CD gene from pcDNA3-CDTK vector. The oligonucleotides TK-5' (5'-<underline> GGA TCC</underline> GGC GGG GGC GGT GGA GGA GGG GGT ATG GCT TCG TAC-3'), which introduced a BamH I site (underlined in the sequence) to the 5' end of the TK gene, and TK-3' (5'-<underline> TCT AGA</underline> TTA GTT AGC CTC CCC CAT CTC-3'), which introduced a Xba I site (underlined in the sequence) to the 3' end, were used as primers to amplify TK gene from pcDNA3-CDTK vector.</p>
        <p>A 366 bp KDR promoter fragment was cloned from A549 cell genome by PCR, containing minimum core sequence of -125 to +227 of the KDR promoter (GeneBank KDR/flk-1 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="X89776">X89776</ext-link>). The primers used were: forward primer 5'-GCT CGA GTT GTT GCT CTG GGA TGT TCT-3' with a Nrul site at the 5' end, and reverse primer 5'-GAA GCT TGT GCC GGT AGG AGA GGA TAT-3' with a Hind III site at the 3' end.</p>
        <p>The CD and TK gene fragments were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector, whose CMV promoter was replaced with KDR promoter. The nucleotide sequence for the pcDNA3-KDRp-CDglyTK vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p>

After serum starvation for 24 h, cells were treated with 5 &#x3BC;g/ml GCV, 100 &#x3BC;g/ml 5-Fc, or 5 &#x3BC;g/ml GCV + 100 &#x3BC;g/ml 5-Fc, or 0.9% sodium chloride (physiological saline) as a control group. Then the cells were incubated with fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT at the indicated time points. After 4-h incubation, medium was removed and purple blue sediment was dissolved in 150 &#x3BC;l DMSO.

        <title>Intrinsic expression of KDR in tumor cells</title>
        <p>In order to select out suitable tumor cells as model to test the selective killing efficacy of the double suicide genes under regulation of the KDR promoter, KDR expression was studied by RT-PCR and Western blotting in human large cell lung cancer cell lines L9981 and NL9980 and a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. A human umbilical vein endothelial cell line ECV304, which is supposed to express intrinsic KDR, was used as a positive control. mRNA and protein expression of KDR was detected in NL9980 and L9981 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). There was no KDR expression in HepG2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

However, 5-Fc and/or GCV treatment significantly decreased the cellular survival rate in L9981 and NL9980 cells with CD and TK transgenes.

      <p>In the present study, the KDR promoter-driven CD/TK double suicide gene system was successfully constructed. CD/TK gene expression was only detected in human large cell lung cancer cell lines L9981 and NL9980, which expressed intrinsic KDR, but not in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, which did not express intrinsic KDR. The present data also indicate that KDR promoter is regulated by its natural elements. The core regulatory region between -225 bp to 125 bp of the KDR promoter has been successfully cloned and testified by DNA sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Because of its specific expression in the tumor tissues, KDR promoter has been used to express target genes in some tumors. Modlich et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] used the KDR promoter to regulate TNF-&#x3B1; expression in tumor vascular endothelial cells (TVEC). Szary et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] successfully introduced a KDR promoter-regulated CD gene into murine sarcoma cells and human ovarian cancer cell line OVP10. A KDR promoter-driven CD/TK plasmid pcDNA3-KDRp-CDglyTK was constructed and introduced into the lung cancer cell lines with different KDR expressing levels. The stable expression of CDglyTK in the cell lines with higher intrinsic KDR levels indicates that the cloned KDR promoter was regulated by its intrinsic regulatory elements.</p>
      <p>In vitro experiments showed that the double suicide genes were functionally only in the L9981 and NL9980 cells. The treatment with 5-FC, GCV, or 5-FC+GCV showed no notable difference in the cell survival rate among HepG2, HepG2-vector, and HepG2-CDglyTK cells, which indicates the transgenic CDglyTK genes did not express double suicide gene because of the inactivity of KDR promoter in the HepG2 cells. On the other hand, single pro-drug treatment with either 5-FC or GCV significantly decreased cell survival rate in the CDglyTK transgenic groups in the KDR-expressing cell lines (L9981 and NL9980). Previous results indicated higher killing efficiency of the combined suicide gene system than any single system, due to the synergetic cytotoxicity of the combined gene system. Rogulski et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] reported that the CDglyTK-transducted neuroglioma cells were easier to be extinguished. The radiation sensitivity of the CDglyTK-expressing cells was notably high, reaching 2.44 times of the CD/5-FC single system and 3.90 times of the BVdU/5-FC single system. The increased pro-drug sensitivity, due to the effect of double suicide genes, can overcome the insensitivity of the HSV-TK/pro-drug resistant cells in the recurrent tumors. At the same time, it can reduce the dosage of pro-drug treatment and increase the radiation sensitivity of the target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The combined treatment of 5-FC and GCV resulted in a lower cell survival rate than single pro-drug treatment, which indicates the enhanced killing effect of the combined pro-drug treatment.</p>
      <p>Our in vivo xenograft experiments showed tumors from the lung cancer cells were significantly suppressed by the systemic treatment of pro-drug 5-FC and GCV. 5-FC and GCV showed higher suppressing effect on the tumors from the highly metastatic human large cell lung cancer cell line L9981 than that of less metastatic human lung cell line NL9980, while no effect was shown on the tumors from the hepatic carcinoma HepG2 cells. These results further confirmed the efficacy of the double suicide genes under regulation by the KDR promoter.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate the double suicide genes regulated by the KDR promoter can be specifically expressed in the KDR-expressing cells such as human lung cancer cells. 5-FC and GCV treatment shows satisfactory drug synergism as the killing effect of the combined 5-FC+GCV treatment is significantly higher than that of any single pro-drug treatment.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Our work suggests that the KDR promoter is capable of regulating a double suicide gene system in human lung cancer cells, thus providing laboratory evidence to develop a gene therapy approach against various cancers. Our research indicates that expression of CDglyTK genes under the control of KDR promotor represents a new strategy for effective gene therapy of tumors expressing intrinsic KDR.</p>
