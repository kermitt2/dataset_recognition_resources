      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> (BP) and <italic>B. mallei</italic> (BM) are closely related gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacteria which cause life-threatening melioidosis in human and glanders in horse, respectively. Our laboratory has previously generated and characterized more than 100 mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against BP and BM, according to in vitro and in vivo assay. In this study, 3 MAbs (BP7 10B11, BP7 2C6, and BP1 7F7) were selected to develop into chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies (cMAbs) against BP and/or BM. For the stable production of cMAbs, we constructed 4 major different vector systems with a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) amplification marker, and optimized transfection/selection conditions in mammalian host cells with the single-gene and/or double-gene expression system. These 3 cMAbs were stably produced by the DHFR double mutant Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO)-DG44 cells. By ELISA and Western blot analysis using whole bacterial antigens treated by heat (65&#xB0;C/90 min), sodium periodate, and proteinase K, the cMAb BP7 10B11 (cMAb CK1) reacted with glycoproteins (34, 38, 48 kDa in BP; 28, 38, 48 kDa in BM). The cMAb BP7 2C6 (cMAb CK2) recognized surface-capsule antigens with molecular sizes of 38 to 52 kDa, and 200 kDa in BM. The cMAb CK2 was weakly reactive to 14&#x223C;28, 200 kDa antigens in BP. The cMAb BP1 7F7 (cMAb CK3) reacted with lipopolysaccharides (38&#x223C;52 kDa in BP; 38&#x223C;60 kDa in <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>). Western blot results with the outer surface antigens of the 3 Burkholderia species were consistent with results with the whole Burkholderia cell antigens, suggesting that these immunodominant antigens reacting with the 3 cMAbs were primarily present on the outer surface of the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species. These 3 cMAbs would be useful for analyzing the role of the major outer surface antigens in Burkholderia infection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> (BP), the causative agent of melioidosis, is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, motile bacillus commonly found in the soil and stagnant waters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Leelarasamee1">[1]</xref>. BP infection is often due to either direct inoculation into wounds and skin abrasions or inhalation of contaminated materials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Chaowagul1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Leelarasamee2">[3]</xref>. The clinical manifestation ranges from subclinical to acute localized, acute septicemic and chronic forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Cheng1">[4]</xref>. Recently, BP has been recognized as a major cause of community-acquired septicemia, resulting in significant mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Howe1">[5]</xref>. Moreover, numerous studies revealed that BP could be intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. Despite therapeutic regimens with certain antibiotics, the mortality rate of melioidosis remains very high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-White1">[6]</xref>. <italic>B. mallei</italic> (BM), a host-adapted pathogen that does not normally persist in nature, causes glanders in horse. Some studies indicated that BM is highly infectious in humans by aerosol route <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Howe2">[7]</xref>. Thus, there are true concerns that BP and BM may be used as biological warfare agents (BWA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Wiersinga1">[8]</xref>. No effective vaccines or therapeutics of either melioidosis or glanders currently exist.</p>
      <p>The only countermeasure providing a state of &#x201C;immediate immunity&#x201D; against these biowarfare agents is neutralizing antibodies. Unlike vaccines, antibodies can confer passive protection regardless of the immune status of the infected host. In comparison with antimicrobial therapy, antibody therapy against many potential BWAs such as <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>, and <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> is significantly promising due to high specific function and low toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Casadevall1">[9]</xref>. Currently, specific antibodies that protect against infections of highly pathogenic BP and BM that military or civilian populations may encounter in biological warfares have not been developed. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) comparisons of the genomes indicated that the genes conserved between BP and BM are 99% identical at the nucleotide level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Altschul1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Rogul1">[11]</xref>. The extremely high homology among BP, BM, and <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> (BT) would allow for only small window of antigenic difference among these species of the Burkholderia bacteria. The main antigenic differences between BP and BM appeared to reside only in the O-capsular polysaccharides (PS) moiety of their lipopolysaccharides (LPS) structure. However, some BM strains might lack the O-PS moiety in their LPS structure. On the otherhand, different strains of BP were found to posses LPS with different chemical structure of the O-PS (O-PS I and O-PS II) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Reckseidler1">[12]</xref>. Serological studies also revealed BP and BM are antigenically closely related <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Cravitz1">[13]</xref>. Thus, it would be extremely difficult to obtain a single MAb that can both recognize all different clinical isolates of BP and at the same time differentiate them from those of BM as well as BT. Development of MAbs that can differentiate between all strains of BP and BM from other non-pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species has been very challenging due to the close homology. However, if the MAbs developed were to be used for therapeutic and not diagnostic purposes, MAbs that react strongly to both BP and BM are highly desirable. Furthermore, to design therapeutic antibodies for human diseases, it is important that the selected MAbs react not only to the particular strain of bacteria used as the immunogen, but to as many different strains and clinical isolates of these two closely related species of bacterial pathogens as possible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Brekke1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Vaughan1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our previous studies, total 108 mouse MAbs against BP and/or BM have been generated, characterized, and categorized into 8 groups (from A to H) on their binding patterns against a panel of 11 species of the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> bacteria and the reactive antigens [PS, LPS, and (glyco)proteins] recognized by each MAb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Feng1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Zou1">[17]</xref>. Most importantly, many of these MAbs showed good protective efficacy against both pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> bacteria by an <italic>in vitro</italic> opsonic assay using differentiated HL-60 cells as phagocytes and <italic>in vivo</italic> protective efficacy of selected MAbs against intranasal challenge of BP and BM in mice. When compared individually, both anti-PS and anti-LPS MAbs performed better in mouse protection than the anti-glycoprotein MAbs. Some of these MAbs could potentially be developed into useful therapeutics in treating the devastating diseases caused by BP and BM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Zhang1">[18]</xref>. Other investigators also showed that the intranasal challenge with a sub-lethal dose of the bacteria has shown that MAbs against PS, LPS, and glycoproteins of BP and/or BM significantly reduce lethality of infections in mice. However, these MAbs fail to achieve full protection, especially with high dose challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Jones1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Trevio1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Development of high-performance cMAbs which could be used as therapeutics in exposed individuals is urgently needed to fill the current gap in defense against BWAs. In this study, three major surface antigen (glycoprotein, PS, and LPS)-reactive MAbs (BP7 10B11, BP7 2C6, and BP1 7F7) against BP and/or BM were selected to further develop chimeric MAbs (cMAbs) for human therapeutics. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop superactive MAbs that can be used as therapeutics against BM and BP infections. Humanization of the target MAbs could minimize possible side effects when used as human therapeutics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Chan1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Reff1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, the chimerization of these 3 MAbs against BP and/or BM is an initial step in the development of MAb-based therapeutics.</p>
      <p>The utilization of bicistronic retroviral expression vectors containing the gene of interest and an amplifiable marker gene has been shown as an effective method in obtaining stable cell lines that express high levels of the cMAb of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Bianchi1">[23]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Lucas1">[25]</xref>. However, experience with the use of such vectors in high level expression of cMAbs is currently limited. In this study, to obtain sufficient quantities of cMAbs, we established a series of technology to develop cell lines producing of neutralizing cMAbs against BP and/or BM. This include (i) construction of four major different mammalian expression vector systems with a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) amplification marker, (ii) optimization of transfection/selection conditions in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells and other common mammalian host cells with the single-gene (heavy or light chain) vectors and double-gene vector (both heavy and light chain in the vector) system, (iii) stable cMAb production by CHO-DG44 cells, and (iv) affinity purification. These techniques are useful for the development of stable cMAbs against targeted BWA for therapeutic purposes.</p>

        <title>Construction of expression vectors with a DHFR amplifiable marker</title>
        <p>To obtain high level expression constructs we modified the pIRES (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) vector containing two multiple cloning sites (MCS) A and B that allows expression of two genes of interest. Briefly, the PCR-amplified DHFR gene (564 bp) from mouse cDNA pools was synthesized by a specific primer set (forward primer with a <italic>Sal</italic> I site: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x2032;-GCTG C<underline>GTCGAC</underline>CATCATGGTTCGACCATTGAACTGC-3&#x2032;</named-content>; reverse primer with a <italic>Not</italic> I site: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x2032;-GAACTTGA<underline>GCGGCCGC</underline>AAGCATCTTCTTGTTAGTC-3&#x2032;</named-content>). The DHFR gene (595 bp) was cloned into the PCR Blunt II-TOPO plasmid using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced. To make the pIRES-DHFR vector system, the DHFR gene digested with <italic>Sal</italic> I and <italic>Not</italic> I was inserted into MCS-B site separated from MCS-A by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence (581 bp) in the pIRES vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

        <p>To generate single-gene vector [pIRES-H(L)-DHFR] systems, mouse variable regions of the heavy and light chains were amplified by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted from the 3 selected hybridoma clones (BP7 10B11, BP7 2C6, and BP1 7F7) (5&#xD7;10<sup>6</sup> cells each (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019867-t001">Table 1</xref>) by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instruction. For cDNA synthesis, total cellular RNA (2 &#xB5;g) was reverse transcribed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Kim2">[26]</xref>. For PCR, the cDNA (2 &#xB5;l) was amplified in a 50-&#xB5;l reaction mixture containing 1&#xD7; PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 0.4 &#xB5;M (each) primer mixture combinations with homology to mouse heavy and light chain [For the V<sub>H</sub> chain: one set of forward-reverse primer mixture (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.); For the V<sub>L</sub> chain: 6 forward primer and 4 reverse primer mixtures (GE Healthcare)] in a DNA thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA). To reduce nonspecific priming, all PCRs were performed by the hot-start method as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Kim2">[26]</xref>. To identify the consensus sequences of each variable gene, the target PCR products (V<sub>H</sub>: 351 bp; V<sub>L</sub>: 324 bp) were directly cloned into the PCR4 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and their variable sequences were determined by multiple sequence alignments with mouse antibody sequence data. To introduce the chimeric heavy or light chains into the MCS-A in the pIRES-DHFR plasmid, the human constant regions of both chains (HcG1: 990 bp; HcK: 324 bp) were also amplified from human cDNA pools using the designed primer sets (HcG1-F: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x2032;-GCCTCCACCAAGGGCCCATCGG-3&#x2032;</named-content> and HcG1-R: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x2032;-TTTfoACCCGGAGACA GGGAGAGGC-3&#x2032;</named-content>; HcK-F: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x2032;-CGAACTGTGGCTGCACCATCTG-3&#x2032;</named-content> and HcK-R: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x2032;-CTAACACT CTCCCCTGTTGAAGC-3&#x2032;</named-content>). After the sequences of all PCR-amplified products were confirmed, the full-length chimeric heavy (light) chains were assembled by the overlapping PCR technique. A freshly prepared full-length chimeric heavy (light) chain was transformed into the DH5&#x3B1; competent cells (Invitrogen) and sequences of the plasmid DNAs prepared from more than 10 different clones were confirmed.</p>

        <p>To determine the optimum plasmid DNA concentration and most favorable host cells for the transient expression of cMAbs using the pIRES-H(L) DHFR system, different amounts of the combined plasmid DNAs (5, 10, 20, and 40 &#xB5;g) at different molar ratios (H&#x2236;L&#x200A;=&#x200A;1&#x2236;1, 1&#x2236;2, 1&#x2236;4, 2&#x2236;1, 4&#x2236;1) in a 10-cm culture dish, and 8 common mammalian cells (CHO-K1, CHO-DG44, 293T, COS-7, BHK-21, SP2, P3&#xD7;36, and IM-9) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019867-t002">Table 2</xref>) were used to optimize transfection conditions using either the lipofectamine (LF)-2000 or the LF-LTX reagent (Invitrogen). Two days prior to scheduled transfection, the cells were seeded at 15 ml in a 10-cm dish at a density of 5&#xD7;10<sup>5</sup> cell/ml in culture media containing 10% dFBS (Invitrogen). For each culture dish to be transfected, the plasmid DNAs (5, 10, 20, and 40 &#xB5;g) at different molar ratios (H&#x2236;L&#x200A;=&#x200A;1&#x2236;1, 1&#x2236;2, 1&#x2236;4, 2&#x2236;1, and 4&#x2236;1) were diluted into 800 &#xB5;l of Opti-MEM I without serum. In a separate tube, 80 &#xB5;l of LF-2000 or LF-LTX with 10 &#xB5;l of PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) were diluted into 720 &#xB5;l Opti-MEM I medium and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The diluted DNAs were combined with the diluted LF-2000 or LF-LTX reagent, incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow DNA-LF reagent complexes to form. After adding additional 6 ml Opti-MEM I medium to DNA-lipofectamine complexes (&#x223C;1,600 &#xB5;l), the tubes were mixed gently, and plated onto the 10-cm culture dish prepared. The cells were incubated at 37&#xB0;C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 6 h. Six hours post-stimulation with the DNA-LF complex in the Opti-MEM I medium, the cells were washed once with PBS (137 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2.7 mM KCl, and 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> [pH 7.2]), and changed with the regular culture medium containing 10% dFBS. The cells were incubated at 37&#xB0;C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for additional 16 h to recover from any cytotoxicity from lipofectamine reagents or plasmid DNA itself freshly prepared from <italic>E. coli</italic>. After 16-h recovery with the regular medium supplemented with 10% dFBS, the media was replaced with the serum-free culture medium. After 72-h incubation, the culture supernatants were harvested, and the binding properties and cMAb levels were examined at each condition.</p>

        <title>Stable expression of three cMAbs</title>
        <p>To develop cell lines producing high levels of 3 cMAbs (CK1, CK2, and CK3), the DHFR gene-deficient CHO-DG44 cells obtained from Dr. Larry Chasin (Columbia University) were propagated in &#x3B1;-MEM with nucleosides and deoxynucleosides (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dFBS (Invitrogen). Two days before transfection schedule, the cells were trypsinized and seeded at 15 ml in a 10-cm culture dish at a density of 5&#xD7;10<sup>5</sup> cell/ml in &#x3B1;-MEM media containing 10% dFBS without antibiotics, so that they were 90&#x2013;95% confluent on the day of transfection. For each culture dish to be transfected, the plasmid DNAs (10 &#xB5;g each) [H&#x2236;L molar ratio&#x200A;=&#x200A;1&#x2236;1 for pIRES-H(L)-DHFR] into 800 &#xB5;l of Opti-MEM I without serum were diluted. In a separate tube, 80 &#xB5;l of LF-LTX with 10 &#xB5;l of PLUS reagent was diluted into 720 &#xB5;l Opti-MEM I medium and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The diluted DNAs were combined with diluted LF-LTX reagent and incubated at room temperature for 25 min to allow DNA-lipofectamine reagent complexes to form. After adding an additional 6 ml Opti-MEM I medium to DNA-lipofectamine complexes (1,610 &#xB5;l), the dishes were mixed gently, and incubated at 37&#xB0;C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for a total of 6 h. Twenty four hours post-transfection, the media was removed, washed once with PBS, and changed with the DHFR-selection media (&#x3B1;-MEM without nucleosides and deoxynucleosides) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dFBS until they were ready to split. Stable CHO-DG44 cell clones producing cMAbs against BP or BM were identified by ELISA, isolated by using cloning cylinders, and amplified in culture media with increased levels of selective agent methotrexate (MTX, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). The stable cell lines expressing high levels of antibodies were selected and re-tested for their binding affinity against BP. The selected stable cell clones were frozen for future large-scale production use.</p>

The cMAb CK3 purification yield was investigated utilizing an affinity chromatography resin, a HiTrap rProtein A-Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare). In brief, samples were loaded and eluted at slow flow rates ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 ml/min. After direct loading of culture supernatant (&#x223C;1 L), the column was washed with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and eluted in 100 mM glycine buffer (pH 3.0). The pH of the elution was immediately neutralized to pH 7.0 using 1 M Tris buffer (pH 10.0). The pooled cMAb CK3 fraction no. 1-4 (1 ml/tube) was concentrated and dialyzed in a Slide-A-Lyzer, MWCO 10K (Thermo Scientific). The cMAb CK3 concentration was measured by the modified human IgG1 ELISA, stored at &#x2212;20&#xB0;C for further use to examine any changes of their binding to specific Burkholderia bacterial antigens and their physical properties during humanization process from the original mouse MAb BP1 7F7.</p>

        <title>Establishment of mammalian expression systems</title>
        <p>The three MAbs BP7 10B11, BP7 2C6, and BP1 7F7 were selected for chimeric engineering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Dinnis1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Werner1">[31]</xref> based on our previous studies on binding specificity, relative antibody ranking, in vitro opsonic activity, and mouse protection against BP and/or BM. To obtain high level expression constructs, we modified the bicistronic pIRES vector by introducing respective DNAs of chimeric heavy (light) chains (H1&#x223C;H3; L1&#x223C;L3) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019867-t001">Table 1</xref>) into the multiple cloning site (MCS)-A. Into the MCS-B site, separated from the MCS-A by an IRES sequence, the DHFR gene was inserted to generate the pIRES-DHFR vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Recently, a new development in cell transfection technology through the DHFR amplification allows the highly efficient transfection of mammalian cells relevant for production of neutralizing cMAbs against BP and/or BM infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The key challenges in the development of stable cell lines able to produce cMAbs are summarized in the schematic chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
        <p>To introduce the chimeric heavy or light chains into the MCS-A in the pIRES-DHFR plasmid, each chimeric fragment (mVH1&#x223C;3+HcG1 and mVL1&#x223C;3+HcK) of the 3 cMAbs CK1, CK2, and CK3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019867-t001">Table 1</xref>) was assembled by the overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Orlandi1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Walls1">[33]</xref> and sequenced. Multiple sequences of each chimeric chain were aligned by FRs, CDRs, junction between mouse variable gene and human constant genes (HcG1 or HcK) indicated on the basis of charge difference of amino acids in each chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The exact junctions of FR4 and human constant regions in each chimeric chain were pinpointed. Amino acid sequence homology data showed 89.6% sequence identity and 93.6% sequence similarity in these 3 V<sub>H</sub> genes originating from the three different hybridoma clones and 82.9% sequence identity and 89.9% sequence similarity in the three V&#x3BA; chains.</p>
        <p>To establish a series of technology for production of stable cMAbs and to evaluate which type of expression vector gives us a maximum performance for cMAb production, four major different expression systems with a DHFR amplification marker were generated by re-engineering the pIRES-DHFR vector. Overall, 6 vectors (4 single-gene vectors pIRES-H(L)-DHFR and p2A-H(L)-DHFR, and 2 double-gene vectors (pH-Fu-2A-L-DHFR and pIRES-L-H-DHFR)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) were constructed to examine their performance. In brief, the bicistronic pIRES-H(L)-DHFR system allows translation of two consecutive open reading frames from the same messenger RNA due to the IRES element between the two transgenes. Recently, other investigators have reported that a gene transcribed upstream of the IRES is expressed strongly whereas a gene placed downstream is expressed at lower levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Chinnasamy1">[34]</xref>. Since the cMAb production using the pIRES-H(L)-DHFR system might have some limitations- their size and variability in expression of two genes (cMAb and DHFR), we introduced the respective DNAs of chimeric heavy (light) chains into only MCS-A, not MCS-B of the pIRES-DHFR vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Since the self-processing, FMDV-2A sequence (APVKQTLNFDLLKLAGDVESNPGP: 72 bp) is small sized compared to the internal promoter sequence with a CMV promoter enhancer (740 bp) or IRES sequence (581 bp), the 2A mediated co-expression strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Fang1">[35]</xref> using the p2A-H(L)-DHFR vectors may be significantly improved over the approach using the IRES system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The main difference between the single gene vectors and the double-gene vectors (pH-Fu-2A-L-DHFR and pIRES-L-H-DHFR) is that the amplifiable DHFR gene of both double-gene vectors is contained in the neomycin cassette, not in the MCS-B. In the pH-Fu2A-L-DHFR plasmid, the furin cleavage sequence (RAKR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Ryan1">[27]</xref> between the chimeric heavy chain and the 2A sequence was added to eliminate potential any adverse effects that might be caused by having a 2A peptide residue on our cMAbs due to incomplete cleavage of 2A-mediated heavy chain, which might lead to a significant decrease of cMAb production levels.</p>
        <p>Another double-gene vector system (pIRES-L-H-DHFR) contains IRES sequences between the junctions of light (at MCS-A) and heavy (at MCS-B) chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The unique restriction sites between the junctions in all eight vectors, sequences for synthetic leader and Kozak (except for the pH-Fu2A-L-DHFR vector) were also included to facilitate the vector engineering for future use of any drug candidates such as recombinant vaccines or proteins. Although these vector systems offer many unique qualities and advantages, the three single-gene vector systems were basically used for cotransfection of the two vectors (heavy and light chain) into the mammalian host cells, while the two double-gene vectors were used for single gene transfer.</p>

To further develop into the stable production of 3 cMAbs, not transient production, the CHO double deletion mutant (dhfr<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/dhfr<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) CHO-DG44 cells were transfected using a LF-LTX containing the PLUS reagent at a high cell density (more than 90% confluent in a 10-cm culture dish). The best results in transfection efficiency (60&#x2013;90%) and positive selection through a step-wise DHFR amplification process were obtained, suggesting that the LF-LTX reagent is less toxic to the cells than the LF-2000 reagent, and the use of highly confluent cells in the culture dish had better chance to recover 16 h post-transfection due to close contact of adjacent cells in a 10 cm-culture dish. After more than 30 positive clones were identified by ELISA and cultured in a DHFR selective medium containing 0.005 &#xB5;M MTX, the top 5 highest producers were further selected for the next amplification step after regaining their polygonal morphology (2&#x2013;3 weeks). Although the concentration of MTX in our initial plan was expected to increase from 0.005 &#xB5;M to 80 &#xB5;M (4 times increase in each step), we found that the longer-incubation periods at high dose of MTX levels (&gt;64 &#xB5;M) resulted in decreased cMAb production level due to slowed growth rates. Therefore, these three cMAb producing stable clones were amplified only until 2 &#xB5;M MTX levels for increase of cell growth rate and reduction of cell cytotoxicity in the final products.</p>

        <p>Third, to examine the binding property of 3 cMAbs (cMAbs CK1, CK2, and CK3) produced by transfectoma CHO-DG44 cells using the pIRES-H(L)-DHFR vector system, the undiluted 3-day culture supernatant without DHFR amplification was titrated by ELISA using the heat-killed BP antigen. The result indicated that the cMAb CK3 showed a strong binding activity to BP over cMAbs CK1 and CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The master seed cells were further incubated for 14 days in DHFR selection medium [(&#x3B1;-MEM without added nucleosides and dialyzed fetal bovine serum (dFBS)] to isolate the highest producers using cloning cylinders before entering the amplification process by MTX.</p>
        <p>We also compared the binding property of the affinity-purified cMAb CK3 with the original mouse MAb BP1 7F7 by adjusting to the same concentration starting with 5 &#xB5;g/ml. The binding affinity between the MAb CK3 and the MAb BP1 7F7 was not significantly changed from the dilutions 1&#x2236;1 to 1&#x2236;160, thereafter the slope of the cMAb CK3 titration curve was slightly dropped compared to the binding curve of MAb BP1 7F7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). This slight loss of binding activity to the BP antigen may be due to the differences in antibody assembly and post-translational modification between two host cells (CHO-K1 and hybridoma) during the chimerization process from the original mouse hybridoma BP1 7F7.</p>

Overall, the use of bicistronic pIRES-H(L)-DHFR expression vectors, containing the gene of either chimeric heavy or light chain upstream of the DHFR amplifiable marker, was effective in obtaining high levels of the transient cMAb produced by using CHO-K1 cells. The production levels (1,049 ng/ml) of a bicistronic vector based on 2A sequence was &#x223C;1.5 times greater than that (694 ng/ml) of an IRES based vector.</p>
        <p>For purification and purity analysis of cMAb CK3, the pooled CK3 supernatant samples (&#x223C;1 L) were purified by the &#xC4;KTAprime plus using an affinity chromatography column (HiTrap rProtein A-FF). The cMAb CK3 chromatogram consisted of the binding, flow-through, and elution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019867-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The pooled cMAb fractions were dialyzed and purification yields were evaluated by the modified human IgG1 ELISA. The purity of cMAb CK3 was analyzed by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Analysis by ELISA and gel electrophoresis showed that cMAb CK3 was recovered at purity and final yield of 92&#x2013;96% from the HiTrap rProtein A-FF column. The &#xC4;KTAprime was operated by slow flow-rate (0.25&#x2013;0.5 ml/min) and pH of binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) for successful purification of cMAb CK3. Since the purity of cMAb obtained from HiTrap rProtein A-FF column was high, the ability to withstand high column pressures and nearly 95% recovery of the original supernatant antibody made a HiTrap rProtein A-FF column well suited as an initial capture step without a further polishing step. These results also indicated that cMAb CK3 was appropriately produced by CHO-DG44 cells through our expression systems and were heterodimeric form with a right size Fc tail necessary for binding to protein A column.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we developed a series of technology for production of stable cMAbs against BP and/or BM by CHO-DG44 cells using the DHFR expression systems. Overall, we have generated six mammalian expression vectors, incorporating IRES and FMDV-2A sequences that efficiently mediated the (co)expression of two transgenes in multiple mammalian cell types. These vectors are useful for various cMAb productions in the laboratory. In our present study, the utilization of either bicistronic pIRES-H(L)-DHFR or p2A-H(L)-DHFR vectors has been shown as the most effective method in obtaining stable cell lines that express high levels of the cMAbs. Therefore, two systems utilizing single gene vectors might be more relevant than other systems for maintaining intact binding properites after chimerization and higher level production of cMAbs by mammalian host cells.</p>
      <p>Recent progresses in antibody engineering, cell transfection technology, and expression systems containing selective markers allow highly efficient transfection of mammalian cells for the fast production of neutralizing cMAbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Werner1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Wurm1">[38]</xref> The efficient transfection of cells not only facilitates stable cell clone generation, but also allows true preclinical development of cMAb production in transiently transfected cells for small-scale production. Using the CHO double deletion mutant (dhfr<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/dhfr<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) CHO-DG44 cells, we were able to amplify the chimeric antibody gene associated with the amplifiable DHFR gene by systematic increases of MTX in medium without added nucleosides. For the development of therapeutic cMAbs, it is critical to obtain a thoroughly guaranteed stable clone derived from a single clone producing stable cMAbs. Using the bicistronic pIRES-H(L)-DHFR vector system, approximately six months is usually required due to selection/amplification and adaptation to serum-free conditions. By using cloning cylinders and applying a less toxic lipofectamine (LF-LTX) reagent to the highly confluent CHO-DG44 cells (&#x223C;90%), we significantly reduced the time and increased the probability of finding the positive clone. Although tedious time is still required for these procedures, the end-results obtained through the selection/amplification processes allow us to use stable cMAbs.</p>
      <p>Considering the production levels and binding properties of cMAbs produced by transient transfection using 8 different mammalian host cells, the cell lines (CHO-K1, COS-7, 293T, and BHK-21) were more productive than other mammalian cells tested. However, for large-scale production, the CHO-DG44 cells are only available in obtaining stable clones due to the property of deficient DHFR genes within host chromosomes. Thus, we can continuously amplify the target antibody gene up to certain MTX levels without causing any cell damage. When producing therapeutic cMAb, the CHO-DG44 cell line makes an ideal cell factory since their cMAbs largely correspond to genuine human MAbs with similar patterns of post-translational modification and glycosylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Wurm1">[38]</xref>. The availability of commercial media of high quality for cell culture is an additional factor that would support large-scale production of cMAbs in this cell line.</p>
      <p>Recent studies of the role of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> outer surface antigens in mouse protection by using MAbs post-nasal or lethal challenges of pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species indicate that the Burkholderia surface antigens (OMPs, LPS, and capsular polysaccharide) are potential protective antigenic targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Bondi1">[39]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Plesa1">[43]</xref>. Our ELISA data and Western blot analysis, using the treated antigens (heat, sodium periodate, proteinase K, and 0.02% SDS) and OMPs antigens of 3 Burkholderia species, revealed each cMAb's reactivity to bacterial cell components and immunodominant antigens with different molecular size from 21 kDa to 65 kDa. Briefly, due to different antigen reactivities (cMAb CK1: surface glycoproteins of BP and BM; cMAb CK2: capsular polysaccharide antigens of BP and BM; cMAb CK3: surface LPS and/or lipoproteins (LP) of BP and BT), these 3 cMAbs would be useful for neutralizing BP and/or BM infection and studying the role of the major surface antigens in Burkholderia infection. Furthermore, since LP is a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, LP in culture supernatants of growing Burkholderia cells may induce pathologic changes associated with infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019867-Zhang2">[44]</xref>. Our previous studies of in vitro neutralization and antibody ranking using the original mouse MAbs suggest that the surface epitopes (with little cross-reactivity to other Burkholderia bacteria) recognized by these 3 cMAbs are highly specific to target <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species. Thus, these cross-reactive antigens in 3 <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species may be useful for determining potential vaccine targets against Burkholderia infection.</p>
