      <abstract>
        <p>Lithium, a drug that has long been used to treat bipolar disorder and some other human pathogenesis, has recently been shown to stimulate neural precursor growth. However, the involved mechanism is not clear. Here, we show that lithium induces proliferation but not survival of neural precursor cells. Mechanistic studies suggest that the effect of lithium mainly involved activation of the transcription factor NF-AT and specific induction of a subset of proliferation-related genes. While NF-AT inactivation by specific inhibition of its upstream activator calcineurin antagonized the effect of lithium on the proliferation of neural precursor cells, specific inhibition of the NF-AT inhibitor GSK-3&#x3B2;, similar to lithium treatment, promoted neural precursor cell proliferation. One important function of lithium appeared to increase inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x3B2;, leading to GSK-3&#x3B2; suppression and subsequent NF-AT activation. Moreover, lithium-induced proliferation of neural precursor cells was independent of its role in inositol depletion. These findings not only provide mechanistic insights into the clinical effects of lithium, but also suggest an alternative therapeutic strategy for bipolar disorder and other neural diseases by targeting the non-canonical GSK-3&#x3B2;-NF-AT signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Lithium is a monovalent cation belonging to the group of alkali metals. It has been the reference standard medication for acute and prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder/manic depressive illness, a brain disorder in which normal moods alternate with both depression and mania, which is recognized by the World Health Organization as a leading debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder that affects about 1.3% of both sexes globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent animal studies suggest a beneficial effect of lithium on other central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as brain ischemia, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Currently, two major targets of lithium are suggested responsible for the actions of lithium on bipolar disorder and other CNS diseases: inositol depletion and glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x3B2; (GSK-3&#x3B2;) inhibition. Lithium inhibits inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (IPPase) and inositol monophosphate phosphatase (IMPase), two enzymes critical for the recycling and de novo synthesis of inositol, thereby leading to inositol depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Lithium may also reduce inositol uptake from outside of cells by down-regulating expression of inositol transporter gene such as sodium-myo-inositol transporter 1 (SMIT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In support of the concept that inositol depletion may be the way that lithium works in bipolar disorder and other CNS diseases, inositol depletion mice due to the <italic>smit1 </italic>gene homozygous deletion behave similarly to lithium-treated animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, much higher inositol depletion is required for achievement of the behavioral effects in mice than that achieved by lithium administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting that the inositol depletion role of lithium is not responsible for all its actions.</p>
      <p>More and more studies suggest that inhibition of GSK-3&#x3B2; may be a more relevant target for the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and the therapeutic action of lithium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For example, loss of GSK-3 function in Xenopus and Dictyostelium results in developmental abnormalities that are phenocopied by lithium treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. More importantly, mice with heterozygous loss of GSK-3&#x3B2; genotype exhibit behavioral and molecular changes similar to those induced by lithium treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and transgenic mice overexpressing GSK-3&#x3B2; show hyperactivity resembling that observed in the manic phase of bipolar disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In agreement with the <italic>in vivo </italic>role of GSK-3&#x3B2; in inhibition of neural precursor cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], GSK-3&#x3B2; inhibition is also involved in lithium-mediated proliferation of human NT2 neural-like precursor cells and proliferation recovery of dexamethasone-treated adult rat dentate gyrus-derived neural precursor cells (ADP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>GSK-3&#x3B2; is a serine/threonine kinase that has diverse functions in various cellular activities in many cell types, including glycogen synthesis, cell survival and cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Unlike most protein kinases, GSK-3&#x3B2; is constitutively active and its activity is down-regulated by upstream signals through inhibitory phosphorylation. The most important and well-known target of GSK-3&#x3B2; is the &#x3B2;-catenin transcriptional coactivator. Active GSK-3&#x3B2; can directly phosphorylate &#x3B2;-catenin, resulting in ubiquitination-medaited proteasomal degradation of &#x3B2;-catenin. The NF-AT transcription factor has been found to be another target of GSK-3&#x3B2;, at least in T cells and neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Different from the &#x3B2;-catenin phosphorylation, NF-AT phosphorylation mediated by GSK-3&#x3B2; promotes its export from the nucleus, therefore terminating NF-AT-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The NF-AT activation is delicately counterbalanced by GSK-3&#x3B2; and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin. GSK-3&#x3B2; phosphorylates NF-AT, leading to its nuclear export and transcriptional inactivation, while Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin dephosphorylates NF-AT, leading to its nuclear import and transcriptional activation.</p>
      <p>Currently, the two models have not been well reconciled yet. Part of the reasons might be due to that the outcome of lithium administration may be cell type dependent. In the present study, we showed that lithium promoted proliferation but not survival of neural precursor cells. Consistently, we found that lithium specifically induced expression of a subset of cell proliferation-related genes in these cells. Whereas addition of inositol had no effect on lithium-induced neural precursor cell growth, inhibition of GSK-3&#x3B2; showed an effect similar to lithium. On the other hand, inhibition of calcineurin/NF-AT antagonized the effect of lithium on neural precursor cell proliferation. Although lithium administration was able to increase inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x3B2;, it failed to stabilize &#x3B2;-catenin. These studies suggested that targeting GSK-3&#x3B2; for NF-AT activation is the main mechanism for lithium-induced neural precursor cell proliferation.</p>

        <title>Lithium increases numbers of neural precursor cells in culture</title>
        <p>Given its clinical benefit on manic depressive illness and its potential application for other central nervous system diseases, we investigated the effects of lithium on growth of neural precursor cell line RG3.6 cells as well as primary neural precursor cells isolated from neonatal mouse and rat. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment resulted in a dose-dependent cell number increase in RG3.6 cell cultures with the maximal effect at 3 mM. In contrast, 3 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) treatment had no obvious effect on RG3.6 cell numbers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), indicating that the lithium, but not the chloride, in LiCl was responsible for the cell number increase. Similarly, lithium significantly induced cell number increase in mouse and rat primary neural precursor cell cultures (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These results suggested a general role of lithium in cell number increase of various neural precursor cells.</p>

        <title>Lithium has no significant effect on the survival of neural precursor cells</title>
        <p>To investigate the mechanism by which lithium induces cell number increase of neural precursor cells, we analyzed the effect of lithium on survival of RG3.6 cells. The RG3.6 cell line was originally derived from GFP transgenic rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. When these cells die, they lose their GFP signal, as revealed by the mutual exclusiveness of GFP signal with the red fluorescent signal due to propidium iodide staining, a hallmark of dead cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Therefore, GFP expression in these cells provides a convenient marker for survival cells. Accordingly, we performed flow cytometry assay to compare the percentage of GFP-expressing live cells in RG3.6 cell cultures treated with 3 mM LiCl or control NaCl. Surprisingly, LiCl treatment failed to increase the ratio of survival cells, compared to NaCl treatment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Nevertheless, this result indicated that lithium has no significant effect on neural precursor cell survival, excluding the possible role of cell survival in lithium-induced cell number increase.</p>

        <title>Lithium promotes proliferation of neural precursor cells</title>
        <p>The results above further suggest that lithium may promote proliferation of neural precursor cells, which accounts for the lithium-induced cell number increase. To verify this, we measured cell proliferation by performing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay to label dividing cells. In the NaCl control group, about 23% neural precursor cells were BrdU positive after 4 hours of BrdU incubation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, the ratio of the BrdU positive cells was increased to 38% in the group treated with LiCl. Together, these results suggest that lithium stimulates proliferation, but not survival, of neural precursor cells.</p>

        <title>Lithium induces a subset of cell proliferation-related genes</title>
        <p>To further confirm our finding above, we performed microarray analysis to compare gene expression profiles in RG3.6 neural precursor cells treated with LiCl or control NaCl. Consistent with our proliferation assay, many cell proliferation-related genes were significantly up-regulated upon lithium treatment (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Notably, none of the known neurotrophic factors, such as NGF&#x3B2;, NGF&#x3B3;, NT-3, BDNF, CNTF, GDNF and LIF, were induced by lithium. Our real-time PCR using primary neural precursor cells further demonstrated that lithium had no significant effect on RNA expression of NGF&#x3B2;, NGF&#x3B3;, NT-3, CNTF, GDNF and LIF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Thus, lithium-induced increase in neural precursor cell numbers is mainly due to lithium-induced stimulation of cell proliferation rather than improvement of cell survival.</p>

        <title>Myo-inositol has no significant effect on lithium-induced proliferation of neural precursor cells</title>
        <p>Since inositol depletion contributes to lithium action in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], we examined whether addition of extracellular inositol blocks lithium-induced neural precursor cell growth. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, up to 10 mM of myo-inositol did not significantly affect growth of RG3.6 cells during 5 days incubation. More importantly, the same concentration of myo-inositol failed to inhibit lithium-induced cell number increase. This result suggests that inositol depletion is not the mechanism by which lithium promotes neural precursor cell proliferation.</p>

        <title>Lithium-induced neural precursor cell proliferation involves GSK-3&#x3B2; suppression</title>
        <p>Lithium has been shown to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x3B2; (GSK-3&#x3B2;) activity in many types of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, we examined whether GSK-3&#x3B2; inhibition is involved in lithium-induced proliferation of neural precursor cells. First, we examined whether lithium inhibits GSK-3&#x3B2; in neural precursor cells by detecting phosphorylation levels of GSK-3&#x3B2; at serine 9 in the presence of LiCl or NaCl. Phosphorylation of this serine is one important mechanism leading to GSK-3&#x3B2; inactivation. Consistent with its inhibitory role in other cell types, lithium also significantly increased phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x3B2; at serine 9 in RG3.6 cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). This result suggests that lithium suppresses GSK-3&#x3B2; activity in neural precursor cells.</p>

            <p><bold>Lithium inhibited GSK-3&#x3B2; in RG3.6 cells, and other GSK3&#x3B2; inhibitors mimicked lithium's effect on RG3.6 cell growth</bold>. (A) RG3.6 cells were grown in culture medium containing 3 mM LiCl or 3 mM control NaCl for 3 days, followed by western blotting analysis on P-GSK-3&#x3B2; (Ser9) and GSK-3&#x3B2; expression. (B) The blotting results in A were analyzed using ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>, 1997-2007), and the ratio of P-GSK-3&#x3B2; was plotted. (C) Other GSK-3&#x3B2; inhibitors, like lithium, also increased cell numbers in RG3.6 cell cultures. Cell count analysis was performed on RG3.6 cells grown for 6 days in culture medium without or with 3 mM LiCl, 0.1% DMSO, 5 &#x3BC;M SB216763, or 25 &#x3BC;M SB415286 (n = 6 for each condition). DMSO was used as the vehicle control for SB216763 and SB415286, since these two drugs were dissolved in DMSO. The data represent mean &#xB1; standard error, and significance was determined with Bonferroni/Dunn post hoc analysis following ANOVA.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Next, we tested the potential effects of other GSK-3&#x3B2; inhibitors on the proliferation of neural precursor cells. If lithium-mediated suppression of GSK-3&#x3B2; plays a role in neural precursor cell proliferation, other GSK-3&#x3B2; inhibitors should have the effects similar to lithium on RG3.6 cell growth. For this purpose, we utilized two potent and specific GSK-3 inhibitors, SB216763 and SB415286. Indeed, both SB216763 and SB415286 treatments resulted in significant cell number increase, just like lithium treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of GSK-3&#x3B2; contributes to lithium-induced neural precursor cell proliferation.</p>

        <title>Calcineurin/NF-AT inhibitor cyclosporin A antagonizes lithium-induced neural precursor cell proliferation</title>
        <p>To find GSK-3&#x3B2; downstream signaling involved in lithium-induced neural precursor cell proliferation, we analyzed &#x3B2;-catenin and NF-AT: two most important targets of GSK-3&#x3B2;. GSK-3&#x3B2; inhibits both &#x3B2;-catenin and NF-AT by directly phosphorylating them. While GSK-3&#x3B2;-mediated NF-AT phosphorylation results in its retention in the cytoplasm, &#x3B2;-catenin phosphorylation by GSK-3&#x3B2; leads to its proteasomal degradation. Thus, we examined the effect of lithium treatment on &#x3B2;-catenin protein stability and NF-AT subcellular expression in RG3.6 neural precursor cells. As revealed by our immunoblotting assays, lithium treatment had no obvious effect on &#x3B2;-catenin protein expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) but significantly increased nuclear translocation of NF-AT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Consistently, the lithium treatment also led to the transcriptional activation of NF-AT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). This result suggests that NF-AT, but not &#x3B2;-catenin, may be involved in lithium-induced proliferation of neural precursor cells.</p>

        <p>GSK-3&#x3B2;-mediated inhibition of NF-AT is counterbalanced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calcineurin dephosphorylates and thereby activates NF-AT. To investigate the role of NF-AT in lithium-induced proliferation of neural precursor cells, we took advantage of cyclosporin A (CsA), a specific inhibitor of the NF-AT activator calcineurin. If NF-AT activation is involved in lithium-induced proliferation of neural precursor cells, CsA should suppress the effect of lithium. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>, CsA alone, at doses of up to 1 &#x3BC;M, did not significantly affect RG3.6 cell growth, although at doses of 10 &#x3BC;M or above it significantly reduced RG3.6 cell numbers. More interestingly, CsA, even at the low dose (1 &#x3BC;M) that does not affect cell growth, completely abolished lithium-induced RG3.6 cell number increase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). Together, these results suggest that lithium-induced proliferation of neural precursor cells involves GSK-3&#x3B2; suppression and subsequent NF-AT activation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Lithium is a standard medication for bipolar disorder. Recent in vitro and animal studies suggest a great potential of lithium in the treatment of other central nervous system (CNS) diseases, although the involved mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we have shown that lithium promotes growth of neural precursor cells. Lithium stimulates neural precursor cell proliferation but not their survival. Our mechanistic studies further indicate that lithium-induced neural precursor cell proliferation involves the non-canonical GSK-3&#x3B2;-NF-AT signaling, but not inositol depletion or &#x3B2;-catenin, the canonical downstream signaling of GSK-3&#x3B2;.</p>
      <p>Neurotrophic factors are well known for their roles in neuron growth. Interestingly, it has been reported that lithium induces expression of neurotrophic factors in specific regions of rodent brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], although the resource cells for the neurotrophic factors and the exact functions of their induction await investigation. One of the potential resources is neurons, because lithium increases neurotrophic factor expression in cultured cortical neurons, which is essential for neuroprotection under certain stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, lithium failed to up-regulate neurotrophic factors in neural precursor cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), suggesting that neural precursor cells are not additional resources for the survival factors. Instead, lithium significantly enhanced expression of numerous proliferation-related genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). In results consistent with the gene induction profile, lithium only promoted proliferation but not survival of neural precursor cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These data were also consistent with the fact that neurotrophic factors are not required for growth of neural precursor cells, at least in vitro. These studies together thus suggest that the effects of lithium are cell type dependent.</p>
      <p>Two different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the lithium's mood-stabilizing properties: inositol depletion and GSK-3 inhibition. However, it remains obscure how these two hypotheses are integrated. Although increasing evidence has suggested a relatively more dominant role of GSK-3 inhibition in the actions of lithium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], it seems highly plausible that inositol depletion and inhibition of GSK-3 both contribute to the therapeutic actions of lithium; because either inositol depletion or GSK-3&#x3B2; deficient animals exhibit phenotypes the same as, although similar to, those induced by lithium treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Given the important role of inositol in various signaling pathways including the GSK-3 pathway and the essential role of GSK-3 in the optimal de novo synthesis of inositol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the two different mechanisms possibly also together with other mechanisms collaboratively fine-tune animal's responses to lithium.</p>
      <p>It is likely that the relative importance of each mechanism is also context dependent. For example, insoitol depletion and GSK-3&#x3B2; inhibition are responsible for lithium-induced growth cone spread in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons and neuronal polarity of hippocampal neurons, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the hippocampal neuron polarity, collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a factor critical for specifying axon/dendrite fate by promoting neurite elongation via microtubule assembly, is the major target of GSK-3&#x3B2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our studies here suggest that lithium stimulates proliferation but not survival of neural precursor cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Interestingly, inhibition of GSK-3&#x3B2;, but not inositol depletion, is the mechanism accounting for lithium-induced cell proliferation, because lithium treatment led to GSK-3&#x3B2; inhibition and inhibition of GSK-3&#x3B2; by other GSK-3 inhibitors showed an effect similar to lithium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). On the other hand, addition of myo-inositol had no effect on lithium-induced neural precursor cell proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We have further found that NF-AT is the major downstream signaling molecule of GSK-3&#x3B2; in lithium-induced neural precursor cell proliferation, because inhibition of NF-AT reversed the effect of lithium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The effect on NF-AT seems highly specific, as lithium-mediated inhibition of GSK-3&#x3B2; failed to stabilize &#x3B2;-catenin in the same cells. Consistent with our studies, lithium also stimulates proliferation of human NT2 neural precursor cells but cannot stabilize &#x3B2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Paradoxically, lithium recovers, rather than directly increases, the proliferation of ADP rat neural precursor cells from dexamethasone-mediated inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The difference could be due to the different sources of the neural precursor cells used. NT2 and RG3.6 cell lines were embryonic as well as primary neural precursor cells we used in this study were from neonatal animals. On the other hand, ADP cells were from adult rat. Nevertheless, these studies suggest that lithium utilizes different mechanisms to achieve the same or different effect on different cells. These effects are further integrated, which will decide the final outcome of lithium administration. Thus, understanding when and where each mechanism is most effective will help to fine-tune therapeutic strategies to promote or constrain specific arms of lithium.</p>
