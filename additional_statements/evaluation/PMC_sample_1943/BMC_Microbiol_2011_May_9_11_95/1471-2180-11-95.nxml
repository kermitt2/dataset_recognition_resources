      <title>Background</title>
      <p><italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>is an intracellular facultative anaerobe Gram-negative that infects a variety of hosts, which include mammals, avians and reptiles. In human beings, <italic>S. enterica </italic>causes over 33 million cases of disease worldwide annually, which may vary from gastroenteritis and diarrhea to severe life-threatening systemic disease (typhoid fever) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The outcome of the disease depends on both the serovar of <italic>Samonella </italic>and the host susceptibility. <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium), can infect humans and animals, but causes different syndromes in each host. In humans, <italic>Salmonella </italic>produces enterocolitis, but in mice it causes a systemic illness that resembles human typhoid fever. Because of this, <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium is widely used as a model organism to study the host-pathogen interactions that contribute to the onset of the systemic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>The pathogenic strategy of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium includes penetration of the mucosal barrier, invasion of non-phagocytic cells of the intestinal mucosa and survival and replication inside macrophages of the spleen and liver during the systemic phase. The ability of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium to survive to host defense mechanisms and to cause disease has been directly linked to genes encoded in pathogenicity islands, which are large horizontally acquired regions of the chromosome. Of outstanding importance are two type three secretion systems (T3SS), which together with cognate effector proteins are essential for cell invasion, intracellular survival and, therefore, for mice colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Besides, factors encoded in the genomic backbone of <italic>Salmonella </italic>are also important for virulence in the murine model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>YqiC is a 99-residue protein of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium (UniProtKB entry K09806, gene STM 3196) which belongs to the cluster of orthologous groups 2960 (COG 2960). This COG includes 322 members (Pfam June 2010), encoded in genomes of pathogenic, non-pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria. In spite of the high conservation of this COG across bacterial species, no description of the in vivo function of any member has been reported. In this work, we carried out microbiological studies which demonstrate that YqiC is required for the pathogenesis of S. Typhimurium in the murine model, since a null mutant is highly attenuated when inoculated both orally and intraperitoneally. We also show that this protein is dispensable for cell invasion and intracellular replication in murine macrophages and human epithelial cell lines, but it is necessary for efficient growth at the mammalian host physiological temperature outside the cells. The microbiological results are complemented by biophysical and biochemical studies. These analyses demonstrate that YqiC shares properties with the recently reported BMFP from <italic>Brucella abortus </italic>(another member of the COG 2960) which include a trimeric coiled-coil structure and the ability to induce membrane fusion <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The results presented here contribute to elucidate the function of members of the COG 2960 and their biological role.</p>

        <title><italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium YqiC is a trimeric protein with a high helical content</title>
        <p>YqiC is a 99-residue protein of S. Typhimurium (UniProtKB entry K09806) which belongs to the cluster of orthologous groups 2960 (COG 2960). The bioinformatic analysis of the primary sequence of YqiC predicts a high helical content (66-77%) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.predictprotein.org">http://www.predictprotein.org</ext-link>, including two helical segments that span the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein (encompassing residues 4-43 and 49-79, respectively). Both helical segments are amphipathic but only the C-terminal one is predicted to form a coiled-coil structure <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/paircoil/paircoil.html">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/paircoil/paircoil.html</ext-link>. YqiC secondary structure was experimentally determined by its far UV circular dichroism spectrum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which showed a typical signature of an alpha helical protein. The percentage of helical structure of YqiC, estimated through the analysis of its CD spectra using K2D program (63%), agrees with the percentage of amino acids involved in the predicted N- and C-terminal alpha helices.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, we studied the oligomeric state of YqiC by chemical cross-linking and static light scattering.

Moreover, analysis of YqiC by static light scattering coupled to size exclusion chromatography showed a single homogeneous peak with a molecular mass of 40.2 kDa, in agreement with a trimeric structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p>

        <title>YiqC promotes membrane fusion in vitro</title>
        <p>As YqiC shares structural properties with BMFP, we investigated if this protein also conserves the membrane fusion activity reported for BMFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. With this aim, we measured the increase in the size and aqueous content mixing of phospholipids vesicles produced after YqiC addition. Changes in the size and aggregation state of vesicles were evaluated by turbidity measurements at 400 nm whereas the aqueous content mixing was evaluated by measuring the fluorescence of the Tb-DPA complex produced upon fusion of vesicles containing TbCl<sub>3 </sub>or DPA encapsulated in their aqueous interior phase, and the percentage of mixing was calculated as described in materials and methods. Experiments were carried out on small unilamellar vesicles composed of a mixture of DPPC and DPPA in a 75:25 molar ratio, both at acid or neutral pH. YqiC produced both a significant increase in the turbidity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and aqueous content mixing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) in the vesicle solutions, mainly at acid pH, after addition of YqiC. These results indicate that YqiC has a pH-dependent in vitro fusogenic activity.</p>

        <title>Subcellular localization of YqiC</title>
        <p>To determine the subcellular localization of YqiC, we performed a mechanical lysis fractionation procedure. A wild type <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium culture grown to late log phase was harvested by centrifugation, mechanically disrupted and fractionated by ultracentrifugation. This procedure allows for the separation of bacterial proteins into two fractions: the supernatant, which contains cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins, and the pellet fraction, which contains the inner and outer membrane proteins. Fractions were then analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-YqiC polyclonal antibody. YqiC was localized in the two fractions, although lower levels of YqiC were found in the membrane fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This result indicated that YqiC is both soluble and membrane associated inside the cell. As a control, we used an antibody against the periplasmic protein MBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which was only detected in the supernatant fraction.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of a <italic>yqiC </italic>defective strain phenotype in vitro</title>
        <p>The <italic>in vivo </italic>functions of the members of the COG 2960 are unknown. To investigate the role of YqiC protein in S. Typhimurium, we constructed an <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 null mutant in <italic>yqiC </italic>through allelic exchange. The resulting strain was named 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT. The gene <italic>yqiC </italic>is encoded divergently to the <italic>ribB </italic>gene and convergent to the <italic>glgS </italic>gene in the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium chromosome. Thus, it appears that <italic>yqiC </italic>is transcribed as a monocistronic element, and polar effects upon allelic exchange are not expected. The successful elimination of the <italic>yqiC </italic>gene was corroborated by PCR analysis and a western blot assay of cell lysates of 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT and its complemented derivative (bearing plasmid pBBR-<italic>yqiC</italic>, which encodes intact <italic>yqiC </italic>gene), using a polyclonal antibody raised against YqiC (data not shown). As a first approach to assess the effect of the mutation in the physiology of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, we tested the effect of temperature in the replication of <italic>yqiC </italic>mutant strain in LB. No difference in the growth pattern of the <italic>yqiC </italic>mutant strain compared with the WT was detected at 28&#xB0;C (average generation time 44.9 +/- 1.4). However, an increased generation time at 37&#xB0;C was observed for 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT, where the average generation time was 22.5 +/- 0.7 minutes for S. Typhimurium 14028 and 48 minutes for 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This difference in growth was enhanced when the strains were incubated at 42&#xB0;C, where the average generation time was 30.2 +/- 0.68 minutes for the WT strain and 78.9 +/- 0.7 minutes for the &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT mutant strain. At both temperatures, <italic>trans </italic>complementation with the plasmid encoding <italic>yqiC </italic>restored the wild-type growth curve pattern to 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT. These results indicate that the mutation of <italic>yqiC </italic>affects the ability of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium to replicate at physiological and high temperatures. No growth curve pattern alteration was observed for the 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT strain when incubated in M9 minimal media or acid LB (pH = 4.0) at 28&#xB0;C (data not shown), which indicates that the <italic>yqiC </italic>mutant is neither auxotrophic nor acid sensitive.</p>

        <title>Survival of the STM-<italic>yqiC</italic>mutant in cultured cells</title>
        <p>The pathogenicity of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium is critically dependent on its ability to infect and multiply into eukaryotic cells. We investigated whether the 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT strain was affected in its ability to invade and survive within cultured eukaryotic cells. J774 murine macrophages and HeLa human epithelial cell lines were infected with WT <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT strains. As the 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT strain grows defectively at physiological temperature, all strains were grown at 28&#xB0;C prior to infection.

        <title>Role <italic>of S</italic>. Typhimurim YqiC in virulence</title>
        <p>In spite of the clear effect of the <italic>yqiC </italic>mutant strain on growth at 37&#xB0;C, we did not observe any defect in colonizing and surviving inside <italic>in vitro </italic>cultured eukaryotic cells grown at 37&#xB0;C. Thus, we evaluated the virulence of the <italic>yqiC </italic>mutant in the murine model. To this aim, we performed oral infections with <italic>S</italic>.

As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, no survival was registered by day 20 in mice inoculated with WT strain. However, the <italic>yqiC </italic>mutant showed complete attenuation in virulence, as all mice infected with this strain survived along the 30-day period of the experiment. The <italic>yqiC </italic>gene provided in <italic>trans </italic>fully complemented the 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT phenotype, causing 100% mice death by day 19. In addition, we determined the LD50 of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT in mice inoculated intraperitoneally as described in <italic>Materials and methods</italic>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this work we have characterized the YqiC protein of S. Typhimurium. YqiC shares common structural and biochemical characteristics with its previously reported orthologous BMFP protein of <italic>Brucella abortus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], although these proteins share only 22% of sequence identity and <italic>Brucella spp </italic>and <italic>Salmonella </italic>are phylogenetically distant bacteria. The common structural characteristics between YqiC and BMFP, namely high alpha helix content, coiled coil C-terminal and amphipathic alpha helix N-terminus, are also predicted by bioinformatics analysis for other proteins of the COG 2960 (such as those encoded by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic>, <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti </italic>and <italic>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</italic>). This structural conservation strongly suggests a common function for the members of this COG.</p>
      <p>In addition, we demonstrated that YqiC has membrane fusogenic activity, like BMFP and other trimeric coiled-coil and/or amphipathic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This activity is higher at acidic pH. A similar fusogenic activity at low pH was observed for <italic>B. abortus </italic>BMFP (unpublished data). The fusogenic activity could be relevant as many processes that involve bacterial or host cell membrane fusion events are important for pathogenic bacteria to successfully establish host infection. In this regard, both <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and <italic>B. abortus </italic>penetrate the cell by phagocytosis, and reside within a host vacuole that rapidly undergoes acidification. This drop in the pH serves as a signal for the expression of bacterial factors that alter intracellular membrane traffic in order to set their replicative niche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The improved YqiC activity at low pH could indicate that this protein is active at the vacuolar stage of the bacterial infection. It is interesting to highlight that YqiC shares structural similarity with S. Typhimurium-SipB protein, as both are predominantly alpha helical in aqueous solution and have a coiled-coil domain involved in trimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. SipB is an effector protein essential for <italic>Salmonella </italic>invasion secreted through the SPI-1-encoded T3SS and was the first bacterial protein reported to display membrane fusogenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], however the function of this membrane fusogenic activity in the bacterial pathogenesis has not been clearly defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The activity of YqiC may be required during the interaction of <italic>Salmonella </italic>with the host cell to hijack membrane trafficking pathways. This would probably be accomplished by competitive inhibition, mimicking eukaryotic membrane fusogenic proteins, such as the SNAREs (given the structural similitude with these proteins) and inhibiting lysosomal fusion with the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuoles. Current work is addressing whether YqiC is translocated to the host cell.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the YqiC-membrane fusogenic activity could be required during the biogenesis of bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMV), which are spherical bilayered structures liberated from the outer membrane in Gram negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. OMV act as delivery vesicles for bacterial toxins into host cells, promote quorum sensing, are involved in stress response, inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion during bacterial growth within macrophages and are important constituents of the matrix of Gram-negative and mixed bacterial biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To date, the machinery that cause vesicle formation remains elusive but it may be expected that a protein with membrane fusion activity could be involved in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this regard, in spite of the lack of a signal peptide or transmembrane domains we demonstrated that YqiC can be localized both soluble and associated to membranes. This localization pattern was also observed for <italic>B. abortus </italic>BMFP (unpublished data). Subcellular localization pattern of YqiC may be in tune with its hypothetical function in biogenesis of OMV, as soluble and membrane-bound states of YqiC can be related to transient associations of this protein with the outer membrane. At this point, is interesting to note that OMV produced by <italic>Shigella flexneri </italic>contain IpaB, a SipB homologue which also displays membrane fusion activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Accordingly, many of the bacterial species conserving an YqiC homolog have been shown to generate OMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Further work is needed to investigate the possible role of YqiC in the biogenesis of OMV.</p>
      <p>The in vivo importance of YqiC was demonstrated by the fact that this protein is necessary for <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium virulence in the murine model, as an <italic>yqiC </italic>mutant strain was unable to kill mice within the period of time assayed and had a significantly higher LD50. The basis for this attenuation in virulence may be related to the observed defect to grow at physiological temperature <italic>in vitro</italic>. Temperature represents a common environmental challenge that microorganisms should be able to sense and respond to in order to survive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Many other single gene mutations produce temperature-sensitive, virulence-attenuated <italic>Salmonella </italic>strains. Examples include <italic>smpA</italic>, which encodes for an outer membrane lipoprotein, <italic>uspA</italic>, which encodes for an universal stress response protein and the genes for DegP and DegQ proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, temperature sensitivity could not be the only factor responsible for the virulence attenuation observed for the <italic>yqiC </italic>mutant, as this strain was still able to invade and replicate inside macrophages and epithelial cell lines incubated at 37&#xB0;C. These phenotypes may be due to differences in the metabolic status and environmental conditions affecting bacteria replication in rich media under laboratory conditions and inside the eukaryotic cell.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>We have demonstrated in this work that <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium YqiC shares structural and biochemical characteristics with <italic>B. abortus </italic>BMFP, in spite of their relatively low sequence identity. Thus, members of the COG 2960 may accomplish a conserved function among phylogenetically distant bacteria. This function may be necessary to display full virulence. This seems to be the case, as in a parallel work we observed virulence attenuation when analyzing a <italic>B. abortus </italic>BMFP-defective strain (Cravero <italic>et al</italic>, unpublished work). This work is the first demonstration of the <italic>in vivo </italic>importance of a member of the COG 2960. However, future research is necessary to clarify the physiological processes in which the membrane fusogenic activity and possibly other unknown functions of YqiC are required.</p>

        <p>J774 murine macrophages and HeLa human epithelial cell lines were seeded at a density of 2 &#xD7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well in 24-well culture plates. Stationary phase cultures of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ATCC 14028, 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT and complemented strain 14028 &#x394;<italic>yqiC</italic>::CAT + pBBR-<italic>yqiC </italic>grown at 28&#xB0;C overnight were added to the cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Culture plates containing infected cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min and incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 30 min to allow bacterial uptake and invasion. The extracellular bacteria were removed by washing thrice with PBS and incubating with 100 &#x3BC;g/ml gentamycin for 1 h. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with 25 &#x3BC;g/ml gentamycin for the rest of the experiment. After 1, 6 and 24 h, the cells were lysed with 1 mL of 0.1% Triton-X 100 per well and bacterial counts were determined by plating serial dilutions of the lysates on LB agar plates with appropriate antibiotic followed by incubation at 28&#xB0;C.</p>
