      <abstract>
        <p>Motor neuron loss is characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders and results in rapid loss of muscle control, paralysis, and eventual death in severe cases. In order to investigate the neurotrophic effects of a motor neuron lineage graft, we transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived motor neuron progenitors (hMNPs) and examined their histopathological effect in three animal models of motor neuron loss. Specifically, we transplanted hMNPs into rodent models of SMA (&#x394;7SMN), ALS (SOD1 G93A), and spinal cord injury (SCI). The transplanted cells survived and differentiated in all models. In addition, we have also found that hMNPs secrete physiologically active growth factors <italic>in vivo</italic>, including NGF and NT-3, which significantly enhanced the number of spared endogenous neurons in all three animal models. The ability to maintain dying motor neurons by delivering motor neuron-specific neurotrophic support represents a powerful treatment strategy for diseases characterized by motor neuron loss.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can differentiate into any cell type, are amenable to genetic manipulation, and readily self-renew <italic>in vitro</italic>.  Directed differentiation of hESCs into high purity populations of a defined cell type can be used to design effective treatments that are both cell and site specific.  Stem cell-based transplantation is an inherently combinatorial therapeutic approach, in that it not only replaces dead or dying cells, but also provides a substrate for endogenous growth, bridges gaps where tissue is lost to injury or disease, and provides neurotrophic support for the endogenous environment. </p>
      <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and spinal cord injury (SCI) are all diseases of motor neuron loss that could potentially benefit from transplantation of hESC-derived cells.  ALS is the most common form of motor neuron disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and can be either sporadic or familial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].   Approximately 5&#x2013;10% of those diagnosed have a positive family history of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].  Although the etiology of the sporadic form of ALS is largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the familial form has a strong genetic linkage to point mutations in either <italic>TAR DNA-binding protein 43</italic> (TDP-43), <italic>FUS/TLS</italic>, or the <italic>Cu/</italic>Zn superoxide <italic>dismutase 1</italic> (SOD1) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].  The average age of onset is between 40 and 60 years, and the disease is generally fatal within 1&#x2013;5 years of onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].  SMA is also characterized by motor neuron loss and is the leading genetic cause of infantile death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].  The disease manifests by roughly 6 months of age in the most severe cases (type I), and death follows in ~2 years without supporting intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].  It is caused by a deletion or mutation in the <italic>Survival Motor Neuron </italic>(<italic>SMN1</italic>) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] in approximately 1 of every 10,000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].  SCI involves several degenerative processes including but not limited to axonal and cellular damage to the motor neuron compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].  Each of these three neurodegenerative diseases is characterized by the progressive loss of muscle control and death of motor neurons within the spinal cord.  Because the adult central nervous system (CNS) has a limited ability to repair itself, therapeutic strategies have focused on ameliorating secondary cellular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], promoting endogenous repair mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and cell replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>There is much evidence that transplantation of stem and progenitor cells into the CNS produces functional improvement even in the absence of functional integration.  Human neural stem cells constitutively secrete the neurotrophins NGF, BDNF, and GDNF that promote growth of injured axons following spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">20</xref>]. At least a portion of the functional recovery seen after transplantation of hESC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells into models of SCI has been attributed to secretion of growth factors by the transplanted cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">22</xref>].  This data indicates that growth factors secreted by transplanted stem cells can significantly influence pathogenesis of the diseased/injured spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>We have previously documented a method to differentiate hESCs into high purity populations of human embryonic stem cell-derived motor neuron progenitors (hMNPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">20</xref>].  In this study, we sought to investigate whether hMNPs secrete growth factors that have neurotrophic effects on neurons in culture and in three different models of motor neuron loss.  We demonstrate that hMNPs secreted physiologically active growth factors <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and significantly enhanced the number of endogenous neurons following transplantation in all three animal models of motor neuron loss.  From a therapeutic perspective, these observations indicate that cell transplantation benefits pathogenesis by growth factor secretion, in addition to cell replacement.</p>

Each injection consisted of a total volume of 1&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>L, at a dose of 25,000&#x2009;cells/<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">20</xref>].  </p>
        <p>Mice were divided into two groups of treated (transplantation with hMNPs; <italic>n</italic> = 30) and vehicle control  (vehicle-injected; <italic>n</italic> = 30) groups that were evaluated up to the end stage for protein expression and histological evaluation of donor cell phenotype.  Furthermore, animals were split into 2 groups; the first group was (composed of 20 mice for both hMNP-treated and vehicle control SCI mice) analyzed for histological quantification and the second group of animals was analyzed for molecular analysis (composed of <italic>n</italic> = 10&#x2009;&#x2009;mice for both hMNP-treated and vehicle control SCI mice).  Animals were survived up to 3 months following transplant. </p>

To determine the fate of the transplanted hMNPs, sections were processed for multiple markers.  Primary antibodies were added overnight at 4&#xB0;C for Ku80 (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;300; Abcam), Islet-1 (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;200; Abcam), biotinylated NeuN (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;200; Millipore), p75 (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and ChAT (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;100; Millipore).  Donkey antirabbit conjugated with biotin (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;250; Invitrogen), Streptavidin 594 (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;250; Invitrogen), Streptavidin 488 (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;250; Invitrogen), or goat antirabbit Alexa Fluor-488/-594 (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;250; Invitrogen) was used for 2 hours at room temperature as secondary antibodies.</p>

        <p>The spinal cords from all three animal models were analyzed for neuronal sparing.  Every tenth slide, spaced 200&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m apart, was processed in order to visualize the length of the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">20</xref>].  IHC staining was performed on tissue slides using mouse anti-NeuN (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;200; Millipore) primary antibodies to identify neurons and rabbit anti-Ku80 (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;300; Abcam) primary antibodies to identify human nuclei.  Serial sections were labeled with human nuclear antigen to ensure no human cells were included in the analysis.  For motor neuron sparing analysis, mouse anti-ChAT (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;100; Millipore) primary antibodies and rabbit anti-Ku80 (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;300; Abcam) primary antibodies were used.  The antibodies were diluted in PBS, incubated overnight at 4&#xB0;C. Vector ABC Biotin Kit and Vectastain DAB Substrate Kits were used for secondary detection.  Hoechst was used as a nuclear counterstain. Following IHC staining, the tissue was imaged using an Olympus AX-80 microscope.  Images were taken of transverse sections of the ventral horns using MicroFire software.  NeuN-positive neurons were quantified up to 2&#x2009;mm cranial and 2&#x2009;mm caudal to the injury epicenter or transplant site.  The number of neurons was quantified using ImageJ software.  Each image was opened individually and changed to an 8-bit image.  Each image was then inverted, then the brightness and contrast was adjusted to the Auto setting, which made the gray areas darker and neurons were more easily visible.  Then, threshold was adjusted from Default to MaxEntropy setting.  Finally, the Nucleus Counter plug-in was used to detect pixels, the smallest particle size set to 400 and largest particle size set to 2000.  Background subtraction and watershed filter were used in the plug-in.  The plug-in then showed the black and white image of the neurons with a number indicating that it was counted and a summary table of the total counts.  If a cell double stained positive for both NeuN and Ku80, then that cell was not used in quantification.  Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test (2 tailed distribution and two sample equal variance).</p>

No Oct4 positive stem cells could be identified on or after day 28 of the differentiation protocol.   </p>
        <p>To assess maturation <italic>in vitro</italic>, hMNPs were plated on astrocytes and allowed to mature for a subsequent 3 weeks following day 28 of the differentiation protocol (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(e)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(f)</xref>).  Astrocytes did not immunostain for the motor neuron markers SMI-32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(e)</xref>) and ChAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(f)</xref>), but were evident by hoescht staining.  Quantification of astrocyte positive cells was therefore not performed.  The neurofilament marker SMI-32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(e)</xref>) was expressed by 97.7 &#xB1; 1.53% of the cells and 96.6 &#xB1; 4.4% of the cells expressed the mature motor neuron marker ChAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(f)</xref>); while HB9 expression decreased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; 6 &#xB1; 4.4%) from the day 28 differentiation profile.

In &#x394;7SMN animals, human nuclear antigen-positive cells did not double label with markers for the mature motor neuron markers ChAT or SMI-32, indicating that their limited time <italic>in vivo</italic> (13 days) is insufficient for differentiation of transplanted hMNPs.  However, human cells were found within the SOD1 G93A and SCI animals, in which animals were survived for up to 2 and 3 months, respectively, after transplantation.  Human cells were colabeled with neuronal and motor neuron markers such as NeuN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(d)</xref>), p75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(e)</xref>) and ChAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(f)</xref>), consistent with a motor neuron lineage of a mixed maturation state.  Many human nuclear antigen-positive cells extended TUJ1-positive processes. TUJ1 tissue staining was absent in no-primary and no-secondary antibody controls.

        <p>The average number of neurons in the hMNP treated group and vehicle control group of all 3 animals was assessed for endogenous neuronal sparing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).  In SCI and SOD1 G93A hMNP-treated animals cranial to the injury/injection epicenter, there were 38 &#xB1; 3 and 43 &#xB1; 5 endogenous neurons counted, respectively.  The average number of neurons in the vehicle control group of SCI and SOD1 G93A animals cranial to injury/injection epicenter was 29 &#xB1; 2 and 27 &#xB1; 3, respectively.  Cranial to the injury/injection epicenter, the hMNP-treated group showed a significant sparing of neurons compared to the vehicle control group in SCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and SOD1 G93A animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(c)</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).  The average number of neurons in the hMNP-treated group of SCI animals caudal to the injury/injection epicenter was 36 &#xB1; 4.  The average number of neurons in the vehicle control group of SCI animals caudal to the injury/injection epicenter was 37 &#xB1; 3.  The hMNP-treated group did not demonstrate statistical significance in neuronal sparing in SCI or SOD1 G93A animals caudal to the injury/injection epicenter.

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>Transplantation is an inherently combinatorial therapeutic approach, as it may provide neurotrophic support for the endogenous environment, and cell phenotype-related benefits such as replacement of dead or dying cells, a substrate for endogenous growth, or a tissue bridge for endogenous growth. The relative contribution of neurotrophic support and phenotypic benefits conferred by a transplant is difficult or impossible to discern for transplants that consist of mixed lineages. In this study, we investigated the neurotrophic effects of a high purity motor neuron lineage graft in three animal models of motor neuron loss. We demonstrate that hMNPs secreted physiologically active growth factors <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and significantly enhanced the number of spared endogenous neurons following transplantation in three animal models of motor neuron loss. The ability to maintain dying motor neurons by delivering motor neuron-specific neurotrophic support represents a powerful treatment strategy for diseases characterized by motor neuron loss.</p>
      <p>Motor neurons respond to neurotrophic cues and express and secrete various growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">25</xref>].  Our data indicate that hMNPs secrete NT-3, and NGF, and our previous publication further indicates that they secrete VEGF and NT-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">20</xref>].   NT-3 and VEGF have known beneficial effects on CNS pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">26</xref>]. Furthermore, our <italic>in vitro </italic>data demonstrate that hMNP-conditioned media enhanced elongation and branching of cortical neurites, demonstrating that the growth factor secretions from hMNPs were physiologically relevant. </p>
      <p>Our transplantation studies further confirm that hMNPs have physiologically relevant neurotrophic effects in the vicinity of the transplant. hMNP transplantation into SMA, ALS, and SCI animal models resulted in beneficial effects on injury pathogenesis, as evidenced by a greater number of spared endogenous neurons in all three animal models. Although the growth factors secreted by hMNPs <italic>in vivo </italic>have been implicated in neuronal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">26</xref>], the mechanisms underlying their interaction with the endogenous environment are unknown. Their mechanism of action may be direct, or indirect, as trophic support of glial cells and/or modulation of the immune or glial response may have contributed to survival of endogenous neurons. Neurons within regions of pathology upregulate p75 neurotrophin receptors (p75NTR) and downregulate tyrosine-related kinase receptors (TrkRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">26</xref>]. The p75NTR binds the precursor forms of neurotrophins and has been implicated in apoptosis, while TrkRs bind mature forms of neurotrophins and have been implicated in beneficial neurotrophic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">26</xref>]. hMNP-secreted growth factors may prevent, inhibit, or counteract neurotrophic action at the p75NTR and/or enhance activation and/or upregulation of TrkRs, enhancing downstream neurotrophic effects. </p>
      <p>This study directly assessed the potential of a cell-based therapeutic to confer neurotrophic benefit to regions of pathogenesis in the absence of phenotypic benefit. hMNP transplants did not extend processes to reinnervate distant muscles, so their neurotrophic benefit to the diseased or injured spinal cord could be investigated in isolation from phenotypic benefits conferred by a transplant.  These findings further our understanding of the neurotrophic benefits of hMNP transplantation.  Nonetheless, efforts to mature transplanted hMNPs and enhance axonal projection to target muscles are important to maximize the benefits of this cell population.</p>
