      <abstract>
        <p>Synthetic nanostructures based on self-assembling systems that aim to mimic natural extracellular matrix are now being used as substrates in tissue engineering applications. Peptides are excellent starting materials for the self-assembly process as they can be readily synthesised both chemically and biologically. P<sub>11</sub>-4 is an 11 amino acid peptide that undergoes triggered self-assembly to form a self-supporting hydrogel. It exists as unimers of random coil conformations in water above pH 7.5 but at low pH adopts an antiparallel &#x3B2;-sheet conformation. It also self-assembles under physiological conditions in a concentration-dependent manner. Here we describe an unimer P<sub>11</sub>-4 production system and the use of a simple site-directed mutagenesis approach to generate a series of other P<sub>11</sub>-family peptide expression vectors. We have developed an efficient purification strategy for these peptide biomaterials using a simple procedure involving chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide then repeated filtration, lyophilisation and wash steps. We report peptide-fusion protein yields of ca. 4.64&#xA0;g/L and we believe the highest reported recovery of a recombinant self-assembling peptide at 203&#xA0;mg/L of pure recombinant P<sub>11</sub>-4. This peptide forms a self-supporting hydrogel under physiological conditions with essentially identical physico-chemical properties to the chemically synthesised peptide. Critically it also displays excellent cytocompatibility when tested with primary human dermal fibroblasts. This study demonstrates that high levels of a series of recombinant self-assembling peptides can be purified using a simple process for applications as scaffolds in tissue engineering.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Over the past two decades self-assembling peptides have emerged as potential candidates for the development of safe nanostructured scaffolds in the field of tissue engineering <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[1&#x2013;10]</xref>. Oligomeric peptides have been rationally designed to spontaneously self-assemble into hierarchical structures in solution, in response to specific physico-chemical environmental triggers, thus providing a new generation of well-defined biopolymers <xref rid="bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[11&#x2013;14]</xref>. Under controlled conditions self-assembling peptides of the P<sub>11</sub>-family undergo one-dimensional self-assembly, forming single molecule thick, micrometer-long &#x3B2;-sheet nanotapes. Further assembly results in the nanotapes stacking in pairs to form ribbons which further assemble to form fibrils, then pairs of fibrils can entwine to form fibres. Over twenty systematically varied P<sub>11</sub> peptides have been designed by Aggeli and colleagues to self-assemble using various physico-chemical triggers and give rise to self-supporting isotropic or liquid crystalline hydrogels at peptide concentrations of 10&#x2013;30&#xA0;mg/ml <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These peptides vary in terms of overall charge, hydrophobicity and type of polar amino acids resulting in nanostructured fibrillar peptide networks with different solvent affinity and dissolution rate.</p>
      <p>As an example, self-assembling peptide P<sub>11</sub>-4 (QQRFEWEFEQQ) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>) was designed to form fibrils at low pH and to be monomeric in solution at higher pH. The incorporation of glutamic acid residues at position 5, 7 and 9 means there is no charge on the &#x3B3;-carboxyl groups at pH &#x2264;2. However a positive net charge of one exists on the arginine. This allows antiparallel &#x3B2;-sheet assembly by Coulombic interactions. The terminal glutamine residues contribute to hydrophobic interactions as well as complementary hydrogen bonding, whilst the aromatic residues phenylalanine, tryptophan and phenylalanine at positions 4, 6 and 8 respectively, promote &#x3C0;&#x2013;&#x3C0; interactions of the aromatic rings and aid in the association of tapes into ribbons in aqueous conditions. By contrast at higher pH, all three glutamates carry a negative charge and electrostatic repulsion will therefore prevent efficient &#x3B2;-sheet formation. Furthermore, the addition of NaCl to a concentration of 140&#xA0;m<sc>m</sc> has been shown to induce a fluid to gel transition at a critical concentration of 6.3&#xA0;m<sc>m</sc> at pH 6. The sodium ions will screen the electrostatic forces between the net negatively charged P<sub>11</sub>-4 fibrils <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Most self-assembling peptides described in the literature have been produced using solid-state synthesis. This is efficient for small scale production and testing, but modest scale-up can be expensive while industrial scale production can be very challenging. It can also be difficult to produce peptides of lengths over 35 residues in acceptable yields and there are environmental considerations in disposal of chemical waste. An alternative approach is to produce peptides biosynthetically using recombinant microorganisms <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, which presents different challenges. Specifically, such small peptides are often difficult to express in bacterial cells due to their propensity to self-associate, mediate toxicity or be rapidly degraded by proteases <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Such issues can be addressed by fusing the peptide to a larger carrier protein to improve intracellular stability <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and provide a mechanism for initial purification. A further problem then arises in removing the fusion partner, following chemical or enzymatic cleavage, to leave pure peptide monomer in solution.</p>
      <p>We have previously reported on the use of a pET31-based expression system to produce trimers of P<sub>11</sub>-4 with subsequent cyanogen bromide cleavage and reverse phase HPLC <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This study provided the highest yields of recombinant self-assembling peptide-fusion protein (2.5&#xA0;g/L) using an auto-induction process <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and of pure peptide (90&#xA0;mg/L). However, one issue with this trimer approach was the production of peptide species with a C-terminal homoserine lactone moiety due to cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage. Similar studies have been reported by Middelberg and co-workers on recombinant production of a related peptide P<sub>11</sub>-2 (QQRFQWQFEQQ) using a pET31 system with intervening cysteines and cleavage of peptides by 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate. In this case protein expression used IPTG induction and therefore gave relatively low levels of protein with purification of 2.63&#xA0;mg peptide/L culture after reverse phase (rp)HPLC which represents a 42% yield of peptide <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Subsequently they developed a chromatography-free purification system based on thioredoxin as the fusion partner and with tobacco etch virus protease release of the peptide in heat treated whole cell homogenates. Ethanol precipitation in the presence of 250&#xA0;m<sc>m</sc> NaCl was used to precipitate other material leaving peptide in solution. They recovered 13&#xA0;mg peptide/L culture, although they did use a rpHPLC step to perform buffer exchange of peptide samples for characterisation <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this study was to improve upon a recombinant expression and purification strategy <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> for self-assembling peptide production, to simplify the purification, to demonstrate the general applicability of the approach for peptide biomaterial production and to perform more detailed characterisation (hydrogel formation, CD, FTIR, TEM) and cytocompatibility studies on one of these recombinant peptides, P<sub>11</sub>-4 (rP<sub>11</sub>-4). To ensure production of homogenous native peptide without any associated homoserine lactone species derived from CNBr cleavage, we used an unimer fusion construct with the ketosteroid isomerase separated from a single P<sub>11</sub>-4 peptide encoding sequence by a methionine residue. We then used this recombinant vector as a template to generate a series of further P<sub>11</sub>-family peptide constructs by using a site-directed mutagenesis strategy. To simplify the downstream processing we used cell lysis and fractionation to give the insoluble inclusion body-based pellet, with subsequent cleavage of the peptide from the fusion protein, and non-chromatographic purification of peptide in water. All the purified peptides were analysed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Purified rP<sub>11</sub>-4 was then used directly in further peptide characterisation assays and importantly the cytocompatibility of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 hydrogel was also tested using primary human dermal fibroblasts.</p>

        <title>Cloning and expression strategy</title>
        <p>The cloning and expression strategy adopted for generating the unimer P<sub>11</sub>-4 construct is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>. The plasmid pET31b-KSI-rP<sub>11</sub>-4(1)-HIS was previously generated <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This plasmid contained a single P<sub>11</sub>-4 coding sequence, but has the C-terminal Met and 6His tag which were not required in this study. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to insert two translation termination codons upstream of the C-terminal Met to prevent expression of this Met or the 6His tag so that CNBr cleaved product would result in release of a native sequence peptide from the KSI partner. The correct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing and designated pET31b-KSI-rP<sub>11</sub>-4(1).</p>
        <p>We then used this vector as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to create a series of plasmids encoding other members of the self-assembling peptide P<sub>11</sub>-family fused to the KSI gene in the pET31b vector. The series of constructs generated encoded P<sub>11</sub>-2, P<sub>11</sub>-4, P<sub>11</sub>-9, P<sub>11</sub>-13, P<sub>11</sub>-14, P<sub>11</sub>-20 and P<sub>11</sub>-4+RGD.</p>

        <title>Cyanogen bromide cleavage of KSI-P<sub>11</sub>-4 and rP<sub>11</sub>-4 purification</title>
        <p>The process of cleavage and recovery of recombinant peptide was initially optimised for rP<sub>11</sub>-4. CNBr was used to cleave the inclusion body-based KSI fusion protein to release rP<sub>11</sub>-4. CNBr was added to a 200-fold molar excess of methionine residues to protein in 70% (v/v) formic acid in an oxygen free environment for 24&#xA0;h, in the dark. The cleaved mixture was resuspended in double distilled water and the pH adjusted to 9 with ammonia. This should lead to recovery of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 in an unimeric state in solution. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000&#xA0;<italic>g</italic> for 30&#xA0;min. We investigated the potential for purification of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 from the supernatant without the use of a chromatography step such as rpHPLC. The supernatant, at pH 9, was passed through a 0.22&#xA0;&#x3BC;m filter, lyophilised and resuspended in 10&#xA0;ml double distilled water (pH 9) and agitated for 2&#xA0;h so that the peptide fully dissolved, then lyophilised. This process of resuspension at pH 9, filtration and lyophilisation was repeated five times and the resulting powder was resuspended in 2&#xA0;ml double distilled water (pH 9) and a sample electrophoresed together with uncleaved and cleaved fusion protein, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>. It can be clearly seen that an apparently pure peptide product was obtained after these wash steps.

        <title>Mass spectrometry characterisation</title>
        <p>To confirm the identity of the fusion protein and purified rP<sub>11</sub>-4, mass spectrometry was performed. The theoretical molecular mass of KSI-P<sub>11</sub>-4 fusion protein determined using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html">http://www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html</ext-link> was 1,5140&#xA0;Da and that obtained by mass spectrometry was 1,5139.77&#xA0;Da, which was in excellent agreement. Mass spectrometry identified three main species within the rP<sub>11</sub>-4 sample, the most abundant was 1537.7&#xA0;Da with +17&#xA0;Da species at 1553.6&#xA0;Da and 1570.7&#xA0;Da. Terminal glutamines that are not chemically blocked are prone to cyclization to form pyroglutamic acid with the loss of ammonia <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Given the theoretical molecular mass of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 at 1554.6&#xA0;Da, the species at 1553.6 would correspond to rP<sub>11</sub>-4, perhaps as a deprotonated species. Loss of ammonia from the N-terminal glutamine would give a 1537.6&#xA0;Da species consistent with the observed 1537.7&#xA0;Da species. It seems most likely that the 1570.7 species was due to an ammonia adduct due to the use of ammonia to adjust the pH. MSMS analysis confirmed the identity of the peptide by identifying 8 of the 11 amino acids as N-&#x2026;RFEWEFEQ&#x2026;-C of rP<sub>11</sub>-4.</p>
        <p>The other purified P<sub>11</sub>-N peptides were also characterised by mass spectrometry and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;5</xref>B provides the values for expected and determined molecular masses for both the KSI fusion proteins and for the purified peptides.

        <p>UV spectrophotometry was used to quantify rP<sub>11</sub>-4 as we have reported previously <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> by using the method proposed by <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> in which the concentration (M) was determined from A<sub>280</sub> (1&#xA0;mg&#xA0;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>; 1&#xA0;cm)&#xA0;=&#xA0;5500/M, where 5500 is the molar extinction coefficient of rP<sub>11</sub>-4.</p>
        <p>The KSI-P<sub>11</sub>-4 fusion protein has 137 amino acids and rP<sub>11</sub>-4 consisted of 11 amino acids, therefore rP<sub>11</sub>-4 comprises 8% of the fusion protein. The maximum yield of fusion protein obtained by auto-induction (8ZY4Lac) was 4.64&#xA0;g/L, which theoretically equates to 371.2&#xA0;mg/L of rP<sub>11</sub>-4. Following cleavage with CNBr, the pH change, and several lyophilisation and wash steps in double distilled water, the concentration of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 recovered equated to 203&#xA0;mg/L which corresponds to a 55% yield. While further optimisation is required in relation to purification efficiency, we have achieved the highest levels of fusion protein and peptide recovery so far reported in the literature without any chromatographic step (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

The CD spectra for rP<sub>11</sub>-4 at pH 7.4 and pH 9 are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;7</xref>A and these spectral data correlate well with that obtained for cP<sub>11</sub>-4 in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;7</xref>B. An increase in pH lead to irregular structure and random coil conformation with characteristic negative minimum at ca. 200&#xA0;nm and positive maximum at 218&#xA0;nm. On lowering the pH to 7.4, a conformational change occurred characteristic of antiparallel &#x3B2;-sheet formation with negative minimum at 218&#xA0;nm and strong positive maximum at 198&#xA0;nm.</p>
        <p>FTIR analysis of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 further supported CD data showing that at pH 7.4 a strong peak was observed at 1617&#xA0;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and a weak peak at 1672&#xA0;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> which confirmed the antiparallel &#x3B2;-sheet configuration of rP<sub>11</sub>-4. Upon increasing the pH to 9, a random coil configuration was adopted and confirmed by the broad peak at 1642&#xA0;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The FTIR spectra of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;7</xref>C and those of cP<sub>11</sub>-4 which showed similar transitions in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;7</xref>D.</p>

        <title>Cytocompatibility of rP<sub>11</sub>-4</title>
        <p>rP<sub>11</sub>-4 samples were plated onto nutrient and heated blood agar, and Sabouraud&#x2019;s dextrose medium to check for potential microbial growth. No growth of bacteria or fungi was observed on any of the plates indicating that the filtration protocol eliminated microbial contaminants.</p>
        <p>rP<sub>11</sub>-4 was prepared in DMEM plus supplements at a concentration of 30&#xA0;mg/ml at pH 7.4. Contact cytotoxicity assays were used to assess the cytocompatibility of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 with primary human dermal fibroblasts. This enabled preliminary assessment of any toxicity profile associated with rP<sub>11</sub>-4. It was found, by microscopic examination, that primary human dermal fibroblasts grew up to and in contact with rP<sub>11</sub>-4 with no evidence of cytotoxicity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;8</xref>A&#x2013;B). There were no apparent changes in cellular morphology nor were zones of cell lysis visible. This was comparable to type I collagen (negative control), which also showed no evidence of cytotoxicity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;8</xref>C). By contrast cyanoacrylate (positive control) caused cell lysis and agglomerated cell remnants were seen (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;8</xref>D).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>There are two broad strategies for the production of self-assembling peptides: chemical synthesis and recombinant production by transgenic organisms ranging from bacteria and fungi to plants and animals. The use of microbial &#x2018;biofactories&#x2019; for protein synthesis is widely employed in industry owing to their ease of use, robustness and low costs. Such recombinant systems have the potential for large scale production of peptides and proteins, although there are significant challenges for the production and efficient purification of short (10&#x2013;30 amino acids) self-assembling peptides.</p>
      <p>The Gram-negative bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic> is an attractive system for heterologous protein production due to its ability to grow rapidly to high cell density on inexpensive substrates and excellent genetic characterisation. The large scale production of insulin by Eli Lilly (USA) and bovine growth hormone by Monsanto Corporation attest to the versatility and economic potential of <italic>E. coli</italic>-based therapeutic protein production <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Recombinant protein expression using <italic>E. coli</italic> as host is frequently associated with the formation of intracellular protein aggregates as inclusion bodies. For most protein production systems this is undesirable as recovery of functional protein from inclusion bodies requires complex refolding with variable success. For peptides however, this is not an issue and inclusion body recovery formed the basis of a method involving tandem peptide repeats fused to KSI with a 6HIS tag for purification and intervening Met residues for CNBr cleavage <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This approach was used in a previous study <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> that demonstrated the peptide coding sequence for P<sub>11</sub>-4 could be successfully expressed as trimer tandem repeats in the pET31b expression system as a KSI-P<sub>11</sub>-4(3)-6HIS construct, with fusion protein yields of 2.5&#xA0;g/L. Following CNBr cleavage, the recombinant P<sub>11</sub>-4 (rP<sub>11</sub>-4) behaved similarly to the chemically synthesised counterpart, cP<sub>11</sub>-4. The peptide yield obtained was the largest reported at that time of 90&#xA0;mg/L culture. However, the cleaved peptide product was a combination of rP<sub>11</sub>-4, rP<sub>11</sub>-4-hsl and 6His tag peptide requiring rpHPLC to resolve the former two species from the latter. The final rP<sub>11</sub>-4 sample remained a mixture of peptide alone and that with an additional homoserine lactone derived from the intervening Met residue cleavage, resulting in a net charge change from &#x2212;2 to &#x2212;1 at pH 7.4. This resulted in self-assembly occurring only at low pH, and not at physiological pH necessary for cell culture and tissue engineering applications.</p>
      <p>The present study focussed on enhancing the production of rP<sub>11</sub> peptides as unimer species, to overcome the unwanted generation of homoserine lactone species, and on the development of a rapid and simple non-chromatographic purification strategy and finally on the characterisation and cytocompatibility of one of the peptide biomaterials, rP<sub>11</sub>-4.</p>
      <p>Starting with a pET31b-KSI-P<sub>11</sub>-4(1)-HIS construct the existing C-terminal 6HIS tag was removed from the expressed protein by inserting two termination codons immediately after the P<sub>11</sub>-4 coding sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis of the resulting pET31b-KSI-P<sub>11</sub>-4(1) plasmid allowed the generation of a series of P<sub>11</sub>-family peptide constructs.</p>
      <p>In eliminating the affinity tag for protein purification, it was essential that the method adopted for purifying the fusion protein and peptide were simple and resulted in a pure peptide product. Commonly rpHPLC, affinity or exclusion chromatography methods are used to obtain highly pure peptides and proteins, however, resulting peptide yields are reduced and for scale-up applications the costs associated with these purification methods are high. These considerations led us to develop a more cost-effective high yield purification strategy. <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were lysed by a detergent lysis method and the insoluble, inclusion body fraction recovered by centrifugation. This pellet which comprised predominantly the KSI-rP<sub>11</sub>-4 fusion protein was treated with CNBr and cleavage was at &gt;90% efficient. The sample was again centrifuged to recover the supernatant which was adjusted to pH 9 then filtered (0.22&#xA0;&#x3BC;m) and subjected to 5 cycles of lyophilisation and water wash steps. While only five wash steps were performed it seems likely that further wash steps may increase the purity of the resulting peptide. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the resulting rP<sub>11</sub>-4 showed no contamination with fusion protein.</p>
      <p>Likewise the same simple cleavage, wash, filtration and lyophilisation strategy was shown to be suitable for purification of P<sub>11</sub>-2, P<sub>11</sub>-9, P<sub>11</sub>-13, P<sub>11</sub>-14, P<sub>11</sub>-20 and P<sub>11</sub>-4+RGD demonstrating the generic nature of this approach for these short self-assembling peptides that display divergent amino acid sequences.</p>
      <p>From a theoretical rP<sub>11</sub>-4 peptide yield of 371.2&#xA0;mg/L, a 55% recovery was achieved of 203&#xA0;mg/L culture. This exceeds our previous demonstration of 90&#xA0;mg/L and we believe this now to be the highest reported self-assembling peptide yield to be recovered from a recombinant system, notable as our purification strategy does not involve a chromatographic step. This certainly represents one of the simplest recovery methods reported yet with the highest yield of target peptide. Losses may have occurred in the filtration step, where some self-assembly may have occurred due to a concentration effect and further optimisation of this approach may achieve even higher yields.</p>
      <p>Middelberg and co-workers also recently reported a chromatography-free purification system in which homogenized cell pellets were heat treated to 55&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 15&#xA0;min. TEV protease was then added to release the P<sub>11</sub>-2 peptide from the thioredoxin fusion partner. The cleavage reaction was then precipitated by ethanol (75% v/v) in the presence of 250&#xA0;m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, centrifuged and the supernatant dried before the peptide was resuspended in water. The overall yield was 40% allowing recovery of 13&#xA0;mg/L culture, although the culture density was significantly lower than we achieve by auto-induction. An rpHPLC polishing step was still used for buffer exchange of the peptide sample prior to self-assembly analysis <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> whereas in our study we used the peptide directly from the wash and lyophilisation process.</p>
      <p>The capacity of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 to form a self-supporting hydrogel was assessed. rP<sub>11</sub>-4 was prepared at the same concentration (10&#xA0;mg&#xA0;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) in cell culture medium (DMEM) at pH 7.4 and it started to form a viscous liquid within minutes. After equilibration for 24&#xA0;h at 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C, it had formed a self-supporting hydrogel. To assess whether rP<sub>11</sub>-4 behaved in a similar pH-responsive manner to cP<sub>11</sub>-4, the pH of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 was increased to pH 9 and a liquid state formed instantaneously confirming that rP<sub>11</sub>-4 behaved in a similar pH-responsive manner to cP<sub>11</sub>-4 becoming unimeric at pH 9.</p>
      <p>TEM showed that rP<sub>11</sub>-4 formed fibrils with lengths and widths similar to those reported for cP<sub>11</sub>-4 reported by <xref rid="bib13 bib18 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[13,18,24]</xref> and to our previously purified rP<sub>11</sub>-4/rP<sub>11</sub>-4 (hsl) <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Circular dichroism analysis suggested that the predominant secondary structure of rP<sub>11</sub>-4 at physiological pH (pH 7.4) was antiparallel &#x3B2;-sheet, as has been observed for rP<sub>11</sub>-4/rP<sub>11</sub>-4 (hsl) <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and for cP<sub>11</sub>-4 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Upon adjusting to pH 9, a conformational transition to random coil occurred. FTIR analysis also indicated an antiparallel &#x3B2;-sheet conformation at pH 7.4 and a random coil conformation at pH 9. These data indicated that rP<sub>11</sub>-4 behaves similarly to cP<sub>11</sub>-4 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Cytocompatibility studies were performed, in which primary human dermal fibroblasts were grown up to and in contact with rP<sub>11</sub>-4, collagen I and cyanoacrylate for 48&#xA0;h. This indicated that rP<sub>11</sub>-4 purified by filtration, lyophilisation and wash steps alone was compatible with growth of these primary human cells.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>We have demonstrated that various P<sub>11</sub>-family &#x3B2;-structure self-assembling peptides can be produced in an <italic>E. coli</italic> expression system. Efficient purification was achieved by CNBr cleavage and a series of simple wash, filtration and lyophilisation steps. For rP<sub>11</sub>-4 which was analysed in greatest detail, this ultimately resulted in a peptide yield of 203&#xA0;mg/L which we believe to be the highest reported self-assembling peptide yield to date. Microscopic and spectroscopic analysis showed that rP<sub>11</sub>-4 had essentially identical properties to the chemically synthesised counterpart (cP<sub>11</sub>-4). rP<sub>11</sub>-4 self-assembled into a hydrogel in physiological conditions and cytocompatibility studies indicated that rP<sub>11</sub>-4 hydrogel was non-cytotoxic towards primary human dermal fibroblasts. This study demonstrates that rP<sub>11</sub>-4 and other P<sub>11</sub>-series peptides can be produced in a sustainable manner using an <italic>E. coli</italic> expression system resulting in a pure peptide without the need for costly chromatographic purification strategies. This method has great potential for large scale production of self-assembling peptides as scaffolds for tissue engineering and human cell culture studies are underway.</p>

P<sub>11</sub>-4 encoding oligonucleotide sequences were designed to introduce intervening methionine codons (ATG) when annealed and cloned into the <italic>Alw</italic>NI site of pET31b. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce two termination codons (TAATAG) to prevent translation of the C-terminal methionine and hexa-histidine tag.

A hydrogel formed under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 140&#xA0;m<sc>m</sc> NaCl) while a pH shift to 9 resulted in peptide unimerisation and a gel&#x2013;liquid transition. The black arrows indicate the position of the peptide sample. TEM analysis of uranyl acetate negative stained samples of (B) rP<sub>11</sub>-4 and (C) cP<sub>11</sub>-4 revealed similar semi-rigid fibril morphologies with the presence of fibrillar twists and bundles.</p>
