      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Silkworm silk is composed of two classes of proteins fibroin and sericin. It is one of the oldest and most versatile biomaterials with many favorable properties such as biocompatibility and biodegradability. Silk is also easily processed into various forms such as fibers, yarns, textiles, sponges, and films (Altman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>). Not only has silk been extensively used as sutures in medical settings for centuries but silk-based biomaterials have been developed for modern biomedical applications such as matrices for tissue engineering (Altman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Molecular functionalization of silk is an attractive strategy for further expanding the versatility of silk as biomaterials. However, relatively few previous reports on chemical functionalization of silk-derived materials can be found. Most of these efforts involve covalent chemical modifications of the silk proteins using reactive reagents (Murphy and Kaplan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). Genetic modifications of silkworms have also been recently reported (Mori and Tsukada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>). However, genetically modified organisms are still subject to stringent regulatory approval, and the possible modifications are limited to those that can be genetically encoded and nontoxic to the host silkworm.</p>
      <p>New universal molecular tools such as peptide tags that can be fused to other functional moieties (e.g. proteins, organic molecules, or nanoparticles) to impart new functions to silk via noncovalent interactions would be highly attractive. Affinity selection using phage libraries that display random peptides fused to a coat protein has proven to be a highly successful strategy for discovering potent peptide ligands (Pande et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). Many peptide ligands with affinities to various biomolecules (Pande et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>) and inorganic (Sarikaya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>) and organic materials (Serizawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>) have been reported. Here, we describe our initial results of the selection and screening of peptide ligands that bind to silk fibroin fibers from a phage-displayed random peptide library. Sequencing of the selected phage clones revealed a short consensus sequence QSWS which appears to be important for binding based on binding assays using phage and synthetic peptides. We envision that these peptide ligands will be useful for noncovalent functionalization of various silk-based biomaterials.</p>

        <title>Silk degumming</title>
        <p>To obtain silk fibroin fiber, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> cocoons were degummed by the standard soap/soda ash method (Robson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1999</xref>). Briefly, <italic>B. mori</italic> silk cocoons were gently agitated in degumming solution containing 0.08% (w/v) Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and 0.2% (w/v) Marseille soap (olive oil soap) at 98&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;h. The fibers were rinsed with warm distilled water for 10&#xA0;min. The degumming process was repeated under a milder condition (0.06% Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and 0.15% Marseille soap). The degummed fibers were repeatedly rinsed with warm water for 10&#xA0;min and finally rinsed with cold water. The degummed fibers were put on a layer of clean KimWipes to remove excess water and dried at room temperature. The degumming process resulted in 25&#x2013;30% loss of the silk weight.</p>

        <title>Selection and identification of silk-binding phage</title>
        <p>A commercially available M13 phage library (Ph.D.-12. New England Biolabs) that displays random 12-mer peptides fused to the minor coat protein pIII was used for peptide selection. Dry degummed silk fibroin fibers (10&#xA0;mg) were placed in a spin-filter column (USA Scientific) and washed with 500&#xA0;&#x3BC;l of 0.1% TBST buffer (50&#xA0;mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150&#xA0;mM NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) using a microcentrifuge (~1,000&#xD7;<italic>g</italic>, 10&#xA0;s). The fibers were incubated with phage in 1&#xA0;ml 0.1% TBST at room temperature with gentle shaking (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Subsequently, the fibers were transferred to a spin-column and the unbound phage were removed by centrifugation (~1,000&#xD7;<italic>g</italic>, 10&#xA0;s) and washed with 1&#xA0;ml 0.1% TBST. Bound phage were released from the fibers by incubation in 1&#xA0;ml 0.2&#xA0;M glycine/HCl buffer (pH 2.2) containing 1&#xA0;mg bovine serum albumin for 5&#xA0;min in a fresh tube and separated from the fibers by centrifugation. The solution containing the eluted phage was neutralized by adding 150&#xA0;&#x3BC;l 1&#xA0;M Tris/HCl (pH 9.1). The recovered phage were titered or amplified according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol (New England Biolabs) for subsequent rounds of selection. Selection conditions for the subsequent rounds are summarized in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

        <p>A phage clone, YN42 identified after the fifth round selection, and its mutants were examined for their silk-binding properties.

        <p>Peptides were chemically synthesized with <italic>C</italic>-terminal biotin by LifeTein. Each 12-mer peptide was synthesized with GK at its <italic>C</italic>-terminus with the terminal lysine side chain biotinylated.

Peptide solution at an appropriate concentration (400&#xA0;&#x3BC;l) in 0.1% TBST was incubated with silk fibers (1&#xA0;mg) for 30&#xA0;min at room temperature with gentle shaking. After washing the fibers ten times with 400&#xA0;&#x3BC;l of 0.5% TBST, the fibers were blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in TBS (400&#xA0;&#x3BC;l) for 2&#xA0;h. After washing the fibers five times with TBS (400&#xA0;&#x3BC;l), the fibers were incubated with 400&#xA0;&#x3BC;l streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Rockland) solution (diluted 1:20,000 in TBS) for 1&#xA0;h. The fibers were further washed six times with 0.1% TBST and transferred to a fresh tube. Subsequently, HRP substrate solution (500&#xA0;&#x3BC;l) containing ABTS (0.4&#xA0;mg/ml) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.03% w/v) was added to the fibers and reacted for 30&#xA0;min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The fibers were removed and A<sub>405</sub> and A<sub>495</sub> were measured using a microplate reader. The ELISA signals were calculated as A<sub>405</sub>&#x2013;A<sub>495</sub> normalized by the weight of the fibers. Background signal obtained without peptide was subtracted.</p>

        <p>Results of the phage selection process are summarized in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Stringency of selection was increased each round by decreasing the binding time and/or increasing the number of washes, except for the fifth round in which the binding and washing conditions were kept the same as the fourth round. We noticed that the number of phage recovered decreased by an order of magnitude after the fourth round, probably due to the higher stringency. However, the phage recovery increased in the fifth round suggesting that the clones with higher affinities to silk fiber were being selected. We randomly picked and analyzed the sequences of 12 clones from the phage selected after the third round. However, the result revealed no consensus or enriched sequences (data not shown). On the other hand, 11 clones analyzed after the fifth round revealed two sequences YN42 and YN43 that appeared three times each (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Moreover, both of these enriched sequences contained a common tetrapeptide sequence QSWS. A closer examination of the selected sequences indicates other characteristic patterns such as the high frequency of tryptophan residues.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>Amino acid sequences of the phage-displayed peptides after silk affinity selection</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Phage<sup>a</sup></th><th align="left">Number of clones</th><th align="left">Sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">YN42</td><td char="." align="char">3</td><td align="left">SYTFHWH<bold><italic>QSWS</italic></bold>S</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YN43</td><td char="." align="char">3</td><td align="left"><bold><italic>QSWS</italic></bold>WHWTSHVT</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YN41</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td align="left">WTWRWAHVTNTR</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YN48</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td align="left">QDVHLTQQSRYT</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YN49</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td align="left">HKAHEYDPWISP</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YN50</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td align="left">SYSQHYGIPNPW</td></tr><tr><td align="left">YN52</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td align="left">SSWQMSWSWMGS</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>The sequenced phage clones were randomly picked from the fifth round selection.

        <title>Characterization of silk-binding peptides</title>
        <p>We focused our initial studies on one of the two highly enriched peptides YN42, because both peptides (YN42 and YN43) contained the common QSWS motif. First, the silk-binding property of the phage clone displaying the YN42 peptide was confirmed by phage binding assay. YN42 phage were recovered in 100 times better yield than the unselected phage population, indicating that the selection indeed enriched phage displaying silk-binding peptides (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To gauge the contributions, if any, of the QSWS motif, two single mutants of YN42 were constructed that display QAWS or QSAS instead of QSWS. While the recovery of the phage YN42/QAWS was moderately lower (by approximately 30%) compared to YN42, the recovery of YN42/QSAS phage were reduced by more than 90%, indicating that the tryptophan in QSWS motif plays a significant role in silk-binding.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>Phage binding assay. Silk fibroin fibers (10&#xA0;mg) were incubated with phage (5&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10<sup>7</sup> pfu) in 1&#xA0;ml solution. After washing as described in &#x201C;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>&#x201D; section, bound phage were eluted in 1&#xA0;ml buffer and titered. The assays were performed twice for each phage clone and the <italic>error bars</italic> indicate the range of the measurements</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10529_2011_519_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
        <p>Results of the peptide binding assays using synthetic biotinylated peptides generally agreed with the phage binding assay (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). In particular, a control peptide with the same amino acid composition but with a randomly shuffled amino acid sequence (pepYN42/Shuffled) showed significantly lower affinity to silk compared to pepYN42, indicating that the sequence, not the amino acid composition, is important for the observed silk-binding property. To demonstrate how silk-binding peptides can be used to functionalize silk, silk fibers treated with pepYN42 and streptavidin-HRP conjugate were stained by an insoluble substrate (3,3&#x2032;,5,5&#x2032;-tetramethylbenzidine, TMB) for HRP. While the fibers treated with pepYN42/Shuffled were only minimally stained, the fibers treated with pepYN42 were stained significantly (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Concentration dependent binding assay using pepYN42 suggests an apparent submicromolar affinity of the peptide to silk fibroin fibers (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>Synthetic peptide binding assay.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our goal was to discover small peptides with significant affinity to silk fibroin fibers that can be used to noncovalently modify silk-based biomaterials with various functional units such as enzymes, hormones, or signaling molecules. We identified YN42 as one of the two highly enriched peptides in silk affinity selection from a phage displayed peptide library. The YN42 peptide exhibited significant affinity to silk fibroin fiber as a coat-protein fusion displayed on M13 phage, as well as a <italic>C</italic>-terminally biotinylated synthetic peptide. Therefore, YN42 or its derivatives are promising candidates for generic silk-binding tags that can be used to impart new functions to silk-based materials. We anticipate that our silk-binding peptides can be used in a number of forms, for example, as synthetic peptide conjugate demonstrated in this work and as genetically encoded fusion tags to other proteins. Further modifications of the peptide sequence may enable fine-tuning of the silk-binding property for individual applications.</p>
