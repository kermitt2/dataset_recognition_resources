      <abstract>
        <p>A key current concern is how scientific knowledge may inform policy in relation to major
          environmental and health concerns. There are distinct schools of analysis about this
          relationship between science and policy. They stress rational relationships; denial and
          delay; or the role of networks. History is important in modifying such perspectives:
          smoking policy in the 1950s and 1960s is the case study here. The initial response in the
          1950s to the link between smoking and lung cancer was in part conditioned by the role of
          the tobacco industry and the financial importance of tobacco: the British tobacco industry
          had closer relationships with government than the American one, and did not rely on public
          relations. Public health interests worked with the industry. But politicians were
          concerned also about the fluidity of the epidemiological evidence; the dangers of stirring
          up further pressure over air pollution; the financial and ideological implications of
          health education and its location; and the electoral dangers of intervening in a popular
          mass habit. In the 1960s the British and American medical reports stimulated the growth of
          a public health &#x2018;policy community&#x2019;. The initial political
          considerations began to weaken and these years marked the beginning of a new style of
          public health.</p>

      <title>I</title>
      <p>A key current concern is how scientific knowledge may inform policy in relation to major
        environmental and health concerns. The demand for &#x2018;evidence based
        medicine&#x2019;, &#x2018;evidence based practice&#x2019;, and &#x2018;evidence
        based policy&#x2019; has its own history. One recent lineage came from the US, Canada,
        and the Netherlands in the 1960s through the rise of clinical epidemiology.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn001"><sup>1</sup></xref> In Britain, there has been a different history. The post-war redefinition of the
        ideas of social medicine had a twin legacy in the &#x2018;new public health&#x2019; on
        the one hand, and, on the other, in the rise of health services research and the dominance
        of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) as the gold standard of medical and scientific
          evidence.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn002"><sup>2</sup></xref> The rise of evidence can also be related to the &#x2018;customer
        contractor&#x2019; changes in government research funding in the 1970s, initiated by the
        1972 Rothschild Report.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn003"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
      <p>There are distinct schools of thought about how the relationship between science/evidence
        and policy or practice operates or should operate. These can be categorized under three main
        tendencies: evidence based or rational arguments; the journalist school; and science
        policy/sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) approaches.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn004"><sup>4</sup></xref> The rationalist argument is what has been called the
        &#x2018;engineering&#x2019; model of research impact on policy. Its proponents argue
        that all that is needed are technical adjustments to make the relationships work, that
        improvements in process are what is needed, rather than a more fundamental critique.
        Underlying this model are positivist models of science, the assumption that knowledge can
        have an impact in a value-free way.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn005"><sup>5</sup></xref> Analogous but more narrowly channelled approaches to the science/policy relationship
        appear in the <italic>journalist school.</italic> The term &#x2018;journalist&#x2019;
        means practised by journalists, and embodying a way of looking at the world which often
        characterizes media agendas on science and policy. Here again, a relationship between
        science/research and policy is seen as desirable, but perhaps in a more partisan way. When
        some hiatus occurs in the relationship, the interpretation is in terms of conspiracy. The
        interruption is seen in terms of &#x2018;delay&#x2019; and blame is attached to key
        participants. This &#x2018;heroes and villains&#x2019; school of analysis is a
        conventionally accepted mode, even in academic circles, of looking at the nature of response
        to public health issues. Some analysis of AIDS provides a recent example, also responses to
        BSE and developments in alcohol policy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn006"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The third main school can be broadly categorized as network analysis, but the field is
        complex and there are different tendencies within it. One such is the SSK which has
        undergone rapid development over the past twenty or so years. Here the concept of actor
        networks in science is important.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn007"><sup>7</sup></xref> Network theories have also been developed with a great degree of sophistication
        within science policy analyses. In fact analysing policy networks has become a dominant
        approach for the study of policy making processes in Britain, Europe, and North America.
        Such approaches emphasize the interaction and patterns of association between actors in
        different policy areas. Networks have been one of the most discussed and contested terms in
        political science.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn008"><sup>8</sup></xref> Richardson and Jordan developed the idea of the &#x2018;policy
        community&#x2019;, focusing on what they called &#x2018;the government, civil
        service&#x2013;pressure group network&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn009"><sup>9</sup></xref> The relationship between government departments and external bodies is what matters,
        in this interpretation; policy formulation takes place in stable subsystems comprising
        government agencies and outside groups. The whole system is compartmentalized such that
        relationships between government and external groups vary for each policy area. Marsh and
        Rhodes, using studies of UK policy making, have differentiated between &#x2018;policy
        communities&#x2019; and &#x2018;issue networks&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn010"><sup>10</sup></xref> The overall view is that policy communities are small, formal, highly focused, and
        centralized policy groupings, while issue networks are more diffuse, informal, with less
        power and more diverse interests. So far as health policy is concerned, Wistow has stressed
        the role of &#x2018;professionalized networks&#x2019;, a network dominated by a single
        profession, in this case medicine. The dominant role of the medical profession is a theme in
        many health policy analyses, although there is little specifically on public health.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn011"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
      <p>How do these schools of analysis manifest themselves for smoking policy? Archival material
        has been used to help make the &#x2018;journalist&#x2019; case, and the history has
        been entwined with advocacy for current policy positions. British smoking policy provides
        examples in Peter Taylor&#x2019;s book, <italic>Smoke ring</italic>, and David
        Pollock&#x2019;s <italic>Denial and delay: the political history of smoking and health,
          1951&#x2013;1964: scientists, government and industry as seen in the papers at the
          Public Records</italic> [sic]<italic>Office</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn012"><sup>12</sup></xref> Pollock&#x2019;s book covers the period of this article.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn013"><sup>13</sup></xref> The chapter headings for the book present the interpretation of denial and delay.
        &#x2018;Chapter 1. Pressure for a government statement, 1951&#x2013;1954; Chapter 2.
        Neutralizing the MRC findings 1954&#x2013;1957. Chapter 3. Masterly inactivity,
        1957&#x2013;1961&#x2019;, and goes through to &#x2018;Chapter 6. The start of
        modern tobacco control, 1963&#x2013;1964.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn014"><sup>14</sup></xref> The framework here is one of delay and conspiracy, of heroes and villains, and
        represents the &#x2018;Whig history&#x2019; of medicine, the assumption of value-free
        scientific truth, and the notion of progress towards a correct course of action. This is a
        dominant interpretation of smoking policy overall. In recent years activism in smoking has
        focused on archival work to a degree which has so far been little appreciated in the British
        historical profession.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn015"><sup>15</sup></xref> Such work, using industry archives, has mainly researched policy making in the 1980s
        and 1990s in the US, Europe, and Asia and has tended to present a universal, American
        dominated history, with little appreciation of national policy differences or the changing
        objectives and strategies of policy over time.</p>
      <p>Political scientists have also used the smoking story to illustrate the role of networks in
        policy making. One of the most extensive discussions of this point of view is in Melvyn
        Read&#x2019;s Ph.D. thesis and subsequent articles and book on the politics of
          tobacco.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn016"><sup>16</sup></xref> Read segments the smoking story into a case study of a &#x2018;producer
        network&#x2019; of industry interests with links into allied government departments; and
        an &#x2018;issue network&#x2019; of anti tobacco organizations and interests also with
        links into relevant government departments, chiefly health. Read uses an historical approach
        but proceeds primarily through published documentation and interviews to make the argument.
        In this analysis the science is taken as a given orthodoxy and the main focus is on the
        operation of what are seen as rival networks over time, concentrating on the years after
        1971 rather than earlier. Other studies of smoking policy also take an &#x2018;interest
        group&#x2019; approach.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn017"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Historians can have an effect on the debates on evidence and policy through challenging the
        assumptions made by the political lobbies and refining the models through which social
        scientists present their case. The former operate from the perspective of the present: the
        models used by the latter fail to take account of complexity and of change over time. The
        case of smoking policy and its history in the 1950s and 1960s in the UK offers an
        opportunity to present a case study of such an historical contribution. Indeed it is
        imperative to do so, given the dominance of archivally based
        &#x2018;journalist&#x2019; analyses of smoking policy compiled by researcher activists
        in recent years.</p>

      <title>II</title>
      <p>The early history of the smoking and lung-cancer connection is well known and has been
        recounted in a number of different histories.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn018"><sup>18</sup></xref> Concern was roused by the gradual increase in the incidence of cancer; a change in
        the balance of the sexes, towards men; and the increasingly important role of lung cancer.
        The greatest increase in lung cancer came in males over forty-five, where the incidence
        increased sixfold between 1930 and 1945. At first it was thought that these changes might be
        due to improved diagnosis and better recording and registration. But work carried out by Sir
        Ernest Kennaway in the 1930s and published in 1947, a detailed examination of post mortem
        certificates, helped eliminate occupational and environmental factors. Kennaway pointed to a
        connection with cigarette smoking, but his work, based on statistical correlations, carried
        little weight. Laboratory studies also tended to support the connection. Research had also
        been undertaken before the war in Nazi Germany and by the American biometrician Raymond
        Pearl, for the insurance industry. There had been concern about the high incidence of cancer
        of the lung among workers in tobacco manufacturing.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn019"><sup>19</sup></xref> The issue became more urgent post-war and discussions between the Ministry of Health
        (MH) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) led to the Council convening an informal
        conference on cancer of the lung in February 1947. The MRC agreed to initiate a large scale
        statistical study of the past smoking habits of those with cancer of the lung and of two
        control groups. Who would take the work forward was a matter of discussion: both the Social
        Medicine Unit under Professor Jerry Morris and Patrick Lawther, who subsequently ran the Air
        Pollution Unit at St Bartholomew&#x2019;s Hospital, were under consideration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn020"><sup>20</sup></xref> But it was the Statistical Research Unit at the London School of Hygiene and
        Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) led by Professor Bradford Hill which was chosen to carry out the
        work and Dr Richard Doll was employed to work on the study. The results, published in the
          <italic>British Medical Journal</italic> (<italic>BMJ</italic>) in 1950, concluded that
        there was a &#x2018;real association&#x2019; between carcinoma of the lung and smoking
        and that smoking was a factor, and an important one, in the production of carcinoma of the
        lung. Work by Wynder and Graham in the US had come to similar conclusions. Later studies
        carried out by Doll and Bradford Hill and by Cuyler Hammond and Horn in the US implicated
        cigarette smoking even further.</p>
      <p>Charles Webster has shown in detail how the issue fared over the next seven years.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn021"><sup>21</sup></xref>A written parliamentary answer from Ian Macleod as minister of health in February
        1954 accepted that there was a connection but that it was not a simple one.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn022"><sup>22</sup></xref> When the MRC issued its own report on smoking and lung cancer in June 1957 the MH
        adopted the argument more fully. The parliamentary secretary to the MH for the first time on
        27 June 1957 expressed unambiguous support for the conclusions reached by Doll and Hill in
        1950. Webster locates this sequence of events in the machinations of the powerful and
        complex advisory machinery which stood between the MRC and the MH. The main advisory body
        was the Cancer and Radiotherapy Standing Advisory Committee (SAC), reporting to the Central
        Health Services Council, which in turn advised the MH. Horace Joules of the Central
        Middlesex Hospital, a member of both bodies, was the only person within the advisory
        committee machinery consistently to press the issue. Palladino has recently related his
        stance to a continuing Christian Socialist tradition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn023"><sup>23</sup></xref> The initial government response focused on an MH circular encouraging local
        authorities to develop health education campaigns on smoking. Further action under the
        Labour government of the 1960s saw the banning of cigarette advertisements on television in
        1965, and attempts by the Labour minister of health, the GP Kenneth Robinson, to introduce
        legislation to ban cigarette coupon schemes and to limit other forms of advertising. Health
        warnings on cigarette packets appeared in 1971.What issues lay behind the nature of the
        initial response in the 1950s and early 1960s? The response in the 1950s will be discussed
        separately from that in the 1960s when new factors came into play.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec003">
      <title>III</title>
      <p>The initial response to the putative link between smoking and lung cancer came at a time of
        reorientation in post-war public health and in modes of investigation. The medical officer
        of health in local government, once perceived as the potential linchpin of the coming
        state-funded health service, had been downgraded by the establishment of the hospital and GP
        dominated National Health Service (NHS). At a broader level, the nature of health problems
        was changing. It was chronic rather than epidemic or infectious disease which was to
        dominate, and chronic disease epidemiology would emerge as the primary technical tool for
        the study of such conditions within populations. The social medicine movement, which had
        been important both before and during the war as a possible &#x2018;new avenue&#x2019;
        for medical practice, was changing its emphasis in the 1950s to a reliance on chronic
        disease epidemiology. This epidemiological technique was to become the foundation of a
        &#x2018;new public health&#x2019; in the 1960s and 1970s when public health
        practitioners were relocated in health services, moved out of the local authorities where
        they had established their pre-war empires.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn024"><sup>24</sup></xref> Jerry Morris&#x2019;s key text, <italic>Uses of epidemiology</italic>, published
        in 1957, set the tone for the emergence of the new scientific approach and the new role for
        public health (to be known as community medicine); the text used smoking extensively as its
          exemplar.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn025"><sup>25</sup></xref> The fluidity of the smoking science was thus embedded in a more general period of
        reorientation both within public health and in the ideology and the technical tools of the
        field. The 1950s and 1960s were also a period when science emerged as an international
        enterprise. The post-war establishment of the World Health Organization (WHO) was important
        as a mechanism for the cross national transfer of ideas and concepts in health, and for the
        development of internationalism in science, building, to some degree, on earlier attempts
        through the pre-war League of Nations. British and American researchers and scientists began
        to become more aware of each other&#x2019;s work in these years.</p>
      <p>The 1950s thus saw a fluid policy situation and the government response was conditioned by
        a number of factors, not all of them directly smoking related. The nature of the evidence
        which the epidemiological studies presented in the 1950s has been much discussed by
        historians in recent years in ways which have drawn on both the science studies and the
        &#x2018;delay and blame&#x2019; frameworks. Debates over the American response to
        smoking/lung cancer research illustrate these arguments. In the American context, Allan
        Brandt and John Burnham have seen the smoking/lung cancer &#x2018;discovery&#x2019;
        and subsequent events as a watershed in the acceptability of chronic disease epidemiology to
        provide legitimate forms of scientific explanation; this was a major paradigm shift towards
        epidemiology and statistical modes of explanation and causation at the expense of laboratory
          science.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn026"><sup>26</sup></xref> Mark Parascandola has argued that it was not simply a case of blanket opposition
        between two styles of science. He has related the discussions, in the US context, to the
        politics of the National Institutes of Health in the 1950s and to controversy between
        biostatisticians and epidemiologists.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn027"><sup>27</sup></xref> Talley et al. have argued that there was a legitimate scientific controversy over
        smoking and lung cancer in the 1950s and early 1960s which reached its denouement and
        codification in the surgeon general&#x2019;s report of 1964.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn028"><sup>28</sup></xref> However, these historical positions have been complicated by the involvement of
        historians in the litigation through which US smoking policy primarily proceeds. Brandt, for
        example, has modified his position recently to place great stress on the role of the tobacco
        industry, in legal testimony given on behalf of anti-tobacco interests.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn029"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The American story was part of the internationalization of science in the 1950s. In the
        1940s Hill and Doll were not aware of the parallel research being carried out by Wynder and
        Graham, but in the 1950s contacts between British and American epidemiologists developed
        rapidly. There were national differences in the process of consolidation of the science, for
        example in terms of opposition to the smoking and lung cancer hypothesis. One key opponent
        was the statistician Ronald Fisher, who had played a central role in the development of the
          RCT.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn030"><sup>30</sup></xref> Ronald Fisher has been criticized because of his role as adviser to the Tobacco
        Manufacturers Standing Committee, set up in 1956 to assist research. In addition, his
        eugenic worldview subsequently became unfashionable as a mode of statistical explanation,
        although it was a dominant position at the time. Recent evidence has thrown more light on
        the nature of this controversy. Fisher&#x2019;s opposition arose in part from statistical
        issues: correlation should not be taken as proof of causation. But it also emanated from his
        libertarian views, which meant that he was strongly against anti-smoking publicity. He
        thought people should be given the data and draw their own conclusions; he criticized Doll
        and Hill only after an article in the <italic>BMJ</italic> had stated that people should be
        discouraged from smoking. This view of what was termed &#x2018;propaganda&#x2019; was
        common at the time and informed the early health education responses.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn031"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The issue of inhalation also divided the researchers, since, paradoxically, it seemed that
        fewer smokers who inhaled developed lung cancer.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn032"><sup>32</sup></xref> There were threats of libel. Bradford Hill had offered data to Fisher from the 1952
        study he and Doll had carried out, but not from the 1950 study. Fisher accused the
        researchers of suppressing evidence.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn033"><sup>33</sup></xref> This controversy was played out in a number of publications and also taken up by
        other authors. The closure of scientific controversy on the issue of causation came finally
        through Bradford Hill&#x2019;s postulates, published in 1965 when Hill was president of
        the section of Occupational Health of the Royal Society of Medicine. Hill had first begun to
        develop the criteria for cause and effect and association in the late 1930s and had expanded
        them in a lecture at Harvard in the 1950s.Their publication in the 1960s formalized
        guidelines for causal inference and marked the closure of the main period of controversy. In
        a recent paper, Luc Berlivet has taken the British story and looked at the controversy
        surrounding smoking and lung cancer and its key role in the formation of the modern science
        of epidemiology. He argues that<disp-quote><p>there was more to criticism of supporters of the &#x2018;causal
            hypothesis&#x2019; than just a reaction of rear guard scientists and vested interests
            plotting to undermine a promising, if young, scientific
            practice&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;The controversy stirred up by the publications on
            the relationship between tobacco and lung cancer was eventually transformed into a
            highly positive retrospective story. This is a process which reminds us of other famous
            episodes of &#x2018;discovery&#x2019; in the history of science.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn034"><sup>34</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>This scientific debate had an effect on the policy response of civil servants
        and others in government. After the publication of the second Doll and Hill report in
        December 1952, the Imperial Tobacco Company, the main British tobacco company, entered the
        fray and papers from both sides were circulated to the SAC in February 1953. As a result,
        the conflicting evidence, from Doll and Hill and from Geoffrey Todd, assistant manager in
        the statistical department of the Imperial Tobacco Company, was submitted to a committee
        chaired by the government actuary, Sir George Maddox, later that year. The civil servants in
        the MH were uncertain. Sir John Charles, the chief medical officer (CMO), told Percy Stocks,
        chief medical statistician to the Registrar General&#x2019;s Office, &#x2018;As
        regards the evidence, I am in general agreement with what you say, but what I was looking
        for was evidence apart from the analogous or purely statistical. So far as I am aware, there
        is no <italic>purely</italic> pathological evidence of this long incubation period in lung
          cancer.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn035"><sup>35</sup></xref> Neville Goodman, an MH civil servant, cited in an internal minute the tobacco

        also compounded the issue.<disp-quote><p>He is a young man &#x2018;far gone in enthusiasm&#x2019; for the causal
            relationship between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. (I had been told when I was in New
            York this spring that he was the son of a revivalist preacher and had inherited his
            father&#x2019;s antipathy to tobacco and alcohol). The American Cancer Society was
            very suspicious of his early work for this reason.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn037"><sup>37</sup></xref></p></disp-quote></p>
      <p>The statistical panel reported in November 1953, and found that a &#x2018;real
        association&#x2019; had been established, with a &#x2018;strong presumption&#x2019;
        that the real association was causal. It might also be dependent on co-factors such as the
        urban&#x2013;rural difference, occupational matters, and so on, and the report therefore
        treated with great reserve the death rates which had been calculated by Doll and Hill
        through a section on estimated risks in the 1952 paper. The SAC accepted this conclusion,
        recommending that young people should be warned about the risks of smoking. The government
        assessment of the state of scientific opinion was beginning to become clearer, and it was
        this development in opinion which led to the first MH statement in the House of Commons in
        February 1954, followed by a press conference. Macleod as minister of health made a
        statement but promised no further action; there was a need for further research.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn038"><sup>38</sup></xref> Macleod&#x2019;s statement was made as a written parliamentary answer. He
        chain-smoked his way through the subsequent press conference, but subsequently gave up his
        sixty a day habit in favour of two or three small cigars a day.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn039"><sup>39</sup></xref> The parliamentary discussions of the time show similar fluidity in the political
        appreciation of the health risk. In an adjournment debate held in March 1953, MPs from
        across the political spectrum expressed uncertainty or opposition. Harmar Nicholls,
        Conservative MP for Peterborough, expressed the then common view of the dangers of arousing
        &#x2018;cancer phobia&#x2019;: the fear of cancer could be worse than cancer itself.
        The report &#x2018;is more a report of statisticians than a medical report&#x2019;.
        Bessy Braddock, Labour MP for Liverpool Exchange, drew attention to the
        urban&#x2013;rural divide in the figures and favoured an environmental explanation.
        &#x2018;In view of the fact that cigarette and pipe smoking goes on all over the country,
        it is folly to say that it is the main cause of lung cancer.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn040"><sup>40</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Expert opinion was related to another issue: the role of the tobacco industry. Here there
        had been a long history of co-operation in Britain. Tobacco was a key import during the
        Second World War and its duty a major source of government revenue. During the war the
        industry had been under strict government control and the Board of Trade appointed Sir
        Alexander Maxwell, who before the war had been a leading leaf merchant, as tobacco
        controller. The industry, in its relationships with government, was different to the US
        tobacco industry, which had no such continuing corporate tradition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn041"><sup>41</sup></xref> Both Maxwell and Sir John Partridge of the Imperial Tobacco Company had close and
        continuing access to government. Imperial dominated the industry/government relationship in
        the UK until the late 1970s. The Imperial Board had been astonished by the Doll/Hill studies
        and saw its role as working with government, as it had done during the war, this time to
        produce a cleaner product. The US industry, by comparison, was distant from government, and
        concentrated from the start on public relations exercises to counteract the perceived
        dangers of smoking.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn042"><sup>42</sup></xref> In the late 1970s, with changes in the ownership of the industry,
        Imperial&#x2019;s dominance faltered and the role of the US companies in the UK became
        more significant.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn043"><sup>43</sup></xref> But in the 1950s the close relationship with government was marked by efforts to
        deal with the health issue.</p>
      <p>The industry provided another source of scientific expertise, in particular through its own
        statistician, Geoffrey Todd, whose report had been submitted to the SAC. The industry also
        planned to fund research, and had approached both the MRC and the MH in 1953. Sir Alexander
        Maxwell, chairman of the Tobacco Advisory Committee, in a secret memo to Harold Himsworth,
        secretary of the MRC, stated his lack of belief in any true association between smoking and
        lung cancer. In order to investigate the true causes of lung cancer the committee wished to
        covenant &#xA3;250,000 over a period of seven years. Discussions between the Treasury
        and the MH resulted in a compromise whereby the tobacco company&#x2019;s gift was to the
        government, which would then allocate it to the MRC. This avoided charges of the impropriety
        of the Council accepting money from an interested body. The gift was for research into
        smoking and lung cancer, but also into the means of removing the harmful elements from the
        tobacco, when they were identified. This was the origin of a long programme of
        &#x2018;product modification&#x2019; research which was of particular significance in
        the 1970s and also fuelled the work on nicotine carried out in the 1980s and 1990s. The gift
        was to be made, so John Boyd Carpenter at the Treasury wrote to the lord president, the
        marquess of Salisbury, for research into smoking and lung cancer, and &#x2018;presumably
        of the means of removing the elements in the tobacco which may have this
          effect&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn044"><sup>44</sup></xref></p>
      <p>A visit paid to Europe by Dr C.&#xA0;C. Little in 1956 to survey the state of play on
        tobacco research and funded by the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, an American industry
        organization, provided an outsider&#x2019;s view of the relationships between the British
        industry and government. This again differentiated the British and US industries. In the US
        the industry took a public relations stance from the outset with a view to defence of future
        legal actions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn045"><sup>45</sup></xref> But the British industry, Little reported, had no knowledge at all of what had been
        funded from its MRC benefaction; industry was not seeking to influence the course of
        research. During his visit, Dr Little moved easily between the scientific cancer research
        community, the MH, where he met the CMO, Sir John Charles, and the Imperial Tobacco company
        offices and laboratories in Bristol. He advised the British industry that it should follow
        the US model and set up a co-ordinating committee to fund research. His idea was that it
        could be an MH advisory committee. In the event the manufacturers set up in 1956/7 the
        Tobacco Manufacturers Standing Committee, subsequently renamed the Tobacco Research
        Committee, which opened its own laboratories in Harrogate in 1962 after the MRC benefaction
        had come to an end. The industry did not make a secret of its connections and referred to
        the US industry research committee in its first published report.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn046"><sup>46</sup></xref> There was criticism of the US industry from the British side, which was uneasy with
        the American industry&#x2019;s public relations approach.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn047"><sup>47</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The tobacco industry connection was also a concern for government because of the revenue
        implications. In February 1954 Macleod as minister of health made a statement to the Commons
        which relayed the advice given by the SAC. This statement was made, as Herbert Brittain of
        the Treasury put it, &#x2018;in language which was in no way dangerous or embarrassing to
        us from the revenue point of view&#x2019;. Macleod himself had commented with cheery
        cynicism in a letter to Boyd Carpenter at the Treasury in January 1954, &#x2018;we all
        know that the Welfare State and much else is based on tobacco smoking&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn048"><sup>48</sup></xref> Tobacco tax was an important part of government revenue (16 per cent of central
        revenue in 1950) and signs of further movement on the causal hypothesis later in the 1950s
        evoked Treasury anxiety. A supplementary answer given by Robin Turton from the MH on 5 March
        1956, where he said there was a causal connection, brought forth enquiries from the
        Treasury; had there been more developments since 1954? Sir John Hawton, the MH permanent
        secretary, replied soothingly,<disp-quote><p>needless to say, we are very conscious of the close Treasury interest in this subject
            and that is one of the things which governs the guarded sort of statements which we have
            so far made&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;If there is any question of our being driven
            to say more than we already have on this subject, we shall of course only do it in
            consultation with you or your people&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;I have a strong
            feeling that we are going to be put under more and more pressure to give more positive
            warnings to the public&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;and particularly from our own
            Central Health Services Council and its Medical
            Committee&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;Until then I don&#x2019;t think there is
            anything we need do and I think that the best policy is to keep the subject as quiet as
            we are allowed to.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn049"><sup>49</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>But the matter was not allowed to remain quiet. It was referred to the full
        cabinet, where it was decided that Turton should make a restrained statement in the Commons.
        Macmillan as chancellor of the Exchequer wanted this held back until after the budget. His
        diary entry for 19 April 1956 read, &#x2018;Cabinet 11.45, Singapore, British Guiana;
        medical views on the dangers of smoking. If we lose Singapore, it&#x2019;s a terrible
        blow to all our Far Eastern interests. If people really think they will get cancer of the
        lung from smoking it&#x2019;s the end of the Budget!&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn050"><sup>50</sup></xref> Politicians at this period were generally cynical about the whole smoking issue,
        apart from its economic implications. Macleod told a House of Commons questioner who wanted
        an American report on smoking and lung cancer published as a White Paper, that dozens of
        reports, all claiming to be authoritative, were being published. &#x2018;If my hon.
        Friend is a heavy smoker and is concerned about the connection between cancer of the lung
        and smoking, I would recommend him to give up reading.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn051"><sup>51</sup></xref> Macmillan commented about the statement to be made in 1956 by the minister of
        health, &#x2018;Cabinet approved a statement to be made by the Minister of Health about
        Tobacco and cancer of the lung. It was a much better draft than the original one. I only
        hope it won&#x2019;t stop people smoking!&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn052"><sup>52</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Economic issues were not the only political consideration. Smoking was politically
        difficult for government, but so too was air pollution, with which the
        smoking&#x2013;lung cancer issue intersected. The issue was also scientifically
        contentious. The text of a TV broadcast on the subject in 1953 after publication of the
        Doll/Hill research on smoking and lung cancer in 1950 gives a sense of the focus on both
        individual and environment. Introduced by Charles Fletcher, later famous for his pioneering
          <italic>Your life in their hands</italic>, the programme was called <italic>Matters of
          medicine</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn053"><sup>53</sup></xref> Dr Guy Scadding, taking part, expressed the views clearly:<disp-quote><p>smoking cannot be called the cause of lung cancer, since non-smokers also get the
            disease, and moreover the increase in cigarette smoking is not likely to be the only
            cause of the increase in the lung cancer death rate. The effect of smoking cannot
            explain the difference in mortality between town and country dwellers. Perhaps the
            effect of air pollution is another factor. If the effects of smoking and general
            pollution of the air&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;reinforce each other, I think that
            most of the known facts about the incidence of lung cancer can be explained.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn054"><sup>54</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>This scientific uncertainty also caused difficulties at the political level, in
        the negotiations which took place in 1957 between the cabinet committee on cancer of the
        lung, which was appointed in that year, and the MRC, which planned to issue a statement on
        the causes of lung cancer. The minutes of the cabinet committee show that both the potential
        of the smoking issue and the issue of air pollution included in the MRC draft statement were
        matters of alarm&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;but that air pollution was more central.</p>
      <p>The MRC, so it was reported to the cabinet committee, had for the first time come to the
        conclusion that the smoking of tobacco had a direct causal relationship to lung cancer and
        therefore there was no alternative but to publicize their conclusions. It was the proposed
        inclusion in the MRC statement that up to 30 per cent of lung cancer might be caused by air
        pollution which caused the greatest political alarm. This would give air pollution, the
        minutes record, &#x2018;unwarranted prominence&#x2019;. The committee thought that
        Professor Bradford Hill and Dr Doll had failed to show any substantial difference in risk
        among non-smokers in greater London and in rural areas. So the politicians asked the MRC to
        re-examine their statement. Both statements, so it was commented, had obvious political
          implications.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn055"><sup>55</sup></xref> On 31 May 1957, Lord Home, the lord president of the council (responsible for the
        MRC), reported back on the changes made in the statement. The MRC had re-examined their
        draft and proposed to modify the references to atmospheric pollution which implied that it
        might be responsible for up to 30 per cent of such deaths. The section would read instead,
        &#x2018;on balance it seems likely that atmospheric pollution plays some part in causing
        the disease, but a relatively minor one in comparison with cigarette smoking&#x2019;. A
        further section was modified to read, &#x2018;A proportion of cases, the exact content of
        which cannot yet be defined, may be due to atmospheric pollution.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn056"><sup>56</sup></xref> The pollution issue was effectively headed off. The 1956 Clean Air Act, passed after
        the great London smog of 1952, was just on the statute book, but had been widely criticized
        for failing to deal with industrial pollution and for only dealing with smoke.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn057"><sup>57</sup></xref> This episode showed that, although government was wary about the smoking and lung
        cancer case as a policy issue, it was infinitely preferable to air pollution. That was the
        issue which government did not want reopened.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn058"><sup>58</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The politics of health education funding and control were also involved. Health education
        had traditionally been conducted by the Central Council for Health Education (CCHE)
        established in 1927, the successor to the British Social Hygiene Council, the interwar
        voluntary body which had conducted health education campaigns. During the war publicity had
        been a central responsibility of the Ministry of Information but after the war
        responsibility was again passed back to the local authorities who were to rate-fund the
        CCHE&#x2019;s work. Central government had no wish to resume funding of these activities
        as discussions of smoking publicity made clear.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn059"><sup>59</sup></xref> But there were also other reasons why there was reticence about health education. An
        MH statement in May 1956 explained why central publicity would not be the right thing.<disp-quote><p>The considerations on publicity concerning smoking and lung cancer differ slightly from
            those on cancer publicity generally in that the special
            point&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;that people might give up
            smoking&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;is not a matter of reporting symptoms. It does
            however concern an individual decision which involves others to a very much smaller
            extent than the subjects of past central public health campaigns.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn060"><sup>60</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>Smoking, it argued, was not a &#x2018;disease&#x2019; in the way cancer
        or indeed infectious disease was. It might lead to disease, but not for many years. The
        notion of long-term &#x2018;risk&#x2019;, as we have seen, was not yet central to
        public health in the 1950s. Publicity would be asking people to curtail a habit which was
        deeply embedded in everyday culture. It might also raise public fear about cancer, which the
        Ministry had been concerned to damp down. Unfounded cancer phobia might generate a demand
        for services at a time when NHS costs were becoming a political issue.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn061"><sup>61</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Conservative politicians were concerned about the implied role of the state. R.&#xA0;A.
        Butler, lord privy seal, commented in May 1956, &#x2018;From the point of view of social
        hygiene, cancer of the lung is not a disease like tuberculosis; nor should the government
        assume too lightly the odium of advising the general public on their personal tastes and
        habits where the evidence of the harm which may result is not conclusive.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn062"><sup>62</sup></xref> This is a theme which emerged consistently throughout the political discussions.
        Politicians were worried about the implications of the &#x2018;nanny state&#x2019;. As
        the minutes of the cabinet committee on smoking record, &#x2018;The Government should not
        seek to intrude into the sphere of an individual&#x2019;s personal responsibility. It was
        however, important to stress this element of personal choice since direct government action
        was excluded.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn063"><sup>63</sup></xref> The focus was also quite different from traditional public health campaigns. One
        civil servant pointed out that any campaign would have to be directed to men (who were the
        majority of smokers) rather than women and children who were the more usual objects of
        public health attention.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn064"><sup>64</sup></xref> It was much easier on many political grounds to leave this to the local authorities.</p>
      <p>Lying behind this discussion was the cultural normality of smoking and its embedding in a
        range of social customs and practices. This was far from the simple continuation of the
        liberal individualism of the gentlemanly culture of smoking which Hilton has ascribed to
        this period.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn065"><sup>65</sup></xref> Tobacco tokens for old age pensioners were issued by government in the 1950s.
        Smoking was also a cross-class activity with its own rituals. The public health researcher
        Walter Holland recalled that for many years after the smoking/lung cancer research had been
        published, Bradford Hill would keep a box of cigarettes in his room at LSHTM. When Holland
        asked him why this was so, Hill was incredulous; it would be impolite not to offer visitors
        a cigarette.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn066"><sup>66</sup></xref> Norman Brook as cabinet secretary was equally amazed at a suggestion that government
        should set trends. &#x2018;Does this mean that Prime Ministers should not
        smoke&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;or at least should not be seen smoking in
        public?&#x2019; he wrote in amazement in 1962.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn067"><sup>67</sup></xref> In the 1970s, when the researcher Nicholas Wald wished to trace the changes in tar
        levels in cigarettes since the 1940s, he was deluged with cigarette stubs and cigarette
        cases containing tobacco which grieving widows had kept as mementoes of their dead husbands.
        &#x2018;His last cigarette&#x2019; had a cultural significance which has become
        &#x2018;hidden from history&#x2019; with the subsequent marginalization of
          smoking.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn068"><sup>68</sup></xref> The cultural aspects of post-war smoking have been surprisingly little
          researched.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn069"><sup>69</sup></xref> For the Labour government of the 1960s these had political implications which will
        be discussed below. Thus policy in the 1950s was being formed in a very different political
        and social climate to that which operated later on. As Doll himself stated in evidence to
        the Commons Health Committee in 1999&#x2013;2000,<disp-quote><p>In retrospect, it may be surprising that resistance to the idea that smoking caused so
            much disease was initially so strong. Three factors, at least, contributed to it. One
            was the ubiquity of the habit, which was as entrenched among male doctors and scientists
            as among other men and had dulled the sense that tobacco might be a major threat to
            health. Another was the novelty of the epidemiological techniques, which had not
            previously been applied to any important extent to the study of non-infectious disease.
            The findings were consequently undervalued as a source of scientific evidence. A third
            was the primacy given to Koch&#x2019;s postulates for determining causation. The
            evidence that lung cancer also occurred in non-smokers was consequently taken to show
            that smoking could not be the cause and the possibility that it might be a cause was
            inappropriately doubted. The manner in which lung cancer was linked to smoking was not,
            however, unique. All the other major diseases related to smoking were found to be so by
            epidemiological enquiry and laboratory evidence of physiological effects that provided
            plausible mechanisms by which smoking might cause them was obtained only later and, in
            some instances, is still awaited.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn070"><sup>70</sup></xref></p></disp-quote></p>

      <p>The policy environment began to change in the 1960s. There was &#x2018;pressure from
        without&#x2019;, and there was an incipient policy lobby or policy community on the issue
        which linked medical or public health interests within government with medical interests
        outside. Within government there was political rethinking of the issue, although the
        electoral arguments still remained strong, even for the Labour government of the 1960s.
        Above all, a &#x2018;new public health&#x2019; for which smoking was the central
        issue, was beginning to consolidate. Even before the Royal College of Physicians (RCP)
        published its first report on smoking in 1962, there were some signs of change. Pressure
        came from Scotland and also from the international level. Scotland, in this as in other
        health issues, was often a catalyst for developments in British health policy more
          generally.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn071"><sup>71</sup></xref> Edinburgh carried out an active health campaign about smoking in 1959, organized by
        the City Corporation in response to the MH circular. The impact of the campaign was assessed
        by the social survey researchers, Ann Cartwright and Fred Martin, newly arrived with John
        Brotherston from LSHTM. Pressure came from the Scottish Office for a more effective health
        education campaign and more extensive government action. In June 1961 a memorandum was sent
        from the Scottish Office which stressed the high and rising incidence of lung cancer in
        Scotland and criticized government policy. Two main policy options were identified: a
        campaign directed at children and young people; and one directed at the whole population
        followed by an increase in the tax on cigarettes. The Scottish Office favoured the latter
        option although recognizing that this would be a new departure in health policy, one area of
        several where the public had to be induced to exercise personal self-restraint.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn072"><sup>72</sup></xref> Policy models were also being developed at the international level. In 1959 the
        relatively newly established WHO published a report on the Epidemiology of Cancer of the
        Lung, the report of a study group in Geneva in November of that year, chaired by Doll. This
        confirmed smoking as a major cause of lung cancer and downgraded air pollution. The model of
        &#x2018;policy transfer&#x2019; is perhaps appropriate here, the transfer of models
        developed in other countries (Scotland) or at the transnational level into national
          policy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn073"><sup>73</sup></xref></p>
      <p>At the same time a &#x2018;policy lobby&#x2019; was emergent on smoking, developing
        as a &#x2018;policy community&#x2019; in the way in which Jordan and Richardson have
        delineated the concept with links into government.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn074"><sup>74</sup></xref> In the 1950s, there had been no real interest group or &#x2018;policy
        community&#x2019; on the issue. Apart from key individuals like Joules, no significant
        lobby was pushing the anti-smoking case, nor indeed was there any consistent policy
        position. The researchers themselves were not activists in this cause. Although Bradford
        Hill had worked within government during the war, he had advised Doll that it was best to
        steer clear of the political dimensions of the research. It was his view that a young
        researcher&#x2019;s career could be tainted by an apparent lack of scientific
          objectivity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn075"><sup>75</sup></xref> Doll&#x2019;s socialist convictions were known and he remained a member of the
        Communist Party until 1957.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn076"><sup>76</sup></xref> Hill remarked towards the end of his life that he had made Doll passionate about
        statistics as a replacement for left-wing politics.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn077"><sup>77</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In the 1960s smoking became emblematic of a new role for medicine as the defining voice in
        the delineation of health risk in post-war British society. George Godber as deputy CMO was
        an important &#x2018;inside&#x2019; influence. He was quietly encouraging Charles
        Fletcher to take the issue through the Royal College as a way of exerting external pressure
        on government.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn078"><sup>78</sup></xref> The need for an outside &#x2018;policy lobby&#x2019; was widely recognized in
        the Ministry. In part this was a way of convincing the CMO, Sir John Charles, who was
        reluctant to act, but also for wider reasons, as a way of giving the issue a significance
        which it might not otherwise have. Godber wrote to Goodman in July 1961, &#x2018;I am
        convinced that a considerable increase in price would do more than anything else to cut down
        consumption but that the pressure to do this should come from unattached scientific bodies
        from the weight of the medical profession&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;and not from any
        official sources.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn079"><sup>79</sup></xref> Enid Russell Smith in the Ministry also recognized the need for an external source
        of pressure so that government could use that to justify action.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn080"><sup>80</sup></xref> That policy lobby was indeed emergent in the late 1950s and early 1960s, comprising
        chest medicine, cancer, and epidemiology; it had moved from the low status Central Middlesex
        Hospital, where many of the specialists had been based, into the medical elite represented
        by the RCP. Robert Platt as president and his modernizing agenda for medicine was a key
        influence as well as the networks of Charles Fletcher.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn081"><sup>81</sup></xref> The role of Godber as CMO provided the link with government and to the international
        level: it was also symbolic that, on retirement, Godber became the chairman of the Health
        Education Council, one of the key institutions which promoted the new public health agenda.</p>
      <p>The RCP report for the first time provided an agenda for action for this community. It
        dropped air pollution as a priority (the committee had originally been intended to consider
        both) and provided an alternative package for government to consider.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn082"><sup>82</sup></xref> More education of the public; more restrictions on the sale of tobacco to children;
        restrictions on advertising; restriction of smoking in public places; increased taxation;
        information on tar and nicotine content; anti-smoking clinics.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn083"><sup>83</sup></xref> Here was the agenda to respond to. And this was for the first time a media agenda as
        well. The College employed a public relations consultant for the first time and held its
        first press conference; the book sold to the public, and there was a
        &#x2018;Panorama&#x2019; programme shortly after its publication in March 1962.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn084"><sup>84</sup></xref> Charles Fletcher&#x2019;s Penguin special on smoking followed a year later.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn085"><sup>85</sup></xref> This was a new era in the role of scientific argument and of the medical lobby. For
        the first time, science was reaching out to the public and using the full panoply of
        marketing and consumer oriented techniques which were then emergent in a post-rationing
        society. The Cohen Report on health education of 1964 and the formation of the Health
        Education Council in 1968 set the seal on the new style of persuasive public health.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn086"><sup>86</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The politics of the issue also began to change, although this change was less apparent by
        the end of the 1960s. Some differences can be identified between the Conservative and Labour
        governments of this decade, but it was rather a question of the attitudes of individual
        politicians rather than one of party political division. After the publication of the first
        RCP report, the government had set up a cabinet committee on smoking which held its first
        meeting in the home secretary&#x2019;s room in the House of Commons on 28 February 1962.
        The tempo was different. The MRC was pressing for action. The publication of the report
        broke a stalemate in government where policy was in limbo; the Ministry was
        &#x2018;waiting for the RCP&#x2019;. Enoch Powell, as minister of health, had seen a
        draft of the RCP report and wrote with characteristic vigour in November 1961:<disp-quote><p>The Government has it in its power, without prohibition or interference directly with
            anyone&#x2019;s freedom of choice, to cut cigarette smoking whenever and to whatever
            extent it pleases. Indeed, given the probable flatness of the demand curve, they could
            combine a big cut in consumption with no reduction, and possibly an increase in revenue.
            If duty were increased for explicitly public health reasons, the opprobrium would be
            much less than with ordinary increases of taxation, and it would be possible to use a
            cost of living index which excluded tobacco (or
            cigarettes)&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;In my opinion if the Government is unwilling
            to use this power&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;then health education and all the rest
            is merely humbug and will be felt and seen to be such. In any case, &#x2018;health
            education&#x2019; has already gone a long way&#xA0;&#x2026; &#xA0;without
            producing the slightest effect, and I don&#x2019;t believe advertising makes any
            difference one way or the other.</p><p>The publication of the Report will excite temporary interest and for weeks afterwards
            we shall have to answer a shower of tiresome Questions about what the Government is not
            doing; but unless my colleague is prepared to use the fiscal weapon, I personally
            propose to indulge in as little humbug as I can get away with.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn087"><sup>87</sup></xref></p></disp-quote></p>
      <p>David Eccles, as minister of education, was &#x2018;gung ho&#x2019; for action, in
        part because of his family background.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn088"><sup>88</sup></xref> But there was in-fighting between the CCHE and the MH about the responsibility for a
        health education campaign. Bruce Fraser, the new MH permanent secretary, was of the opinion
        that the CCHE could not conduct a campaign for central government which was distinct from
        its role in helping the local authorities with their health education work. The lack of
        central government control, when potentially central government money would be spent, was a
        basic sticking point. Various institutional alternatives were extensively discussed, battles
        which were certainly re-run thirty years later over HIV/AIDS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn089"><sup>89</sup></xref> But the two ministries, health and education, did bring a joint memorandum to the
        cabinet committee at its first meeting. This called for a national campaign with further
        restrictions on the sale of cigarettes to children and on smoking in public places,
        restrictions on tobacco advertising, and a differential tax on cigarettes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn090"><sup>90</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Cabinet committees had been briefly formed in the 1950s at the time of the various
        parliamentary statements and had been chaired by the home secretary of the day. Butler as
        home secretary chaired the first meeting of the latest committee. But Macmillan as prime
        minister did not want him in this role and Hailsham as lord president of the council took
        over. The ministerial committee was paralleled by one of officials which did the detailed
        work. Cary, deputy secretary in the cabinet office, was chair of the committee.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn091"><sup>91</sup></xref>A draft report was ready to go to the lord president by the middle of April.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn092"><sup>92</sup></xref> The report, preceded by a flurry of activity in the relevant departments, was
        relatively anodyne, placing its reliance on health education and on voluntary agreements for
        advertising. The officials came down against differential taxation and the taxation option
        in general. This would penalize the poor, raise the cost of living, and have a serious
        effect on producer economies such as Rhodesia. It was underpinned by a belief that more
        restrictive action could not be sustained without major change in public attitudes to
        smoking. The Edinburgh research and the government&#x2019;s own pilot survey of public
        attitudes to smoking through the Central Office of Information had confirmed that most
        people knew about the smoking and lung cancer link, but their views on why smoking was
        harmful to health were different, laying stress on the environmental nuisance aspects rather
        than the risk-based epidemiology.</p>
      <p>In the event education and voluntarism were the keynotes of the response and the committee
        decided not to make a statement. As Hailsham told Macmillan, a small publicity campaign
        would not be welcomed and interest anyway had abated for the present. He proposed to set up
        the machinery and start the campaign, perhaps issuing a statement later on. A meeting with
        the manufacturers might also result in an agreement to apply the TV restrictions voluntarily
        to other advertising so the government could also claim credit for that.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn093"><sup>93</sup></xref> At a subsequent meeting in the House of Lords with representatives of the Tobacco
        Advisory Committee, the lord president said the government accepted the scientific case as
        in the RCP report but was against compulsion and action which would lead to pressure for
        similar measures in respect of alcohol and even foods like chocolate. It was &#x2018;not
        the government&#x2019;s purpose to induce any catastrophic change in smoking
        habits&#x2019;. The meeting resulted in a move towards overall agreement on advertising
        restrictions based on the code applicable to television. On 14 November, Hailsham wrote to
        Maxwell. He felt the informal way this matter had been dealt with was suited to other issues
        as they arose. But he was clear that he was no stooge for industry interests. Someone at
        Carreras had sent him a box of filter-tipped Piccadilly. &#x2018;This was indeed bearding
        the lion in his den, but it was as ineffectual as the devil&#x2019;s attempt on St.
          Anthony.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn094"><sup>94</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The government response was thus muted and focused on a strategy, health education, which
        the health minister recognized as ineffective. The multiplicity of interests in government
        was a key factor. The Treasury view ultimately prevailed over the taxation issue but not
        before the implications had been fully aired at the political level. The role of the
        industry was important, although its representatives were called in after the political
        decisions had been taken. Also behind these decisions was a desire to achieve a balance in
        policy and the realization that, without a huge change in the social positioning of smoking,
        there was little point in initiating a major programme of change.</p>
      <p>The publication of the American surgeon general&#x2019;s report in 1964 led to a further
        officials&#x2019; report and political interest. The American report extended
        associations between smoking and health risk to diseases other than lung cancer, but the
        officials did not feel this warranted further action. Hailsham received a draft and was
        disappointed at their negative conclusions. The Social Survey had focused on smoking and had
        shown that attitudes were changing. On 6 April 1964 he wrote, &#x2018;I consider that the
        American Report, the American action and the Social Survey <italic>have</italic>
        strengthened the case for action, and that it is <italic>not</italic> too early to say that
        our limited campaign is failing and that unless we can bare our teeth nothing that we do
          <italic>will</italic> be taken seriously.&#x2019; He suggested an extension of the
        health education campaign and consideration of banning smoking in cinemas and advertising,
        together with a health warning on packets. He also inserted a significant change in the
        inequality argument deployed by officials. Now the words &#x2018;it would bear more
        hardly on the poor than on the rich&#x2019; were replaced by &#x2018;it could be
        harder for a poor man than for a rich man to continue his existing level of smoking and
        while this element of discrimination might be said to be more to the poor man&#x2019;s
        benefit, it would be unlikely to go uncriticised&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn095"><sup>95</sup></xref> On 30 June the cabinet committee approved the officials&#x2019; suggestion of a
        modest extension of the government health education campaign. There was no support for a ban
        on TV advertising or on smoking in cinemas. Least opposition was attracted by packet
        warnings.</p>
      <p>The minister of health in the succeeding Labour government, Kenneth Robinson, was a doctor
        who took a more active line on smoking. His meetings of individual ministers on the matter
        caused alarm on the part of Burke Trend, the cabinet secretary, who channelled these through
        the Home Affairs Committee in order to stop the proliferation of ad hoc ministerial
        committees on the boundaries of home and economic affairs. Trend also promoted the
        &#x2018;anti nanny state&#x2019; argument which had carried weight with Conservative politicians.<disp-quote><p>But on what grounds are the Government justified in intervening in those cases where a
            man&#x2019;s personal habits may damage only himself? And, if we accept that the
            Government are entitled to intervene in such cases, does this argument apply only to a
            man&#x2019;s physical habits, or does it extend also to his mental
            habits&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;i.e. to what he reads or watches on television? In
            short, where does the argument, if logically pursued, stop?<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn096"><sup>96</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>But the nature of policy was changing. Robinson promoted voluntary agreements
        which led to the disappearance of cigarette advertising from TV. The acceptance of money
        from the manufacturers for research was no longer a straightforward matter. When the issue
        of resumed industry funding was reopened in the mid-1960s, various possibilities came under
        consideration, including an MRC takeover of the industry&#x2019;s new laboratory complex
        opened at Harrogate in 1962, but nothing came of the contacts.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn097"><sup>97</sup></xref> Such requests were seen as calling into question government policy, including the
        banning of TV advertising of cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Electoral considerations about smoking continued to operate, however. Robinson&#x2019;s
        wider proposals were killed off by Richard Crossman when he moved to the Department of
        Health and Social Security in 1968. Both he and the prime minister, Harold Wilson, were
        worried about the electoral implications of smoking restrictions. When Robinson presented a
        draft bill to outlaw cigarette coupons, Crossman&#x2019;s reaction was brusque. He<disp-quote><p>simply blurted out that this was another of those Bills which we simply
            couldn&#x2019;t afford to pass when we were running up to an election because bans of
            this sort made us intensely unpopular, particularly with children and families. If
            you&#x2019;re going to deal with the cigarette smoking problem, you should not try
            this kind of frivolous but intensely unpopular method. There was a tremendously violent
            reaction with everyone saying that here we must stand on moral principle. I heard it
            from Eirene White, Dick Taverne, and Edmund Dell, representing the Board of Trade which
            has switched its junior Ministers around, and, indeed, I only had two or three people on
            my side. However, I&#x2019;m still just powerful enough to hold the thing up and
            finally I suggested that instead of forbidding coupons we should ration the amount of
            money to be spent on advertising and leave it to the cigarette manufacturers to decide
            how they should spend their money. I found this infinitely preferable. Harmony
              achieved.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn098"><sup>98</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>It was significant that Dell, as minister for the department with close links
        to the tobacco industry, supported restriction, not a &#x2018;pro-industry&#x2019;
        approach. Smoking&#x2019;s significance as an electoral issue was changing, although
        electoral concerns were still a strong disincentive to action as this incident
      indicates.</p>

      <p>By 1971, when the RCP published its second report, much water remained to flow under the
        bridge. The end of the 1960s can be see as the &#x2018;end of the beginning&#x2019;
        and a suitable resting point for assessment of the initial policy response. Denial and delay
        is an inadequate framework of assessment and policy science theories are helpful but need
        historicizing. The changes of the 1950s and 1960s were symbolic of a wider paradigm shift in
        the way in which health issues were presented by and to politicians and the public. A new
        role for medicine, the presentation of scientific facts to the public through the media, was
        an important component of the changed situation. The medical reports of 1962 and 1964 made
        risky behaviour by the public a matter for governments; and they made smoking an issue for
        the public. Politicians were engaged: witness Hailsham, Powell, and Robinson, who
        represented an opposite view to those who stressed public opinion. The policies which
        emerged reflected fiscal concerns but also interests like health education, air pollution,
        or the state of public opinion. There was a balancing act across government. The
        central/local tension over control and financing of health education often occupied
        ministers&#x2019; minds as much as its content. Electoral considerations were dominant.
        It would have been unthinkable for governments to impose the public smoking bans of the
        early twenty-first century in the 1950s.</p>
      <p>Network theories are more helpful but need historical development. Networks changed over
        time; and they were not so clearly segmented for and against smoking. The anti-smoking
        policy lobby, absent in the 1950s, consolidated in the 1960s. The negotiations about the
        establishment of the RCP committee and its subsequent report saw the formation of a policy
        community with links into government and also with the outside medical constituency. The
        policy linkages were more complex than the industry versus public health model. In the 1960s
        and after, parts of that lobby also linked with industry round an agenda of &#x2018;harm
        reduction&#x2019;. Historical analysis of post-1945 public health has focused on the
        organizational and professional changes which brought the demise of the medical officer of
        health and his rebirth as the community physician within health services.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn099"><sup>99</sup></xref> Alongside that service-focused world, a &#x2018;new public health&#x2019; was
        forming with an ideology which stressed individual responsibility in the context of
        population-based interventions aimed at persuading the public. This public health was not
        centred on the community physician and drew on different networks and strategies to achieve
        policy change. Smoking was the key issue which acted as the template for much that followed:
        it symbolized a new era of health risk and individual responsibility.</p>
      <p>The historical modifications presented here are also suggestive of the policy uses of
        history. Narrowing historical analysis to policy advocacy undermines its utility for option
        appraisal. Smoking policies and cultural change have passed through stages in the UK in
        which different relationships have operated at different points in time. Policy formation is
        messier and more complex than public health advocates or political science would have us
        believe. We need to take account of such historical analysis as a detached basis for
        discussion of the interaction between evidence, culture, and regulation and its potential
        future implications.</p>

        <p>In a legal case against the Philip Morris tobacco company his testimony argues that in

          without a doubt in the mid-1950s and that controversy was only kept alive by the tobacco
          companies; these focused on public relations activity to keep the controversy going.
