      <abstract>
        <p>We have recently shown that brief episodes of hypothermic perfusion interspersed with periods of normothermic perfusion, referred to as temperature preconditioning (TP), are cardioprotective and can be mimicked by consecutive isoproterenol/adenosine treatment. Here we investigate the optimal temperature for TP and whether TP further enhances protection provided by hypothermic ischemia with or without polarized cardioplegic arrest. Three experimental groups of Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were used. In the first group, hearts were subjected to three episodes of hypothermic perfusion at 7, 17, 26 and 32&#xB0;C during the TP protocol, followed by 30 min normothermic index ischemia and 60 min reperfusion (37&#xB0;C). Protein kinase A (PKA) activity and cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentrations were measured prior to index ischemia. In the second group, TP (26&#xB0;C) hearts were subjected to two hours hypothermic index ischemia at 26&#xB0;C and two hours normothermic reperfusion. In the third group, TP (26&#xB0;C) hearts or hearts treated with isoproterenol/adenosine (pharmacological simulation of TP) were subjected to four hours hypothermic index ischemia with procaine-induced polarized cardioplegia at 26&#xB0;C followed by two hours normothermic reperfusion. Hemodynamic function recovery, lactate dehydrogenase release and infarct size were used to assess cardioprotection. TP at 26&#xB0;C resulted in highest cardioprotection, increased cAMP concentration and PKA activity, while TP at 7&#xB0;C exacerbated ischemia/reperfusion damage, and had no effect on cAMP concentration or PKA activity. TP at 26&#xB0;C also protected hearts during hypothermic ischemia with or without polarized cardioplegia. Isoproterenol/adenosine treatment conferred additional protection similar to TP. In conclusion, the study shows that TP-induced cardioprotection is temperature dependent and is optimal at 26&#xB0;C; TP confers additional protection to hypothermia and polarized cardioplegia; and that the pharmacological treatment based on the mechanism of TP (consecutive isoproterenol/adenosine treatment) is a potential cardioprotective strategy that can be used during heart surgery and transplantation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>We have recently described a novel protocol for cardioprotection that involves subjecting the heart to brief, transient hypothermic (26&#xB0;C) episodes prior to index ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C1">1</xref></sup> The choice of 26&#xB0;C was based on the data of Stowe <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C2">2</xref></sup> indicating that this is the lowest temperature that can be used without impaired contractility. Such temperature preconditioning (TP) is as least as good, if not better than ischemic preconditioning (IP) in terms of hemodynamic function, reduction in arrhythmias, oxidative stress and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C1">1</xref></sup> We have also shown that the signaling pathway mediating TP involves activation of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) followed by activation of protein kinase C (PKC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C3">3</xref></sup> A modest increase in reactive oxygen species has been found to play an important role, and an involvement of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) cannot be excluded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C1">1</xref></sup> The cardioprotective effects of TP, like IP, were associated with decreased oxidative stress at the end of index ischemia and during reperfusion which prevents opening of the mitochondria permeability transition pore (MPTP) leading to both improved contractile function and decreased necrotic damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C3">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Hypothermia is routinely used in conjunction with cardioplegic solutions to protect the heart during open heart surgery. Hypothermia (25&#x2013;27&#xB0;C) affords considerable protection against an expected ischemic insult in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for coronary bypass grafting or valve repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C4">4</xref></sup> This protection is associated with better tissue perfusion, improved metabolic and mechanical function, fewer arrhythmias and reduced infarct size upon reperfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C6">6</xref></sup> Hypothermia may mediate its protection by slowing ATP-dependent metabolism and hence mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C7">7</xref></sup> However, hypothermia also increases intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), which may be harmful to the myocardium. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading during hypothermia may derive from increased net inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> current flux due to markedly increased action potential duration, slowing down Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal mediated by ATP-dependent pumps of the sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C2">2</xref></sup> Hypothermia also diminishes Na<sup>+</sup>-pump activity and increases Na<sup>+</sup> influx via Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C8">8</xref></sup> leading to increased [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. This Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation results in further increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> through inhibition or reversal of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C2">2</xref></sup> Elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> can exert deleterious effects such as hypercontracture that may jeopardize a full return of function on re-warming,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C2">2</xref></sup> eventually leading to circulatory collapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C9">9</xref></sup> Whether the cardioprotective efficacy of TP can also extend to hypothermic ischemic arrest is not presently known.</p>
      <p>Along with hypothermia, cardioplegic arrest remains a popular measure to diminish ischemia-induced myocardial injury during cardiac surgery. Cardioplegic arrest during index ischemia is usually induced by a hyperkalemic extracellular solution that induces depolarization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C10">10</xref></sup> Despite its almost universal usage, depolarized cardioplegic arrest has serious disadvantages including Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in myocardium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C11">11</xref></sup> This can lead to myocardial and microvascular injury, coronary vasoconstriction and spasm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C12">12</xref></sup> arrhythmias,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C13">13</xref></sup> right and left ventricular stunning, and can potentiate the local inflammatory response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C14">14</xref></sup> An alternative to depolarized arrest is to induce electromechanical arrest in a polarized or hyperpolarized state. This will retain ionic homeostasis during ischemia. Sodium channel blockers such as tetrodotoxin, procaine or lidocaine are able to induce a polarized arrest, considerably improving heart preservation during cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C11">11</xref></sup></p>
      <p>However, neither hypothermia nor polarized cardioplegia totally abolishes ischemia-induced myocardial damage. Thus, additional protection is needed to improve heart recovery following global ischemia in these conditions occurring during cardiac surgery. This study was aimed at determining whether TP or its pharmacological mimic (consecutive isoproterenol/adenosine treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C3">3</xref></sup>) confer additional protection to hypothermia and polarized cardioplegic arrest. Prior to this we also sought to establish the optimal temperature for TP-induced cardioprotection.</p>

        <p>All procedures conformed to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996). Ethical approval was granted by the University of Bristol, UK (Investigator number ub/09/012). Male Wistar rats (250&#x2013;260 g) were killed by stunning and cervical dislocation. Hearts (&#x223C;0.75 g) were rapidly removed into ice-cold Krebs&#x2013;Henseleit buffer (KH) and Langendorff heart perfusion was performed. Hemodynamic function was measured throughout all the experiments using a latex balloon in the left ventricle. Data acquisition and analysis used a PowerLab System (ADInstruments, Bella Vista, NSW, Australia). Hemodynamic left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) was calculated as the difference between left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and work index (rate-pressure product, RPP) as the product of LVDP and heart rate (HR). Time derivatives of pressure were measured during contraction (+d<italic>P</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>) and relaxation (&#x2212;d<italic>P</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>). During ischemia, the following parameters were measured: time from the onset of ischemia to complete cessation of contractility (time to zero LVDP), time from the onset of ischemia to start of LVEDP increase due to ischemic contracture (time to ischemic contracture), and maximal LVEDP increase during ischemic contracture (maximal contracture).</p>

          <p>After 36 min preischemia, hearts were cooled by perfusing at 26&#xB0;C for one minute. This brief hypothermic perfusion allows the myocardial temperature to equilibrate with the hypothermic temperature of KH buffer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C1">1</xref></sup> Then the hearts were subjected to global hypothermic ischemia for two hours by halting perfusion and immersing the heart in perfusion buffer at 26&#xB0;C. Normothermic perfusion (37&#xB0;C) was reinstated after the hypothermic ischemia and lasted for two hours. Hearts were divided into two groups according to the preischemic protocol. In hearts of the Control group (<italic>n</italic> = 11), normothermic perfusion was carried out for 36 min. In this series of experiments, hearts of the TP26 group (<italic>n</italic> = 9) were subjected to two cycles of two minutes hypothermic perfusion (26&#xB0;C) interspersed with six minutes normothermic perfusion instead of three cycles used in Experimental series 1. According to our preliminary experiments (data not shown), three cycles may result in LVEDP increase during reperfusion following hypothermic ischemia.

Infarct size was used as an additional indicator of necrotic damage to myocardium in hearts of the Experimental series 2 and 3 where the duration of reperfusion was two hours. This duration of reperfusion is sufficient for identification of infarct size using TTC and has been used in a majority of studies on isolated rat heart.</p>

          <title>Hemodynamic function</title>
          <p>The hemodynamic parameters of control hearts did not change significantly throughout 44 min preischemic perfusion. In all groups of TP hearts, hypothermic perfusion during TP resulted in a considerable decrease of RPP, mostly due to reduced HR. Diastolic pressure was elevated during two minutes hypothermic perfusion. Subsequent restoration of normothermia led to rapid augmentation of contractile function, mainly as a result of increased LVDP. However, some significant differences between the TP groups were apparent during preischemia (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F3">3</xref>). At 32 and 26&#xB0;C, the initial short-term increase of diastolic pressure was followed by a fall to below the initial value. At lower temperatures (17 and 7&#xB0;C), the initial increase in diastolic pressure was much higher, but here a secondary rise was observed during episodes of hypothermia. This was greatest at 7&#xB0;C (Figures&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F3">3</xref>a and b).

        <title>TP is optimal at 26&#xB0;C</title>
        <p>The data presented here demonstrate that the protective effects of TP are critically dependent on the temperature of the short-term episodes of hypothermic perfusion, with 26&#xB0;C giving the best protection. During global normothermic ischemia, hearts of the TP26 group showed the shortest time to zero LVDP, the longest time to start of ischemic contracture and the lowest increase of diastolic pressure during ischemic contracture. We have previously shown that these effects reflect better preservation of high-energy phosphates in the TP26 hearts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C1">1</xref></sup> These hearts also had the highest hemodynamic function recovery and the lowest LDH release during reperfusion (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F4">4</xref>) indicating the lowest necrotic damage to the myocardium. TP at either lower (17&#xB0;C) or higher (32&#xB0;C) temperatures was not as protective, while the use of 7&#xB0;C actually exacerbated reperfusion injury and was associated with lower hemodynamic recovery and higher LDH release than in the control hearts.</p>
        <p>One reason for the deleterious effect of TP at 7&#xB0;C may be an excessive accumulation of calcium in the myocardium as a result of an imbalance between active and passive ion membrane transport.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C17">17</xref></sup> During hypothermia, ATP-dependent ion channels become inhibited while Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> diffusion are less affected. An imbalance between the activity of the ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum and the ryanodine receptors may also contribute to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation during hypothermia as may the activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger. The severity of this imbalance depends on temperature. Thus, it has been shown that moderate hypothermia reduces membrane-bound Ca<sup>2+</sup>-pump activity while severe hypothermic storage abolishes it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C19">19</xref></sup> Stowe <italic>et al.</italic> showed that at 27&#xB0;C, paced hearts adapt functionally to the greater accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during diastole by reducing the rate of release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, at 17&#xB0;C, despite the very prolonged release and re-uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> over the cardiac cycle, diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading becomes so marked that relaxation is impaired, and contractility decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C2">2</xref></sup> The dependence of the LVEDP on the temperature of the hypothermic episodes during TP (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F3">3</xref>) is consistent with this. Thus, the lowest LVEDP was found in TP32 hearts while the highest value of this parameter was in TP7 hearts (Figures&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F3">3</xref>a and b). The increased diastolic pressure can be explained, at least partially, by a higher accumulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> at greater hypothermia. This hypothesis can be supported by the observation that rapid cooling of the myocardium to 1&#xB0;C causes contracture as a result of calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C20">20</xref></sup> It seems likely that at 7&#xB0;C, Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation is substantially greater than at 26 and 17&#xB0;C and contributes to the greater ischemia/reperfusion damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C21">21</xref></sup> However, moderate intracellular calcium accumulation before prolonged ischemia has been reported to be protective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C23">23</xref></sup> and may play a role in the cardioprotective effects of TP, which our data suggest is optimal at 26&#xB0;C.</p>
        <p>The considerable rise of LVDP and RPP during re-warming (Figures&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F3">3</xref>c and d) may also be partially explained by Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in cardiomyocytes during hypothermia. However, it may also involve PKA activation by the release of endogenous catecholamines during hypothermia, which in turn may modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Indeed, TP at 26&#xB0;C (TP26) significantly increased cAMP concentration and PKA activity leading to cardioprotection during ischemia and reperfusion (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C3">3</xref></sup> and Figures&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F2">2</xref>a and b). Interestingly, we found no difference in these parameters in TP7 hearts compared with controls (Figures&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F2">2</xref>a and b). This finding is consistent with a higher RPP elevation in TP26 hearts compared with TP7 hearts after the second short-term episode of hypothermic perfusion (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F3">3</xref>c). It would appear that severe and/or prolonged hypothermia, if not supported by other protective measures, switches off the mechanism(s) responsible for the myocardial response to <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-adrenergic stimulation. This would affect the ability of the heart to regain its contractility during re-warming and also disrupt the signal transduction pathways of TP, thus explaining why TP7 hearts experienced greater ischemia/reperfusion damage than control hearts. By contrast, short-term episodes of hypothermic perfusion at &#x223C;26&#xB0;C stimulate this <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-adrenergic response, enabling hearts to survive better during prolonged ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C3">3</xref></sup></p>

        <title>TP protects hearts against prolonged hypothermic ischemia</title>
        <p>A number of studies have demonstrated the ability of IP to protect the heart against prolonged hypothermic ischemia, which may occur during cardiac surgery and heart transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C25">25</xref></sup> In these experiments, mild to moderate hypothermia (32&#x2013;17&#xB0;C) was employed.

There are some similarities in the signaling mechanisms of IP and TP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C3">3</xref></sup> suggesting that TP might confer additional protection to hypothermic preservation of hearts as does IP. The nature of the TP protocol might make it more effective than IP in providing such protection and our data confirm this to be the case. TP26 hearts showed significantly improved hemodynamic function recovery, and dramatically reduced LDH release and infarct size after two hours ischemia at 26&#xB0;C (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F5">5</xref>). Hypothermia reduced both the speed of decline of LVSP during ischemia and the extent of ischemic contracture. Yet even under these conditions, TP26 was still able to shorten the time to zero LVDP and reduce ischemic contracture. As the key cause of ischemic contracture is lack of MgATP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C27">27</xref></sup> it is possible that the TP26 protocol enhances ATP preservation during ischemia at 26&#xB0;C over and above the energy sparing effect of hypothermia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C28">28</xref></sup> just as we observed during normothermic ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C1">1</xref></sup> Depletion of ATP during ischemia together with oxidative stress during reperfusion promotes opening of the MPTP that ultimately causes irreversible damage to myocardium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C29">29</xref></sup> We have recently shown that TP26 strongly inhibits MPTP opening during reperfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C3">3</xref></sup> and this might be explained, at least partially, by its ability to preserve myocardial ATP levels.</p>

However, it has been shown that the Na<sup>+</sup> &#x2018;window&#x2019; current during depolarized cardioplegia would lead to increased intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] through the calcium &#x2018;window&#x2019; current.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C30">30</xref></sup> High [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> may also be caused by calcium influx through the slow calcium channel and reversed activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C11">11</xref></sup> This would lead to contracture, calcium overload and subsequent myocardial injury, particularly during reperfusion. A potential way to address this problem would be to induce a polarized arrest at membrane potentials closer to the normal &#x2018;resting&#x2019; membrane potential. Agents with local anesthetic effects (such as procaine and lidocaine) are available clinically and have been widely used either alone or in combination with other agents to induce cardiac arrest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C31">31</xref></sup> Their beneficial effects include reduction of ionic imbalance leading to reduced energy utilization, and hence improved protection from a cellular perspective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C10">10</xref></sup> However, the protective effect of polarized cardioplegia is also time-limited. Thus in our experiments, hemodynamic recovery of control hearts, arrested prior to four hours global hypothermic ischemia (26&#xB0;C) with 1 mmol/L procaine, was very poor. These data confirm the observation that cardiac surgery continues to be limited by an inability to achieve complete myocardial protection from ischemia&#x2013;reperfusion injury despite the use of hypothermia and cardioplegic arrest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C32">32</xref></sup> Furthermore, a number of studies indicate very restricted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C24">24</xref></sup> or no ability of IP to improve heart recovery after cardioplegic arrest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C33">33</xref></sup> However, TP26 was able to improve hemodynamic function recovery and significantly reduce necrotic damage under these conditions (Figure&#xA0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357F6">6</xref>). Therefore, a pharmacological treatment based on the mechanisms of TP could be beneficial when using polarized cardioplegia for hypothermic heart preservation during cardiac surgery and transplantation. We have recently shown that the key mechanism of TP is the consecutive PKA and PKC activation. We induced activation of these kinases pharmacologically, using a non-selective <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and a PKC activator adenosine. This consecutive isoproterenol/adenosine treatment protected the isolated rat heart against normothermic global ischemia very effectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EBM-1011-RM-357C3">3</xref></sup> Here we demonstrate that such consecutive treatment can also protect the heart against prolonged ischemia during hypothermia and polarized cardioplegic arrest just as effectively as TP. Because pharmacological treatment is easier to perform than short-term episodes of hypothermia during cardiac surgery, this treatment may provide an intervention that will help to protect hearts in these conditions yet has much greater clinical potential than TP.</p>
