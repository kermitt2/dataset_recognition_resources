        <p>Apoptosis provoked by glucose shortage in dividing T cells is mediated via the BH3-only protein Noxa and inhibition of its binding partner Mcl-1. It is unknown how signals from cellular metabolism can affect the balance between Mcl-1 and Noxa and to what extent other Bcl-2 members are involved in this apoptosis cascade. Here, we defined the mechanism underlying apoptosis in relation to various types of metabolic stress. First, we established that the Noxa/Mcl-1 balance is regulated by glucose deprivation as well as by general metabolic stress, via changes in proteasome-mediated degradation of Mcl-1. Second, in contrast with cytokine-deprivation, no transcriptional modulation of Mcl-1, Puma, Bim or Noxa was observed during glucose deprivation. Third, no changes in PKB or GSK3 activity occurred and no clear role for AMPK was detected. Fourth, apoptosis triggered by nutrient deprivation was executed without signs of overt autophagy and independent of ROS production or p38 MAP kinase activity. Lastly, apoptosis under nutrient limitation could also be delayed by knock-down of Bim or overexpression of Bcl-2. In conclusion, Noxa functions in a specific apoptotic pathway that integrates overall nutrient stress, independent from attenuated PI3K/PKB signaling and without clear involvement of autophagy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Growth factors and nutrients are essential for lymphocyte survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Deprivation of these metabolic resources initiates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, which is marked by the release of apoptogenic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, such as cytochrome c. Upstream in this cascade, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak are directly involved in the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Their function is inhibited by protective Bcl-2 members (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-XL, A1 and Bcl-w). The pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (e.g. Bim, Bid, Noxa, Puma) constitute the third sub-group of this family and are suggested to function as sentinels that integrate distinct extracellular and intracellular insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>Dividing lymphocytes, such as antigen-activated T cells, are highly dependent on nutrients in order to fulfill their metabolic requirements. Triggering of growth factor receptors or of the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 in conjunction with the T cell receptor promotes glucose uptake by augmenting the expression of cell surface glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) in a PKB-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of an apoptotic route coupling nutrient shortage to Bcl-2 family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We have demonstrated that during TCR-mediated activation, human T cells upregulate the expression of the BH3-only protein Noxa, and that the balance between Noxa and its pro-survival binding partner Mcl-1 dictates the apoptosis susceptibility of dividing lymphocytes to glucose shortage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently, we have shown that the dynamic balance between Noxa and Mcl-1 controls the formation of the effector T cell pool in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Apart from growth factors and glucose, cells require essential anabolic building blocks derived from amino acids. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bim have been shown to play a role in this apoptotic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but how cellular metabolic stress signals integrate and activate apoptosis executors remains largely unexplored. Various studies have demonstrated a PI3K-dependent transcriptional and post-translational control of Bcl-2 family members for the induction of apoptosis following growth factor withdrawal. De novo expression of BH3-only proteins Bim and Puma mediated by the forkhead transcription factor 3a (FoxO3a) is a key cellular event caused by attenuation of PI3K/PKB signaling following growth factor deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, PI3K/PKB controls inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) activity, which targets Mcl-1, the antagonist of Puma, Bim and Noxa, for proteasomal degradation following IL-3 or glucose deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Alternatively AMPK, the cellular sensor of energy, has been associated with the control of Mcl-1 protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, this pro-survival molecule has emerged as a common target in apoptosis caused by growth factor and nutrient starvation. However, our understanding of the signaling pathway(s) in response to metabolic stress that converge on Mcl-1 still contains significant gaps.</p>
      <p>In this study we questioned how intracellular signaling in response to metabolic stress couples to the proteins Mcl-1 and Noxa. We investigated whether their engagement is restricted to glucose shortage, or may involve other types of nutrient stress. We demonstrate that Noxa is involved in apoptosis caused by general deprivation of nutrients, and that this occurs independently of upstream PI3K components, AMPK and MAP kinases.</p>

        <title>Mcl-1 is targeted to the proteasome during apoptosis provoked by glucose limitation</title>
        <p>Both activated T cells and transformed cells switch their glucose catabolic metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (the so-called Warburg effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). Cells cultured under low glucose concentrations readily deplete glucose from the medium and undergo apoptosis due to a gradual decline in Mcl-1 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The decrease in Mcl-1 might be regulated at the transcriptional level, subsequent to caspase activation after the onset of apoptosis and/or via a post-transcriptional mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. First, we investigated whether Mcl-1 or other Bcl-2 family members were transcriptionally regulated in T lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Jurkat cells, clone J16). The relative mRNA expression of members of the Bcl-2 family, including Mcl-1, Bim and Noxa, as detected by RT-MLPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], did not change significantly despite apoptosis induction. In contrast, levels of survivin, a gene regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], decreased concomitantly with the reduction in cell division (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and data not shown).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>Mcl-1 is targeted to the proteasome during apoptosis provoked by glucose limitation.

Mock transduced (Mock) or cells with stably knocked-down Noxa levels (N8.15) were washed in cultured in fresh IMDM at 25&#xA0;mM glucose (<italic>Higlu, closed symbols</italic>) or for 3 days in DMEM at 5&#xA0;mM of glucose (<italic>Loglu, open symbols</italic>). Then, cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and viability was measured 24&#xA0;h later by mitotracker staining. Results shown are the averaged results (&#xB1;SEM; note that the error bar is smaller than the symbol) of triplicate measurements performed at least twice</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10495_2011_599_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
        <p>We next investigated whether the decline in Mcl-1 degradation required caspase activation. Using either the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD or J16 cells transduced with dominant-negative caspase-9, the processing of caspase-3 was prevented following glucose deprivation. Yet, the decline in Mcl-1 protein still occurred under these conditions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), indicating that this labile protein is subject to post-transcriptional regulation. Recently, Pradelli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] described that during acute glucose deprivation, Mcl-1 protein turnover is maintained, but its levels are decreased by a translational block of Mcl-1 transcripts via activation of AMPK. To investigate whether Mcl-1 turnover was affected during gradual glucose deprivation, its half-life was compared before or after 3&#xA0;days of culture in low-glucose conditions. Surprisingly, when translation was blocked using cyclohexamide, Mcl-1 half-life was reduced approximately three fold, whereas the half-life of Noxa was not significantly affected (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Accordingly, the Noxa/Mcl-1 ratio increased almost 20 fold on day 3, compared to day 0. Inhibition of proteasome activity by MG132 induced accumulation of both proteins, as previously shown ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and data not shown).</p>
        <p>Proteasome inhibition induces apoptosis in cells from the hematopoietic lineage, at least in part via accumulation of Noxa protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. If protesomal degradation of Mcl-1 regulates apoptosis in response to glucose deprivation, then MG132-induced cell death should not be affected by glucose deprivation. In addition, reduction of Noxa levels should provide an equal survival advantage under conditions of high and low glucose. Mock transfected Jurkat cells (Mock) and cells in which Noxa was stably knocked down (N8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] were exposed to various doses of MG132 after 3&#xA0;days of culture in medium with 5&#xA0;mM glucose, or cultured in fresh medium with 25&#xA0;mM glucose. As previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], Noxa ablation provided a survival advantage under conditions of low glucose (data not shown). In addition, N8 cells had a survival advantage after treatment with MG132. However, glucose deprivation had no overt effects on the survival of both Mock and N8 cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, since the effects of proteasome inhibition did not grossly alter the apoptosis rates under glucose deprivation and/or of Noxa knock-down, no other mechanism than proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 seems to be the determining factor.</p>

      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Decrease in Mcl-1 levels following glucose deprivation is independent of AMPK and GSK3 activity</title>
        <p>Next, we attempted to identify the intracellular signaling components responsible for Mcl-1 degradation following glucose deprivation. AMPK is critical for sensing energy levels (ATP/ADP/AMP ratios) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Since limiting glucose concentrations will negatively influence energy metabolism, AMPK is a candidate to be involved in this process.</p>
        <p>First, we measured ATP levels in relation to apoptosis when Jurkat cells were cultured under low starting concentrations of glucose (5&#xA0;mM). After 2&#xA0;days in culture, ATP levels were decreased equally in Mock and N8 cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). N8 cells retained slightly higher ATP levels after 3&#xA0;days in culture, most likely due to increased cell survival and persistent ATP production. Surprisingly, no differences in AMPK phosphorylation were observed in either Mock or N8 cells after 2&#xA0;days of culture under limiting glucose concentrations. Instead, a consistent decrease in activated AMPK occurred after several days (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). These data indicate that degradation of Mcl-1 is not associated with AMPK activation.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>Decrease in Mcl-1 levels following glucose deprivation is independent of AMPK and GSK3 activity. <bold>a</bold>&#x2013;<bold>d</bold> Mock transduced (Mock) or cells with stably knocked-down Noxa levels (N8) were cultured under low starting concentrations (5&#xA0;mM) of glucose. <bold>a</bold> Viability over time relative to day 0, assessed by mitotracker positivity. <bold>b</bold> ATP levels over time (RLU/10e6 cells relative to day 0). <bold>c</bold> AMPK phosphorylation.

One representative experiment of seven performed is shown (<bold>d</bold>) PKB and GSK3 phosphorylation.

        <p>It has been shown that during glucose deprivation, attenuated PI3K/PKB signals activate GSK3&#x3B2;, which targets Mcl-1 to the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In Jurkat cells, neither PKB or GSK3&#x3B2; seemed to function as potential upstream regulators in this process, as neither the activity of PKB nor the repressive phosphorylation of GSK3 was diminished (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). This was observed in both control cells and cells with reduced Noxa levels, and thus also excluded possible feed-back loops triggered upon apoptosis. Accordingly, we found no difference in apoptosis sensitivity of these cells to inhibition of PKB with Ly294002 or Wortmannin (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Since Jurkat cells have excessive PKB activity due to PTEN deletion, we also investigated Mcl-1 degradation in the IL-3-dependent cell line TF-1 under similar conditions as described above. A strong link between cytokine deprivation, GSK3 activity and Mcl-1 stability has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and was therefore compared with glucose-deprivation mediated cell death. TF-1 cells rapidly died following IL-3 deprivation, which could be largely prevented by the GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 (SB). Glucose deprivation also induced apoptosis, but this was not significantly affected by SB (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). Mcl-1 levels decreased during IL-3 and glucose deprivation, which could be reversed by re-addition of IL-3 or glucose respectively. Mcl-1 levels were maintained when SB was added to IL-3 deprived cells, but not to glucose-deprived cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). Our data indicate that these processes are mediated via different molecular pathways. Accordingly, whereas IL-3 deprivation resulted in reduced levels of phosphorylated GSK3, which could be reversed by adding IL-3, glucose deprivation did not have an effect on the phosphorylation levels of GSK3 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g). Inhibition of AMPK activity by Compound C did not reduce apoptosis levels after IL-3 or glucose deprivation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h), demonstrating with a complementary approach that this signaling molecule does not play a major role in our experimental system. In summary, these data indicate that gradual glucose deprivation results in Mcl-1 degradation and apoptosis in an AMPK and GSK3-independent manner.</p>

        <title>The Noxa/Mcl-1 axis mediates apoptosis provoked by overall nutrient limitation</title>
        <p>In our experimental system, cells are not shifted abruptly from 25&#xA0;mM to 0&#xA0;mM glucose as done previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Instead, cells gradually deplete glucose from the culture medium at a starting concentration of 5&#xA0;mM glucose, mimicking a more physiological situation of hypoglycemia. Under these conditions, a gradual shift in glucose metabolism occurs, which may lead to different stress responses. To investigate this hypothesis, we determined whether the signals that engage Mcl-1 and Noxa emerged during glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. In a competitive outgrowth experiment between WT Jurkat and N8 cells under glucose limiting conditions, pyruvate was supplemented to bypass glycolysis and to provide direct substrates for the citric acid cycle. The addition of pyruvate or glucose delayed apoptosis as detected by a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in both populations in a similar fashion, as assessed by mitotracker staining (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#xA0;3</label><caption><p>Apoptosis under glucose shortage is prevented by addition of pyruvate.

        <p>During metabolic crisis, loss of MMP may represent a reduction in catabolic rate and not necessarily apoptosis. Therefore, we tested whether reduced MMP correlated with another standard means of apoptosis measurement, AnnexinV<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/PI<sup>&#x2212;</sup> cells on day 1 and 3. We observed only very minor differences between these two methods of measurements (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). These findings indicate that in our culture system MMP loss is equivalent to &#x2018;classical&#x2019; apoptosis measurement.</p>
        <p>Next we analyzed whether changes in Noxa or Mcl-1 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d) correlated with sensitivity of Jurkat cells to disruption of the citric acid cycle with the specific aconitase inhibitor SFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This inhibitor induced apoptosis after 48&#xA0;h, suggesting that despite the high dependence of dividing cells on glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the responsible stress signals that trigger apoptosis likely derive from oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, a survival advantage for cells with reduced levels of Noxa was observed. In contrast, cells with low Mcl-1 levels displayed increased sensitivity to SFA (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e), indicating that the Noxa/Mcl-1 axis plays a role in apoptosis mediated by inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation.</p>
        <p>During prolonged culture under starting conditions of high glucose (25&#xA0;mM) we observed that N8 cells have a modest survival advantage. Interestingly, glucose concentrations stayed well above levels considered hypoglycemic in vivo (&lt;3&#x2013;5&#xA0;mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and lactate was produced from the start of the experiment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). These results suggest that deprivation of other nutrients could also engage the Noxa/Mcl-1 apoptotic axis. To test this, we next cultured cells under conditions of high glucose, but with low levels of anabolic supplements, such as amino acids and vitamins (12.5% of normal values). Apoptosis occurred with clearly different kinetics compared to complete medium but again N8 cells displayed a survival advantage (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), and the level of Mcl-1 decreased concomitantly with apoptosis induction (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The cells ceased dividing, suggesting that inhibition of anabolism triggered apoptosis. To corroborate a link between deprivation of anabolic building blocks and Noxa, the anabolic pentose phosphate pathway was disrupted by the specific inhibitor 6-AN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A clear survival advantage was observed in cells with reduced Noxa levels, whereas cells with low Mcl-1 levels were more sensitive to this compound (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Together, these data suggest that the Noxa/Mcl-1 axis participates in apoptosis initiated by overall nutrient stress.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#xA0;4</label><caption><p>The Noxa/Mcl-1 axis mediates apoptosis provoked by overall nutrient limitation. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Untransduced J16 cells (GFP<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) were mixed initially at 1:1 ratio with either Mock or N8 J16 cells (GFP<sup>+</sup>) and cultured in complete medium or medium with reduced levels of amino acids/vitamins (12.5% of normal levels in complete medium) (right).

        <title>Apoptosis instigated by nutrient shortage occurs in the absence of overt autophagy</title>
        <p>Many cell types subjected to starvation undergo autophagy, an evolutionary conserved intracellular degradation process that is instigated via the mTOR complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Since both glucose and nutrient starvation can induce autophagy, we investigated whether this molecular pathway may be the underlying mechanism linked to Noxa and Mcl-1. Compared to cell lines that readily induce autophagy during starvation such as the U251 astrocytoma cell line, Jurkat cells appeared less prone to undergo autophagy. This was demonstrated by low levels of lipidized LC3, a well-known autophagy marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], when these cells were cultured under low glucose or in the absence of amino acids (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Inhibition of the mTOR complex by rapamycin did induce conversion of LC3-I into the lipidized LC3-II form in Jurkat cells. High concentrations of rapamycin resulted in cell death, which was not affected by changes in Noxa levels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>bi). When cultured under limiting conditions of glucose or amino acids and vitamins, no LC3 lipidation was observed even though N8 displayed enhanced survival (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>bii and data not shown).

        <p>Glucose deprivation induces oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and this may activate the MAP kinases p38 and/or JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Increased ROS production was indeed observed upon glucose deprivation, which correlated with the induction of apoptosis but this could not be delayed by addition of the ROS-scavenger N-acetylcysteine (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). A slightly increased phosphorylation of p38 at the onset of apoptosis was detected, and phosphorylation of JNK or the pro-survival MAP kinases ERK1/2 was unchanged. Compared to control stimulation with PMA/ionomycin which occurs in minutes, the level of p38 activation was modest after several days of glucose deprivation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). However, no difference in ROS production or MAP kinase activation between control and N8 cells was observed under these conditions. In addition, Mcl-1 levels were not influenced by external addition of ROS (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), or by intracellular production of ROS following stimulation with CCCP. Also, addition of NAC during glucose deprivation did not prevent Mcl-1 decline (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c, d), while it was capable of completely abrogating the pro-apoptotic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] of CCCP (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#xA0;6</label><caption><p>Noxa/Mcl-1-dependent apoptosis pathway instigated by nutrient shortage occurs is independent of ROS production (<bold>a</bold>) MAP kinase phosphorylation.

Mcl-1 overexpressing cells displayed decreased sensitivity to death-stimuli such as serum deprivation and CD95-triggering.

        <title>Apoptosis provoked by glucose limitation involves the BH3-only member Bim</title>
        <p>The pro-apoptotic effects of BH3-only proteins depend on the Bcl-2 like proteins they are able to antagonize. Noxa binds exclusively to Mcl-1 and to A1/Bfl-1 and is therefore considered a weak inducer of apoptosis. Other BH3-only proteins, like Bim, (t)Bid and Puma bind all Bcl-2 like family members and may directly induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Hence, apart from Noxa, the apoptosis induced by glucose shortage may involve other BH3-only proteins.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The induction of Noxa sensitizes dividing human T cells to apoptosis induced by glucose withdrawal, but not to other apoptotic stimuli such as serum deprivation, CD95 triggering or staurosporin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Here, we further clarify the role of Noxa in the context of metabolic and growth factor deprivation pathways, using Jurkat T cells and erythroid TF-1 cells as a model. We find that Noxa has a specific role upon general metabolic stress in an apoptotic response which does not involve upstream components of the PI3K/PKB/GSK3 path, AMPK or autophagy. Downstream, the function of Noxa converges into an apoptotic signaling cascade involving Mcl-1 and Bim, which are involved in a broad range of apoptotic stress responses.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that neither decreased Noxa or Bim levels, nor increased Mcl-1 expression could completely block apoptosis in response to metabolic stress. In accordance with current knowledge on the interaction between Bcl-2 family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], functional redundancy between proteins will ultimately always cause apoptosis, except in the case of Bax/Bak double deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The study described here therefore only identifies factors that influence apoptotic-sensitivity to metabolic stress. Since Noxa is considered a &#x2018;weak&#x2019; inducer of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], additional pro-aoptotic molecules, such as Bim will most likely be required to induce cell death. The proteins which are absolutely detrimental are as of yet unclear, but will never involve only a single pro- or anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member.</p>
      <p>Activated T cells markedly shift their catabolism as well as their anabolic requirements. In our study we addressed whether Noxa is involved solely in the apoptotic response to glucose deprivation, or is also engaged by other metabolic stress situations. Reduced levels of Noxa conferred a survival advantage when cells were supplied with pyruvate as energy source, when the citric acid cycle was disrupted or when the pentose phosphate pathway was blocked. In addition, Noxa levels affected the apoptotic response to general nutrient depletion (i.e. amino acids, vitamins). These data indicate that in addition to glucose shortage, Noxa regulates apoptosis induced by general metabolic stress.</p>
      <p>Mcl-1 is the predominant pro-survival binding partner of Noxa, and its expression is essential for lymphocyte survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Previously, we described that the decrease in Mcl-1 protein upon nutrient deprivation renders dividing lymphocytes susceptible to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Here, we established in more detail that the decline in Mcl-1 level is regulated post-transcriptional via proteasomal degradation and independent from caspase activation. Although Mcl-1 is generally considered as an intrinsically labile protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], our findings emphasize that its half-life is subject to regulation depending on the metabolic status of the cell. Since it is reported that the engagement with Noxa in fact controls the half-life of Mcl-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], this implies that signals conveying metabolic stress may indeed converge on Noxa.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, a very recent report shows that under homeostatic conditions Cdk5 may phosphorylate Noxa and its phosphorylated form then stimulates aerobic glycolysis. After (acute) glucose deprivation, kinase activity of Cdk5 was diminished, after which unphosphorylated Noxa exerted its pro-apoptotic role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Surprisingly, the phosphorylation state of Noxa did not appear to have a major influence on its interaction with Mcl-1, suggesting that Cdk5-mediated Noxa-phosphorylation does not influence Mcl-1 protein levels. In addition, we did not observe that altered Noxa levels influence metabolic rates (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Differences in the experimental systems applied may underlie these divergent results.</p>
      <p>Increased proteasomal targeting of Mcl-1 and subsequent apoptosis was previously also observed upon growth factor deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This process is mediated by GSK3, which is activated following decreased PKB phosphorylation. However, in different cell lines we observed no decrease in PKB or GSK3 phosphorylation upon glucose deprivation and Mcl-1 decline or apoptosis could not be prevented with GSK3 inhibitors. IL-3 deprivation on the other hand did result in GSK3 mediated Mcl-1 degradation. This suggests that growth factors and nutrient starvation use two different signaling pathways that converge at the level of Mcl-1 degradation to induce apoptosis.</p>
      <p>In seeming contrast with a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we observed a gradual decrease in AMPK activity in glucose-deprived Jurkat cells, which correlated with a decrease in Mcl-1 protein. Various observations may account for this apparent discrepancy. First, AMPK is involved in a broad range of metabolic stress responses and intersects with signaling pathways such as PKB and mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Importantly, in primary T cells and leukemic Jurkat cells, TCR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling also activates AMPK, and this occurs independently of increased AMP/ATP ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Second, the often used activator of AMPK, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells which is reportedly independent of AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Third, since we applied a gradual decline of glucose levels, rather than an abrupt loss of glucose or inhibition of glycolysis, as is often applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], previously unappreciated compensatory mechanisms may occur. These mechanisms may be related to the same general metabolic stress response that mediates cell death after amino acid and vitamin deprivation. Further studies targeting AMPK in various experimental systems may provide more insight into this question.</p>
      <p>Likely candidates to regulate metabolic stress responses are the MAPK signaling pathway, autophagy or reactive oxygen species. All of these are related to nutrient starvation-induced cell death and all have been shown to activate mitochondrial apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, in this study we exclude an overt role for these signaling mediators in Noxa-dependent apoptosis triggered by glucose deprivation. Future studies are required to dissect the molecular connection between sensors of cellular energy and metabolism and apoptosis involving the Noxa/Mcl-1 axis. It appears that primary and leukemic T cells posses both TCR/Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and ATP/AMP-dependent routes to AMPK activation, which may reflect their intrinsic capacity for rapid cell division and adaptation to metabolic changes.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our data indicate that Noxa sensitizes cells to metabolic stress in a response that targets Mcl-1 for proteasomal degradation, and also involves the concerted action of Bim.</p>

        <p>Cells were transferred to phenolred-free medium (Gibco) and incubated with DHE (14&#xA0;&#x3BC;M; Molecular Probes) for 20&#xA0;min at 37&#xB0;C. The MFI of cells within the viable gate, caused by DHE oxidation, was measured over 1&#xA0;min per sample on a FACScalibur.</p>

        <title>SDS-PAGE and western blotting</title>
        <p>After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were either lysed in laemmli sample buffer or NP40 lysis buffer with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein contents were determined by the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Depending on the protein detected, 30&#x2013;50&#xA0;&#x3BC;g of protein per lane was separated by SDS-PAGE (13%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-FL, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Proteins were visualized by staining immuno-blots with anti-Noxa (Biocarta Carlsbad, CA, USA), anti-Mcl-1 (BD Pharmingen), anti-Bim (Stressgen, Canada), anti-&#x3B2;-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA); Anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175), anti-phospho-PKB(Thr308), anti-phospho-PKB(Thr306), anti-phospho-Erk1/2(Thr202/Tyr204), anti-Erk1/2, anti-phospho-p38(Thr180/Tyr182), anti-AMPK, anti-phospho-AMPK (Thr172), anti-p38, anti-phospo-Jnk1, 2/3 (Thr183/Tyr185), and anti-JNK 1,2/3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-phospho-GSK3&#x3B2; (Ser9) and anti-GSK3&#x3B2; were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-LC3 (Sanbio BV, The Netherlands) was a kind gift from F.B. Mullauer. Staining was visualised using IRDye 680 or 800 labeled secondary antibodies and an Odyssey Imager (Li-Cor). Quantification of signal was performed using Odyssey 3.0 software.</p>

        <p>Total RNA for Reverse Transcriptase Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (RT-MLPA) was extracted using the Trizol isolation method (Invitrogen). mRNA levels were analyzed with the Apoptosis RT-MLPA kit R011 (MRC-Holland, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mlpa.com">http://www.mlpa.com</ext-link>) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Samples were mixed with ROX500 and run on an ABI 3130 capillary sequencer in Genescan mode. Data was analyzed with GeneMapper (Applied Biosystems GmbH; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.appliedbiosystems.com">http://www.appliedbiosystems.com</ext-link>) and subsequently with Excell software (Microsoft), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

        <title>Retroviral constructs &amp; retroviral infection</title>
        <p>To knock-down Bim, we used the pSuper-Bim vector kindly provided by Dr. Andreas Villunger (Innsbruck, Austria), containing the human Bim targeting sequence (referred to as Bimi), described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Overexpression of Mcl-1 was accomplished by cloning myc-tagged Mcl-1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], provided by Prof. J. Borst, in the LZRS-GFP vector. Retroviral particles and transductions were done as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The efficiency of transduction was estimated by determining the percentage of green fluorescence protein (GFP)-positive cells, 2&#x2013;3&#xA0;days later, by flow cytometry. GFP-positive cells were sorted on a FACS sorter (Moflow; Dako-Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA) to &gt;90% purity for further experiments. To improve knock-down of Bim or Noxa in J16 cells, a limiting dilution of transduced population was performed according to standard procedures. Resulting clones (N8.15, Bimi18, Bimi19) were selected based on GFP, and further characterized by Western blot.</p>
