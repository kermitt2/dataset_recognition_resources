          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p>To generate and characterize a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor and to develop an antiresorptive strategy using this mAb as an osteoclast-targeting platform that selectively targets osteoclast cells whilst delivering an attached (i.e. chemically conjugated) active drug cargo.</p>

          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Using hybridoma technology, we generated a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor and characterized by SDS PAGE, ELISA, Western Blot and immunocytochemistry, then synthesized osteoclast-targeting bioconjugates of salmon calcitonin (sCT) using this antibody by generating thiol groups on mAb using 2-Iminothiolane and subsequently reacting them with sCT-PEG-MAL synthesised from sCT and NHS-PEG-MAL. To test the efficacy of the conjugate <italic>in vitro</italic>, osteoclasts were generated from precursor RAW 264.7 cells by dosing with the cytokines macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and RANK Ligand (RANKL) and TRAP activity assay, Resorption Pit Assay, TRAP staining were performed. Cytotoxicity of the mAb-sCT conjugate was also evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells; sCT bioactivity and CTR binding potential were evaluated by <italic>in vitro</italic> intracellular cAMP stimulation assay in human T47D breast cancer cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Generation of antibody against human RANK receptor was confirmed by SDS PAGE, ELISA and Western Blot. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the osteoclast targeting potential of the antibody. Successful conjugation of the antibody with sCT was confirmed by SDS PAGE and ELISA.Multinucleated osteoclast formation was confirmed by staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Conjugate functionality was confirmed by TRAP activity and Resorption Pit assay, showing the inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation. cAMP assay confirmed the retention of calcitonin bioactivity after conjugation.</p>

          <p>Our strategy offers the potential for a &#x201C;universal&#x201D; osteoclast-targeting platform&#x2014;one that targets the RANK receptor on osteoclast cells by simply altering the conjugated cargo in order to affect the specific regulation of osteoclast cells.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Osteoclasts are the cells uniquely responsible for dissolving both the organic and inorganic components of bone during development and are part of the bone remodeling cycle throughout life. These cells originate from hematopoietic precursors of the monocyte/macrophage lineage that are present both in the bone marrow and peripheral circulation, and their numbers and/or activity are frequently increased in a wide range of clinical disorders that are associated with excessive bone loss and which affect millions of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Osteoporosis is a major metabolic bone disease that predisposes patients to fracture in up to 40% of aging women and 15% of aging men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). The increase in bone resorption is due both to increased osteoclastogenesis and to decreased osteoclast apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). Osteoclasts may also play a role in the etiology of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), the most common form of arthritis. At an early stage of disease pathogenesis, there is a phase of increased bone resorption and turnover in periarticular subchondral bone volume and an increased number of osteoclasts, prior to later stage sclerosis and eburnation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). Similarly, increased osteoclast functional activity is directly responsible for the generalized bone loss that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that an antiresorptive strategy that selectively targets osteoclasts and/or carries an active drug to osteoclast cells directly would be highly desirable as a therapeutic to treat bone disease involving upregulated osteoclast activity.</p>
      <p>Osteoclast cells express the RANK receptor (receptor activator of nuclear factor Kappa B) and in effect serve as ideal molecular targets. RANK is expressed on osteoclast precursors as well as mature osteoclasts. RANK is the essential signaling receptor for osteoclast differentiation during the process of osteoclastogenesis, as triggered by the osteoclast differentiation factor known as RANK-ligand (RANKL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). RANK signaling, with additional signaling through c-Fms, the receptor for macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), triggers the proliferation and fusion of mononuclear cells and the formation of multinucleated, mature osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>).</p>
      <p>Mature osteoclasts will also express the calcitonin receptor upon its surface, which has been known for decades as a prominent negative controller of bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). Calcitonin receptors are of the G protein-coupled receptor family (comprising seven transmembrane-spanning receptor domains) whose signaling will inhibit osteoclast activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). Calcitonin receptor activation upon osteoclasts, by its ligand calcitonin, will rapidly induce the loss of ruffled border and immobility followed by cell retraction and arrest of bone resorption. Calcitonin receptor signaling will also alter ion transporter distribution, impair enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>) and inhibit the osteoclastogenic effects of RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>).</p>
      <p>Since antibodies have exquisite specificity of target recognition and, thus, generate highly selective outcomes following their systemic administration, our purpose was to develop a &#x201C;universal&#x201D; osteoclast-targeting platform as a drug-delivery strategy in order to deliver antiresorptive drugs using an anti-RANK mAb capable of localizing to the cells responsible for bone resorption. We have chosen salmon calcitonin as a model drug, as it acts on the calcitonin receptor also found on bone-resorbing osteoclasts.</p>

        <title>Preparation of Anti-RANK Monoclonal Hybridoma Cell Lines</title>
        <p>Monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the RANK receptor was generated using Hybridoma technology, as previously performed in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Briefly, 6&#x2013;8-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally three times with 25&#xA0;&#x3BC;g of recombinant human sRANK receptor (Peprotech, USA) on days 0 and 14 using complete and incomplete Freund&#x2019;s adjuvant, respectively, and once with 10&#xA0;&#x3BC;g of antigen on day 28 using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.3). The immune response to the antigen was assessed by measuring the titer of polyclonal antibody in mouse serum using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mice with the highest antibody titer were euthanized and splenectomized 3&#xA0;days after the final injection of antigen. Spleen cells were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells at a ratio of 4:1 using 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Sigma, USA) according to the technique described previously by K&#xF6;hler &amp; Milstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). The hybridoma cells were suspended in culture medium (RPMI 1640) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, L-glutamine (PSG), hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine (HAT), and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma, USA). Cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated in a humidified 37&#xB0;C, 5% carbon dioxide incubator for 2&#xA0;weeks. Clones were maintained in HAT medium for a further 2&#xA0;weeks.</p>
        <p>Hybridoma cell lines were screened by an indirect ELISA. The cell lines producing specific antibodies were recloned successively 3&#x2013;7 times by limiting dilution to ensure monoclonality and stability of the cell line. Hybridoma cell lines were then propagated in large 175&#xA0;cm<sup>2</sup> tissue culture flasks, and the conditioned supernatant collected. Purification of IgG mAbs was achieved by affinity chromatography using Protein G agarose (Sigma, USA). The IgG immunoglobulin subclass was determined using the mouse hybridoma isotyping reagents according to instructions from the manufacturer (Sigma, USA).</p>

      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)</title>
        <p>All ELISAs were performed in flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Nunc-Immuno MaxisorbTM plates, Nunc). Antibody secretion by hybridoma cells was detected by indirect ELISA. Briefly, 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;l of antigen (human sRANK receptor) was used for coating at a concentration of 1&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/100&#xA0;&#x3BC;l, overnight at 4&#xB0;C. The wells were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.3) and, to avoid nonspecific binding, incubated with 3% BSA for 1&#xA0;h at room temperature. After washing, the wells were incubated with 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;l supernatant from each hybridoma clone for 1&#xA0;h at room temperature. After washing, bound antibodies were detected using secondary goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (GAM-HRPO) at a 1:5000 dilution for 1&#xA0;h at room temperature. After final washing, 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;l of 3,3&#x2032;,5,5&#x2032;- tetramethylbenzidine (TMB substrate) was added to each well and incubated for 15&#xA0;min at room temperature. The optical density (OD) was measured at 650&#xA0;nm using an ELISA Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., California, USA). The clones showing ELISA values five times higher than the negative control were considered positive. Sera of unimmunized mice and irrelevant antibody were used as negative controls. RPMI media and positive sera from hyperimmunized mice were used as blank and positive control, respectively.</p>

        <title>Characterization of Anti-RANK Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
        <p>Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed on purified antibody under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. Antibody was mixed with loading buffer and run in 10% polyacrylamide gel, with the thiol reagent 2-Mercaptoethanol added to the loading buffer for reducing conditions (to cleave the disulfide bonds between the polypeptides). Gels were stained with Coomassie blue for protein band detection of individual heavy and light chains of the antibody.</p>
        <p>ELISA was performed as above, using 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;l RANK receptor for coating at a concentration of 1&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/100&#xA0;&#x3BC;l, overnight at 4&#xB0;C. To avoid nonspecific binding, the wells were incubated with 3% BSA for 1&#xA0;h at room temperature. After washing, the wells were incubated with different concentrations of antibody for 1&#xA0;h. The wells were washed with PBS, and the bound antibodies were detected using secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase) for 1&#xA0;h. After final washing, 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;l of TMB substrate was added to each well and incubated for 15&#xA0;min. The optical density (OD) was measured at 650&#xA0;nm.</p>
        <p>For Western blot analysis, RANK receptor (19.3&#xA0;kDa) was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using mini trans-blot apparatus. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS-T for 1&#xA0;h, washed with PBS-T, cut into strips, and incubated with purified mAb solution for 1&#xA0;h. After washing, strips were reacted with GAM-HRPO for 1&#xA0;h, and the binding of mAbs to RANK receptor was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. For the negative control, the primary antibody was omitted, and the antigen strip incubated with PBS.</p>

        <title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
        <p>To confirm the RANK receptor targeting potential of generated mAb <italic>in vitro</italic>, osteoclast-like cells were generated in Lab Tek II chamber slide system (Nunc) from RAW 264.7 cells, as described below for generation of osteoclasts. The MG-63 osteoblast-like cell line known to lack RANK receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>) was used as negative control. Likewise, osteoclast cell culture omitting primary mAb was also used as a method negative control. Cell cultures were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 5&#xA0;min and rinsed thoroughly. After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS for 1&#xA0;h, the cells were incubated with our anti-RANK mAb (4 &#x3BC;g/ml) overnight at 4&#xB0;C. Antibody detection was carried out using rabbit anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:100; Sigma, USA) for 60&#xA0;min at 4&#xB0;C. To visualize cell nuclei, slides were counterstained with 1.5&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml 4-6-diamidino-2 phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) diluted in PBS. Culture slides were separated from their chambers, mounted and photographed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 710 with ZEN software and the microscope the Observer.Z1).</p>

          <title>Synthesis of Thiol-Reactive Calcitonin Analogue</title>
          <p>To generate thiol-reactive calcitonin analogue, synthetic salmon calcitonin (sCT, Calbiochem, USA) in DMSO (13.72&#xA0;mg/ml) was mixed with NHS-PEG-MAL (Creative Biochem, USA) in DMSO (51&#xA0;mg/ml) (Sigma,USA) in 1:3 molar ratio. DMSO was chosen as the reaction medium because of the instability of NHS and sCT in aqueous solutions. sCT is further highly soluble and highly stable in DMSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). The reaction between the primary amines in sCT and NHS group of NHS-PEG-MAL was allowed to proceed at room temperature with constant stirring for 45&#xA0;min. sCT has three primary amines at residues Lys 11, Lys 18 and the N-terminus, which can react with the NHS functional group of NHS-PEG-MAL to generate three intermediate conjugates: mono-, di- and tri-substituted thiol reactive sCT analogues (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p>

          <title>Generation of Osteoclasts</title>
          <p>Osteoclast-like cells were generated in culture from RAW 264.7 cells (transformed murine monocytic cell line), purchased from the American type culture collection (ATCC, VA, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>). RAW 264.7 cells were cultured to confluence in a 75&#xA0;cm<sup>2</sup> flask in GIBCO High Glucose 1X Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, CA, USA) containing 4.5&#xA0;g/L D-Glucose, L-glutamine, and 110&#xA0;mg/L sodium pyruvate, with the addition of 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin added (10,000&#xA0;U/mL; Invitrogen, USA). Confluent cells were harvested by scraping, centrifuged at 1,500 RPM, and resuspended in 25&#xA0;mL of culture medium. The number of cells in the suspension was measured using a Bright-Line Hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific, PA, USA) and seeded at a concentration of 2&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>3</sup>cells/well in 96-well culture plates (Corning) and placed in the CO<sub>2</sub> incubator overnight to allow the cells to attach to the surface. After 24&#xA0;h, the culture medium was replaced with media containing 25&#xA0;ng/ml macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and 50&#xA0;ng/mL RANKL (PeproTech, NJ, USA). Osteoclasts were successfully generated by dosing with M-CSF and RANKL every 48&#xA0;h over the course of 7&#xA0;days. To confirm the generation of multinucleated osteoclast-like cells, the cultured cells were stained for the enzyme tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using the Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase TRAP Kit from Sigma-Aldrich (St.Louis, MO, USA), according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts were visualized by light microscopy and photographed.</p>

Peptide factors 50&#xA0;ng/ml RANKL and MCSF 25&#xA0;ng/ml were added to the culture, with or without the addition of 100&#xA0;nM of mAb, 100&#xA0;nM of mAb-sCT, or 100&#xA0;nM of sCT. The medium and factors were replaced every 48&#xA0;h. Osteoclastogenesis was assessed by the spectrophotometric measurement of TRAP activity on day 7. Briefly, the medium was aspirated, and the cell monolayer washed twice with PBS. The cells were then lysed with 100 &#x3BC;l of 0.2% Triton X-100 in water (v/v) for 10&#xA0;min. TRAP activity in the cell lysate was determined using an Acid Phosphatase Assay Kit (Cayman chemical, USA). The assay utilizes para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as a chromogenic substrate for the TRAP enzyme. In the first step, acid phosphatase dephosphorylates pNPP. L-tartrate, an inhibitor of non-tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, provided in the kit was used to measure TRAP enzyme activity. In the second step, the phenolic OH- group was deprotonated under alkaline conditions, resulting in p-nitrophenolate that yields an intense yellow color, which was measured at 405&#xA0;nm using a microplate reader.</p>

        <title>Osteoclast Generation and Confirmation by TRAP Staining</title>
        <p>Osteoclasts were generated by dosing the RAW264.7 cells with RANKL and MCSF. The staining for TRAP is a technique commonly used to visualize osteoclasts. The principle behind staining of TRAP involves the use of napthol AS phosphates in conjunction with fast garnet GBC salts for the detection of acid phosphatase. This diazonium fast garnet GBC salt was selected because it couples rapidly at acid pH, forming insoluble dye deposits. Napthol AS-BI, released by enzymatic hydrolysis, couples immediately with fast garnet GBC salt, resulting in the formation of insoluble maroon deposits at sites of activity. Tartaric acid was used in order to demonstrate the presence of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. Hence, cells containing tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatase are devoid of activity, and only the cells containing tartrate acid-resistant phosphatase show maroon dye deposits at the sites of activity. Staining confirmed that the presence of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclast-like cells was limited to those wells dosed with exogenous M-CSF and RANKL, under the cell culture conditions described (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Osteoclasts are the only cells capable of resorbing mineralized bone. However, current antiresorptive therapies do not specifically target the osteoclast cell and elicit systemic side effects in cells other than osteoclasts. For example, the development of duodenal ulcers, gastric erosions and potentially even osteonecrosis of the jaw or catastrophic low energy fracture of the femoral shaft have all been associated with differing classes of bisphosphonates, the most commonly prescribed medication for osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>). Estrogen hormone replacement therapy stimulates uterine and breast tissue, which predisposes the patient to neoplastic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). Leg muscle cramps, joint aches and deep vein thrombosis has been associated with selective estrogen receptor modulator therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>). Similarly, conventional salmon calcitonin has shown limitations in antiresorptive efficacy, likely in part because of poor bioavailability to bone cells and the undesired uptake of the drug by calcitonin receptors present in tissues other than bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>).</p>
      <p>Since the pharmacological arrest of the osteoclast is the mainstay of treating systemic bone loss, drug delivery strategies that target the osteoclast directly would provide a potential therapeutic advantage at reducing systemic bone loss by selectively delivering an antiresorptive drug &#x201C;cargo&#x201D; to the osteoclast. Antibodies are renowned for their exquisite specificity of target recognition and generate highly selective outcomes following their systemic administration. As the RANK receptor is predominantly expressed on the surface of mature osteoclasts, we hypothesized that an anti-RANK antibody would facilitate an effective osteoclast targeting platform for the delivery of antiresorptive drug directly to the resorbing bone cells.</p>
      <p>Salmon calcitonin, a single chain polypeptide hormone consisting of 32 amino acids, was chosen as a &#x201C;model&#x201D; drug for this study, as sCT therapy is known to inhibit and/or slow osteoclast-mediated resorptive bone loss, whilst positively influencing osteoinduction and bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Hence, we designed a conjugative strategy whereby calcitonin would be coupled to an antibody directed predominantly against osteoclast-specific receptors, in order to impart osteoclast specificity to the attached calcitonin &#x201C;cargo.&#x201D; Delivery of sCT to the osteoclast cells by virtue of an antibody-mediated targeting platform would ensure that the calcitonin drug remained primarily localized to bone tissue after systemic administration. This would directly contrast with the passive interaction of calcitonin with other tissues that express the calcitonin receptor, such as kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen, heart and thyroid. Hence, a delivery system capable of improving sCT targeting and localization to osteoclast could have a potential to positively impact sCT therapy, whilst reducing the drug concentration in non-bone loci containing the calcitonin receptors.</p>
      <p>Using hybridoma technology, we generated and characterized a specific monoclonal antibody against recombinant human RANK receptor, and chemically coupled synthetic sCT to that anti-RANK mAb carrier. We further PEGylated sCT in the process of conjugation by using the polymer polyethylene glycol, which is known to improve the major disadvantages of conventional sCT by increasing solubility, stability, and efficacy and reducing the immunogenecity. It has also been established that PEGylation enhances the enzymatic stability of calcitonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>) against proteolysis, by forming an effective shield against degradative enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>) whilst improving its efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> by increasing molecular size, thus contributing to reduced renal filtration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>) allowing less frequent administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>).</p>
      <p>The synthesized bio-conjugate was initially characterized using SDS-PAGE analysis and ELISA. Protein band above 150&#xA0;kDa was observed for the conjugate under non-reducing condition of SDS-PAGE analysis, and some bands were seen above 50&#xA0;kDa and 25&#xA0;kDa under reducing condition, thus suggesting that conjugation of PEGylated sCT with mAb had occurred. An ELISA further verified the successful conjugation of sCT to our mAb, as the anti-calcitonin secondary antibody reagent would only detect immobilized calcitonin residues that were part of the primary anti-RANK conjugates that were binding to the RANK-coated wells of the ELISA plate. A slight signal was observed for PEGylated sCT, and we assume that this could be due to the reaction of thiol reactive MAL functional group of PEGylated sCT with the free thiol group in BSA used as a blocking agent. In the case of conjugate, such MAL groups were utilized in the reaction with free thiol groups generated in antibody.</p>
      <p>In order to verify the efficacy of mAb-sCT conjugates, we employed <italic>in vitro</italic> osteoclast-like cell cultures. It is well established that osteoclasts are derived from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and are formed after the cellular fusion of their mononuclear precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). Hence, we utilized the RAW 264.7 cell line that can be differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> into osteoclast-like cells after exposure to M-CSF and RANKL cytokines. RANKL is the essential factor necessary for osteoclast differentiation, whilst M-CSF (also known as CSF-1) has also been identified as an essential factor necessary to initiate osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>). The main role of M-CSF is to act as a survival factor for osteoclast precursor cells and to induce the expression of the RANK receptor for stimulation by the RANKL.</p>
      <p>Immunocytochemistry confirmed the osteoclast targeting potential of our generated anti-RANK mAb <italic>in vitro</italic>. Fluorescent staining of our anti-RANK mAb was specifically localized to cellular surface receptors. DAPI staining showed the successful generation of multinucleated osteoclast-like cells. No demonstrable FITC staining was seen for negative controls. These results support the evidence that osteoclast-like cells generated from RAW 264.7 precursor cells express the RANK receptor, and our generated anti-RANK antibody can be used as a potential osteoclast targeting platform. The successful generation of osteoclast-like cells was also confirmed by TRAP staining, which confirmed multinucleated cells with maroon-colored dye deposits due to the presence of TRAP, the enzyme that has been used as a marker of osteoclast function for more than 20&#xA0;years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>).</p>
      <p>To determine the <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy of the anti-RANK mAb-sCT conjugate on osteoclast activity, we quantified osteoclast activity using a spectrophotometric total culture TRAP activity assay and a mineral resorption assay. TRAP has been shown to be a specific and sensitive indicator of bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>) and contributes to the intracellular processing of primary bone matrix degradation products prior to its final release through the basolateral membrane of resorbing osteoclast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>). Osteoclasts, as the bone-resorbing cells of the body, further show the ability to dissolve the mineralized inorganic phase of bone matrix known as hydroxyapatite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>). We found that the use of our conjugate in culture significantly reduced TRAP enzyme activity as compared to sCT alone, and use of the mAb alone also showed inhibition of TRAP enzyme activity. Although the cause for this effect shown by our anti-RANK antibody alone has not been tested, we speculate that in binding the RANK receptor, the antibody may be functioning as a receptor antagonist. That competitive binding would interfere with the interaction of RANKL with RANK, an essential step of osteoclast differentiation. Nonetheless, further antiresorptive and/or anabolic effector functions could be attributed with the development of a targeted delivery strategy to osteoclast cell receptors. We further evaluated if the mAb-sCT conjugate had an effect on the ability of osteoclasts to resorb bone. We cultured osteoclast-like cells on calcium phosphate-coated culture plates in the presence of conjugate, antibody or sCT. We found that both the conjugate and the mAb alone were capable of significantly reducing the resorption of mineral layer as compared to the sCT alone. Then, we performed cyclic AMP assay to confirm that bioactivity of conjugated calcitonin. Human breast carcinoma T47D cells known to express the calcitonin receptor were used for this purpose. Binding of sCT with its receptor activates adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme responsible for the generation of cAMP. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> cAMP assay results confirmed that the modification of sCT by conjugation did not interfere with its ability to bind the calcitonin receptor and trigger its biological activity. We measured the conjugate to have increased activity over calcitonin alone, and the exact reason for that effect is still not clear. It is likely our conjugation strategy allowed one mole of antibody to become conjugated with greater than one mole of calcitonin. It has been reported that when IgG is treated with a 10 molar excess of Traut&#x2019;s reagent, 3-7 thiol groups are generated, which may result in the attachment of 3-7 PEGylated calcitonin molecules per molecule of IgG.</p>
      <p>The results obtained so far have been quite encouraging from the generation of antibody and to the synthesis and <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation of the conjugate. The conjugate and the antibody alone showed good efficacy in TRAP activity inhibition and resorption pit assay. However, cAMP assay showed that the conjugate served the purpose of delivering active drug cargo. The conjugate showed the ability to bind the calcitonin receptors and generate intracellular cyclic AMP, thus showing an advantage over the antibody alone.</p>
      <p>With the advent of novel RANKL-scavenging antibody-based antiresorptive strategies (such as Denosumab&#x2013; Prolia&#xAE;, Amgen Inc.), it may further prove efficacious to target the RANK receptor directly with an antibody, in order to successfully antagonize receptor signaling and osteoclast function. However, neither the &#x201C;scavenging&#x201D; nor &#x201C;antagonist&#x201D; motives of those antiresorptive strategies focus on the targeted delivery of a given drug cargo (such as our anti-RANK mAb-conjugate design) which would function as a universal osteoclast targeting platform.</p>
      <p>One potential limitation of our osteoclast targeting platform remains that RANKL-RANK signaling is not entirely restricted to osteoclasts and their precursors, but is known to be involved in the regulation of other cell types. Studies have that RANKL-RANK signaling controls the development of lactating mammary glands in pregnancy, with the highest levels being at day 15.5 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>). Several studies that looked at transgenic Rankl-/- and Rank-/- mice found that there was a complete absence of lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>). This led to further studies involving patients with an osteoclast-poor form of the autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), where they found the cause of the disease to be various mutations in RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>). The same research then found that these patients showed no palpable signs of lymph nodes, further strengthening the theory that RANKL-RANK signaling is involved in lymph node formation in humans. RANK is further known to be expressed by monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells, specialized immune cells programmed to capture and process antigens in the body and present them to na&#xEF;ve T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>). However, the targeting of drug &#x201C;cargo&#x201D; to the RANK receptors of those cells may not necessarily result in drug action with those cells if the cargo is carefully chosen not to affect those cell types. For example, it is highly unlikely for any cell (other than the mature osteoclast) to express both the RANK receptor and calcitonin receptor at the same time. Thus, the Boolean &#x201C;and/or&#x201D; logic can be applied to the selection of the differential cargo targeting to cellular phenotypes expressing the RANK receptor at any given time. The extent of this limitation remains to be fully determined, however, should not necessarily preclude the further exploration of RANK receptor targeting strategies, which may in turn provide a more comprehensive understanding of RANK signaling and crosstalk with other signaling pathways.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>This study details the generation of an antibody-mediated osteoclast-targeting platform. This drug-delivery strategy may find utility as &#x201C;a universal osteoclast-targeting platform&#x201D; in order to directly target and deliver antiresorptive agents, anti-inflammatory agents, cathepsin K inhibitors, disintegrins, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitors, and so on, directly to osteoclast cells. We have shown this platform is capable of being employed as an antiresorptive strategy, and our efforts will now center on the <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of this targeting strategy.</p>
