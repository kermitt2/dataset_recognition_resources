      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Aims:</italic> Many countries experience persistent or increasing
                    socioeconomic disparities in specialist care. This study examines the
                    socioeconomic distribution of elective surgery from 1992 to 2003 in Finland.
                        <italic>Methods:</italic> Administrative registers were used to identify
                    common elective procedures performed in all public and private hospitals in
                    Finland in 1992&#x2013;2003. Patients&#x2019; individual
                    sociodemographic data came from 1990&#x2013;2003 census and employment
                    statistics databases. First coronary revascularisation, hip and knee
                    replacement, lumbar disc operation, cataract extraction, hysterectomy and
                    prostatectomy on residents aged 25&#x2013;84 years were analysed.
                    Age-standardized procedure rates by income quintile were calculated for both
                    genders, and concentration indices were developed and applied to
                    age-standardized procedure rates in 5% income groups for each study year.
                        <italic>Results:</italic> Most procedure rates increased during the study
                    period. Three trends emerged: declining inequality for coronary
                    revascularisations, an increase and then a decline in cataract extractions and
                    primary knee replacements among men, and positive relationships between income
                    and treatment for hysterectomy and lumbar disc operations.
                            <bold><italic>Conclusions:</italic> Our results suggest that structural
                        features &#x2013; uneven availability, co-payments and plurality of
                        provision &#x2013; sustain inequity in access; decreasing inequities
                        reflect directed service expansion. Increased attention to collective,
                        prospective funding of primary and specialist ambulatory care is required to
                        increase equity of access to elective surgery.</bold></p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Equity in health and healthcare are considered to be important goals for health
                policy in Finland, as in other industrialized countries. Despite universal access to
                healthcare having been enshrined in law for decades, many countries, including
                Finland, continue to report socioeconomic inequalities in treatment rates in
                ambulatory care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494808098505">1</xref>]. In
                specialist care, similar results have been reported in Finland. In an earlier study
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494808098505">2</xref>], covering 1988 and
                1996, overall hospital use was found to be greater in lower socioeconomic groups
                than among better-off groups. However, affluent patients underwent common, planned
                surgical procedures more frequently. A general trend of increasing disparities was
                found in the content of care both overall and in individual procedures and surgical
                diagnostic categories from 1988 to 1996. Similar but narrowing disparities have been
                reported in coronary revascularisations; in revascularisations, a large increase in
                operation rates took place in this time period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494808098505">3</xref>]. Similar results on disparities in
                elective operations have also been reported from other countries with similar
                healthcare systems, e.g. in terms of hip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494808098505">4</xref>] and knee replacements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494808098505">5</xref>] and coronary
                revascularisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494808098505">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494808098505">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>This article examines elective surgery as a case study for access to specialized
                hospital treatment from 1992 to 2003. Elective surgery is a useful exemplar for
                studying access to specialist care, since it exhibits a strong element of discretion
                on the part of health service providers as to how and when treatment is offered.</p>

        <title>Data</title>
        <p>Hospital data from 1992 to 2003 were used to assess changes in the socioeconomic
                    distribution in the use of common surgical procedures. Data on selected elective
                    procedures were obtained from the Finnish Care Register, which covers all
                    hospital discharges in all public and private hospitals in Finland. The study
                    population consisted of all people resident in Finland between 1992 and 2003
                    aged 25&#x2013;84 years at the beginning of each year.</p>
        <p>Seven procedures were selected to study socioeconomic differences in rates of
                    common and usually elective surgical procedures: coronary revascularisation,
                    primary hip replacement operation, primary knee replacement operation, lumbar
                    disc operation, hysterectomy, prostatectomy, and cataract operation. Coronary
                    revascularisations included coronary artery bypass grafting for the whole study
                    period, as well as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCAs) from
                    1994 onwards. PTCAs performed in 1992&#x2013;93 were missing, since they
                    were not recorded in the Finnish Care Register before 1994. According to
                    statistics from the Finnish Heart Association, PTCAs covered approximately
                    one-quarter of revascularisations during those 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494808098505">8</xref>]. For hip replacements, those
                    performed in the context of a fracture of the femur (ICD 10 code S72, ICD 9
                    codes 820&#x2013;821) were excluded. Surgical operations were coded
                    according to the classification of procedures of the Finnish Hospital League
                        [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494808098505">9</xref>] until 1996,
                    and thereafter according to the NOMESCO classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494808098505">10</xref>]. Since cataract operations can be
                    performed in private outpatient clinics, and therefore not be included in the
                    discharge records of the Finnish Care register, the data were complemented with
                    information on operations from the Social Insurance Institution register for
                    reimbursed healthcare use. Additionally, since subsequent operations are likely
                    to be related to preceding ones and thus cannot be considered as independent
                    observations, we focused on first operations. We considered that first
                    operations best illustrate access to, and selection for, hospital care. Access
                    to subsequent operations is more likely to reflect assessed clinical need and
                    willingness to remain engaged with services, factors that require separate
                    analyses.</p>
        <p>The hospital data were individually linked to sociodemographic data from
                    Statistics Finland using the personal identification code unique to each
                    resident in Finland. Each record was linked with information referring to 31
                    December of the preceding year. Persons who were not permanent residents of
                    Finland and those under 25 or over 84 years of age at the beginning of the entry
                    year were excluded from the data. Year of procedure was approximated by the date
                    of hospital admission, since the exact date of procedure event could not be
                    specified. Age was defined as on 31 December of the year before the data entry
                    and classified into 5-year age bands in order to match the age groups in
                    population at risk tables. Family disposable income from the year preceding data
                    entry was derived from the employment statistics, and adjusted for family size
                    using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
                    equivalence scale. The study population was classified into income groups
                    according to family disposable income, based on limits derived from the
                    population at risk tables. Patients who were in long-term institutions were
                    excluded from the data, since family income cannot be determined for this group
                    reliably from the registers used.</p>
        <p>For statistical analyses, the population at risk was defined as the resident
                    Finnish population aged 25&#x2013;84 years. Tabulated data on the
                    population at risk was derived from 1995 census data and the employment
                    statistics for the study years by each of the sociodemographic variables used in
                    the study. This study was approved by the STAKES research ethics committee, the
                    data protection measures were agreed with Statistics Finland, as the proper
                    statistical authority, and the data linkages were considered to be appropriate
                    by the office of the Finnish data protection ombudsman.</p>

        <p>Annual age-standardized rates for first elective surgical procedures were
                    calculated for men and women separately, using the direct method of
                    standardisation. The resident Finnish population from 2003 was used as the
                    standard population.</p>
        <p>In order to explore the socioeconomic distribution of different aspects of
                    hospital care, the distributions of elective operations by income-20ths were
                    analysed using the concentration curves of hospital utilisation. Concentration
                    indices (CIs) were determined to quantify the degree of income-related
                    inequality in these operations. Annual age-standardized CIs were calculated for
                    each elective procedure, separately for men and women. We used the approach of
                    calculating CIs for grouped data presented by Kakwani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494808098505">11</xref>] and van Doorslaer

                    annual percentage changes were calculated for age-standardized operation rates.
                    Changes in the socioeconomic distribution of elective surgical procedures were
                    analysed by estimating linear trends from linear regression models for annual
                    CIs, taking into account the uncertainty by using the inverse of the standard
                    errors as weights. Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS system for

      <p>Procedure rates tended to increase during the study period, especially for coronary
                revascularisations, primary knee replacement operations and cataract operations,
                both among men and among women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494808098505">Table I</xref>), with rates for these operations doubling during the study
                period. The rates for primary hip replacement operations increased more modestly.
                Lumbar disc operation, hysterectomy and prostatectomy rates increased in the
                beginning of the study period, but decreased towards the late 1990s and early 2000s.
                Revascularisation rates were much higher among men than among women, hip replacement
                operations were relatively evenly distributed, and primary knee operations were
                almost twice as frequent among women during most of the study years. <table-wrap id="table1-1403494808098505" position="float"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Age-standardized procedure rates for men and women in

                worst-off income groups use relatively more services than the better-off groups, and
                a positive value a distribution in which the better-off use more services. For
                coronary revascularisations, relative income differences favoured the better-off
                groups in 1992, and the differences increased slightly in the beginning of the study
                period, but from the mid-1990s the differences decreased consistently. A linear
                trend of decreasing income differences was also found in regression analysis
                    (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). For primary
                hip replacement operations, income group differences favouring the better-off were
                found for five study years. In the other years, the distribution of operations was
                income neutral, and no significant change in the differences was detected. For
                primary knee replacement operations, a pattern of relative income differences
                favouring the better-off was found throughout the 1990s. However, a trend of
                decreasing differences was detected in the early 2000s. Accordingly, no
                statistically significant linear trend was discernible. For cataract operations, a
                pattern favouring the better-off was found in the beginning of the study period, but
                the inequities declined after 1997, and no linear trend was detected. For lumbar
                disc operations, the CIs showed a steady pattern of differences favouring the
                better-off, with few changes in time. In only one of the study years were the
                results income neutral. For prostatectomy, few statistically significant differences
                were found in CIs. <fig id="fig1-1403494808098505" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The development of socioeconomic differences in six elective operations

      <p>Among women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1403494808098505">Figure 2</xref>), the
                distribution of revascularisation operations favoured the better-off in the
                beginning of the study period, but the income group differences decreased steadily
                during the study period, resulting in a distribution favouring the worst-off income
                groups in the beginning of the 2000s. A linear trend was also found in the
                regression analysis
                (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0011). Primary hip
                replacement operations were relatively evenly distributed across income groups; in
                only two of the study years was a distribution favouring the better-off found. No
                significant linear trend was detected in the regression analysis. Primary knee
                replacements were relatively evenly distributed across income groups, and no linear
                trend could be detected in CIs through the study period. For cataract operations, a
                trend of increasing inequities favouring the better-off was found in the beginning
                of the study period. However, after 1996, a decreasing trend was detected, and by
                the end of the study period, the distribution of operations was income neutral.
                Accordingly, no significant trend could be fitted to the data. The distribution of
                lumbar disc operations favoured better-off income groups, but the trend varied in
                time: throughout 1990s, a trend of decreasing differences was found, and in the
                early 2000s, a trend of increasing differences. Hysterectomy showed a steady
                distribution of operations favouring the better-off, and the pattern was similar
                throughout the study period. No linear trend in differences was detected in the

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We examined 12-year trends in socioeconomic inequalities in rates of elective surgery
                for coronary revascularisation, cataract extraction, hip and knee replacement,
                lumbar disc surgery, hysterectomy, and prostatectomy. Overall, income group
                differences were larger among men than among women; for some procedures, there was
                no clear relationship with income. Three clear patterns emerged, however: a decline
                in income-related inequality over time for coronary revascularisation; an increase
                at the start of the period, followed by a reduction in inequality, for cataract
                extraction and primary knee replacement among men; and positive relationship between
                income and treatment rates for lumbar disc surgery and hysterectomy.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that rates of elective surgery for several common conditions
                vary by income, even in a universal healthcare system. Our study was designed to
                compare the variation in access to care among procedures where inequalities appear
                to be most persistent, those where the patient makes a choice to present and the
                clinician has discretion over whether to treat. While similar inequalities in access
                to treatment have been identified in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494808098505">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494808098505">7</xref>], they seem to be more marked in Finland
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494808098505">1</xref>]. This reflects
                structural features of the healthcare system and factors influencing the behaviour
                of professional and patients that influence the socioeconomic patterning of
                treatment. The relative influence of these factors is likely to vary by procedure.</p>
      <p>Our study employed individual register data on diagnosis and treatment, including
                referrals from the private sector and elective surgery undertaken privately. The
                Finnish Care Register has not been formally evaluated recently, but studies from the
                1980s reported that about 95% of all discharges and 90&#x2013;95% of surgical
                procedures were recorded in the register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494808098505">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494808098505">14</xref>]. Several studies have assessed the
                validity of the Finnish Care Register diagnoses, and found that they compare
                satisfactorily with diagnoses made with standard criteria from the FINMONICA/FINAMI
                study in reporting hospital treatment for coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494808098505">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494808098505">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>In our study, the Finnish population aged 25&#x2013;84 years formed the
                population at risk, because no individual-level data on need were available from the
                registers. Our estimates of relative differences in access to elective surgery,
                therefore, are likely to be conservative, since many of the conditions that we
                studied occur more frequently among lower socioeconomic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494808098505">17</xref>]. During the study
                period, there was no evidence of any change in the distribution of need in relation
                to income.</p>
      <p>Finnish data, however, do permit detailed analysis of inequalities in treatment
                rates, because individual data on socioeconomic status, including income, can be
                linked to health service use using unique personal identifiers. These data are
                reliable, and our previous studies have indicated that disposable income
                encapsulates the direct and indirect factors that affect access to planned care.
                These factors include the ability to pay for care, income as a proxy for established
                assets, and/or regular employment in a professional or managerial role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494808098505">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>We used CIs to compare the distribution of operations across income groups and to
                examine changes in the distribution over a 12-year period. This method enables all
                income groups to be included for examination of the gradient in inequality in access
                to care. It shows the direction and measure of (in)equity in distributions and
                allows modelling and quantitative measurement of distributional differences and
                changes over time. Similar methods have been used, e.g. to study differences in the
                distribution of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494808098505">12</xref>] and the use of outpatient services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494808098505">19</xref>] between countries and between years in
                one country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494808098505">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>Several structural features of the health service and factors influencing the
                behaviour of professionals, managers and patients changed over the period that we
                studied. Together, these go some way to explaining our findings and those in other
                countries with similar experiences. At the beginning of the 12-year study period,
                the Finnish government decentralized health service funding and delegated
                decision-making to individual municipalities. The age and social structure of the
                municipalities, the income and infrastructure available to them to fund health
                services and the opportunities for collaboration with their neighbours varied across
                the country, perpetuating the risk of social and geographical inequalities in access
                to care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494808098505">21</xref>].</p>
      <p>The main tools available to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health in Finland have
                been employed with varying levels of success to increase capacity and reduce
                inequalities in planned care. Benchmarking initiatives have been established, and
                clinicians have formalized working in clinical networks and developed integrated
                care pathways. These tools have been most effective where they have been supported
                by public and professional scrutiny from within and beyond Finland. Rates of
                coronary revascularisation, criteria for intervention and inequalities associated
                with previous treatment patterns, for example, have been subject to scrutiny across
                Europe and the OECD countries, highlighting the weight of evidence for the benefit
                of this approach.</p>
      <p>The second pattern of treatment rates, an increase and then a decline in
                income-related inequities, was found particularly for cataract extraction, but also
                for primary knee replacement among men. This may also reflect national and
                international scrutiny of treatment practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494808098505">22</xref>] and advances in anaesthetic and
                surgical treatment enabling higher-risk patients to be treated. Australia, another
                country with a comprehensive health system, co-payments, and mixed
                public&#x2013;private sector provision, found that, while older residents from
                less disadvantaged areas, and those who paid for private treatment, were more likely
                to undergo cataract extraction, there was no clear socioeconomic gradient, and by
                2000&#x2013;2001, the gap between major cities and remote and rural regions was
                narrowing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494808098505">23</xref>]. While
                primary knee replacement among men followed a similar pattern in our study, in other
                countries where inequalities have been measured at the area level, the socioeconomic
                gap remains, e.g. in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494808098505">24</xref>] and England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494808098505">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Potential explanations for the improvements in access to treatment in Finland
                identified above include behavioural changes at the individual and organisational
                levels that have facilitated more rapid expansion of services in recent years, and
                the development and implementation of widely agreed clinical guidelines, e.g. for
                hip and knee replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494808098505">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>The third pattern that we identified was the consistently pro-rich picture found on
                examination of the trends in lumbar disc operation and hysterectomy. Evidence-based
                guidelines on the use of these procedures reflect the requirement for caution,
                careful selection of patients to achieve optimum benefit, and alternatives to
                surgical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494808098505">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494808098505">27</xref>]. In
                both cases, these have spread into routine practice more extensively in Finland than
                in other OECD countries, perhaps because of easier access to private specialists
                favouring surgery.</p>
      <p>Although the proportion of hospital inpatient treatment in the private sector has
                been relatively low in Finland, private ambulatory care and assessments affect
                access to some elective surgical procedures. Referrals from the private sector are
                also an important source of differential access. According to the Finnish Care
                Register in 2003, 80% of patients undergoing cataract extraction were referred by a
                private practitioner. For hysterectomy, the proportion was around 50%, and for
                primary hip and knee operations, approximately one-third. In contrast, for coronary
                revascularisation, one of the interventions for which evidence of inequalities was
                reducing, the proportion of private sector care was about 7%.</p>
      <p>The existence of a parallel system in which additional payments provide a choice of
                provider increases income differences in access to assessment and treatment. In
                Denmark, it also increased the share of health service expenditure among more
                affluent groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494808098505">28</xref>]. A
                similar scheme to enable employers to purchase additional elective care for their
                employees was ruled out in the Netherlands because of its potential to increase
                health inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494808098505">29</xref>].</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study identified varied patterns but persistent socioeconomic differences in
                access to elective surgery for seven common, chronic problems. While there were some
                positive findings that could be attributed to changes in clinical and organisational
                practice, particularly those associated with expansion of eligibility and provision,
                several structural features of the Finnish healthcare system have an impact on
                maintaining inequity in access to these procedures and help to explain the greater
                socioeconomic differences found in Finland as compared to other Nordic
            countries.</p>
