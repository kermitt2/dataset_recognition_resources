        <p>Musical education has a beneficial effect on higher cognitive functions, but
					questions arise whether associations between music lessons and cognitive
					abilities are specific to a domain or general. We tested 194 boys in Grade 3 by
					measuring reading and spelling performance, non verbal intelligence and asked
					parents about musical activities since preschool. Questionnaire data showed that
					53% of the boys had learned to play a musical instrument. Intelligence was
					higher for boys playing an instrument (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). To
					control for unspecific effects we excluded families without instruments. The
					effect on intelligence remained (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).
					Furthermore, boys playing an instrument showed better performance in spelling
					compared to the boys who were not playing, despite family members with
					instruments (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). This effect was observed
					independently of IQ. Our findings suggest an association between music education
					and general cognitive ability as well as a specific language link.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Active music performance relies on a demanding action-perception-loop calling for
				long periods of focused attention on dynamic visual, auditory, and motor signals.
				Given this extra training of high-level cognitive skills in children who learn to
				play an instrument, it can be asked whether making music enhances
				children&#x2019;s performance in domains other than music.</p>
      <p> Positive relationships between playing an instrument and general cognitive abilities
				have been observed previously. In a retrospective design with 6- to 11-year-old
				children, Schellenberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2006</xref>) found a
				correlation between the duration of music lessons and performance in an verbal and
				non-verbal IQ test as well as school performance. The effects on IQ and on academic
				performance were still observable in undergraduates that had been trained to play an
				instrument in childhood. Forgeard, Winner, Norton, and Schlaug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">2008</xref>) observed a relationship between playing an
				instrument and higher cognitive functions in a sample of forty-one 8- to 11-year-old
				children who had at least 3 years of musical instruction. Beside motor learning and
				enhanced melodic discrimination, the authors also found enhanced vocabulary and
				nonverbal reasoning scores. </p>
      <p>However, no differences were found in a prospective study investigating 6- year old
				children between a group of 16 control children and 15 children who had weekly
				private keyboard lessons for 15 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hyde et al.,
					2009</xref>). Nevertheless, the authors were able to show near-transfer effects
				(motor and auditory skills) as well as structural brain changes for the keyboard
				group.</p>
      <p> In an experimental design, Schellenberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">2004</xref>) reported an effect on IQ using Wechsler&#x2019;s WISC-III in
				6-year-olds after keyboard or singing lessons for 36 weeks. The music group (+ 7.0
				points) showed a larger increase than the control group taking drama lessons in the
				same time or waiting for piano lessons (+ 4.3 points). This finding contrasts the
				meta-analysis of Hetland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">2000</xref>, Analysis 2) including five experimental studies
				about the effect of musical training on Raven&#x2019;s IQ. </p>
      <p>Besides this broad effect of music on general cognitive performance, some studies
				also found associations with mathematical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cheek
					&amp; Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Vaughn,
					2000</xref>) and spatial abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hetland,
					2000</xref>; Analysis 1).</p>
      <p>Moreover, there seems to be a link between musical training and language abilities
				since musical training in childhood influences the development of auditory
				processing in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Fujioka, Ross, Kakigi,
					Pantev, &amp; Trainor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Moreno
					&amp; Besson, 2006</xref>). There is evidence that musical training is
				linked to language related aspects such as pitch processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Sch&#xF6;n, Magne, &amp; Besson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Wong, Skoe, Russo, Dees, &amp; Kraus, 2007</xref>), speech prosody
					(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Thompson, Schellenberg, &amp; Husain,
					2004</xref>), verbal memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chan, Ho, &amp;
					Cheung, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ho, Cheung, &amp; Chan,
					2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Jakobson, Cuddy, &amp; Kilgour,
					2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kilgour, Jakobson, &amp; Cuddy,
					2000</xref>). Additionally, musical aptitude was found to correlate with second
				language acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Slevc &amp; Miyake,
					2006</xref>). Furthermore, associations of musical training and reading
				performance have been demonstrated in a normal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Barwick, Valentine, West, &amp; Wilding, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Butzlaff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lamb &amp; Gregory, 1993</xref>) as well as in dyslexics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Overy, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The putative link between musical and language abilities is seen in the
				discrimination of rapid auditory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Jakobson et
					al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Tallal &amp; Gaab,
					2006</xref>). Musical instrument training should improve auditory information
				processing, which in turn is crucial for the acquisition of reading and writing
				skills.</p>
      <p>It is no longer the question whether or not musical training is associated with
				higher cognitive abilities, because there is growing evidence that it is. An
				unresolved issue however, is the nature and specificity of the link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Schellenberg &amp; Peretz, 2008</xref>). It has
				been proposed that all specific relations observed so far can be explained by a
				carry-over effect of the relation between musical training and general abilities as
				measured by IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Schellenberg &amp; Peretz,
					2008</xref>). Indeed, such a dependency was always found in
				Schellenberg&#x2019;s studies. Most of the previous studies showing a relation
				between musical training and specific abilities, such as language performance, did
				not measure general abilities. Therefore these studies could not report on the
				dependency of both.</p>
      <p>Our correlational study addresses this unresolved issue of link-specificity by
				looking at a general association as well as at a specific language association of
				musical training.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <sec id="S2a">
        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>We recruited 272 elementary school boys of Grade 3 aged 8 to 9 years from 26
					schools in a southern German school district. The recruitment served two
					purposes. On the one hand, the boys were screened for an electroencephalographic
					study on auditory processing in normal and dyslexic children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gust, 2009</xref>). Therefore we included only
					healthy boys who were native German speakers and had not repeated a class. On
					the other hand all screening data was used in combination with an additional
					parents&#x2019; questionnaire to answer the research question presented
					here.</p>
        <p>The study followed the principles of the declaration of Helsinki and was approved
					by the local internal review board of the Medical Faculty, University of
					Ulm.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S2b">
        <title>Tests and questionnaire</title>
        <p>We tested non-verbal intelligence with the German adaptation of Cattells Cultural
					Fair Intelligence Test - Scale 1 (CFT-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cattell,
						Wei&#xDF;, &amp; Osterland, 1997</xref>). The CFT-1 consists of five
					subtests (substitutions, labyrinths, classification, similarities, and matrices)
					and takes about 45 min to complete. This non-verbal IQ test was chosen to
					measure intelligence independently from progress in reading and writing.</p>
        <p>Reading and spelling performance was tested with the Salzburger Lese- und
					Rechtschreibtest (SLRT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Landerl, Wimmer,
						&amp; Moser, 1997</xref>). The SLRT is an individually given test
					assessing reading accuracy and reading speed for three word and two non-word
					reading subtests as well as spelling performance with regard to different types
					of spelling errors.</p>
        <p>Parents filled out a questionnaire about the musical experience of their child
					during preschool and school years, including singing, listening to music, and
					playing an instrument, either at home or in an institutional setting such as
					children choir and music school. Additionally, we asked questions about the
					parental encouragement concerning non-musical activities. It was rated on a
					scale from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 7 (<italic>more than once
						daily</italic>) how often adults engaged with the boys in activities like
					looking together at picture books, reading books to the boys, telling stories to
					the boys, encouraging boys to draw and paint, or being at the playground with
					them. A composite score of &#x201C;parental investment&#x201D; was
					calculated from these ratings.</p>
        <p>Lastly, parents were asked if any family member is playing an instrument. We
					expect that boys who play an instrument differ from boys that do not play an
					instrument. The existence of family members who play instruments allows to
					control for any unspecific differences, such as the family value of playing an
					instrument, or the minimum family income to allow for financing an instrument
					and lessons.</p>
        <p>Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed using STATISTICA 7.1
					(StatSoft, Inc. Tusla, OK, USA).</p>

      <p>Two hundred and six parents completely answered and sent back the questionnaire on
				the musical experience of their boys (76% return rate). <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the overall musical experience of the

        <p>The results so far described were obtained from the whole group of boys. In the
					following analysis we focus on low-performer in terms of spelling. Low
					performers were defined as the quarter of boys (<italic>n</italic> = 51) with
					the highest number of SLRT spelling mistakes. Not all of these low-performers
					showed a spelling deficit as defined by the ICD-10. Only 17 of them exhibited a
					spelling performance on or below 10% of the population accompanied by an IQ
					within the normal range.</p>
        <p>Boys who played an instrument were underrepresented in the lowest quartile of
					spelling performance: Only 27.5% of boys in the lowest quartile played an
					instrument whereas 61.5% of boys of the better quartiles were active musicians.
					Comparison between lowest quartile and all other quartiles combined proved a
					significant difference, X<sup>2</sup>(1) = 17.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001; that
					turned into tendency towards significance after families without instruments

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Boys from a non-selected sample of third grade elementary school who play an
				instrument have shown a higher non-verbal IQ and were better in a formal spelling
				test compared to boys who did not play an instrument. The effects remained when
				controlled for musical interests by excluding families without instruments. The
				positive effect on reading vanished after this exclusion. The effect on spelling was
				independent of the influence from non-verbal IQ. A closer look at the distribution
				in spelling performance showed that only students in the lowest quartile differ from
				the others with respect to playing an instrument.</p>
      <p>Our sample is not representative for the whole school population because of our
				inclusion criteria: male sex, right handedness, native German speakers, no class
				repetition. For the purpose of the current study the exclusion of girls seems to be
				a disadvantage. Advantageous, however, is the exclusion of children without native
				German language as our study needs a homogeneous group in terms of language
				acquisition. We did not focus on students suffering from dyslexia but included the
				whole range reading and spelling performance in a normal school population. The
				obtained return rate of the parents&#x2019; questionnaire about the musical
				experience of their child (76%) is within acceptable limits.</p>
      <p>A further restriction of our study is the retrospective design. The results do not
				clarify a causal relation from music education to cognitive performance, they only
				demonstrate correlations. Any questionnaire covering the past might introduce a
				positive bias. But this should not be a problem for the core of our results, because
				we do not expect that parents give a wrong answer to the simple question
				&#x201C;Does your child play an instrument?&#x201D; We did not specify this
				response: We included children who received recorder group lessons for 30 min per
				week at age 8 for some weeks as well as children who played instruments with up to 4
				hr individual lessons weekly starting at the age of 5. Given that weak inclusion
				criterion our results may even underestimate the observed effect.</p>

        <title>Relation to general cognitive abilities</title>
        <p> A positive effect of playing an instrument on general cognitive abilities has
					been observed previously. Schellenberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">2004</xref>) reported an effect on IQ using Wechsler&#x2019;s WISC-III
					in 6-year-olds after keyboard or singing lessons for 36 weeks. In our study, the
					differences between the two groups were larger regarding both the IQ difference
					(Schellenberg delta 2.7 points vs. delta 6.6 points) and the effect size
					(Schellenberg d 0.35 vs. d 0.52). However, the studies differed considerably.
					For instance, we did not measure changes over time but compared two groups
					classified by the parents&#x2019; questionnaire. Furthermore, we also
					focused on reading and writing performance and have therefore chosen a
					non-verbal IQ test to measure intelligence independently from progress in
					reading and writing. Schellenberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">2004</xref>)
					did not observe a difference between verbal and non-verbal subtests in his
					investigation. </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S4b">
        <title>Relation to specific cognitive abilities for reading and writing</title>
        <p>The putative link between musical and language abilities is seen in the
					discrimination of rapid auditory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Jakobson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Tallal
						&amp; Gaab, 2006</xref>). Our results indicate a stronger link of
					playing an instrument in respect to spelling as to reading performance. This
					result is in contrast to findings reported in a meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Butzlaff, 2000</xref>) and has, to the best of our
					knowledge, not been reported before.</p>
        <p>Our findings can be explained in different ways. Firstly, it has to be taken into
					consideration that the German language has better phoneme&#x2013;grapheme
					mapping than the English language. Therefore, it might be feasible that native
					German speakers benefit from auditory training such as playing an instrument in
					regard to the discrimination of rapid auditory events which in turn helps them
					to decipher the spelling of the German words.</p>
        <p>Another explanation can be found in the double deficit hypothesis of dyslexia
						(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Wolf &amp; Bowers, 1999</xref>).
					According to this hypothesis, spelling deficits are associated with a
					phonological deficit whereas dysfluent reading is associated with a naming speed
					deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Wimmer &amp; Mayringer,
					2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Wimmer, Mayringer, &amp;
						Landerl, 2000</xref>). The naming speed deficit is supposedly not due to
					auditory information processing but rather to lexical access. In contrast,
					musical training mainly affects sound processing and therefore spelling
					capability.</p>
        <p>In line with these results, studies with dyslexic risk populations of 6-year old
					children and a dyslexic population of 9-year old children demonstrated a
					positive effect of musical lessons on spelling performance and phonological
					abilities but not on reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Overy,
					2003</xref>). It therefore appears from these studies that children with
					particularly low reading and spelling abilities benefit most from playing a
					musical instrument. We cannot exclude that low performers dislike playing an
					instrument and therefore cause the observed group differences. Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) show a leap between the percentages
					of players in the two lowest quartiles (delta 30%) that cannot be seen between
					the other quartiles (delta max. 8%). This pattern suggests a kind of
					threshold.</p>

        <p>In our sample, the active participation in a choir or the lessons
					&#x201C;First Experiences With Music&#x201D; did not show the benefits
					found when children were playing musical instruments. It cannot be ruled out
					that this negative finding is based on intensity or quality of the musical
					activities. Another explanation could be the differences in specific motor skill
					between singing and playing an instrument. Further studies that control for
					intensity and quality of the musical courses might clarify if there is a
					specific advantage in playing an instrument.</p>

      <sec id="S4c">
        <title>Specific versus general effects</title>
        <p>It has been proposed that all specific relations observed so far can be explained
					by a carry-over effect of the relation between musical training and general
					abilities as measured by IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Schellenberg
						&amp; Peretz, 2008</xref>). Indeed, in Schellenberg&#x2019;s studies
					such dependency was observed. Our data contrast these observations. We observed
					both a relation to general abilities as measured by non-verbal IQ and a relation
					to spelling performance that was still observed when controlled for general
					abilities. The relation between musical training and spelling performance may
					alternatively be explained by an increase of crystallized intelligence. Such an
					increase was found by Schellenberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2006</xref>). In our study only non-verbal IQ
					was tested so that we cannot rule out a mediation of crystallized intelligence
					on the effect of musical training on spelling. However, in this case we would
					have also expected an effect on reading. The isolated improvement of spelling
					but not reading suggests a specific link between musical training and spelling
					abilities mediated by improvement in auditory analysis.</p>
        <p> From our data we propose that there is both an association of musical training
					and general abilities as well as specific spelling abilities. The link between
					training and general abilities has been demonstrated to be causal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Schellenberg, 2004</xref>). In the retrospective
					study, Schellenberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2006</xref>) has also shown
					that the association between duration of musical training and academic average
					was evident even when IQ was held constant. This, too, suggests a general as
					well as an additional specific link between musical training and cognitive
					abilities. Our data justify a prospective study investigating a specific impact
					of musical training on spelling in languages with shallow orthographies such as
					German. </p>
