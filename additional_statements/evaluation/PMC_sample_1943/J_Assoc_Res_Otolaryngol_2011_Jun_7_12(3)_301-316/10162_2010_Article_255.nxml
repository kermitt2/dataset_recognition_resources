        <p>In this study, we analyze the processing of low-frequency sounds in the cochlear apex through responses of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) that innervate the apex. Single tones and irregularly spaced tone complexes were used to evoke ANF responses in Mongolian gerbil. The spike arrival times were analyzed in terms of phase locking, peripheral frequency selectivity, group delays, and the nonlinear effects of sound pressure level (SPL). Phase locking to single tones was similar to that in cat. Vector strength was maximal for stimulus frequencies around 500&#xA0;Hz, decreased above 1&#xA0;kHz, and became insignificant above 4 to 5&#xA0;kHz. We used the responses to tone complexes to determine amplitude and phase curves of ANFs having a characteristic frequency (CF) below 5&#xA0;kHz. With increasing CF, amplitude curves gradually changed from broadly tuned and asymmetric with a steep low-frequency flank to more sharply tuned and asymmetric with a steep high-frequency flank. Over the same CF range, phase curves gradually changed from a concave-upward shape to a concave-downward shape. Phase curves consisted of two or three approximately straight segments. Group delay was analyzed separately for these segments. Generally, the largest group delay was observed near CF. With increasing SPL, most amplitude curves broadened, sometimes accompanied by a downward shift of best frequency, and group delay changed along the entire range of stimulus frequencies. We observed considerable across-ANF variation in the effects of SPL on both amplitude and phase. Overall, our data suggest that mechanical responses in the apex of the cochlea are considerably nonlinear and that these nonlinearities are of a different character than those known from the base of the cochlea.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Data from direct mechanical measurements have greatly advanced our understanding of auditory processing in the mammalian cochlea. Most of these data were obtained from the base of the cochlea. Mechanical responses in the cochlear base to high-frequency sounds are characterized by high sensitivity, sharp tuning, and strong dynamic compression (reviewed in Robles and Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2001</xref>). Processing of low-frequency sounds in the apex is less well charted. The apex is poorly accessible for direct mechanical measurements, and apical data have thus far been inconclusive concerning both the extent and nature of nonlinearities (Cooper and Rhode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>; Hao and Khanna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1996</xref>; Rhode and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>; Zinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2000</xref>). The interpretation is further hampered by unknown effects of surgical trauma to the cochlea, unavoidable with these methods (Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1997</xref>; Khanna and Hao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1999</xref>; Zinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2000</xref>). Therefore, less invasive techniques such as recording from the auditory nerve continue to contribute to our knowledge of cochlear mechanics at the apex, even though the relation between auditory nerve fiber (ANF) responses and mechanical vibrations in the cochlea is indirect.</p>
      <p>The literature on ANF recordings is vast (reviewed in Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1992</xref>; more recent studies include Recio-Spinoso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>; Van der Heijden and Joris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>; Temchin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">b</xref>; Palmer and Shackleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>; Temchin and Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>) and covers many mammalian species. The species tested share a large number of general characteristics, but also differ in their audible range, sensitivity, and sharpness of tuning. The literature on ANF recordings of the Mongolian gerbil (<italic>Meriones unguiculatus</italic>) includes a detailed inventory of sharpness of tuning at threshold, obtained using frequency-threshold tuning curves (FTCs; Schmiedt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1989</xref>; Ohlemiller and Echteler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1990</xref>). We have not been able to find comprehensive studies in gerbil ANFs of low-frequency tuning based on phase locking, such as first-order Wiener kernel analysis (reverse correlation) or phase analysis of single-tone responses. Such data are available for other mammalian species (e.g., cat, Carney and Yin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1988</xref>; chinchilla, Temchin and Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>; guinea pig, Palmer and Shackleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). Also, systematic data on the frequency limits of phase locking in the gerbil auditory nerve are lacking.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we analyze the peripheral frequency selectivity in gerbil ANFs using the irregularly spaced tone complexes (<italic>zwuis</italic>) described in Van der Heijden and Joris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>). The amplitude and phase curves produced by this technique provide a &#x201C;filter-like&#x201D; characterization of neural responses to wideband stimuli. In that respect, the technique is comparable to first-order Wiener-kernel analysis. However, it has the advantage of a better spectral resolution and wider frequency range, extending to frequencies remote from the characteristic frequency (CF). The technique is therefore suitable for studying peripheral frequency selectivity in quantitative detail.</p>

        <title>Animals</title>
        <p>Recordings were made from Mongolian gerbils (<italic>M. unguiculatus</italic>; female; weight &#x223C;60&#xA0;g; 41 ears). The animals were anesthetized by an initial intraperitoneal injection with a solution of ketamine/xylazine (80 and 12&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/g body weight, respectively). Anesthesia was maintained by subcutaneous injections of the anesthetics, which kept the paw pinch reflex suppressed. This typically required the injection of 1/3 of the initial dose each hour. The Sokolich approach was used to access the auditory nerve (Sokolich and Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1973</xref>; Chamberlain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1977</xref>). Briefly, the pinna and cartilaginous part of the ear canal were removed, and the inferior posterior mastoid chamber of the ipsilateral bulla was exposed by removing the overlying tissue. The bulla was opened by gently chipping away some bone in a &#x223C;2-mm radius, slightly posterior of the ear canal. This granted a clear view on the basal cochlear turn and the round window antrum. Opening the dorsomedial wall of the round window antrum by means of a small needle provided access to the underlying auditory nerve. The tensor tympani muscle was left intact. The head of the animal was fixed during the experiment using a small metal rod attached to the dorsal part of the skull. Throughout the experiment, body temperature was maintained at 37&#xB0;C using an electrical heating pad. Since compound action potential thresholds obtained with frequencies of &#x223C;2&#xA0;kHz and below are not a reliable metric for the state of the cochlea, we used thresholds from the literature as a standard. The experiment was terminated if rate thresholds at CF were more than 20&#xA0;dB higher than those reported by Ohlemiller and Echteler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1990</xref>). All procedures were approved by the Erasmus MC laboratory animal committee.</p>

        <title>Stimulus generation and data acquisition</title>
        <p>Stimuli were calculated on a personal computer using custom software written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and generated from a single 16-bit D/A-channel (PD1; Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL, USA) at a sample rate of 16&#xA0;kHz. The stimuli were fed through a low-pass filter (J85E 7.2&#xA0;kHz; TTE Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA), followed by an attenuator (PA4; Tucker-Davis Technologies) and a headphone buffer (HB5; Tucker-Davis Technologies) before being broadcast by a speaker (FRS 7 4&#xA0;&#x3A9;; Visaton, Haan, Germany; or SCL2; Shure, Niles, IL, USA). This speaker was attached to a sound delivery probe sealed to the exposed bony rim of the ear canal with Vaseline. A 1/2-in. condenser microphone (40AG, G.R.A.S., Holte, Denmark), placed inside the probe and connected to a pre-amplifier (2669; Br&#xFC;el and Kj&#xE6;r, N&#xE6;rum, Denmark) and a conditioning amplifier (Nexus 2690; Br&#xFC;el and Kj&#xE6;r), allowed for in situ calibration &#x223C;3&#xA0;mm from the eardrum. All experiments were carried out in a double-walled sound-attenuating booth on a vibration isolation table (Newport, Irvine, CA, USA).</p>
        <p>For intra-axonal recordings, glass micropipettes (1BBL w/fil 1.0&#xA0;mm; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) filled with 3&#xA0;M KCl were used. The electrodes had resistances of 30&#x2013;80&#xA0;M&#x3A9; (measured in situ). A reference electrode was placed subcutaneously at the edge of the surgical field. Neural signals were fed to a pre-amplifier (Electro 705; World Precision Instruments) and a conditioning amplifier (EG&amp;G PARC 113; AMETEK, Oak Ridge, TN, USA; or SR560; Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) which amplified (100&#x2013;500&#xD7;) and filtered (30&#x2013;10,000&#xA0;Hz) the signal. Under constant monitoring of the threshold, a custom-built peak detector converted action potentials in the filtered signal to standard rectangular (TTL) pulses. The timing of these pulses was determined by an event timer (ET1; Tucker-Davis Technologies; 1-&#x3BC;s resolution) and stored on computer disc for subsequent analysis.</p>

        <title>Stimulus protocol and data analysis</title>
        <p>The electrode was advanced through the auditory nerve in 1-&#x3BC;m steps (controller 8200 Inchworm; EXFO, Mississauga, ON, Canada) until a single fiber was found. As a search stimulus, brief tone bursts (70&#xA0;ms duration, 3&#xA0;ms rise/fall; duty cycle 0.7) were used. The frequency was varied from 100&#xA0;Hz to 25&#xA0;kHz in 1/3-octave steps.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec6">
        <title>Single-tone stimuli</title>
        <p>For each ANF, the same brief tone bursts (70&#xA0;ms; 3&#xA0;ms rise/fall; 0.7 duty cycle) were presented 15&#x2013;20 times over a range of intensities (10&#x2013;90&#xA0;dB sound pressure level (SPL)) and frequencies (0.05&#x2013;0.3 octave steps). The spike rates were used to reconstruct frequency&#x2013;intensity response areas from which the units&#x2019; CF was determined. The spike arrival times, occurring during a window from 10 to 70&#xA0;ms after the onset of each stimulus, were used in the analysis of phase locking to single tones, which was quantified by the vector strength <italic>R</italic> (Goldberg and Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1969</xref>). Statistical significance of <italic>R</italic> was determined by means of a Rayleigh test (Mardia and Jupp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2000</xref>) using a <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 criterion.</p>
        <p>The dependence of maximum vector strength on stimulus frequency was estimated by fitting a polynomial to the highest vector strengths (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, black line). To that end, the data points were binned in non-overlapping bins of a non-uniform bandwidth. For the first bin, starting at 50&#xA0;Hz, bandwidth was expanded upward until it contained 100 data points. The lower boundary of each consecutive bin started where the previous bin had ended and again the upper frequency limit was found by increasing bandwidth until 100 data points fell within the current bin. The last bin contained the remaining data points (<italic>N</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;32). A fifth-order polynomial was then fitted to the median of the five highest vector strengths in each bin.

        <title>Multitone stimuli</title>
        <p>Multitone stimuli were used to obtain amplitude and phase curves that represent the effective stimulus at the input of the transduction process. Briefly, each stimulus consisted of multiple, irregularly spaced, frequency components (Victor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1979</xref>; Van der Heijden and Joris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>). Components had equal amplitude and random starting phase. Each multitone stimulus was presented over a single speaker for 60&#xA0;s. If necessary, multiple 60-s repetitions were combined. If time permitted, responses were obtained using a range of SPLs. See Van der Heijden and Joris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>) for further details on the generation, analysis, and interpretation of such multitone stimuli.</p>
        <p>The analysis of recorded spike trains involved the computation of the vector strength and phase for each of the frequency components of the stimulus. The irregular spacing of frequencies is essential because it ensures that all possible difference and sum frequencies (f1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;f2), which are present in the response owing to the rectifying character of the transduction, never coincide with any stimulus component. This ensures that the vector strength and phase values computed for a given stimulus frequency results only from that stimulus component and that contamination by second-order components is excluded. A confidence level of <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 (Rayleigh test) was used as a criterion for significance of phase locking. Due to the low-pass characteristics at the level of the hair cells and their basolateral membrane (Weiss and Rose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1988b</xref>), phase locking declines with stimulus frequency. We therefore corrected the amplitude curves by dividing each <italic>R</italic> value by the corresponding value of the polynomial trend line described above (see also Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>To increase the frequency range of amplitude and phase curves of single ANFs, responses were obtained to multiple tone complexes that partially overlapped in frequency. To combine the separate amplitude curves into a single composite curve, individual curves were aligned by minimizing the sum of squares of their difference in the region of overlap (Van der Heijden and Joris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>As a measure for sharpness of tuning for (composite) amplitude curves, <italic>Q</italic><sub>10dB</sub> was calculated as the peak frequency divided by the bandwidth 10&#xA0;dB below the peak. When possible, amplitude curves obtained for different stimulus intensities in a single ANF were aligned on their low-frequency tail (defined as one octave below CF), using the same alignment procedure as described above. From these aligned curves, the growth rate of the normalized amplitude at CF was calculated by fitting a straight line to the stimulus level versus amplitude curve. The growth rate was obtained by converting gain to non-normalized amplitude, i.e., by adding one to the slope of the straight line.</p>
        <p>Phase curves represent phase of the response component re rarefaction near the eardrum. Fine structure of phase curves was assessed by increasing each phase by an amount that varied linearly with frequency, corresponding with a positive time shift (see &#x201C;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>&#x201D;).</p>
        <p>Group delay was calculated by fitting straight lines to phase-frequency curves. Since phase curves were generally poorly described by single straight lines, we calculated separate group delays over four different sections along the phase curves: <italic>above</italic> CF for frequencies &gt;1.6&#xD7;CF, <italic>near</italic> CF for frequencies in a 0.4-octave-wide band around CF, <italic>below</italic> CF for frequencies between 0.3&#xD7;CF and 0.6&#xD7;CF, and <italic>well below</italic> CF for frequencies &lt;400&#xA0;Hz. Due to the variation in filter shapes with CF (see &#x201C;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>&#x201D;), group delay could not always be calculated at all four sections for a single phase curve.</p>

        <title>Responses to single tones</title>
        <p>Single tone data were collected with the purpose of determining the limits and degree of phase locking in gerbil ANFs. Responses to 70-ms tones were obtained from 163 ANFs, with CF ranging from 88&#xA0;Hz to 24.71&#xA0;kHz, presented at intensities of 10&#x2013;90&#xA0;dB SPL. Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> shows vector strength as a function of stimulus frequency. For each ANF, vector strength was determined for a wide range of stimulus frequencies and intensities. Each data point represents a single frequency/intensity combination. Different symbols are used for different ranges of CFs as indicated in the figure. The large spread at each frequency is mainly caused by the inclusion of data obtained with arbitrary SPLs, including low and moderate levels which yield relatively poor phase locking. The solid line is a polynomial fit estimating the upper envelope of the data. The derivation of this curve and its use in the correction of amplitude curves extracted from multitone data are described in &#x201C;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x201D;.</p>
        <p>Between 50&#xA0;Hz and 1&#xA0;kHz, vector strength was typically below 0.9, with a few outliers as high as 0.99 in the 500-Hz region. Vector strength decreased for stimulus frequencies above 1&#xA0;kHz and just above 4&#xA0;kHz it had dropped below 0.2. Notice that the data are not limited to near-CF stimulation; for example, the highest vector strengths were found for stimulus frequencies around 500&#xA0;Hz, presented to ANFs with CF &gt;2&#xA0;kHz.</p>
        <p>For each ANF, the maximum vector strength found for tones in a 0.25-octave band around CF are indicated in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> (open circles). These values typically fall below the polynomial fit to the upper envelope of the data (solid line). Only two near-CF data points between 500&#xA0;Hz and 1&#xA0;kHz show a vector strength slightly exceeding 0.9. The highest near-CF vector strength (<italic>R</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.94) was found around 100&#xA0;Hz.</p>
        <p>Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> compares the upper limit of vector strength in gerbil to three other mammalian species. Both the guinea pig data (Palmer and Russell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1986</xref>) and the chinchilla data (Temchin and Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>) were obtained using brief tone bursts covering a wide range of frequencies (i.e., both near-CF and off-CF stimulation). In both studies, the vector strengths from all ANFs and animals were pooled to obtain their maximum for each stimulus frequency, similar to our data from gerbil. In chinchilla, the stimulus level was fixed at 70&#xA0;dB SPL. The data from cat (Johnson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1980</xref>) are different in two ways. Firstly, they were obtained using long tonal stimulation. However, this does not strongly affect vector strength (Joris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1994a</xref>). Secondly, stimulation was restricted to near-CF tones. For off-CF stimuli, Joris et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1994b</xref>) reported vector strengths up to 0.95 for cat ANFs with CF &gt;2&#xA0;kHz stimulated at 500&#xA0;Hz. Thus, the restriction to near-CF stimulation in the data of the cat (Johnson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1980</xref>) tends to underestimate the overall maximum vector strength in that frequency region, similar to our results in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>. Taking this tendency into account, phase locking in the gerbil is very similar to that in cat, both in terms of maximum vector strength values and of frequency limit. In a final comparison to phase locking in rat (data not shown), gerbil ANFs also show higher vector strengths for off-CF tones as well as for near-CF tones (Paolini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2001</xref>).</p>

        <title>Responses to tone complexes</title>
        <p>Responses to tone complexes were obtained from 157 ANFs, with CFs ranging from 88&#xA0;Hz to 5&#xA0;kHz. Fourier analysis of the response to the tone complexes produced linear estimates of amplitude and phase characteristics of the ANF (see &#x201C;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x201D; and Van der Heijden and Joris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>). Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (left panel) shows an example of an amplitude curve from a single ANF, computed from the response to a single tone complex. It represents the relative magnitudes (i.e., the relative vector strength, expressed in decibel) of each of the stimulus components in the response. Since we are mainly interested in cochlear frequency selectivity, we corrected the amplitude curves for the overall decline of phase locking with frequency using the frequency response of the vector strength, derived from population data in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> (solid line). Note that this correction is small (&lt;4&#xA0;dB) at frequencies up to 3&#xA0;kHz; at higher frequencies, the amplitude curves have a very limited dynamic range due to poor phase locking. The corrected amplitude curve (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) shows a clear peak near CF, which reflects the peripheral frequency selectivity.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>FIG.&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>Amplitude curve (<italic>left panel</italic>) and phase curve (<italic>middle panel</italic>) for one ANF, obtained from a single response to a multitone stimulus. The magnitude of the amplitude curve, determined by the relative vector strength of each stimulus component, was corrected for the frequency dependence in phase locking (see text), after which its maximum was arbitrarily set to zero. To reveal details in the associated phase curve (<italic>middle panel</italic>), an overall delay was compensated for by advancing the curve in time by 2.1&#xA0;ms (<italic>right panel</italic>). The CF (1.90&#xA0;kHz), obtained from single tone data, is indicated in each panel (<italic>filled circles</italic>). The <italic>zwuis</italic>-stimulus consisted of 20 frequency components (0.93&#x2013;2.5&#xA0;kHz), each component at 15&#xA0;dB SPL. The gap in amplitude and phase curves at 2.41&#xA0;kHz corresponds to a stimulus component that failed to yield significant phase locking (Rayleigh test, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.001).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10162_2010_255_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
        <p>The slope of the phase curves, extracted from the multitone responses, reflects overall group delay (&#x223C;2.3&#xA0;ms in the example in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, middle panel). This delay combines the contributions from middle-ear transmission, intracochlear propagation, and synaptic and neural transmission. In order to zoom in on the finer details of phase transfer, the curve was advanced in time by 2.1&#xA0;ms, an amount large enough to compensate most of the overall delay of this ANF response (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, right panel; the 2.1-ms compensation is indicated in the graph). The phase compensation revealed deviations from a straight line, i.e., small, frequency-dependent, variations of group delay.</p>

        <title>Tuning characteristics at low SPL</title>
        <p>For low stimulus intensities (maximally 30&#xA0;dB above threshold), we observed a gradual, systematic transformation in the amplitude and phase curves with CF. This is illustrated by the examples in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Amplitude curves of low-CF ANFs were asymmetric with a steep low-frequency flank and a shallow high-frequency flank (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, left panel). With increasing CF, lower flanks became shallower, while upper flanks became steeper (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, left column). Amplitude curves became symmetric (on a logarithmic frequency scale) for CFs near 1&#xA0;kHz (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). For still higher CFs, the amplitudes became asymmetric again, but now with the lower flanks shallower than the upper flanks (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C, D</xref>).

        <p>The corresponding phase curves also show systematic changes with CF. For ANFs with the lowest CF, phase curves were concave from above: they were steepest at the lowest frequencies (including CF) and contain an extended shallow part above CF. With increasing CF, the phase curves became less bent, turning into almost straight lines (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, right panel). For higher CFs, the curves were concave from below with the steepest gradient around CF and a more shallow tail below CF. In addition, many phase curves of higher-CF (&gt;1&#xA0;kHz) ANFs exhibited a marked upturn (increased group delay) below 1&#xA0;kHz (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, right panel).</p>

        <title>Near-CF group delays</title>
        <p>In most cases, the segment around CF was the steepest part of the phase curve, corresponding to the largest group delay. Consequently, fitting a single straight line to the entire phase curve would underestimate near-CF group delay. We therefore restricted our near-CF group delay estimates to a 0.4-octave-wide band around CF, while pooling data obtained at different SPLs. Near-CF group delay (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>, circles) ranged from &gt;10&#xA0;ms for the lowest CFs (&#x223C;100&#xA0;Hz) down to &#x223C;2&#xA0;ms for the highest CFs (&#x223C;5&#xA0;kHz). The relation between near-CF group delay and CF was fitted to a power function (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>, solid line). The fit describes a lower limit of 2.1&#xA0;ms for the highest CFs. This is higher than the estimated 1-ms &#x201C;synaptic delay&#x201D; for ANFs (Ruggero and Rich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1987</xref>), suggesting that for the entire range of CFs covered (&lt;5&#xA0;kHz), cochlear travel delays of near CF components exceed 1.1&#xA0;ms. The range of near-CF group delays and their systematic decrease with CF is similar to near-CF group delays reported for squirrel monkey (Anderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1971</xref>), chinchilla (Temchin and Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>), guinea pig (Palmer and Russell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1986</xref>), and cat (Goldstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1971</xref>), as shown in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>.

        <p>The wide range of stimulus frequencies covered by many phase curves allowed an assessment of group delay for frequencies remote from CF. Motivated by the shapes of phase curves (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), we estimated group delays in three non-CF regions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A&#x2013;C</xref>), which are illustrated in the insets of Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. At very low (&lt;400&#xA0;Hz) frequencies (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>), well-below-CF group delay showed a large variability and little dependence on CF. Large values of group delay in this low-frequency region reflect the upturns in the phase curves mentioned previously (cf. Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>), which were observed in some, but not all ANFs. Group delays for the frequency region just below CF (&#x223C;1.5&#x2013;0.6 octaves below CF, i.e., 0.3&#xD7;CF to 0.6&#xD7;CF) are shown in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>. These below-CF group delays decreased with CF, but less strongly than the near-CF delays of Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>. Above-CF (&gt;1.6&#xD7;CF) group delay (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>) showed a weak trend to decrease with CF.

        <p>We compared the group delays obtained from the different segments of single phase curves by computing the difference of the near-CF group delay and the various off-CF regions of the same curve, when available. This comparison of steepness across segments provides a quantitative analysis of the deviation of phase curves from straight lines (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). The group delay data of Figures&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> can be summarized as follows: Most of the variation with CF is observed in the near-CF region, with group delay monotonically decreasing with CF (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). The off-CF regions show little, if any, variation of group delay with CF (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A&#x2013;C</xref>). In most ANFs, the largest group delays were obtained for near-CF stimulus frequencies, with the exception of some ANFs with CF of 1 to 2&#xA0;kHz, for which very low stimulus frequencies yielded the largest group delays (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>, X&#x2019;s).</p>

        <title>Effect of SPL on amplitude curves</title>
        <p>For 92 ANFs, we obtained responses to tone complexes presented at multiple SPLs. If the auditory periphery were linear, the amplitude curves obtained at different SPLs would have the same shape. The broadening of tuning with SPL (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), however, indicates that the shape of amplitude curves is SPL dependent. When considering the effect of SPL on amplitude curves, it is important to realize that each curve only represents the <italic>relative</italic> amplitudes of the different components. They do not yield any information about the absolute amplitude of the response. Therefore, there is no intrinsic way of comparing amplitude curves across SPLs, so the vertical alignment of the curves is arbitrary (Van der Heijden and Joris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>In contrast, mechanical measurements do yield <italic>absolute</italic> amplitudes and the variation of tuning with SPL is conveniently visualized by normalizing each amplitude curve by the amplitude of the stimulus. When overlaying these &#x201C;sensitivity curves&#x201D; obtained from the base of the cochlea, the linear growth well below CF results in complete overlap in the low-frequency tail, while compressive growth around CF results in a sharp peak at low SPLs that declines with increasing SPL (Rhode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>The similarity of our highest-CF data (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, curves marked d) with cochlear mechanical data motivated us to align the multiple amplitude curves at their low-frequency tail. Assuming linear growth for below-CF tones, vertical alignment of low-frequency tails of amplitude curves obtained at different stimulus levels converts them into sensitivity curves (this procedure can be viewed as a &#x201C;wideband version&#x201D; of Cooper and Yates&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>) method to estimate mechanical compression from single-tone rate-level curves.) Three examples of this alignment procedure are shown in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> (left column). The curves were aligned by minimizing the squared distance of each low-frequency tail (&lt;CF/2) to the averaged curve. With increasing SPL, the relative response at CF (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, filled circles) decreased, indicating compressive growth at CF. A similar alignment procedure could be applied to 44 ANFs (CF between 0.4 and 3&#xA0;kHz). For each ANF, the growth rate (decibel response growth per decibel stimulus increase) was estimated by fitting a straight line to the magnitude at CF as a function of SPL. The growth rate was obtained by converting gain to non-normalized amplitude, i.e., by adding one to the slope of the straight line. This yielded a median compressive growth rate of 0.66&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.22&#xA0;dB/dB. The absence of distinct below-CF tails in the response curves of low-CF ANFs largely limited the alignment procedure to ANFs with CF above 800&#xA0;Hz. An exception is shown in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref> for an ANF with CF&#x2009;=&#x2009;500&#xA0;Hz, which yielded a compression of 0.87&#xA0;dB/dB.

        <p>Many amplitude curves for which low-tail alignment was not feasible did show clear effects of SPL. Some of these effects were systematic: As shown earlier (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), peak width broadened with increasing SPL. In other aspects, however, the SPL-induced changes varied considerably across ANFs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). In some ANFs, the broadening of the curves was accompanied by a downward shift to lower frequencies. For other ANFs, the shape of the amplitude curve changed little (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9E</xref>), although sometimes its position also shifted to lower frequencies (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9D</xref>). In other cases, the lower/higher flank became shallower, while the upper/lower flank and best frequency showed little change (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9A and B</xref>, respectively). In three cases, we also observed the occurrence of secondary peaks at higher SPLs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9A</xref>). Similar secondary peaks were observed in in vivo intracellular recordings of inner hair cells (Chatterjee and Zwislocki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1997</xref>, Fig.&#xA0;4).

        <p>Our data did not reveal a systematic relationship between SPL-dependent peak shifts and CF. Some ANFs showed a clear peak shift, while such a shift was completely absent in other ANFs of comparable CF (compare Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9D, E</xref>). We have not been able to link the observed variation in SPL-dependent tuning to any systematic experimental factor such as threshold of the ANF, condition of the animal, or time into the experiment. These findings are in contrast to in vivo, intracellular recordings in gerbil of low-CF (500&#x2013;2,500&#xA0;Hz) outer hair cells and Hensen cells (Zhang and Zwislocki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1996</xref>) and inner hair cells (Chatterjee and Zwislocki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1997</xref>), which showed systematic downward peak shifts (as large as two octaves in some cases) of amplitude-versus-frequency curves with increasing SPL. A potential explanation for this discrepancy is the difference in the auditory stimuli used; wideband stimuli tend to linearize the cochlear response compared to single tones (Recio-Spinoso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>). The comparison between the two types of data is difficult because little is known about the exact relation between transduction potentials in hair cells and ANF responses.</p>

        <title>Effect of SPL on phase curves and group delay</title>
        <p>The effect of SPL on phase curves was highly variable. The most consistent effect that we observed was a decline in group delay (downward slope of the phase curve) with increasing SPL, but there were exceptions even to that trend (see below). Examples of phase curves obtained at multiple SPLs are shown in Figures&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> next to the corresponding amplitude curves. As before (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), the phase curves were compensated for overall group delay as indicated in the lower-right corner of the graphs. For optimal across-SPL comparison, the same compensation was applied to all curves obtained from the same ANF.</p>
        <p>In the examples in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8A, B</xref>, phase lag at CF decreased with SPL and the downward slope around CF became shallower. The example in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>, which showed an amplitude behavior (left column) similar to that of Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8A, B</xref>, showed an opposite phase behavior, with both phase lag and near-CF group delay <italic>increasing</italic> with SPL. In Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9B</xref>, phase at CF is nearly constant across SPL, whereas the curve becomes shallower (decreasing group delay) with increasing SPL. This &#x201C;pivoting&#x201D; of the phase curve around CF was previously observed in squirrel monkey ANFs by Anderson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1971</xref>). Other examples, however, show pivoting about a frequency different from CF (below CF: Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>; above CF: Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9F</xref>) as previously observed in guinea pig by Palmer and Shackleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>) and in one ANF in the squirrel monkey (Anderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1971</xref>). The phase curves of some ANFs showed nonmonotonic effects of SPL (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9D</xref>); in other ANFs, phase was nearly constant over a large range of SPLs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9E</xref>). A similar variability in phase curves was reported for squirrel monkey (Anderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1971</xref>) and guinea pig (Palmer and Shackleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). In three ANFs, we found phase anomalies (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9C</xref>) reminiscent of those observed in gerbil by Ronken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1986</xref>) and in chinchilla by Temchin and Ruggero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>To quantify the effect of SPL on the group delays, we computed the change in group delay per 10-dB increase of stimulus intensity (&#x394;<italic>&#x3C4;</italic><sub>10dB</sub>) for each of the segments of the phase curves described earlier (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The results of this analysis are shown as a function of CF in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>. In most ANFs, near-CF group delay (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10A</xref>, circles) decreased with sound intensity (&#x394;<italic>&#x3C4;</italic><sub>10dB</sub> &lt;0). A subset of ANFs (six of 36), however, showed an increase of near-CF group delay with increasing SPL. The effect of SPL on near-CF group delays has been investigated in several mammalian species, using either single tones or first-order Wiener kernels (Anderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1971</xref>; M&#xF8;ller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1977</xref>; Carney and Yin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1988</xref>; Rhode and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1997</xref>; Recio-Spinoso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>; Palmer and Shackleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>; Temchin and Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>). For comparison, &#x394;<italic>&#x3C4;</italic><sub>10dB</sub> values estimated from those studies are displayed in Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10A</xref> (numbered dots). The different studies show comparable ranges of &#x394;<italic>&#x3C4;</italic><sub>10dB</sub> values. Interestingly, some studies report increases of group delay with increasing SPL (positive &#x394;<italic>&#x3C4;</italic><sub>10dB</sub> values), in contrast with the widespread &#x201C;textbook view&#x201D; that group delay around CF always decreases with stimulus intensity.

        <p>As before (cf. Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), off-CF group delays were split in three sets. Group delay in the 100&#x2013;400-Hz stimulus range (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10B</xref>, crosses) generally increased with increasing SPL (positive &#x394;<italic>&#x3C4;</italic><sub>10dB</sub>), whereas group delay evaluated 1.5&#x2013;0.6 octaves below CF (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10B</xref>, squares) and &gt;0.6 octaves above CF (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10B</xref>, diamonds) generally decreased with increasing SPL (negative &#x394;<italic>&#x3C4;</italic><sub>10dB</sub>). The range of &#x394;<italic>&#x3C4;</italic><sub>10dB</sub> values for the latter two regions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10B</xref>, squares and diamonds) was comparable to that observed in the near-CF region (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10A</xref>, circles).</p>

        <p>Single-tone responses of gerbil ANFs showed phase locking up to 4 to 5&#xA0;kHz (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), a frequency limit comparable to cat and somewhat higher than chinchilla and guinea pig (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>).

        <title>Amplitude curves and their dependence on SPL</title>
        <p>Frequency selectivity was assessed using amplitude curves derived from multitone responses. Tuning in low-CF gerbil ANFs (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) was less sharp than in cat (Carney and Yin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1988</xref>; Van der Heijden and Joris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>). Low-SPL amplitude curves showed a gradual change of shape with CF (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Similar CF-dependent tuning asymmetries were observed in studies employing single tones, e.g., ANF rate-frequency curves for squirrel monkey (Rose et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1971</xref>) and chinchilla (Temchin and Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>) and FTCs for gerbil (Schmiedt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1989</xref>; Ohlemiller and Echteler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1990</xref>), cat (Kiang and Moxon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1974</xref>), and chinchilla (Temchin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2008a</xref>). Similar asymmetries were also found in studies employing first-order Wiener kernels in cat (Carney and Yin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1988</xref>) and chinchilla (Recio-Spinoso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>) and tone complexes in cat (Van der Heijden and Joris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>). In these studies, tuning was nearly symmetric (on a log-frequency scale) for 0.8&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;CF&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;1.2&#xA0;kHz. In the present study, the region of symmetric tuning appeared somewhat larger (&#x223C;0.3&#x2013;1&#xA0;kHz).</p>
        <p>Because the cochlea is highly nonlinear, metrics of frequency tuning depend on the stimulus paradigm. Different paradigms emphasize different aspects. Single tones assess the differential sensitivity to frequency components presented in isolation, whereas wideband stimuli assess the ability to separate out components in the presence of other, simultaneous, components. Cochlear compression typically causes suppression of CF components by off-CF components. This effect may explain why our amplitude curves were broader than FTCs from gerbil ANFs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and for analogous differences between tuning estimated from Wiener kernels and FTCs in cat (Carney and Yin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1988</xref>).</p>
        <p>In most ANFs, amplitude curves changed systematically with SPL. The broadening of tuning agrees with Wiener-kernel data in many studies (M&#xF8;ller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1978</xref>; Harrison and Evans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1982</xref>; Carney and Yin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1988</xref>; Recio-Spinoso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>). The amplitude curves of many ANFs (particularly for CF &gt;1&#xA0;kHz) allowed an across-SPL alignment of low-frequency tails (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The resulting estimates of growth at CF (0.66&#xB1;0.22&#xA0;dB/dB; <italic>N&#x2009;=</italic>&#x2009;44) are similar to estimates of low-CF compression derived from single-tone ANF responses in guinea pig (Cooper and Yates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>) and less compressive than the 0.1&#x2013;0.2&#xA0;dB/dB in first-order Wiener-kernel spectra of basilar membrane responses in chinchilla (Recio-Spinoso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>, Fig.&#xA0;5). The lower CF range (&lt;3 versus 9.5&#xA0;kHz) may well account for the latter difference, consistent with the notion that the degree of nonlinearity increases with CF (Cooper and Yates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>).</p>
        <p>The low-tail alignment was based on the assumption that frequencies well below CF evoke a linear response. This is well documented in the base (e.g., Cooper and Rhode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1997</xref>; Ruggero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1997</xref>). Unfortunately, a comparably systematic characterization of apical (non)linearity is unavailable, prohibiting the straightforward alignment of amplitude curves from low-CF ANFs. The large variation in SPL effects across individual ANFs further complicates the interpretation of intensity-dependent tuning. Our selection of example curves (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) was guided by the intention to do justice to this variation rather than to suggest a systematic behavior not supported by the data. The variable effects of SPL likely reflect variations in nonlinear response growth in the apex. Both the degree of nonlinearity (steepness of growth) and the frequency range of nonlinear growth at a given cochlear location will affect amplitude curves obtained with wideband stimuli.</p>

        <title>Phase curves</title>
        <p>Phase curves uncompensated for overall delay appeared approximately linear (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Their downward slope reflects a group delay that includes cochlear travel and synaptic delay. Compensation for overall delay revealed a fine structure, often comprising multiple segments (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Previous studies in cat (Pfeiffer and Molnar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1970</xref>; Van der Heijden and Joris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>) and chinchilla (Temchin and Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>) reported multisegment phase curves, changing from concave upward for CFs &lt;1&#xA0;kHz to concave downward for higher CFs. The curves reported here show a similar transition.</p>
        <p>We analyzed group delays separately for the different phase-curve segments. Near-CF group delays showed a systematic decrease with CF, similar to group delays reported for other species (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). In most ANFs, phase curves became shallower (smaller group delay) with increasing SPL (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>), although there were frequent exceptions showing the opposite (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>) or nonmonotonic effects (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9D</xref>). Decreasing group delay with increasing SPL was first reported by Anderson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1971</xref>) for single-tone responses in the ANF of the squirrel monkey. Their findings are often summarized as &#x201C;pivoting&#x201D; of phase curves around CF: When SPL is increased, phase at CF stays constant, and the phase curve &#x201C;rotates&#x201D; around this fixed point. Phase pivoting was also reported in single-tone responses of guinea pig ANFs (Palmer and Shackleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>) and in noise responses in chinchilla (e.g., Recio-Spinoso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>) and cat (Carney and Yin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1988</xref>). In many of these ANFs, however, the frequency of constant phase deviated from CF.</p>
        <p>Irregularities in phase curves and the across-ANF variability of SPL effects are somewhat magnified by the compensation for overall delay from the phase curves, combined with the sharp spectral resolution of the <italic>zwuis</italic>-method compared to the smeared-out character (caused by temporal windowing) of Wiener-kernel data. The irregularities, however, were stable and reproducible within single ANFs. The deviations from simple pivoting behavior indicate the limited validity of models based on oscillators having a variable damping coefficient. Incidentally, the observation that SPL affects group delay at frequencies remote from CF (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10B</xref>) also contradicts such models (Carney and Yin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1988</xref>). Apparently, the nonlinearities in the apical responses are more complicated than an oscillator with variable damping.</p>

        <title>Relation to cochlear mechanics</title>
        <p>In the range of SPLs of the present study, Hao and Khanna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1996</xref>) observed a largely linear behavior of the cochlear apex, whereas three other studies found nonlinear growth of single-tone responses (Cooper and Rhode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>; Rhode and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>; Zinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2000</xref>). These nonlinearities occurred at &#x223C;40&#x2013;80&#xA0;dB SPL and were relatively minor compared to nonlinearities at the base. The range of stimulus frequencies evoking nonlinear growth appeared larger in the apex than in the base (Rhode and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>). Overall, the phases of single-tone responses in these apical&#x2013;mechanical studies are compatible with ANF data reported here and elsewhere. For guinea pig (Khanna and Hao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1999</xref>) and chinchilla (Rhode and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>), phase curves for CF &lt;1&#xA0;kHz can be approximated by two straight line segments (the steeper one at low frequencies). In contrast to most ANF studies, an <italic>increasing</italic> group delay with increasing SPL was found in mechanical measurements in the apex (Rhode and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>; Zinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2000</xref>) and an in vivo recording in gerbil of a Hensen cell (Zwislocki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1990</xref>; Zhang and Zwislocki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1995</xref>).</p>
        <p>To what extent are the nonlinear effects of SPL in the ANF responses caused by cochlear mechanics? After all, the transduction stage is also nonlinear. However, amplitude curves are largely insensitive to instantaneous nonlinearities of the transduction stage (De Boer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>; Van der Heijden and Joris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>), and it is unlikely that the low-pass character of transduction is strongly SPL dependent. We therefore expect amplitude curves to faithfully represent tuning at the level of the bundles of the innervated inner hair cell. This, however, may still differ from mechanical tuning measured at Reissner&#x2019;s membrane or supporting cells in the apex.</p>
        <p>Phase of ANF responses is typically interpreted in terms of mechanical vibrations by simply accounting for a 1-ms &#x201C;synaptic delay&#x201D; (Ruggero and Rich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1987</xref>), independent of SPL. It is not obvious, however, that the timing of action potentials should be SPL independent. In elementary threshold models of firing, larger amplitudes cause earlier threshold crossings, leading to smaller group delays with increased SPL. At the inner hair cell synapse, processes like vesicle release likely depend on stimulation level too (Keen and Hudspeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>; Goutman and Glowatzki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>). The transduction stage may therefore contribute its own SPL dependencies to the ANF phase. Such nonmechanical contributions are also suggested by our observation that off-CF group delay and near-CF group delay were equally affected by SPL (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>), whereas cochlear mechanical SPL effects are typically confined to the CF region (Robles and Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2001</xref>). The combination of opposing SPL effects (increasing mechanical delay; decreasing synaptic delay) may explain the apparent contradiction between mechanical data and ANF data and the variable effects of SPL on group delay of the present study (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>) and others (e.g., Temchin and Ruggero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>, Figs.&#xA0;15 and 16).</p>
        <p>Overall, the ANF data presented here and elsewhere indicate that apical mechanics is considerably nonlinear and that apical nonlinearity is qualitatively different from basal nonlinearity. The quantitative interpretation of neural data in terms of cochlear mechanics is hampered by a scarcity of independent data on the character of apical nonlinearity. Apart from additional mechanical measurements, independent insights into apical mechanics may be gained from the study of inherently nonlinear phenomena such as two-tone suppression and distortion products.</p>
