        <p>Androgen receptor function is required for normal differentiation and maintenance of the proximal epididymis, and its ablation results in obstructive azoospermia.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The epithelial lining of the epididymal duct expresses the androgen receptor (<italic>Ar</italic>) along its entire length and undergoes rapid and profound degeneration when androgenic support is withdrawn. However, experiments involving orchidectomy with systemic testosterone replacement, and testicular efferent duct ligation, have indicated that structural and functional integrity of the initial segment cannot be maintained by circulating androgen alone, leaving the role of androgen in this epididymal zone unclear. We addressed this question in a mouse model with intact testicular output and selective <italic>Ar</italic> inactivation in the proximal epididymis by creating double-transgenic males carrying a conditional <italic>Ar<sup>loxP</sup></italic> allele and expressing Cre recombinase under the promoter of <italic>Rnase10</italic>, a gene specifically expressed in proximal epididymis. At 20&#x2013;25 d of life, on the onset of <italic>Rnase10</italic> expression, <italic>Ar</italic> became selectively inactivated in the principal cells of proximal epididymis, resulting in epithelial hypoplasia and hypotrophy. Upon the subsequent onset of spermiation, epididymal obstruction ensued, with the consequent development of spermatic granulomata, back pressure-induced atrophy of the seminiferous epithelium, orchitis, and fibrosis of the testicular parenchyma. Consistent with these findings, the mice were infertile. When the effect of <italic>Ar</italic> knockout on gene expression in the proximal epididymis was compared with that of efferent duct ligation and orchidectomy, we identified genes specifically regulated by androgen, testicular efferent fluid, and both. Our findings demonstrate that the development and function of the epididymal initial segment is critically dependent on direct androgen regulation. The phenotype of the produced knockout mouse provides a novel model for obstructive azoospermia.</p>

  <body>
    <p>It is well established that the normal development and functional integrity of the epididymis are dependent on androgen action. The epididymis does not develop in the absence of normal testicular testosterone production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), and if androgen action in adult age is eliminated by orchidectomy (OE) or antiandrogen treatment, the consequence is epididymal weight loss secondary to disappearance of spermatozoa from the lumen as well as cytoplasmic shrinkage and apoptosis of epididymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). If testosterone levels are restored after castration, the regressive changes in the distal caput, corpus, and cauda epididymidis are reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) but not in the initial segment (IS), which has cast doubt on androgen dependence of this epididymal zone, whose normal function is crucial for the functional maturation of sperm. Efferent duct ligation (EDL) experiments, producing clear hypotrophic changes in the IS, have emphasized the importance of factors present in the testicular efferent fluid (<italic>i.e.</italic> lumicrine regulation) in the maintenance of structural and functional integrity of the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In agreement with this contention, a recent study on androgen replacement of regressed rat epididymis after OE showed that cell proliferation was increased in all epididymal regions except for the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, this type of experiment cannot exclude the possibility that combined action of androgen and lumicrine factors is required for the maintenance of IS. Of note, the androgen receptor (<italic>Ar</italic>) gene is strongly expressed in the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), but as stated above, its function still remains unclear.</p>
    <p>As a novel approach to elucidate the role of androgen action in epididymal function and in particular in the IS, we used the targeted gene ablation technique, crossing the <italic>Ar<sup>loxP</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) with a novel <italic>Cre</italic> deletor mouse expressing <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase under the promoter of <italic>Rnase10</italic>, a gene with specific expression in the proximal epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The results obtained clearly demonstrate a role for direct androgen action in the proximal epididymis.</p>

        <p>All experimental work involving animals was carried out with approval of the local ethics committee and in line with national regulations. Mice of the wild-type (WT) strain C57BL/6 were supplied by Charles River Laboratories (Margate, Kent, UK). Heterozygous B6.<italic>Rnase10<sup>Cre</sup></italic> males were produced, as described in Supplemental Information, published on The Endocrine Society's Journals Online web site at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://endo.endojournals.org">http://endo.endojournals.org</ext-link>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, and used for the production of proximal epididymis-specific <italic>Ar</italic> knockout mice by crossing to congenic B6.<italic>Ar<sup>loxP</sup></italic> homozygous females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Genotypes of transgenic mice were determined by PCR with allele-specific primers. The <italic>iCre</italic> sequence was identified with the following pair of primers: 5&#x2032;-CAGGCAGGCCTTCTCTGAAC-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-CATTCTCCCACCATCGGTGC-3&#x2032;, yielding an amplification product of 481 bp (annealing temperature 58 C). The intact <italic>Rnase10</italic> allele was identified with 5&#x2032;-TGGGGAATGTGAGGAGAAGG-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GCCAAGTGCCAGACCTTCTG-3&#x2032; primers (product size 383 bp; annealing temperature 58 C). Carriers of floxed (<italic>Ar<sup>loxP</sup></italic>), WT, and null alleles of <italic>Ar</italic> gene located on the X chromosome were identified as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). EDL and OE were carried out under isoflurane anesthesia, with postoperative analgesia provided by ip administration of buprenorphine.</p>

        <p>Before immunohistochemical detection of the androgen receptor (AR), antigen retrieval was carried out by boiling tissue sections in 10 m<sc>m</sc> sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20. After blocking in 8% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, sections were incubated overnight at 4 C with rabbit anti-AR IgG PG-21 (Millipore, Watford, Hertfordshire, UK) at a dilution of 1:500 in 1% BSA in PBS. After incubation with secondary antibody, biotin-labeled antirabbit IgG (ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK), at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS for 30 min, avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was applied (ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) for another 30 min. Horseradish peroxidase was then detected using the diaminobenzidine chromogen substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Once stain had developed, nonstained cell nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Stained sections were dehydrated through ascending concentrations of ethanol, cleared in Histoclear, and finally mounted in dibutyl phthalate/xylene.</p>

        <title>Generation of mice with disrupted <italic>AR</italic> in proximal epididymis</title>
        <p>For the inactivation of the <italic>Ar</italic> specifically in the proximal epididymis, we used the binary Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> transgenic technology and produced a novel <italic>Cre</italic> deletor mouse, <italic>Rnase10<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and Supplemental Materials and Methods). <italic>Ar</italic> is located on the X chromosome, and therefore, to produce males carrying both the floxed <italic>Ar</italic> exon 2 and the <italic>Rnase10<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele, female <italic>Ar<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> mice were crossed to <italic>Rnase10</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic>/+</sup> males. Male progeny of the desired genotype (<italic>Ar<sup>loxP/Y</sup></italic>, <italic>Rnase10</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic>/+</sup>) were identified by RT-PCR with allele-specific primers (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) and used for phenotype analysis. Ablation of <italic>Ar</italic> was specific for the proximal epididymis of the double-transgenic males [termed proximal epididymis-specific androgen receptor knockout mouse (ProxE-ARKO)], as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry with an anti-AR antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>B and Supplemental Fig. 1).</p>

        <p>The expression of <italic>Rnase10</italic> starts at around 17 d postpartum (dpp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) coincidentally with the differentiation of IS. Although <italic>Rnase10</italic> has previously been described to be expressed exclusively in the epididymal IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), the zone of <italic>Ar</italic> inactivation in the ProxE-ARKO mice appeared also to include the whole of segment II, continuing into segment III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>B and Supplemental Fig. 1). The spatial pattern of <italic>Ar</italic> inactivation in the ProxE-ARKO epididymis was found to correspond to the area of endogenous <italic>Rnase10</italic> expression as confirmed by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>C). The zone of <italic>Ar</italic> inactivation began abruptly in the margin between the efferent ducts and IS and waned gradually distally, without a distinct border (Supplemental Fig. 1). Immunohistochemical analysis of proximal epididymides from prepubertal mice showed that in the ProxE-ARKO males AR began to disappear from the nuclei of epithelial cells between d 20 and 25 of life (Supplemental Fig. 2). We found that during this time window, proximal epithelium began to differentiate from simple cuboidal into columnar pseudostratified. The pseudostratification is a result of appearance of different cell types within the epithelium, and we observed ablation of AR in nuclei of the middle layer, <italic>i.e.</italic> in differentiating principal cells that started to express <italic>Rnase10</italic> (Supplemental Fig. 2). Consequent to the disappearance of the AR, there was a loss of epithelial height, whereas further development of the IS was aborted. Accordingly, the principal cell-specific glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (solute carrier family 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), localized in stereocilia in IS and in microvilli in the more distal parts of the epididymis, was absent in the knockout IS but present in corpus and cauda (Supplemental Fig. 3). <italic>Ar</italic> expression remained intact in the rest of the Wolffian duct-derived structures, as well as in the testes and accessory sex glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), and similar to that detected in WT control mice (Supplemental Fig. 4).</p>

        <p>Ten knockout males that had reached maturity were mated with a total of 30 wild-type CD1 females over a period exceeding 4 months. Even though vaginal plugs were regularly observed, no pregnancies occurred. Two females were killed early on the day of mating, and upon inspection of the uterine contents, only few immotile sperm were found. Macroscopic examination of the male reproductive organs showed obstruction of the epididymis at the level of caput, revealing obstructive azoospermia as the cause of infertility.</p>

        <title>Morphological findings</title>
        <p>Under a dissecting microscope, a clear hypoplasia in IS of the ProxE-ARKO mice was observed at 30 dpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>A). Microscopic examination at around the time of onset of spermiation (39&#x2013;40 dpp) revealed a substantial decrease in height of the epithelium of epididymal segments I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>B). This was mainly due to a reduction in the number and volume of cytoplasm of the principal cells, which manifested as both dilatation of the intertubular space and as a relative increase in luminal diameter. In some specimens, the accumulation of spermatozoa in the affected segments of the epididymal duct was observed already at this stage (Supplemental Fig. 5). Further buildup of spermatozoa resulted in severe dilatation and finally complete occlusion of the duct (Supplemental Fig. 5D).</p>
        <p>As a consequence of the interruption of flow of testicular fluid, severe distension developed in the efferent ducts, rete testis and seminiferous tubules. Testes examined at the age of 4 months were increased in size apparently secondary to fluid retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>B). The seminiferous tubules were at various stages of degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, D and E), some with numerous mononuclear cells in the lumen. A significant proportion of the tubules had lost all cells of the germinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>E) and contained intraepithelial cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>F), consistent with backpressure testicular atrophy; some males were found to have developed unilateral orchitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>F). Epididymal epithelium distal to the point of occlusion displayed signs of degeneration with the formation of intraepithelial cysts and accumulation of hyaline-like material in the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>G). Spermatic granulomata were frequently observed in obstructed epididymides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, A and H).</p>

        <title>Effects of <italic>AR</italic> knockout on epididymal gene expression</title>
        <p>To address the molecular consequences of <italic>Ar</italic> ablation, the transcription of six genes with predominant expression in the principal cells of the IS was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Specific mRNA levels in the ProxE-ARKO mice were compared, besides WT controls, with those in WT mice subjected to EDL or OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). EDL and OE were carried out at 20&#x2013;25 dpp (shortly after the onset of <italic>Rnase10</italic> expression and differentiation of IS), whereas gene expression was measured at 35&#x2013;40 dpp, around the time of onset of spermiation and before the development of ductal occlusion in the ProxE-ARKO males. In this way we were able to discriminate the dependence of expression of the genes on endocrine androgen effect (reduced in PoxE-ARKO), lumicrine factors (reduced in EDL), or either one of the former (reduced in OE).</p>

        <p><italic>Rnase10</italic> and <italic>Etv4</italic> expression were similarly, and nearly totally, lost in all experimental groups, indicating that the proper expression of this gene requires both endocrine androgen action and lumicrine factors. <italic>Srd5a1</italic> expression responded in similar fashion but displayed higher residual activity that apparently represents constitutive expression independent of androgen or lumicrine regulation. <italic>Ros1</italic> expression persisted in ProxE-ARKO mice but was lost in the other two groups, indicating that it is mainly regulated by lumicrine factors, however, with a considerable constitutive component. The expression patterns of <italic>Araf</italic> and <italic>Bcl2l15</italic> were similar, with reduced levels in the <italic>AR</italic> knockout and OE groups but with persistent expression after EDL, indicating that the expression was androgen but not lumicrine factor dependent.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The development of obstruction in the proximal epididymis as a consequence of targeted <italic>Ar</italic> deletion provides strong evidence for a direct role of androgens in the regulation of this epididymal zone. Direct evidence for such androgen function has hitherto remained elusive. Besides the epididymal obstruction and decreased height of the proximal epididymal epithelium, alterations in IS gene expression were detected that were specific for the <italic>Ar</italic> ablation.</p>
      <p>Androgen dependence of the epididymis, in terms of both its development and maintenance, has long been known. However, earlier studies on EDL and OE, with and without testosterone supplementation, have emphasized the importance of exocrine testicular luminal factors in regulation of the proximal portion of epididymis, and particularly of the IS. In rats and mice, interruption of the flow of testicular fluids by EDL results in striking involution of the IS, with less dramatic, yet clear regressive changes more distally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Even more extreme involution of the epididymis is observed after bilateral OE, and administration of testosterone, even at supraphysiological doses, fails to prevent regression of the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), thus implying a relative androgen independence of this epididymal zone. Findings of the present study, however, suggest the androgen dependence of IS. Even though the epithelium of the proximal zones of the ProxE-ARKO mice is exposed to testicular fluid before the development of obstruction, it closely resembles in histological appearance the postcastration epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>B). This similarity does not rule out the role of testicular factors other than testosterone in the regulation of the proximal epididymis; rather it suggests a permissive role for androgens.</p>
      <p>Experiments in rats have indicated that the main mode of action of testosterone in caput epididymis is through its conversion into DHT via the amplification pathway operated by type I steroid 5&#x3B1;-reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Although the microsomal fraction of this enzyme found throughout the epididymis appears to be regulated by circulating testosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), 5&#x3B1;-reductase activity associated with the nuclear fraction is markedly and selectively down-regulated in IS after unilateral OE or EDL and cannot be maintained by exogenous testosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). A hypothetical model was therefore proposed that the proximal epididymis is regulated by DHT whose local formation from testosterone, <italic>i.e.</italic> by steroid 5&#x3B1;-reductase, is in turn controlled by lumicrine factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Whereas this model may apply to the rat, the situation in the mouse appears to be somewhat different. Although the administration of DHT after orchidectomy can restore the morphology of murine IS to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), the genital structures and fertility of males with 5&#x3B1;-reductase type I knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and combined type I and II knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), are largely uncompromised, with the exception of smaller prostates and seminal vesicles. The urogenital tissues (prostate, seminal vesicles, coagulating glands) of the double-knockout mice were found to accumulate high levels of testosterone, indicating that conversion of testosterone to DHT largely functions as signal amplification mechanism and is redundant in the presence of sufficient testosterone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The phenotypic mismatch between steroid 5&#x3B1;-reductase knockout males and those lacking the <italic>Ar</italic> (present study) therefore supports the contention that direct androgen action, not through the local production of DHT under lumicrine control in the IS, is sufficient to maintain normal function of the proximal zones of the epididymis.</p>
      <p>Although the disruption of <italic>Ar</italic> in the proximal epididymis resulted in the current study in severe hypoplasia of the epithelium and obstruction, it is curious that the latter does not occur in the <italic>Ros1</italic> knockout males with complete IS agenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Instead, these males are infertile because of impaired sperm volume regulation during their epididymal transit, resulting in swollen spermatozoa displaying angulated tails and inability to pass through the uterotubal junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The reason for this phenotype mismatch may be simply mechanical. In the <italic>Ros1</italic> knockout, the length of the tubule lined with underdeveloped epithelium is considerably shorter than that in the ProxE-ARKO mice, in which gene inactivation extends down to zone 3 and occurs at a later postnatal stage in a partly differentiated and therefore longer tubule. Although clogging of spermatozoa in this dead space may also be promoted by the altered luminal fluid affecting the physicochemical properties of the sperm cell surface, epididymal obstruction also ensues in a proximal epididymis with less complete, mosaic inactivation of the <italic>Ar</italic> in principal cells, as demonstrated in a study using a <italic>FoxG1-Cre</italic> mouse to inactivate <italic>Ar</italic> in the epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p>
      <p>The differential response patterns of the epididymal genes to the experimental manipulations allowed us to conclude that the proximal epididymis expresses genes that are predominately under direct androgen regulation, requiring functional <italic>Ar</italic> expression; such genes were <italic>Araf</italic> and <italic>Bcl2l15</italic>. There were also genes regulated by both androgen and lumicrine factors (<italic>Rnase10, Etv4</italic>, and <italic>Srd5a1</italic>). In this group, the lumicrine action of androgen present in testicular efferent fluid at concentrations up to 60-fold of those in blood plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) remains a possibility. On the other hand, existence of hitherto unidentified lumicrine regulators distinct from androgen is indicated by the profile of <italic>Ros1</italic> expression.</p>
      <p>The Cre<italic>-loxP</italic> technology used in this study allows spatial control over inactivation of the <italic>Ar</italic> gene, its timing being determined by the developmental onset of <italic>Rnase10</italic> expression, <italic>i.e.</italic> from d 17 postpartum by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In our immunohistochemical characterization of the prepubertal epididymal epithelium in ProxE-ARKO males, we found that the development of the proximal segment of the epididymis was aborted once the epithelial cells had reached the differentiation stage at which they began to express <italic>Rnase10</italic>. Therefore, the definitive IS never formed in ProxE-ARKO males, thus indicating an essential role of androgen in proper development of the proximal epididymis. In this context, a possibility exists that the low levels of <italic>Etv4</italic>, <italic>Araf</italic>, <italic>Srd5a1</italic>, and <italic>Bcl2l15</italic> mRNA found in the ARKO group at 35&#x2013;40 dpp may be due to the fact that <italic>Ar</italic> inactivation occurred in principal cells before the developmental onset of transcription of these genes. Gene expression analysis of prepubertal ProxE-ARKO epididymides is therefore warranted to test this possibility. On the other hand, cessation of <italic>Rnase10</italic> expression is a clear indication of direct androgen dependence of gene expression in principal cells, whose continued presence in ProxE-ARKO epididymis is signified by unaltered expression of principal cell-specific <italic>Ros1</italic>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, in contrast to previous studies that have emphasized the importance of lumicrine factors in the regulation of the proximal epididymis, our current studies provide convincing evidence for a direct role of androgen action. The phenotype of <italic>Ar</italic> knockout in proximal epididymis, <italic>i.e.</italic> obstructive azoospermia, is intriguing, and provides a hypothesis for clinical studies on disturbed androgen action in the epididymis as the pathogenetic mechanism of this form of male infertility.</p>
