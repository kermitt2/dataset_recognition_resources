      <abstract>
        <p>Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by pancreatic &#x3B2; cells is regulated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), but opposing phenotypes, GSIS improvement and impairment, have been reported for different <italic>Ucp2</italic>-ablated mouse models. By measuring mitochondrial bioenergetics in attached INS-1E insulinoma cells with and without UCP2, we show that UCP2 contributes to proton leak and attenuates glucose-induced rises in both respiratory activity and the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. Strikingly, the GSIS improvement seen upon UCP2 knockdown in INS-1E cells is annulled completely by the cell-permeative antioxidant MnTMPyP. Consistent with this observation, UCP2 lowers mitochondrial reactive oxygen species at high glucose levels. We conclude that UCP2 plays both regulatory and protective roles in &#x3B2; cells by acutely lowering GSIS and chronically preventing oxidative stress. Our findings thus provide a mechanistic explanation for the apparently discrepant findings in the field.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Type 2 diabetes is a pandemic metabolic disorder that manifests by chronic hyperglycemia. Dysfunctional pancreatic &#x3B2; cells are involved prominently in the etiology of this disorder, as they contribute heavily to the impaired ability of diseased subjects to maintain glucose homeostasis. In healthy subjects, &#x3B2; cells respond to rising blood glucose levels by secreting insulin, which is a sign for peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver to take up or store glucose, respectively. When blood glucose levels rise, &#x3B2; cells increase their oxidative catabolism of glucose, which leads to an increased mitochondrial proton motive force and an increased cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio. In the canonical model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS)<sup>2</sup>, the boosted ATP/ADP poise closes plasma membrane K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, causing plasma membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-sensitive calcium channels, calcium influx, and insulin secretion <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This order of events reflects an extraordinary bioenergetic design, as the &#x3B2; cell's response to glucose implies that its ATP/ADP ratio is controlled predominantly by ATP supply and not ATP demand, as is the case in most other cell types <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Moreover, the outlined scenario indicates that GSIS relies on the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, as it seems essential that glucose oxidation and mitochondrial ATP synthesis are coupled tightly.</p>
    <p>Pancreatic &#x3B2; cells contain a mitochondrial uncoupling protein, UCP2 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The generally anticipated molecular function of this protein is partial dissipation of the proton motive force <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, which would (mildly) uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. UCP2 activity is thus expected to attenuate GSIS, a notion that is indeed supported by a growing body of experimental evidence (reviewed in <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>). However, it should be emphasized that a direct uncoupling function of UCP2 is not accepted universally <xref rid="bb0030 bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref> and, furthermore, that studies into the effects of UCP2 activity on GSIS are equivocal. Genetic knockout of <italic>Ucp2</italic> in mice was established originally on a mixed 129/SVJ&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;C57BL/6 background and resulted in greatly improved GSIS <xref rid="bb0015 bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[3,8]</xref>. When this <italic>Ucp2</italic>-ablated strain was backcrossed onto three different genetic backgrounds, however, the GSIS phenotype was lost completely <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In fact, the resulting pure strains (C57BL/6&#xA0;J, A/J, and 129/SvImJ) all exhibited <italic>impeded</italic> GSIS, which has been attributed to the chronic oxidative stress seen in these <italic>Ucp2</italic> knockout animals <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Similarly, the improved glucose tolerance reported by Zhang et al. <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> was not replicated in <italic>Ucp2-</italic>knockout backcrossed mice <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It is evident from these discrepant observations that unambiguous interpretation of studies with <italic>Ucp2</italic>-ablated mice is difficult given the confounding effects of genetic background. Such interpretation is complicated further by likely secondary or systemic effects caused by the ubiquitous and persistent absence of UCP2 protein from knockout animals. The inconsistent effect of <italic>Ucp2</italic> knockout on GSIS in different mouse strains, for example, may partly be due to the chronic lack of UCP2 in macrophages <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and pro-opiomelanocortin neurons <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The ab initio absence of UCP2 in these tissues may well have differentially affected, respectively, the immune status and the hypothalamic glucose sensing ability of the various animal strains.</p>
    <p>Interpretational difficulties of whole-animal studies can be avoided by using less complicated experimental systems such as clonal &#x3B2; cells. The relative strength of such a cellular approach is highlighted by our previous studies with INS-1E insulinoma cells <xref rid="bb0060 bb0065 bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[12&#x2013;14]</xref>, a widely used &#x3B2;-cell model that has retained most important characteristics of primary &#x3B2; cells, including GSIS <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We have shown that acute siRNA treatment of INS-1E cells can lead to 80&#x2013;90% knockdown of UCP2 protein within 48&#xA0;h of transfection <xref rid="bb0065 bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[13,14]</xref>. This relatively acute knockdown of UCP2 protein causes a marked improvement in GSIS <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which agrees well with the original <italic>Ucp2</italic> knockout studies in mice <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Our RNAi experiments furthermore revealed that UCP2 contributes significantly to the exceptionally high mitochondrial proton leak activity of INS-1E cells <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This finding led us to the assertion that UCP2 regulates the canonical GSIS pathway through modulating the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation <xref rid="bb0025 bb0065 bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[5,13,14]</xref>, a notion that has indeed been put forward by many others (e.g., <xref rid="bb0015 bb0080 bb0085 bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[3,16&#x2013;18]</xref>). In light of the recent observation that hydrogen peroxide is an important noncanonical GSIS signal <xref rid="bb0095 bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>, however, we decided to explore the possibility that UCP2 activity affects GSIS by modulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS).</p>
    <p>In this paper we report that the improvement of GSIS observed upon UCP2 knockdown in INS-1E cells is completely annulled in the presence of the cell-permeative antioxidant MnTMPyP. We show furthermore that UCP2 knockdown in <italic>attached</italic> INS-1E cells lowers mitochondrial respiratory activity, amplifies a glucose-induced increase in mitochondrial coupling efficiency, and, unexpectedly, improves the cells&#x2019; respiratory response to glucose. Importantly, we demonstrate that UCP2 activity lowers hydroethidine (DHE) oxidation at high glucose levels, but only when this ROS probe is targeted to mitochondria. We conclude that UCP2 lowers GSIS, at least partly, by lowering mitochondrial ROS.</p>

        <p>INS-1E cells were obtained from Pierre Maechler and Claes Wollheim (Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland) and grown as reported previously <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> in RPMI medium containing 11&#xA0;mM glucose and 2&#xA0;mM glutamine. An 80&#x2013;90% knockdown of UCP2 protein was accomplished through siRNA transfection of INS-1E cells grown on XF24 (Seahorse Bioscience) or 96-well (Costar 3595; Corning) tissue culture plates. We have previously confirmed this level of UCP2 knockdown by Western analysis <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and have also shown that such knockdown is achieved with siRNA oligonucleotides targeted at three different <italic>Ucp2</italic> exons <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Cells were grown overnight after seeding to about 50% confluence, transfected with 200&#xA0;nM <italic>Ucp</italic>2-targeted siRNA (predesigned by Ambion, Huntingdon, UK; see <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) in complex with 1.7&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), and subjected to GSIS, bioenergetic, and ROS assays 48&#xA0;h posttransfection. To identify potential nonspecific effects, control cells were transfected in parallel with 200&#xA0;nM scrambled siRNA (Silencer Negative Control 1; Ambion).</p>

        <p>Cells seeded (at 40,000 cells per well) and transfected on 96-well plates were starved for 2&#xA0;h in RPMI that lacked glucose and pyruvate and contained only 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were washed twice with a glucose-free Hepes-buffered Krebs&#x2013;Ringer medium composed of 135&#xA0;mM NaCl, 3.6&#xA0;mM KCl, 10&#xA0;mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.5&#xA0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5&#xA0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5&#xA0;mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2&#xA0;mM glutamine, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (KRH). Cells were then incubated in KRH&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;20&#xA0;&#x3BC;M MnTMPyP (a cell-permeative superoxide dismutase mimetic <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>) for 30&#xA0;min at 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C using a shaking plate incubator (Labnet International, Oakham, UK) set at 100&#xA0;rpm. Note that metalloporphyrins such as MnTMPyP generally scavenge not only superoxide but, to different extents, also hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and lipid peroxyl radicals <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Next, the medium was replaced with KRH containing 2, 5, or 30&#xA0;mM glucose, again in the presence or the absence of 20&#xA0;&#x3BC;M MnTMPyP. After another 30-min shaking incubation at 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C, the medium was collected and centrifuged to pellet any detached cells. Supernatants were assayed for insulin by ELISA (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden) using mouse insulin as a standard. Note that our KRH formulation contains 2&#xA0;mM glutamine to maintain UCP2 protein levels in control cells (cf. <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>), but lacks the usually included sodium bicarbonate to prevent alkalinization of the medium during the assay.</p>

        <p>In experiments designed to measure bioenergetic parameters under conditions identical to those applied during GSIS assays (<xref rid="f0010 f0015" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#xA0;2 and 3</xref>), cells were seeded (40,000 cells/well) and transfected on Seahorse XF24 plates.

The XF24 plate was then transferred to a temperature-controlled (37&#xA0;&#xB0;C) Seahorse analyzer and subjected to a 10-min equilibration period and 3 assay cycles, comprising a 1-min mix, 2-min wait, and 3-min measure period each (cf. <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>); then glucose (2, 5, or 30&#xA0;mM in KRH) was added by automatic pneumatic injection. After 10 further assay cycles, oligomycin (1&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml) was added to inhibit the ATP synthase and thus approximate the proportion of respiration used to drive ATP synthesis (coupling efficiency). Each experimental trace was ended by addition of a rotenone (1&#xA0;&#x3BC;M) and myxothiazol (2&#xA0;&#x3BC;M) mixture to determine the nonmitochondrial respiratory rate, which was subtracted from all other rates. The stated inhibitor concentrations gave maximum effects as verified by doubling the concentrations. Coupling efficiency was calculated as the oligomycin-sensitive fraction of glucose-stimulated mitochondrial respiratory activity (last rate before oligomycin addition). The mitochondrial respiratory response to glucose was normalized as the ratio of glucose-stimulated and basal oxygen uptake activities (last rates before oligomycin and glucose addition, respectively).</p>
        <p>In experiments designed to determine absolute oxygen consumption rates (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>), cells were also seeded (20,000 cells/well) and transfected on XF24 plates. On the day of assay (i.e., 48&#xA0;h posttransfection), however, the cells were not starved of glucose in RPMI, but incubated instead for 1&#xA0;h in a 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C air incubator in KRH containing 2&#xA0;mM glucose but lacking bovine serum albumin. After a 10-min equilibration in the Seahorse analyzer and 4 assay cycles to measure basal respiration, the cells were subjected to 30&#xA0;mM glucose. In parallel experiments, either oligomycin (1&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml) or a mixture of oligomycin (1&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml), rotenone (1&#xA0;&#x3BC;M), and myxothiazol (2&#xA0;&#x3BC;M) was added after 10 further cycles to allow assessment of coupling efficiency and nonmitochondrial respiratory activity, respectively (see the <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref> legend for more detail). Immediately after the Seahorse assay, the cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and nuclear DNA was then stained with 4&#x2032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; applied at a 1:5000 dilution). DAPI-stained cells were imaged using a wide-field microscope (10&#xD7; magnification) and view fields were assembled to construct images of individual XF24 wells. Cells (nuclei) were counted using Image Analyst software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imageanalyst.net">http://www.imageanalyst.net</ext-link>) and specific oxygen consumption rates were calculated as nanomoles atomic oxygen consumed per minute per 10<sup>6</sup> cells.</p>

This approach is superior to our previous bioenergetic assessment of <italic>trypsinized</italic> INS-1E cells <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> as it removes the concern that the UCP2 knockdown phenotype is facilitated by a trypsin-induced stress response.</p>

        <p><xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#xA0;1</xref>A and 1B present time-resolved absolute respiratory activities exhibited by attached INS-1E cells that were transfected with scrambled or <italic>Ucp2</italic>-targeted siRNA and that had been starved for 1&#xA0;h before assay of respiration in KRH containing merely 2&#xA0;mM glucose and lacking bovine serum albumin. After four basal rate measurements, the glucose concentration was raised to 30&#xA0;mM and, in parallel experiments, the ATP synthase (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>A) and also the mitochondrial respiratory chain (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>B) were subsequently inhibited, respectively, by oligomycin or a mixture of oligomycin, rotenone, and myxothiazol. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#xA0;1</xref>A and 1B show that a raised glucose concentration causes small respiratory increases in cells with and without UCP2. Although these increases are relatively modest and the respiratory rates are somewhat variable, it may be noted that UCP2-containing cells achieve, relatively rapidly, an activity that is steadier than that exhibited by UCP2-lacking cells. In fact, glucose-stimulated cells without UCP2 do <italic>not</italic> reach a steady respiratory rate until other effectors are added (cf. the normalized respiratory responses to glucose shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>C). As expected, oxygen uptake is lowered both by oligomycin (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>A) and by the mix of oligomycin, rotenone, and myxothiazol (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>B). Under all conditions and at all time points, the absolute total respiratory activity of UCP2-containing cells is higher than that of their UCP2-ablated counterparts. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>C shows these respiratory activities corrected for nonmitochondrial oxygen consumption and, although statistically not significant, it can be seen that UCP2 knockdown tends to lower mitochondrial respiration at 30&#xA0;mM glucose both in the absence and in the presence of oligomycin. This finding is consistent with our previous study with trypsinized INS-1E cells <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and indicates that UCP2 activity stimulates mitochondrial proton leak rate in attached INS-1E cells. The observation that nonmitochondrial respiration is decreased by UCP2 knockdown as well (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>B) is again consistent with the trypsinized cell data, although the nature of this effect remains unclear. The absolute mitochondrial respiratory activities shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>C are about 70&#x2013;80% higher than the &#x201C;trypsinized&#x201D; activities <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which is most probably due to a different experimental design in terms of assay medium composition and glucose concentration. The rate-lowering effect of UCP2 knockdown is more pronounced in the presence than in the absence of oligomycin (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>C), which is reflected by the comparatively high coupling efficiency of UCP2-depleted cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>D). Note that the effect of UCP2 knockdown on coupling efficiency (a normalized parameter) is indeed statistically significant.</p>
        <p>We stress that we define coupling efficiency as the proportion of mitochondrial respiration that is used to drive ATP synthesis, i.e., the respiratory fraction that is sensitive to oligomycin. In principle, therefore, an increased coupling efficiency could be due to either decreased proton leak rate or increased rate of ADP phosphorylation. A lowered proton leak rate would <italic>decrease</italic> respiration, whereas a rise in phosphorylation rate would <italic>increase</italic> it. UCP2 knockdown results in both an increased coupling efficiency (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>D) and a decreased mitochondrial respiratory activity (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>C), demonstrating that knockdown of UCP2 is associated with decreased proton leak rate across the mitochondrial inner membrane.</p>

        <p>Next, we probed coupling efficiencies in attached cells under conditions that were <italic>identical</italic> to those applied during the GSIS assay. First, we performed a static GSIS experiment challenging glucose-starved INS-1E cells with and without UCP2 with 2, 5, and 30&#xA0;mM glucose.

This GSIS improvement is somewhat more pronounced than reported previously <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which is probably due to the presence of glutamine in all our current buffers to ensure that UCP2 protein is retained in the control cells throughout the assay <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In parallel experiments, we then determined the effects of glucose challenge on the mitochondrial bioenergetics of starved INS-1E cells with and without UCP2. <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>B shows that a rise in glucose concentration from 2 to 30&#xA0;mM increases the coupling efficiency of UCP2-containing cells from 0.13 to 0.32 on average. This increase is more significant in UCP2-depleted cells, leading to a coupling efficiency of 0.41 on average at 30&#xA0;mM glucose. It can be taken from these data that UCP2 activity dampens a glucose-induced increase in mitochondrial coupling efficiency. This outcome is consistent with our previous conclusion that UCP2 attenuates GSIS because of its considerable contribution to mitochondrial proton leak <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>

        <p><xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#xA0;1</xref>A and 1B show that the absolute respiratory activity of INS-1E cells is increased modestly when the glucose concentration is raised from 2 to 30&#xA0;mM. The data shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>C were obtained in a different set of experiments and quantify this respiratory effect by normalizing glucose-stimulated activity to the basal activity measured in glucose-starved INS-1E cells with and without UCP2. When glucose levels are kept low after the basal &#x201C;starved&#x201D; measurements (i.e., when KRH with only 2&#xA0;mM glucose is added), respiration in cells with and without UCP2 declines gradually, leading to rates after 10 assay cycles that are approximately 70% of the initial activity (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>C, G2). This respiratory decline may reflect the cells&#x2019; response to the prolonged glucose deprivation. When UCP2-containing cells are challenged with 5 or 30&#xA0;mM glucose, the respiratory activity increases to values that are, respectively, about 10 and 30% higher than the basal activity (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>C, G5 and G30, open bars). Knockdown of UCP2 improves this normalized respiratory response, at both 5 and 30&#xA0;mM glucose, which leads to stimulated rates that are, respectively, about 25 and 70% above the basal rate (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>C, G5 and G30, shaded bars). The improvement at 30&#xA0;mM glucose is statistically significant and it can thus be concluded that, rather unexpectedly, UCP2 restrains a glucose-induced increase in mitochondrial respiration. When the data shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#xA0;1</xref>A and 1B are normalized to basal mitochondrial respiration, a similar, though somewhat less pronounced, UCP2 phenotype transpires (not shown). Variation in the size of the UCP2 effect is probably due to differences in experimental design, particularly with respect to glucose starvation before the respective sets of measurements (see Experimental procedures).</p>

        <title>GSIS improvement upon UCP2 knockdown is annulled when ROS are scavenged</title>
        <p>In light of increasing evidence that ROS are important GSIS signals <xref rid="bb0095 bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>, we explored the possibility that GSIS regulation by UCP2 is affected not only by coupling efficiency but also by mitochondrial ROS. To do this, we repeated the GSIS and bioenergetic experiments described in the previous two paragraphs, but now in the presence of MnTMPyP, a potent and cell-permeative antioxidant <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Strikingly, the UCP2 knockdown-mediated rise in insulin secretion seen at 30&#xA0;mM glucose was fully annulled when ROS were scavenged by 20&#xA0;&#x3BC;M MnTMPyP (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>A). This observation associates UCP2 with ROS in terms of GSIS regulation, but not in the manner suggested by Krauss et al. <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, who reported a dose-dependent MnTBAP-induced stimulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic islets. Because the effect of MnTBAP, an antioxidant slightly less potent than MnTMPyP <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, was observed exclusively in UCP2-containing islets, it was interpreted as prevention of superoxide-mediated UCP2 activation <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Quite differently, MnTMPyP does not affect GSIS by UCP2-containing INS-1E cells (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>A). Instead, our data reveal that a lack of UCP2 protein can be compensated for by the presence of a ROS scavenger and therefore suggest that UCP2 activity attenuates GSIS, at least in part, by dampening ROS levels.</p>
        <p>Importantly, the presence of 20&#xA0;&#x3BC;M MnTMPyP during respiration measurements with glucose-starved INS-1E cells has no effect on either coupling efficiency (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>B) or normalized glucose-stimulated respiration (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>C). The absolute value of these bioenergetic parameters, in cells both with and without UCP2, is not significantly affected by ROS scavenging. The MnTMPyP insensitivity of the UCP2-knockdown effect on the INS-1E coupling efficiency is somewhat surprising, because the superoxide activation of UCP2-mediated effects in pancreatic islets <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> had raised the expectation that MnTMPyP would increase coupling efficiency of UCP2-containing cells at 30&#xA0;mM glucose.</p>

        <title>MitoSOX oxidation by INS-1E cells</title>
        <p>Although the MnTMPyP effect on GSIS in itself shows that this chemical is active when added to INS-1E cells, we wished to establish more directly that it scavenged ROS. If MnTMPyP indeed scavenges ROS (including superoxide) in INS-1E cells, then it should lower the rate of DHE oxidation, an activity that can be monitored fluorimetrically and that is widely used to detect superoxide in cultured cells <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Note that DHE is oxidized not only by superoxide but also by hydrogen peroxide (in the presence of peroxidases) and intracellular oxidoreductases <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>A shows several typical fluorescence progress curves that reflect the oxidation by INS-1E cells of MitoSOX, a DHE derivative that is targeted to mitochondria because of its conjugation to the lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation. The slope of these fluorescence traces reports mitochondrial ROS <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, a notion that is corroborated by the expected responses of MitoSOX oxidation to antimycin A and the uncoupling agent FCCP, which increase and decrease this slope, respectively (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>A). Similar traces shown in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>B illustrate qualitatively that MnTMPyP lowers the rate of MitoSOX oxidation both in the absence and in the presence of antimycin A. This effect is statistically significant only in the presence of antimycin A (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>C), but demonstrates that MnTMPyP effectively lowers ROS concentrations in the presence of MitoSOX. From this it may be inferred that MnTMPyP indeed lowers (mitochondrial) ROS levels in INS-1E cells. Furthermore, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>D shows that MnTMPyP decreases MitoSOX oxidation rates at low and high glucose levels when nontransfected INS-1E cells are subjected to conditions applied during the GSIS experiments. Raising the glucose concentration from 2 to 30&#xA0;mM may increase ROS concentration slightly, but this effect is statistically not significant (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>D).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The possibility that UCP2 might be a relevant GSIS regulator has provoked considerable interest (see, e.g., <xref rid="bb0025 bb0125 bb0130 bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[5,25&#x2013;27]</xref> for reviews) as this mitochondrial carrier could well be an attractive therapeutic target in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The various genetically modified mouse models that have been established to explore this possibility, however, exhibit inconsistent phenotypes: glucose tolerance and GSIS in the original <italic>Ucp2</italic>-deficient mouse are improved <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, whereas in more backcrossed strains they are unaffected <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> or impeded <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Not surprisingly, these diametrically opposite observations have led to rather different suggestions for the in vivo function of UCP2. On one hand, a pathological role in the etiology of type 2 diabetes has been suggested <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and on the other, a physiological role in the protection against oxidative stress has been proposed <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. If UCP2 is to be considered a therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes, it seems essential to shed light on these disparate findings. Our data increase the understanding as to how GSIS is regulated by UCP2 and thus provide mechanistic grounding for the apparently discrepant findings in the field. Because all our data were obtained using a clonal &#x3B2;-cell model, obvious caution is warranted in their physiological interpretation.</p>

        <title>GSIS regulation by UCP2</title>
        <p>Arguably our most striking observation is that GSIS improvement after UCP2 knockdown is abolished by MnTMPyP (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>A), which indicates that UCP2 attenuates GSIS by depressing ROS levels. This result is consistent with the recent awareness that ROS are an important signal during GSIS <xref rid="bb0095 bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[19,20]</xref>. Pi and colleagues showed that addition of 1&#x2013;4&#xA0;&#x3BC;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to mouse islets or insulinoma cells increases insulin secretion at low glucose levels. Insulin secretion is also increased by diethyl maleate, a compound that raises intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. GSIS is inhibited by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavengers, but is unaffected by a cell-permeative superoxide dismutase <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In agreement with these data, our UCP2-containing cells exhibit GSIS that is insensitive to MnTMPyP (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>A). However, the MnTMPyP sensitivity of UCP2-depleted cells indicates that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is not a relevant signal during the GSIS that is facilitated by a lack of UCP2. ROS-mediated GSIS attenuation by UCP2, therefore, probably occurs via a mechanism (probably involving superoxide) different from the one that accounts for the findings of Pi et al. <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>INS-1E cells tend to exhibit glucose-stimulated MitoSOX oxidation, but only in the absence of UCP2 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>A). Importantly, oxidation of DHE <italic>not</italic> targeted to mitochondria is fully glucose insensitive even in the absence of UCP2 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>B). Moreover, MitoSOX oxidation is decreased by MnTMPyP (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>A), which annuls the UCP2-dependent difference seen at high glucose. Together, these data suggest that UCP2 lowers GSIS by dampening glucose-induced ROS production. Two points of caution, however, deserve attention.</p>
        <p>First, MitoSOX equilibrates across the mitochondrial inner membrane according to the Nernst equation and thus accumulates in a membrane potential (&#x2206;&#x3C8;)-dependent manner <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It is therefore conceivable that the MitoSOX concentration achieved in mitochondria lacking UCP2 is higher than that reached in their UCP2-containing counterparts, based on the assertion that UCP2 activity partially dissipates the &#x2206;&#x3C8;. Because MitoSOX oxidation depends on probe concentration (the dose dependency is linear up to 50&#xA0;nM in cultured neurons <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>), the UCP2 effect at 30&#xA0;mM glucose (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>A) could formally be due to a probe accumulation difference. This eventuality seems unlikely, however, because we applied a saturating MitoSOX concentration (5&#xA0;&#x3BC;M). More importantly, UCP2 knockdown is not expected to increase the &#x2206;&#x3C8; exclusively at 30&#xA0;mM glucose, but also (perhaps even <italic>more</italic> so given the underlying kinetics of oxidative phosphorylation <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) at 2 and 5&#xA0;mM glucose. MitoSOX oxidation at these glucose levels is not affected significantly by UCP2 knockdown (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>A).</p>
        <p>The second issue that requires attention is the apparent lack of effect of UCP2 knockdown on DHE oxidation (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>B). Even without a specific targeting moiety, DHE is expected to achieve concentrations that are sufficient to detect mitochondrial ROS. It is important to appreciate in this respect that pancreatic &#x3B2; cells contain NADPH oxidases that produce considerable amounts of cytoplasmic superoxide <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It should be realized too that DHE is oxidized not only by superoxide but also by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (in the presence of peroxidases) and intracellular oxidoreductases <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, which probably explains the relative insensitivity of DHE oxidation to MnTMPyP (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>B). We assert that DHE is mainly oxidized by cytoplasmic INS-1E events (supported by insensitivity of DHE oxidation to antimycin A; data not shown) that mask any effect UCP2 may have on mitochondrial ROS production. MitoSOX oxidation, on the other hand, is dominated by mitochondrial ROS because of the vast accumulation of this probe into the mitochondrial matrix, which is evidenced by stimulatory and inhibitory effects of antimycin A and FCCP, respectively (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>A).</p>
        <p>The differential effect of UCP2 on MitoSOX and DHE oxidation (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>) is readily interpreted as an exclusive effect of UCP2 on mitochondrial ROS production. Our data do not explain <italic>how</italic> these ROS stimulate GSIS. Presumably it is attenuation of the proton motive force by UCP2 that lowers mitochondrial ROS production (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>) and decreases the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>B). Decreased coupling efficiency attenuates glucose-induced rises in the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio. Further research is required to quantify the relative importance of the UCP2 effects on ROS and ATP/ADP in terms of GSIS regulation, although the full sensitivity to MnTMPyP (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>A) suggests strongly that the UCP2 phenotype is mediated mainly via ROS in our experiments. Interestingly, our bioenergetic data disclose another novel mechanism by which mitochondrial uncoupling may lower GSIS, as UCP2 activity also dampens the cells&#x2019; respiratory response to glucose (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>C). It is currently unclear how the self-reinforcement of glucose oxidation is effected, but ROS, ATP/ADP, or Krebs cycle intermediates are all possible signals. The MnTMPyP insensitivity of the UCP2 effect (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>C), however, implies that mitochondrial ROS are the least likely cue. The relative tardiness of the effect (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#xA0;1</xref>A and 1B) indicates that mitochondrial biogenesis may be required.</p>

        <title>UCP2 function and regulation</title>
        <p>Although the attenuating effect of UCP2 activity on glucose-stimulated coupling efficiency (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>B) and mitochondrial ROS production (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>) agrees with a primary proton leak function, it is possible that a different UCP2 activity accounts for these phenotypes. For example, putative pyruvate export by UCP2 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> could explain in principle how UCP2 dampens glucose-dependent respiration, ROS production, and coupling efficiency, by oxidizing and slowing the electron transport chain. However, measurements of absolute respiratory activity in cells with and without UCP2 distinguish simply between a proton leak and pyruvate export function. As demonstrated before in pancreatic islets <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and trypsinized INS-1E cells <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, UCP2 knockdown <italic>lowers</italic> the mitochondrial respiratory rates of attached INS-1E cells, in the absence but particularly the presence of oligomycin (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>C). This finding demonstrates that UCP2 contributes to mitochondrial proton leak. If UCP2 exported pyruvate, then the absolute respiratory activities would have <italic>increased</italic> upon UCP2 knockdown.</p>
        <p>Previous work from our laboratory has led to the notion that UCPs attenuate &#x2206;&#x3C8; only when they are activated, for example, by superoxide <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Although functional regulation of novel UCPs is the subject of ongoing debate <xref rid="bb0030 bb0035 bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[6,7,33]</xref>, some experimental evidence supports UCP2 activation in cells. In thymocytes, for example, UCP2 activity is stimulated by the retinoic acid analogue TTNPB <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and all UCP2-mediated pathological effects in pancreatic islets depend on superoxide <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, our current data do not favor UCP2 activation in INS-1E cells by superoxide. ROS scavenging by MnTMPyP in UCP2-containing INS-1E cells does <italic>not</italic> lead to improved GSIS (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>A), coupling efficiency (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>B), or an increased normalized respiratory response to glucose (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>C). Although MnTMPyP clearly lowers mitochondrial ROS (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#xA0;3</xref>B, 3C, 3D, and <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A), it remains possible that the concentration we applied (20&#xA0;&#x3BC;M) is insufficient to acutely reverse already activated UCP2. In that case, it would be surprising that 10&#x2013;20&#xA0;&#x3BC;M MnTBAP prevents UCP2 activation in pancreatic islets <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Similarly, INS-1E respiration is not affected significantly by TTNPB either, even when the compound is added in the presence of oligomycin (C. Affourtit and M.D. Brand, unpublished data). In our hands, TTNPB <italic>does</italic> in fact inhibit GSIS, but in a UCP2-independent manner. Together with the recent observation that &#x3B2;-cell UCP2 is not activated by fatty acids <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, our data may suggest that UCP2 activity is not regulated acutely in cultured &#x3B2; cells, perhaps because the protein is permanently or constitutively activated. In that case, activity in these cells would be controlled exclusively by transcription and translation against a background of exceptionally rapid UCP2 protein degradation <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The work presented in this paper highlights the relative strength of the INS-1E model, providing new insights into UCP2 function and regulation. Importantly, we have shown that UCP2 attenuates GSIS in a manner that can be mimicked by the antioxidant MnTMPyP. This finding reaffirms that UCP2 is an acute regulator of GSIS, which agrees with the GSIS phenotype exhibited by the original <italic>Ucp2</italic>-knockout mouse <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Moreover, we have shown that UCP2 lowers mitochondrial ROS in INS-1E cells at high glucose concentrations. This particular result provides a direct mechanistic basis for the oxidative stress phenotype exhibited by the more recently established <italic>Ucp2</italic>-deficient mouse strains <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. We conclude that through modulation of mitochondrial ROS production, UCP2 plays both regulatory and protective roles in pancreatic &#x3B2; cells as its activity will attenuate GSIS acutely and, in the long term, will also prevent oxidative stress.</p>

        <p>UCP2 knockdown lowers mitochondrial respiratory rate and increases the coupling efficiency of attached INS-1E cells. (A and B) Time-resolved absolute respiratory rates (<italic>J</italic><sub>o</sub>), normalized to cell number as measured by nuclear staining, of cells transfected with <italic>Ucp2</italic>-targeted (closed symbols) or scrambled siRNA (open symbols) and treated as described under Experimental procedures. After four Seahorse assay cycles at 2&#xA0;mM glucose, cells were subjected to 30&#xA0;mM glucose (G30) and, in parallel experiments, either oligomycin (O) or a mixture of oligomycin, rotenone, and myxothiazol (ORM). Each time point represents the average&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;SEM (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;8&#x2013;12) of 8&#x2013;12 separate wells sampled from seven independent Seahorse XF24 plates. (C) Respiratory rates in the presence of the oligomycin/rotenone/myxothiazol mix were averaged and subtracted from all other rates to yield mitochondria-specific respiratory activities. Glucose-stimulated activity (G30) is the average of the last two rate measurements before oligomycin addition, and the oligomycin-insensitive activity (oligomycin) is the average of the two rates after this addition. (D) Coupling efficiencies were calculated as the fraction of glucose-stimulated mitochondrial oxygen uptake that is sensitive to oligomycin and thus reflects respiratory activity used to drive ATP synthesis. The data in (C) and (D) are averages&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;SEM (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;13&#x2013;15) of 13 (scrambled siRNA, open bars) or 15 (<italic>Ucp2</italic>-targeted siRNA, shaded bars) separate wells sampled from seven independent XF24 plates. *<italic>p</italic>&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.05.</p>

        <p>UCP2 knockdown improves GSIS in a MnTMPyP-sensitive manner, amplifies a glucose-induced rise in coupling efficiency, and improves the cells&#x2019; respiratory response to glucose. Cells transfected with <italic>Ucp2</italic>-targeted or scrambled siRNA (shaded and open bars, respectively) were first starved of glucose as described under Experimental procedures and then subjected to glucose in the absence (G2, G5, G30) or presence (G5-PyP, G30-PyP) of 20&#xA0;&#x3BC;M MnTMPyP; G2, G5, and G30 reflect 2, 5, and 30&#xA0;mM glucose, respectively. (A) Insulin secretion data are averages&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;SEM of four independent experiments with each condition assayed six times. (B) Mitochondrial coupling efficiencies and (C) the respiratory responses of the cells to glucose are averages&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;SEM of 4&#x2013;11 separate XF24 runs.
