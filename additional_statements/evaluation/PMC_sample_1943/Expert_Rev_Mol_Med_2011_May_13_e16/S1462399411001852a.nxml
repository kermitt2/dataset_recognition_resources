      <abstract>
        <p>The analysis of cell-free fetal nucleic acids in maternal blood for prenatal diagnosis
          has been transformed by several recent profound technology developments. The most
          noteworthy of these are &#x2018;digital PCR&#x2019; and &#x2018;next-generation
          sequencing&#x2019; (NGS), which might finally deliver the long-sought goal of
          noninvasive detection of fetal aneuploidy. Recent data, however, indicate that NGS might
          even be able to offer a much more detailed appraisal of the fetal genome, including
          paternal and maternal inheritance of point mutations for mendelian disorders such as
          &#x3B2;-thalassaemia. Although these developments are very exciting, in their current
          form they are still too complex and costly, and will need to be simplified considerably
          for their optimal translation to the clinic. In this regard, targeted NGS does appear to
          be a step in the right direction, although this should be seen in the context of ongoing
          progress with the isolation of fetal cells and with proteomic screening markers.</p>

  <body>
    <p>In the past few years it has become clear that the demographic shift towards increasing
        maternal age for pregnancies in developed nations, with its associated risks of fetal
        chromosomal anomalies, will necessitate a change in current strategies for prenatal
        screening and detection of fetal aneuploidies (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). This is illustrated by a recent
        analysis of the English and Welsh National Down Syndrome (DS) Cytogenetic Register over the
        period 1989&#x2013;2008 (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), which reported
        a 71% increase in the number of diagnosed cases with DS, with no comparable increase in
        birth rate. The increase in the number of cases with DS was largely attributed to the
        concomitant increase in maternal age, as more than 20% of pregnancies now occur in mothers
        older than 35 years (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>).</p>
    <p>This development is likely to add additional costs to already strained healthcare budgets,
        because positive cases from initial noninvasive screening based on ultrascans and maternal
        serum biochemical analysis need to be verified by invasive analysis such as amniocentesis or
        chorionic villous sampling, which are labour-intensive examinations requiring highly skilled
        personnel (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). To break this spiralling cost,
        it would be advantageous for any future noninvasive method to be so accurate that it could
        function as a &#x2018;stand-alone&#x2019; test and not require further invasive
        verification. Naturally, it will also need to be considerably cheaper than current invasive
        practices. An alternative scenario might be to use such a noninvasive test to reduce the
        cost and risk associated with the invasive analysis of the high number of false-positive
        cases resulting from current screening practice (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). In either case, strenuous efforts
        will need to be undertaken in order to ensure that cost-effective noninvasive prenatal
        diagnosis of DS cases finally becomes a reality (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p>
    <sec sec-type="" id="sec2">
      <title>Has research in the field of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis become
        &#x2018;mature&#x2019;?</title>
      <p>Since the discovery of fetal cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) in maternal plasma or serum in 1997
        (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), more than 1000 papers have been published
        on this topic. A cursory review of publications listed in public depositories such as PubMed
          (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed</uri>) suggests that the most prolific period was
        probably the latter half of the previous decade. In this period, several large-scale studies
        were initiated to test the efficacy of this new-found tool for the noninvasive determination
        of fetal genetic traits such as the fetal RhD (Rhesus D) gene or gender (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). These
        data indicated that this approach was indeed sufficiently robust that widespread clinical
        application could be safely implemented, and as a result concerted efforts were undertaken
        by multicentre consortia, such as the European Union (EU)-funded SAFE Network, to
        standardise these assays (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). These data also indicated that the analysis of
        cf-fetal DNA could form the secure and sound basis for subsequent developments, such as the
        noninvasive detection of fetal aneuploidies (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).</p>
      <p>In recent years this prolific output in publications seems to have largely tapered off,
        although the number of reviews dealing with the field has increased tremendously. Hence the
        scenario appears very similar to economic models of the &#x2018;product life
        cycle&#x2019;, where a particular item has progressed through development, introduction
        and growth, and is settling into a pattern of maturity and subsequent decline (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Although this simplistic view might lead to the
        impression that research in this field has waned, this is far from the truth, for this
        punctuated modicum in published reports indicates that the field has finally entered a phase
        where quality, using a quantum leap in technological development, rather than quantity is
        the prevailing trend. This facet will become very evident in this review.</p>

    <sec sec-type="" id="sec3">
      <title>The question of fetal cell-free DNA fragment size and concentration</title>
      <p>It is necessary to reiterate that the major problem still hampering the use of fetal cf-DNA
        for the noninvasive detection of fetal genetic loci that are not distinct from maternal loci
        is that fetal sequences constitute only 5&#x2013;10% of the total cf-DNA in maternal
        plasma, and even less in maternal serum (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>).</p>
      <p>Groundbreaking research performed in the middle of the past decade on the biophysical
        properties of cf-DNA indicated that fetal cf-DNA was more fragmented and had a shorter size
        than comparable maternal cf-DNA fragments (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Interestingly, this topic still continues to
        be the focus of intense research efforts and considerable debate (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). The fragmentation was exploited for the selective enrichment of
        fetal cf-DNA sequences (to up to 50% of total cf-DNA), thereby permitting the detection of
        otherwise masked fetal genetic loci such as short tandem repeats, single-nucleotide
        polymorphisms (SNPs) and paternally inherited point mutations, such as those involved in
        &#x3B2;-thalassaemia or achondroplasia (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>).
        These experiments, however, used conventional agarose gel electrophoresis for the
        physical-size-based separation of fetal and maternal cf-DNA species &#x2013; a
        cumbersome, labour-intensive, inefficient procedure that is prone to contamination. For the
        widespread applicability of this approach in the clinic, new approaches such as
        microfluidics will be required.</p>
      <p>Another key development during this period was verification of the long-standing suspicion
        that fetal cf-DNA was of placental origin, and was not the result of the demise of
        trafficking fetal cells. This was confirmed by a number of different approaches, such as
        analysis of (1) placental mosaicism, where key fetal loci such as the Y chromosome were
        missing both in the placenta and in fetal cf-DNA, but not in the male fetal karyotype (Ref.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>), (2) molar pregnancies, where cf-DNA specific
        for the molar karyotype (46 XY) could be detected (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>), and (3) epigenetic markers specific for placental tissues, such as the
        hypomethylated maspin (<italic>SERPINB5</italic>) or the hypermethylated
        <italic>RASSF1</italic> genetic loci (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>).</p>
      <p>The latter markers could prove to be useful as gender-independent tools to verify the
        presence of fetal cf-DNA in ambiguous diagnostic cases, such as when determining fetal
        gender or RhD status (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). It might also be
        possible to use these as tools to quantify fetal cf-DNA levels (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Reliable, accurate assessment of fetal cf-DNA levels, however,
        appears to require the use of high-copy sequences, such as DYS14 on the Y chromosome (Ref.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>).</p>

    <sec sec-type="" id="sec4">
      <title>Indirect methods for the noninvasive detection of fetal aneuploidy using cell-free
        nucleic acids</title>
      <sec id="sec4-1">
        <title>Allelic transcript ratios</title>
        <p>The first indication that cell-free fetal nucleic acids could be used for the noninvasive
          prenatal detection of DS, in 2007, came from an indirect approach in which chromosomal
          dosage was inferred from allelic gene transcript copy numbers (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). The study focused on the gene <italic>PLAC4</italic>
          (placenta-specific 4), located on chromosome 21, which was specifically transcribed in the
          placenta but not in any maternal tissues. In this manner, the analysis of this gene
          product would be similar to that of the Y chromosome, in that it would not be hindered by
          maternal background. To assess the dosage of each allelic transcript, heterozygous SNP
          loci were used. These could then be quantitatively assessed using mass spectrometry. In
          the analysis of samples from 10 DS cases and 56 healthy controls, DS cases could be
          detected with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96.5%.</p>
        <p>However, a serious caveat of this approach is that the SNP in <italic>PLAC4</italic>
          needs to be heterozygous in order to derive a conclusion concerning chromosomal dosage.
          Hence, a very large number of cases had to be excluded from the study, because they failed
          to meet this important criterion. Furthermore, the approach makes a fundamental assumption
          concerning the underlying biology for it to work effectively &#x2013; namely, that the
          interrogated alleles are transcribed at exactly the same rate. This might not be the case
          in many instances (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>), which would make subsequent analysis unreliable.</p>
        <p>Although this RNA-based approach was subsequently explored by Sequenom, Inc., USA, it
          appears not to have been successful. Unfortunately, details of this study have not been
          divulged; it would have been interesting to determine the cause for its apparent failure,
          which perhaps could have been rectified in subsequent studies.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec4-2">
        <title>Epigenetic allelic ratios</title>
        <p>A second indirect approach, which was explored around the same time, involved epigenetic
          differences of methylation to distinguish placental (fetal) genetic loci from maternal
          loci (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). The first report,
          on the maspin gene on chromosome 18 (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>),
          again used heterozygous SNP alleles to determine chromosomal dosage; in this study,
          however, no clear distinction could be discerned between cases with trisomy 18 and
          unaffected healthy controls, even when using &#x2018;pure&#x2019; fetal and maternal
          genetic material, such as fetal material obtained by amniocentesis. Subsequently, however,
          the epigenetic approach has been explored successfully for cases with trisomy 21 and
          trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome; ES) (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). In these recent studies much more encouraging
          results were obtained, in that all five DS cases and eight out of nine cases with ES were
          correctly identified by the analysis of epigenetic markers in plasma DNA. The efficacy of
          these assays might be improved by the inclusion of further candidate epigenetic biomarkers
          (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>).</p>
        <p>In a very recent report, it has been demonstrated that the enrichment of fetal cf-DNA
          fragments by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation can be used for the successful
          determination of chromosome 21 ploidy (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>).
          In this study, hypermethylated fetal cf-DNA fragments, identified in a previous study
          (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>), were enriched by immunoprecipitation
          and then examined by conventional real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
          The fetal-specific DNA methylation ratio for each sample was then calculated by comparing
          the sample CT (cycle threshold) value with the median CT value of a pool of normal control
          cases. In those cases where the fetus had a normal karyotype this ratio was determined to
          be of the order of 1, whereas in cases with trisomy 21 this ratio was larger than 1. To
          increase the accuracy of this system, eight methylated genetic regions on chromosome 21
          were examined in parallel. In a blinded analysis, 14 cases with trisomy 21 could be
          correctly distinguished from 26 normal cases. The advantage of this system is that it does
          not require any specialised equipment, and can readily be performed by the instruments
          currently present in most routine diagnostic laboratories.</p>

    <sec sec-type="" id="sec5">
      <title>Digital PCR: first hint at direct noninvasive aneuploidy detection</title>
      <p>Most of the studies examining fetal cf-DNA to date have used a form of real-time PCR and
        Y-chromosome-specific sequences (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). These studies indicated that the amount of fetal
        cf-DNA increases during gestation, and disappears rapidly from the maternal circulation
        following delivery. Increases were also observed in several pregnancy-related disorders or
        conditions such as preeclampsia, preterm delivery and trisomy 21, suggesting that this
        phenomenon could serve as the basis for a new generation of screening tests.</p>
      <p>During this period, studies had indicated that real-time PCR could be used for the rapid
        determination of chromosomal ploidy on pure fetal genetic material obtained by invasive
        means (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). Because real-time PCR is not well
        suited for the detection of less than twofold differences in template copy numbers, special
        conditions had to be introduced to detect the 1.5-fold difference in template concentration
        occurring in trisomy 21. It was, however, very clear that this approach would not be suited
        for the noninvasive determination of DS, because of the overwhelming presence of maternal
        cf-DNA fragments.</p>
      <p>Consequently, a different tack had to be taken, which was provided by &#x2018;digital
        PCR&#x2019; (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>) and the advent of
        microfluidic devices (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). Unlike real-time
        PCR, where an &#x2018;analogue&#x2019; signal of the entire PCR reaction containing
        the entire input template is obtained, in &#x2018;digital PCR&#x2019; the PCR reaction
        is split into thousands of minute individual reactions, with each individual reaction
        containing at most a single template copy. A quantitative assessment of the concentration of
        input template in the sample examined is then made by counting the number of individual
        positive PCR reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). <fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of fetal aneuploidy using digital PCR.</bold> In this procedure,
              fluorescent PCR specific for sequences on chromosomes 12 and 21 is carried out in
              individual microreaction chambers. The amount of input template is titrated in such a
              fashion that each microreaction vessel contains &gt;1 copy. After the plateau
              phase has been reached (approximately 40 cycles), the PCR reaction is terminated, and
              the number of positive reactions for each locus is counted. In euploid cases the ratio
              of blue (chromosome 12) to red (chromosome 21) signals should be 1, whereas in cases
              with Down syndrome the ratio of blue (chromosome 12) to red (chromosome 21) signals
              should be 1.5 (illustrated in more detail in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). This method has to date not been successfully used for the detection of

      <p>This procedure has been demonstrated to permit a much more accurate quantification than
        more conventional approaches such as real-time PCR, but, more importantly, it permits the
        detection of very small changes in input DNA. Thus, &#x2018;digital PCR&#x2019; could
        perhaps indicate whether a fetus was affected by DS, simply by counting the number of
        chromosome-21-specific target sequences in comparison to a similar locus on an unaffected
        chromosome (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>A strategy in which the amyloid gene locus on chromosome 21 and the <italic>GAPDH</italic>
        (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene locus on chromosome 12 were co-examined by
        digital PCR was shown to be able to detect DS when examining pure fetal genetic material
        obtained by invasive means (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The report indicated that the method might also
        be suitable for the analysis of cf-DNA, in that &#x2018;DS cases&#x2019; could be
        detected using artificial mixtures involving only 10% DS material, which is very similar to
        the concentration of fetal cf-DNA in maternal plasma. A crucial limitation of these
        observations, however, was that they would hold true only when 10&#xA0;000 or more
        individual PCR reactions were monitored.</p>

      <title>Next-generation sequencing and the possible advent of noninvasive DS detection</title>
      <p>Although reports from two research groups indicated that digital PCR might offer success
        for the noninvasive detection of DS by the analysis of cf-DNA (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>), these studies also made it clear that these analyses would be
        conducted at the limits of current digital PCR platforms, which at the time offered some
        12&#xA0;000 individual reaction events. Hence, if this strategy were to be pursued, then
        its successful transition would require an even greater level of &#x2018;individual event
        analysis&#x2019; to permit the necessary degree of discrimination between normal and DS
        cases.</p>
      <p>This was offered by the advent of &#x2018;next-generation sequencing (NGS)&#x2019;,
        also termed &#x2018;deep sequencing&#x2019;, whereby the entire genomic template is
        fragmented, sequenced in short reads and then reassembled through complex bioinformatic
        comparison with a genomic database (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). In
        this manner, subtle mutations having key roles in tumour initiation and progression could be
        ascertained (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>).</p>
      <p>Apart from offering unprecedented detail with regard to genomic alterations, the NGS
        approach also offered a unique opportunity to overcome the current limitation of digital
        PCR, by providing information concerning tens of thousands of sequence reads per chromosome;
        more than 60&#xA0;000 reads might be recorded for chromosome 21, and many millions over
        the entire genome.</p>
      <p>In the case of a DS fetus, there would be a small increase in the number of chromosome 21
        reads, whereas there should not be any comparable alteration across the other chomosomes. As
        such, in a manner akin to digital PCR, by simply counting the number of chromosome 21 reads,
        and then comparing these to a much larger number of sequence reads over the entire genome,
        it should be possible to determine the ploidy of chromosome 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). This indeed was the case, and it was clearly demonstrated that
        even minute quantitative alterations in the number of chromosome 21 reads could lead to an
        unparalleled discrimination between pregnancies bearing a fetus with trisomy 21 or those
        with a normal karyotype (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>). Furthermore, because this analysis was not
        restricted to chromosome 21, it was also possible to detect two cases with ES (trisomy 18)
        and one case with Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), thereby indicating the possible widespread
        applicability of this technology (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>). <fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of fetal aneuploidy using next-generation sequencing.</bold> In this
              procedure the cell-free DNA fragments in maternal plasma are isolated, and a library
              with special sequence tags is then made. These tags permit subsequent multiplex
              analysis. The library is examined by next-generation sequencing, which determines the
              sequence of each and every fragment. By bioinformatic analysis these sequences are
              ascribed to chromosomal locations. Following this, the number of sequence reads for
              each chromosome is counted. For chromosome 21 this is typically of the order of
              several thousand reads, which can then be compared with several million reads spread
              across the genome. If the fetus is affected by Down syndrome, then slightly more reads
              will be recorded for chromosome 21 compared with those from a euploid fetus. By
              comparing these data with a bank of reference samples, and by the use of predetermined
              cut-off values (<italic>Z</italic> score), the ploidy of the sample being examined can
              be determined (described in more detail in Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S1462399411001852_fig2"/></fig></p>
      <p>The downside of this approach is the prohibitively high cost per sample and the length of
        time taken for sample preparation, sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis, which
        occupies the better part of several days per sample (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>).</p>
      <sec id="sec6-1">
        <title>Is NGS ready for clinical application?</title>
        <p>Neverthless, two very recent publications have suggested that the NGS approach might be
          ready to make the transition from the research laboratory to clinical routine (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). In the first of these studies, 753 pregnant
          women at risk of having a fetus affected by DS, and who were therefore about to undergo an
          invasive prenatal diagnostic procedure, were recruited (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>); of these, full karyotyping determined that 86 had a fetus affected
          by DS. To reduce the complexity and cost of the NGS analysis, a multiplex approach was
          tested, whereby eight samples were examined in parallel (8-plex). This was compared with a
          more costly duplex analysis on 314 samples (two samples examined simultaneously). The
          8-plex analysis yielded a sensitivity of 79.1% and a specificity of 98.9%, whereas the
          duplex assay yielded 100% sensitivity and 97.9% specificity (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). To make the assay more efficient, a cohort of normal samples was
          used as a standard, permitting a threshold cut-off value (termed <italic>Z</italic>) to be
          determined: values above this were deemed to show DS cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Although it is unfortunate that the duplex analysis was determined to be superior to the
          less complex 8-plex analysis, it is not entirely surprising, in that for the 8-plex assay
          only approximately 300&#xA0;000 total reads were recorded per sample. This translates
          to a small fraction of the billions of reads required to access the entire genome, and
          furthermore implies that perhaps less than 10&#xA0;000 chromosome-21-specific reads
          were recorded. Because the NGS assay, like its digital PCR predecessor, relies simply on
          the counting of individual events, it would seem that here simply too few single events
          were being interrogated.</p>
        <p>In the second, independent study, 449 samples were examined by a more detailed and robust
          pair-end 4-plex NGS procedure in which approximately 5 million reads per sample were
          obtained (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). In this examination all 39
          cases with DS were correctly identified, although one normal case was incorrectly
          classified as DS, thereby yielding 100% sensitivity and 99.7% specificity. An important
          quality control in this study is that the concentration of fetal cf-DNA was monitored, and
          samples with less than 3.9% were excluded (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>).</p>
        <p>Even if the NGS assays are considered not to be 100% effective, and could not be used as
          a stand-alone diagnostic test for DS, it has been suggested that their use as a
          secondary-tier screen of high-risk cases could lead to a 98% reduction in the number of
          invasive procedures (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). As such, this avenue
          certainly does appear to be an attractive route to pursue (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Accordingly, large-scale clinical studies are being launched in
          Europe and elsewhere.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec6-2">
        <title>Can NGS be simplified?</title>
        <p>The above results have indicated that the use of complex cutting-edge genomic tools such
          as NGS can finally offer the long-sought dream of noninvasive detection of fetal
          aneuploidy (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>). However, this comes at a very high cost and unacceptably long
          analysis. A possible strategy to overcome these disadvantages is the targeting of only
          those chromosomes or regions of interest such as those on chromosome 21 for the detection
          of DS cases. Although several different strategies exist that permit some form of target
          enrichment prior to the subsequent sequencing step, they have to date been limited to
          examination of intact genomic DNA samples, and not fragmented DNA species such as those
          found in cf-DNA (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>). Furthermore, these
          procedures, such as on-array capture, require rather large concentrations of input
          template DNA (up to 7.5&#xA0;&#xB5;g per sample). Hence, an approach that
          permitted targeted sequencing of the small quantities of fragmented DNA in maternal plasma
          had to be sought.</p>
        <p>Very recently, a solution hybrid selection method using ultralong oligonucleotides,
          commercially marketed by Agilent, USA, has been used for targeted enrichment (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).
          A capture library specific for the X chromosome was hybridised with 500&#xA0;ng of an
          amplified plasma DNA library, and the selected capture targets were pulled down using a
          combination of biotinylated oligonucleotide probes and streptavidin-coated magnetic beads.
          The enriched target DNA was then subjected to a further 12 rounds of PCR with specially
          tagged primers necessary for the subsequent sequence analysis. In the examination of 12
          maternal plasma samples, this targeted capture procedure led to a mean enrichment of
          213-fold. This enrichment was also reflected in the increased ability to detect
          fetal-specific loci on the X chromosome, which changed from 3.5% in the un-enriched
          samples to 95.9% in the samples subjected to a targeted enrichment step. <fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of a targeted sequencing approach using the
                    SureSelect<sup>TM</sup> Target Enrichment System.</bold> In this procedure the
                cell-free DNA fragments are isolated and a library is generated as per the standard
                next-generation sequencing protocol. Prior to sequencing, however, this library is
                hybridised to the SureSelect<sup>TM</sup> Oligo Capture Library, which is
                manufactured in such a manner that it will recognise a specific chromosome, such as
                chromosome 21. These oligo sequences contain magnetic particles to permit their
                retrieval in a magnetic field. Hence, following hybridisation (65&#xB0;C,
                24&#xA0;h), captured sequences are selected by magnetic selection, and
                unselected sequences are washed away. The bound fragments are then purified and
                prepared for sequencing and examined as described for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>. This procedure was recently shown to permit a
                213-fold enrichment of the targeted X chromosome (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S1462399411001852_fig3"/></fig></p>
        <p>A concern with any enrichment approach is that it might lead to bias, by preferential
          enhancement of select sequences, including the preferential accumulation of maternal
          cf-DNA sequences over fetal ones. However, in this study the proportion of fetal to
          maternal sequences was similar in un-enriched loci (~16&#x2013;30% from first to third
          trimester) and in enriched X-chromosome regions (~15&#x2013;32%) (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>). These results are encouraging, because they
          could facilitate targeted enrichment of more crucial fetal loci, such as those on
          chromosome 21, thereby paving the way for a less complex noninvasive test for DS.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec6-3">
        <title>How much information is available from NGS?</title>
        <p>The first series of experiments with NGS focused on select chromosomes and compared the
          number of reads obtained for these to those obtained for the entire genomic complement.
          Because close to 65&#xA0;000 individual loci are counted on chromosome 21 alone, it
          was open to debate whether this approach would be sufficiently sensitive to detect more
          subtle chromosomal aberrations such as the Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes
          21 and 15 (or 14), which has a role in 2&#x2013;3% of cases with DS (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). As the Down Syndrome Critical Region associated
          with this translocation is a lot smaller than the entire chromosome 21 commonly involved
          in DS, it was unclear whether the NGS approach would be able to detect this alteration
          (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>).</p>
        <p>However, this view has been altered by a new landmark publication, in which the entire
          cf-DNA present in a maternal plasma sample was sequenced (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). The data indicated that the entire fetal genome complement is
          present in cf-DNA in maternal plasma, and that this can be mined to show minute details
          such as mutations involved in &#x3B2;-thalassaemia; surprisingly, the study correctly
          discerned that the fetus had inherited the paternal codon 41/42 mutation, involving a CTTT
          deletion, but not the maternal &#x2212;28A&#x2192;G mutation. Although this analysis
          was very complex, involving almost 4 billion reads and 900&#xA0;000 SNPs, it is a
          striking indicator of what might lie ahead &#x2013; namely, the ability to obtain a
          full fetal karyotype down to miniscule single-nucleotide detail from a single maternal
          blood sample (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>).</p>

      <title>The question of intellectual property and how to optimise procedures</title>
      <p>An important concern that needs to be addressed is how intellectual property and
        commercialisation will affect future research and applications (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>). For the best possible service to reach the patient, clarity is
        essential; otherwise, conflicting reports and views might prevent superior products from
        being developed. In the case of fetal cf-DNA, such an issue was raised by the
        commercialisation of a noninvasive test for fetal RhD determination in the EU, and
        subsequently in the USA (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>). Although it was
        clear to leading researchers in the field that the tests initially marketed might be flawed
        or were not state of the art, it was felt that it would be a weary process to convince the
        commercial parties involved to change their standard of practice and to adopt more modern
        effective approaches. This issue was further highlighted by the near-simultaneous reports
        concerning the application of digital PCR or NGS, leading to conflicting reports in the lay
        media as to who the main patent claimants were (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>). It is currently also unclear what
        business model or strategies should be used in translating this research from the bench to
        the clinic. Hence, it might be worthwhile to echo previous concerns that such uncertainty
        might hinder or restrict further research in the field (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>).</p>

      <title>Are fetal cells in maternal blood still worth pursuing?</title>
      <p>Despite the enormous strides that have been made with the determination of fetal
        aneuploidies through the use of cf-DNA, the latest reports have indicated that these will be
        very labour intensive, and require extremely high-tech devices and bioinformatic services.
        Hence it is unclear how quickly these developments will be translatable into the clinic.</p>
      <p>For this reason there has been a resurgent interest in the isolation of fetal cells from
        maternal blood. This have been fostered by the development of (1) sophisticated
        high-throughput automated scanning devices, which permit the rapid identification of
        putative target fetal cells among a large pool of maternal cells (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>), and (2) efficient
        microfluidic systems and electronic micromanipulation systems, which permit the effective
        retrieval of individual trafficking fetal cells (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>).</p>
      <p>Even though this process will most likely also be laborious, it has several advantages over
        cf-DNA analysis, in that fetal cells offer a pure source of fetal genomic material.
        Furthermore, widely standardised procedures commonly used in many diagnostic laboratories,
        such as FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridisation), can be applied for the very rapid
        detection of chromosomal anomalies (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>). In
        addition, use can now be made of a wide body of experience in the analysis of single cells,
        a routine practice in many in vitro fertilisation clinics offering preimplantation genetic
        diagnosis (PGD) (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>).</p>
      <p>A possible further advantage is that the intellectual property situation in this area is
        not as complex as that of cf-DNA, in that many of the original patents are close to expiry,
        and no commercial entity holds a wide portfolio of key elements. As such, it will be of
        interest to monitor progress in this sphere of research, because it might yet have a few

      <title>The challenge of proteomics</title>
      <p>The development of the first-trimester DS screening test using a combination of ultrasound
        measurement of nuchal translucency, serum analyte analysis and maternal age has led to a
        dramatic increase in the ability to detect pregnancies at-risk of bearing an aneuploid fetus
        (85% sensitivity) when compared with the previous generation of second-trimester screening
        tests (65% sensitivity), which relied solely on serum analyte analysis in combination with
        maternal age (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref>). This facet is reflected in
        the report on the English and Welsh National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register analysis,
        which indicated that the vast majority of DS cases were detected by current screening
        practice (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>).</p>
      <p>The downside of this startling development is that the first-trimester screen is still
        hampered by a rather high false-positive rate of 5&#x2013;8% (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref>). This implies that a
        large number of healthy pregnancies are being subjected to unnecessary invasive procedures
        &#x2013; a healthcare risk for mother and unborn child, as well as a considerable
        financial burden for healthcare services. Furthermore, almost 15% of cases remain undetected
        and, because these occur in the group of pregnant women not judged to be at a higher risk
        (&lt;35 years old), could result in undesired live births.</p>
      <p>Therefore, increasing the efficiency of this test has been proposed, perhaps by the
        addition of further biochemical analytes, such as members of the activin family (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref>). The
        inclusion of further highly specific blood-based analytes might be possible as a result of
        the development of quantitative proteomic technologies as part of the Human Proteome
        Association, especially the affiliated plasma proteome project (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref>). The placenta in DS cases exhibits structural alterations, which
        are most likely the result of alterations in protein expression, and so it is possible that
        these changes will be reflected in the maternal plasma proteome (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>). In this regard, the use of quantitative isobaric labelling has
        been shown to permit the detection of significant alterations in the levels of several
        placenta-derived peptides in DS cases when compared with controls (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref>). Analogous observations have been made by other
        research groups using a variety of different proteomic approaches (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">78</xref>). It
        now remains to explore how useful these potential biomarkers will be in increasing the
        detection rate of the current first-trimester screen.</p>

      <title>Summary and conclusion</title>
      <p>Tremendous strides have been made with the analysis of fetal cf-DNA in maternal blood, in
        that we now stand on the threshold of a new generation of noninvasive diagnostic tools,
        which might even permit a detailed analysis of the entire fetal genome or a full karyotype.
        However, it remains to be seen how rapidly these can be translated into the clinic, in a
        manner that is cost effective and accessible to all. In this context it will be interesting
        to see which system, namely NGS, digital PCR or enrichment of methylated fetal cf-DNA
        fragments, passes the final hurdle to enter clinical service. Although the isolation and
        analysis of trafficking fetal cells might remain a peripheral test, it could be useful in
        those centres already offering FISH or PGD services. Should multiparameter mass spectroscopy
        and quantitative proteomics finally come of age, it might yield a set of biomarkers with
        unparalleled specificity, not only for DS screening but also for other pregnancy-related
        disorders such as preeclampsia.</p>
