          <title>Objective</title>
          <p>In light of the emerging obesity pandemic, front-of-pack calories labels may
                        be an important tool to assist consumers in making informed healthier food
                        choices. However, there is little prior research to guide key decisions on
                        whether caloric content should be expressed in absolute terms or relative to
                        recommended daily intake, whether it should be expressed in per serving or
                        per 100 g and whether the information should be further brought alive for
                        consumers in terms of what the extra calorie intake implies in relation to
                        activity levels. The present study aimed at providing more insight into
                        consumers&#x2019; appreciation of front-of-pack labelling of caloric
                        content of food products and their specific preferences for alternative

          <p>The results show that calories are well-understood and that participants were

                        uniform across products. The most liked flags are the simpler flags
                        depicting only the number of calories per serving or per 100 g, while more
                        complex flags including references to daily needs or exercise and the flag
                        including a phrase referring to balanced lifestyle were least preferred.
                        Some relevant differences between countries were observed. Although
                        participants seem to be familiar with the notion of calories, they do not

    <p>The revealing of information on the nutritional properties of foods can be an important
            means of reducing the information asymmetry between consumers and suppliers of food
                products<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1"><sup>1</sup></xref>. After all, nutrients cannot be seen, tasted or directly experienced by the
            consumer. They are the so-called credence qualities of the food product<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2"><sup>2</sup></xref> for which consumers rely on information to be able to make an assessment and
            comparison. As a result, nutrition labelling information about the nutrient content and
            sometimes even the nutritional desirability of foods has received considerable attention
            in recent years. The US Nutritional Labelling and Education Act (NLEA), which went into
            effect in 1994 and requires most food products to carry a nutrition facts panel, has
            been one of the landmarks in nutrition labelling policy. Also in Australia and New
            Zealand, nutrition labelling is mandatory. In the European Union (EU), nutrition
            labelling is currently not compulsory unless a nutrition claim is made<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3"><sup>3</sup></xref>. However, there are countries, like the UK, where most pre-packed products carry
            nutrition information on labels.</p>
    <p>Nutrition labelling, if applied correctly and if adequately used, understood and trusted
            by the consumer, can assist consumers in taking into account the nutritional content of
            the food product in their purchase decisions and consequently in making informed choices
            for healthy options and hence for a more healthy diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>&#x2013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6"><sup>6</sup></xref>. Also, it contributes to consumer protection, as transparency offers consumers
            their right to know the nutrient content of a food very much like the food&#x2019;s
            country of origin or its sell-by date<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7"><sup>7</sup></xref>. However, it is important to note that although nutrition labelling communicates
            important information to the consumer, there are no scientific data that convincingly
            show that nutrition labelling improves dietary patterns. Such evidence is largely
            confined to self-reported measures often collected under controlled situations, which
            casts doubt on their generalisation to real-life food choice conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25"><sup>25</sup></xref>. An extra difficulty would be the fact that consumers also eat foods that are
            not labelled, for example, while eating outside home.</p>
    <p>A recent review on consumer understanding of nutrition labelling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7"><sup>7</sup></xref> has identified lack of time, concerns about accuracy of the information as well
            as difficulty in understanding the information as among the prominent reasons why
            consumers fail to use the nutritional information in their actual food choice behaviour.
            Many consumers report that they find the information confusing and have difficulty in
            translating the information into actual food choices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8"><sup>8</sup></xref>.</p>
    <p>Partly as a result of consumers&#x2019; inability or lack of motivation to consider
            the nutritional information as contained in nutrition labels on the back of packs,
            several parties have suggested to bring the essential information to the front of the
            packs in order to generate higher awareness and consideration from the consumer. These
            so-called &#x2018;food information programmes&#x2019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9"><sup>9</sup></xref> aim at simple logos that highlight foods with nutritional characteristics that
            aid in promoting health or reducing disease risk. Several of such schemes have been
            proposed, such as Pick the Tick (since 1989 in Australia and New Zealand), Green Keyhole
            (since 1989 in Sweden), Heart Check (since 1995 in the USA) and Health Check (since 1998
            in Canada). These schemes have in common that they categorise food products into
            nutritional quality on the basis of nutrient criteria. Also, in Europe, there has been
            increasing interest in nutritional signposting largely initiated by the UK Department of
            Health and studies conducted through the Food Standards Agency (FSA). In a series of
            qualitative and quantitative studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11"><sup>11</sup></xref>, FSA finds that consumers would prefer multiple traffic lights and colour-coded
            guideline daily amounts (GDA) formats over single traffic lights, which would only
            indicate the overall healthiness of the product rather than its content on specific
            nutrients. The debate is still ongoing as to the appropriateness of colour coding (red,
            amber, green) of individual foods, the expected impact of signposting initiatives, and
            the preferred format for such information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13"><sup>13</sup></xref>. Many consumers limit their information search to the front label<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15"><sup>15</sup></xref>. When examining health claims, Wansink<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16"><sup>16</sup></xref> found that combining short health claims on the front of a package with full
            information on the back of the package leads consumers to better understand and have
            higher trust in the information. This finding implies that using two sides of a package
            increases the credibility of information and hence it will contribute to
            consumers&#x2019; ability to make better choices.</p>
    <p>Previous research has focused strongly on the provision of information about the content
            of specific nutrients. The &#x2018;food information programmes&#x2019;, including
            FSA&#x2019;s signposting scheme, have excluded the amount of calories as an explicit
            piece of information to the consumer. This is because from the caloric content of an
            individual food, it is much more difficult to categorise or qualify (i.e. colour code)
            the food as healthy or unhealthy. However, if the caloric content is used relative to
            recommended daily energy intake, such information can be meaningfully provided and this
            might explain why calories are part of the GDA scheme as put forward by several food
            manufacturers and retailers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12"><sup>12</sup></xref>.</p>
    <p>From a public health perspective, transparent and consumer friendly calorie labelling is
            a high priority. Over 300 million adults worldwide are obese, according to the latest
            statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Obesity Task
            Force (IOTF). About one-quarter of the US adult population is said to be obese, with
            rates in Western Europe on the rise although not yet at similar levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17"><sup>17</sup></xref>. Although many factors including genetic, environmental and behavioural factors
            contribute to obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18"><sup>18</sup></xref>, dietary factors and physical activity patterns are the major modifiable
            factors. In the end, obesity is caused by a positive energy balance, i.e. when calories
            consumed exceed calories expended. Consumers could be aided to maintain a neutral, or
            even negative, energy balance by providing them with easy to understand and easy to
            process information on the caloric content of the food products they consume. Several
            consumer studies on the most frequently looked-at information on food labels in Europe
            also reveal that calories are always among those on top of the list<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19"><sup>19</sup></xref>. Calories are the most widely used nutritional indicator and the best
            established notion with European consumers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20"><sup>20</sup></xref>. Still, only very few consumers would really know how to apply the energy
                notion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22"><sup>22</sup></xref> or estimate their recommended daily caloric intake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23"><sup>23</sup></xref>.</p>
    <p>In summary, in addition to nutrient quality, the amount of calories present in individual
            foods is a crucial piece of information for the consumers in order to help them make
            informed choices in their diet. A key challenge for nutrition labelling is to find
            accurate, yet simple, representations of the caloric information in a format that is
            appealing, easy to process and easy to understand for consumers. Unfortunately, there is
            little guidance from prior research into how such caloric labelling should look like. As
            with other nutrients there is still a lot of discussion as to whether caloric content
            should be expressed in absolute terms or relative to recommended daily intake, whether
            it should be expressed in per serving (per portion)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> or per 100 g and whether the information should be further brought alive for
            consumers in terms of what the extra calorie intake implies in relation to activity
            levels. The present study aimed at providing more insight into consumers&#x2019;
            appreciation of and engagement towards front-of-pack labelling of caloric content of
            food products and their specific preferences for alternative execution formats for such
            information. For this purpose, eight executions of front-of-pack calorie flags were
            designed and extensively discussed with consumers in four different European countries
            in terms of their appeal and information value. To enhance market realism, the
            front-of-pack labels were subsequently also presented to the consumer in the context of
            a standard back-of-pack nutrition information panel.</p>

        <title>Stimuli</title>
        <p>A set of eight front-of-pack flags, all focusing on energy, was specifically
                    designed for this study. These front-of-pack flags (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) differ to the extent that they
                    express the amount of calories in per serving or per 100 g, whether they relate
                    to daily energy needs, and whether they relate to the amount of physical
                    activity necessary to spend the calories ingested. In addition to the
                    front-of-pack labels, back-of-pack nutrition labels were also included in the
                    study. These back-of-pack labels were the current &#x2018;standard&#x2019;
                    nutrition labels, but with a added-on front-of-pack calorie flag and a reference
                    to a help website. The actual content of the nutrition labels was left
                        untouched.<table-wrap id="tab1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Participants&#x2019; evaluations of front-of-pack flags</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S1368980007000304_tab1"/><table-wrap-foot><p>* 2000 kcal is used as general reference for women and 2500 kcal for

                    the national market place to enhance the task realism. Each flag concept was
                    shown to the respondent having been integrated onto three different food
                    packages, one of which was always Philadelphia Light. The other two food
                    products were selected to represent a mix of well-known brands in various
                    product categories (e.g. breakfast cereals, drinks, snacks, meal components).
                    Care was taken that the food products comprised a mix of low- and high-calorie
                    products (e.g. Coke light and olive oil).</p>

        <title>Procedure</title>
        <p>A total of 12 focus groups were conducted, three in each of the following
                    countries: France, Germany, the UK and The Netherlands. Each focus group
                    consisted of 8&#x2013;10 consumers and lasted approximately 2.5&#x2013;3
                    h. All focus groups were conducted in specialised research locations and
                    facilitated by a moderator from a commercial market research agency, specialised
                    in focus groups research. Data were collected in Paris, Chaem (Greater London),
                    Hamburg and Amsterdam.</p>

        <title>Respondents</title>
        <p>The respondents were recruited according to a set of sociodemographic criteria as
                    well as their self-reported usage of nutrition labelling. In each country,
                    separate focus groups were set up for young adults (18&#x2013;24 years old),
                    families (25&#x2013;55 years old with children in the age group
                    4&#x2013;18 years old) and empty nesters (over 55 years old). Each of the
                    groups was composed in such a way that 50% were self-reported regular users of
                    nutrition labels and 50% were occasional, 50% were female, 50% were
                    professionally active and all were sampled from social classes B, C1, C2 and D.
                    In the family groups, 50% had children younger than 12 years and 50% had
                    children older than 12 years.</p>

        <title>Protocol</title>
        <p>All focus groups were conducted following the same protocol (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app1">Appendix</xref> for the detailed interview guide).
                    The focus group discussions were organised around four key themes. After a short
                    introduction, the respondents discussed their opinions on healthy eating (15
                    min) as a warm up, before they discussed the role of nutritional information in
                    general and front-of-pack information more specifically (35 min). After this
                    initial discussion, respondents were shown the concepts (front-of-pack flags)
                    one by one and asked to individually write down their personal first reactions.
                    They provided an overall liking score (on 1&#x2013;10 scale) and wrote down
                    their likes and dislikes about each execution. After collecting these initial
                    individual quantitative responses, the respondents shared and discussed their
                    responses in the group for each of the flags consecutively. They were probed
                    further to express and share thoughts on understanding, communication value and
                    credibility of the different flags. Subsequently, each front-of-pack flag was
                    discussed to get a deeper insight of specific elements such as understanding of
                    the calories concept, and preference for labelling in per portion vs. per 100 g.
                    Once all executions were discussed (order differed across focus groups), the
                    respondents individually voted the three best front-of-pack concepts by writing
                    short comments for each of their three top flags. These ratings were then shared
                    and discussed in the group and a group judgement was developed on the preferred
                    flag concept. After the front-of-pack flag evaluations, participants were asked
                    to comment on the labels in the context of a back-of-pack nutrition information
                    panel. The current &#x2018;standard&#x2019; nutrition tables were shown as
                    appearing on existing products, but with addition of the front-of-pack calorie
                    flag and a reference to a help website. The actual content of the nutrition
                    tables was left untouched (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> for
                    an example). At the closing down of the session, the respondents were asked to
                    share their final messages. They were then thanked for their participation.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Back-of-pack nutrition label including a repetition of the

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The results will be organised around the four key themes of the interview protocol.</p>
      <sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="general">
        <title>The role of nutritional information and labels</title>
        <p>In terms of health and nutrition information, participants stated that they rely
                    on a combination of sources among which the media (newspapers, television and
                    women&#x2019;s magazines) is highly influential. Many participants claimed to
                    use nutrition labels and that they use product labels when purchasing new
                    products but not very often for regularly bought products. While many
                    participants stated that food labels are very useful, some indicated that they
                    sometimes feel confused in interpreting the food labels and have difficulties in
                    trying to understand this information. This is particularly caused by the
                    terminology used on food labels, which is perceived to be too technical and
                    advanced.</p>
        <p>Participants across all focus groups understood what calories are
                        (&#x2018;<italic>it is fuel for the body</italic>&#x2019;). Calories
                    are seen as relevant information to be highlighted on the front-of-food
                    packages, as they are seen as summing up the nutritional value of a product and
                    useful for weight loss. It is the measure that most participants felt able to
                    work with, although sometimes with a little help in the form of additional
                    information or reference tables. However, very few individuals could quite
                    accurately state daily needs and their own consumption, while most of the others
                    had absolutely no idea.</p>
        <p>Participants were generally positive about front-of-pack calories flags and
                    recognise a variety of benefits. Calorie flags are seen as innovative because
                    the flag is on the front of the package, in contrast to nutrition information
                    which is typically &#x2018;hidden&#x2019; on the back, side or the bottom
                    of a package. In addition, it was mentioned that these flags would encourage
                    them to eat healthier and are seen as a good step in the right direction.
                    Putting the number of calories at the front label allows for more easy
                    comparisons in the store when selecting food products with the lowest amount of
                    calories. In this way, flags can save valuable consumer time:<disp-quote><p>I would more than likely do a first selection on the basis of what is on
                            the front.</p><p>(UK participant)</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>It is a lot better than what we have now. It is all there, and easy to
                            understand.</p><p>(Dutch participant)</p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>In relation to this, it was argued by most participants that flags should be
                    recognisable and consistently used across products.</p>
        <p>However, participants also mentioned some concerns. Calorie flags are seen by
                    some as particularly appropriate for people following a calorie-controlled diet.
                    Some participants believed that these labels are only put on
                    &#x2018;healthy&#x2019; products and that mostly women would use them. In
                    addition, a few wondered why only calories were flagged (what about other
                    ingredients like fat and salt?). This was particularly true for some people in
                    the 55+ group.</p>
        <p>Participants generally trust the information on a label, although some
                    participants saw the calorie flags as a promotion tool offered by the
                    manufacturer, similar to front-of-pack claims such as yoghurt with a
                    &#x2018;0.1%-fat&#x2019; label. Several participants described how
                    important it is that the authorities are behind the flags and that the flags are
                    supported by a larger information campaign with a website, billboards and
                    commercials. This will make the system more trustworthy. The campaign should
                    focus on various groups in society, and not only on young people. Participants
                    found it important that the flags are put on the labels to make consumers aware
                    of healthy nutrition and not forced upon them: <disp-quote><p>The intention should not be to scare us; you should still be able to have
                            your glass of beer and cake every week, because that is part of life.</p><p>(Dutch participant)</p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>Overall, the respondents seem to be receptive to front-of-pack calorie-related
                    information as an improvement relative to the current situation. However, a
                    minority of those who are at specific risk seem to prefer also more specific
                    front-of-pack information on salt and fat.</p>

        <p>Consumers&#x2019; individual ratings on the eight front-of-pack calorie flag
                    executions were subjected to ANOVA with Student&#x2013;Newman&#x2013;Keuls
                    multiple comparison test to explore differences between concepts and countries
                    and their interaction. There exist reliable differences in consumer preference
                    between the different front-of-pack executions (<italic>F</italic> (1, 7) =
                    9.01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), in overall evaluations between

                    the order of preferred executions differs between countries (<italic>F</italic>
                    (1, 21) = 7.51; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Overall, the most liked
                    concepts are the simpler flags (flags 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">*</xref>), while a
                    more complex flag (flag 7) and the flag including a phrase referring to balanced
                    lifestyle (flag 8) were least preferred (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Analysis of the marginal means<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">*</xref> across countries show that German participants on average rate all
                    executions lowest (marginal mean = 4.0), followed by the UK (marginal mean =
                    5.4) and French participants (marginal mean = 5.5). Overall, the Dutch
                    participants on average gave higher marks (marginal mean = 6.2). The marginal
                    means of the statistically significant two-way interaction between execution and
                    country are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, which show
                    that it is particularly the German consumers&#x2019; evaluation that deviates
                    from the other countries. German consumers are much more outspoken in that they
                    are slightly more positive about the simpler flags 1 and 2, but substantially
                    more negative about all the other executions than consumers from other

        <title>Detailed comments about the specific executions</title>
        <p>From the discussions with respondents on the more detailed opinions about the
                    various executions, a number of key themes relating to front-of-pack flag
                    evaluations emerged. These included: (1) the amount of information provided in a
                    flag, (2) the assessment of the amount of calories consumed relative to portion
                    size, (3) reference to exercise and (4) the assessment of the relative
                    contribution to the total amount of calories consumed in a day. Results below
                    are categorised according to these four themes and differences between countries
                    are highlighted where appropriate.</p>
        <sec id="sec2-3-1" sec-type="general">
          <title>Completeness and informative vs. catchy and easy to understand</title>
          <p>The experimentally designed flags differ in the amount of information they
                        provide. More simple flags (in particular flag concepts 1 and 2) were
                        generally liked by the majority of participants. In particular, German
                        participants considered these flags to be very helpful. These flags are
                        considered more easily processed in that they are understandable at first
                        glance. They do not require too much thinking and time to read. This is in
                        contrast to more complete energy flags (such as flag concepts 5, 6 and 7),
                        which are perceived as most informative. However, it was clear to the
                        respondents that combining these various types of information is a complex
                        task, even for motivated consumers. Many participants questioned the need to
                        put all information in one flag. When the concept did not allow for quick
                        inspection, participants felt a bit overwhelmed by the number of details and
                        described these flags as too technical and complex. A visual overload may
                        lead to not using the flag in purchase decision making, as indicated by a
                        participant evaluating the flag which included all information (flag 6):<disp-quote><p>Completely crazy, too much blah-blah.</p><p>(French participant)</p></disp-quote></p>
          <p>Often mentioned in the discussion was the need for a flag to be catchy and
                        stand out from other information on the package. Being
                        &#x2018;catchy&#x2019; and the ease of their understanding was related
                        by the respondents to design characteristics of the flags, such as
                        legibility and clever use of colour. An older German participant recommended
                        the use of sufficiently large letter sizes so that the flags can be read
                        without reading glasses. Sentences such as &#x2018;balance your
                        energy&#x2019; are typically seen as meaningless because respondents fail
                        to understand what is meant by it. Adding such a sentence was viewed with
                        scepticism by many participants, suspecting that it was simply a marketing
                        tool. This finding is reflected in the low marks that concept 8 received
                        across countries.</p>

          <title>Calories per portion size vs. calories per 100 g</title>
          <p>As discussed before, participants liked the simple front-of-pack flags only
                        showing calories (concepts 1 and 2) for their clarity and focus on the
                        essentials. Discussion of these two simple flags showed that calories per
                        portion was clearly seen as an instrument to assess the nutritional content
                        of what one was actually buying or consuming, while calories per 100 g was
                        mostly cited as an instrument for comparison between different choices:
                            &#x2018;<italic>This allows us to compare</italic>&#x2019; (Dutch
                        participant).</p>
          <p>In general, participants found it difficult to understand what a large amount
                        of calories is (&#x2018;<italic>how much is too
                        much</italic>&#x2019;). Participants were aware of the fact that an
                        amount of 100 g often does not match the amount typically consumed in one
                        eating occasion. Participants discussed extensively various issues related
                        to the question &#x2018;<italic>what is a serving (portion)
                        size?</italic>&#x2019; The majority of participants were aware that a
                        serving size is not necessarily a whole package and also not the amount of
                        food that will be eaten. They did, however, wonder how many servings are in
                        a package and how to compare this to the amount actually eaten. It was seen
                        as problematic to some participants that they had to do some calculations to
                        figure out how many calories they will get. If you eat an entire package,
                        you have to multiply the amount of calories by the number of servings in a
                        package size. Some participants wondered whether other meal components are
                        also included (such as the ketchup with French fries).</p>

          <title>Referring to exercise</title>
          <p>Physical activity symbols show how much consumers have to exercise in order
                        to burn off the calories in a serving size. Several participants mentioned
                        that referring to exercise made them realise that overweight is also the
                        consequence of lack of exercise. However, respondents see the reference to
                        exercise as confronting because it makes them realise how much work it takes
                        to burn off a small amount of calories by walking. This derives from the
                        inherent imprecision of the concept (as it does not take into account the
                        basal metabolic rate energy expenditure). Another downside might be that the
                        awareness effect will wear off after some time. While some participants
                        noted that these symbols could make people more aware of exercise, most
                        participants were sceptical of the effectiveness of this flag:<disp-quote><p>I do not think that people would walk if they ate a packet of crisps.</p><p>(UK participant)</p></disp-quote></p>
          <p>A key theme in the discussion of this type of flag was that it can be
                        demotivating and patronising. Some participants said that it evoked a
                        feeling of guilt, as the urge to burn off the calories through exercise
                        would not stop them from eating a particular high-calorie food. According to
                        a few participants, flags should focus on the pleasure of choosing and
                        eating foods. In particular, on indulgence foods such as chocolate, these
                        flags were not liked. In France, some participants felt that the picture of
                        the walking man was funny and therefore not to be taken too seriously.</p>

          <title>Referring to daily needs</title>
          <p>Concepts 5, 6 and 7 include the percentage of daily energy values. These
                        percentages tell the consumer whether the calories in a serving of a food
                        contribute a lot or a little to the total daily calorie intake. Reference to
                        daily needs was liked by a considerable number of participants, mostly so in
                        the UK and by younger participants. It was considered a quick reference.
                        Most participants did not know their average daily needs and saw this as
                        helpful. It puts the calories in perspective:<disp-quote><p>Basically, they&#x2019;ve told you 47 calories out of 2500 is
                                nothing, so you think that&#x2019;s obviously alright for you. It
                                is still per serving, still a bit tricky, but you can work out
                                I&#x2019;m not going to kill myself eating that because I can
                                have 2500.</p><p>(UK participant)</p></disp-quote></p>
          <p>In those flags where the calories contained in a serving of a product were
                        represented as a percentage of daily needs, a few participants were unsure
                        whether the percentage indicated &#x2018;a little&#x2019; or
                        &#x2018;a lot&#x2019;. Some participants were very negative, as
                        knowing that they have had, for example, 13% of their daily intake would not
                        help them making choices regarding the 87% left.</p>
          <p>When the calories contained in a serving of a product were represented
                        graphically as percentage of daily needs through a bar chart (concepts 5 and
                        6), certain participants were quite puzzled. Although younger participants
                        liked this flag for its compact communication of all key energy information,
                        to some older participants the flag resembled medical symbols used on
                        medicines, which was seen as too complex. One participant argued that
                            &#x2018;<italic>supermarkets should not be
                        pharmacies</italic>&#x2019;. Similar to the exercise symbols,
                        participants expressed their concerns that this flag seems to take away the
                        pleasure of eating. One French participant said: &#x2018;<italic>Eating
                            is not just for surviving, eating is for pleasure</italic>&#x2019;.</p>
          <p>Flag 7 also shows the percentage daily needs delivered by the product, but
                        without a bar chart. Overall, this option was not preferred by participants
                        as it requires too much interpretation effort by turning food shopping into
                        a mathematics test:<disp-quote><p>It&#x2019;s a pain really &#x2026; this is 8% of what I should
                                be having?</p><p>(UK participant)</p></disp-quote></p>
          <p>The pictograms used to express the daily needs for men and women were seen as
                        very helpful and understandable, though probably a bit redundant on a front
                        panel after a while. However, there was much debate about the percentage
                        daily needs referring to some kind of &#x2018;average&#x2019;
                        person&#x2019;s daily needs. A few participants commented that this might
                        not match their own needs, particularly when they have a day with a lot of
                        physical activity. Moreover, some participants could not relate themselves
                        to an &#x2018;average&#x2019; person:<disp-quote><p>What is average? Am I average?</p><p>(German participant)</p></disp-quote></p>

        <title>Evaluation in the context of back-of-pack nutrition information panel</title>
        <p>When evaluating front-of-pack flags in relation to the standard back-of-pack
                    nutrition labels, participants did not change their opinion regarding the
                    calorie flags, although the reappearance of the front-of-pack calorie flag on
                    the nutrition label was seen as a helpful addition by the majority of
                    participants. The advantage of calorie flags on the front of a package is that
                    they allow for a quick comparison between products, while back-of-pack nutrition
                    labels were considered to be particularly appropriate for more interested
                    consumers. In this respect, reference to a website was considered to be useful,
                    as one German participant stated: &#x2018;<italic>There is no abundant
                        information, as more information can be obtained through the
                    website</italic>&#x2019;. In contrast to front-of-pack flags, various
                    participants argued that they do not find it realistic to read the back of a
                    pack all the time: &#x2018;<italic>I doubt if we would all go round the
                        supermarket reading the back of everything</italic>&#x2019;. Participants
                    expected to find more detailed information about the nutritional value at the
                    back of a pack: <disp-quote><p>You would have on the front what most people look at when they get it out

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The main objective of this study was to get insights into the potential of a variety
                of energy-based front-of-pack flags as motivational tools for consumers towards
                nutrition information on food labels and nutrition in general.</p>
      <p>Our results suggest that highlighting energy on the front of the pack might be a
                promising platform of communication to the consumer. Consumers see front-of-pack
                flags as an improvement over current on-pack nutritional information, also when they
                see them in combination with the back-of-pack nutrition information panel. Our
                findings confirm that &#x2018;energy&#x2019; and
                &#x2018;calories&#x2019; are relatively well-established notions with the
                consumers and often considered as a summary measure of nutritional qualities of
                    foods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8"><sup>8</sup></xref>. Participants across all focus groups and countries are aware of calories
                and see them as a relevant measure to highlight on the front of the pack as they sum
                up the nutritional value of a product and are useful with weight management.
                Front-of-pack information was well received and participants felt that having The
                information on the front would allow them to more quickly and easily compare
                products while shopping. This is in line with previous research<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21"><sup>21</sup></xref> showing that consumers feel that front-of-pack labelling can help them make
                healthier choices. For example, the food industry in The Netherlands has implemented
                front-of-pack energy logos as a means to inform consumers and help them towards
                managing their diet.</p>
      <p>Our results further suggest that in communicating front-of-pack caloric information,
                many consumers prefer executions that are simple, easy to interpret and use. It
                seems that the simpler the information provided on the front of the pack, the better
                the understanding and engagement of consumers. Of the eight front-of-pack flags
                examined, most participants preferred the simple flags, solely indicating the amount
                of calories per 100 g or per serving. The simple flag including references to daily
                energy needs was also much liked, although there was disagreement on whether this
                more detailed information should be presented on the front or back of the pack.
                Previous research already showed that consumers request simplicity regarding
                nutrition information provided on labels as a key for their understanding and
                    engagement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8"><sup>8</sup></xref>. Reference to daily needs has a potential to help consumers put things into
                    perspective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21"><sup>21</sup></xref> but more complete (and hence complex) flags were least preferred.</p>
      <p>There were lots of similarities between the different groups tested and across
                different countries, indicating that energy (calories) might be one good minimum
                common denominator to work from in future initiatives. However, German consumers
                proved to have a fairly different perspective from those in the UK, France and The
                Netherlands. German consumers tend to be much more outspoken in that they show a
                stronger preference for simple front-of-pack flags than for more complex
                communication front-of-pack formats.</p>
      <p>Overall, our results show that energy-based front-of-pack communication systems hold
                potential, although several consumer issues or dilemmas need to be addressed when
                developing and introducing it. A first key dilemma is on how much information to put
                on a flag. On the one hand, simple flags are well-liked by consumers for their
                straightforwardness and ease of use. On the other hand, younger consumers in
                particular appreciate more detailed information, such as their daily energy needs,
                to be included in the flag as this would help them to put the amount of calories
                they are eating into perspective. Also, the preferred amount of information seems to
                differ between countries. UK participants were generally more positive about flags
                showing daily energy needs and charts showing percentage daily needs delivered by
                the food product. This preference might be explained by the fact that consumers in
                this country are more familiar with nutrition information on packages. German
                participants were negative about everything that was complex and have a preference
                for the simple flag showing calories per 100 g. This issue is of great importance;
                in particular, if a labelling scheme was to be proposed for EU-wide usage. Closely
                related to this issue is that front-of-pack flags should provide information in a
                consistent way on the front of <italic>all</italic> packs and not just on products
                that compare favourably. In this way, consumers will trust the information and will
                be enabled to learn how to use the information provided by the flags.</p>
      <p>A second key consideration is how to choose between flags indicating the amount of
                energy per serving vs. per 100 g. The calories per serving flag will only be helpful
                if consumers understand what exactly a serving unit is. It has been found that
                consumers are not very good at assessing the number of calories in a portion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24"><sup>24</sup></xref>. In our research, consumers found this option as the most preferable as long
                as the serving represents a realistic and easy-to-understand consumption unit.
                Otherwise, they would rather have the energy expressed per 100 g, with the exception
                of the UK, where they found the information per 100 g unclear, possibly due to the
                lesser use of the metric system. However, both options seem to fulfil different
                roles: the calories per serving would give them a realistic perspective on how many
                calories they are consuming, whereas the calories per 100 g would allow them to more
                easily compare products.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, when discussing the daily needs, participants felt confused about the
                meaning of average daily needs, recognising that there may be individual differences
                also based on energy expenditure. This dilemma could potentially be solved through
                the development of complementary and supporting educational campaigns on daily
                energy needs or by providing more detailed complementary information through a link
                to a reference website.</p>
      <p>Fourthly, the reference to exercise on front-of-pack energy flags seems to be
                polarising. Despite the fact that the notion of energy output is key to
                understanding the energy balance, many participants were sceptical or negative about
                the flags referring to exercise. This is in line with previous findings that show
                that consumers feel frustrated when they realise how much effort it takes to burn
                the amounts of calories in a given food<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22"><sup>22</sup></xref>. Most consumers seem to understand the underlying implicit message: increase
                the level of exercise, but most respondents feel that this sort of information does
                not belong on the food package. Messaging opportunities should be further explored
                to find other means to convey the concept to consumers. From our results, it seems
                that off-pack communication on the notion of energy balance is more appropriate than
                confronting consumers with it on-pack.</p>
      <p>The fifth consideration is if a standarised nutrition labelling system was to be
                proposed, it should be considered that although there are lots of similarities among
                different European countries, there are also some differences. Research done by
                    EUFIC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8"><sup>8</sup></xref> already pointed out the different relationship the UK consumers had with
                food and nutrition compared to other continental countries (like France, Italy or
                Germany). The present study reinforces this; for example, the fact that UK
                participants are more aware of daily needs than their continental counterparts. This
                should be taken into consideration when suggesting standardised approaches. However,
                calories are relevant to the present challenge of the obesity epidemic and seem to
                be the minimum common denominator. Therefore, the energy approach on front-of-pack
                labels could be the starting point, complemented or not to different extents with
                other systems, for a European standardised approach. Consumers also like uniformity
                across food product categories.</p>
      <p>Finally, although participants seem to be familiar with the notion of calories, they
                do not seem to fully understand how to apply it. This is in line with results from
                    EUFIC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8"><sup>8</sup></xref> and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22"><sup>22</sup></xref>. The lack of understanding on calorie application is among the main barriers
                to an effective use of nutrition information on food labels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23"><sup>23</sup></xref>. Increasing the nutrition knowledge increases the likelihood of nutritional
                label usage and has a positive effect on the quality of the consumer&#x2019;s
                    diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>&#x2013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6"><sup>6</sup></xref>. To be successful, any initiative aimed at helping consumers to understand
                and use the nutrition information on food labels is likely to require a concurrent
                consumer education and marketing strategy to be developed. The strategy should be
                adapted to specific population groups (e.g. non-users of the label, male,
                socio-economically disadvantaged and people with lower education). In parallel,
                certain issues such as the technical terminology or the information complexity (e.g.
                percentages or graphs, serving sizes per 100 g) would need to be resolved to improve
                the usage and understanding of the nutrition information on food labels.</p>
      <p>As a first assessment of consumer appreciation of front-of-pack energy-related flags,
                this study has a number of limitations. As there was little published research to
                guide us, we took a qualitative approach to the issues. Qualitative research seems
                appropriate at this stage as it allows for more in-depth exploration of underlying
                motivations and considerations on the part of the consumer. However, the qualitative
                nature of this study, and its inherent restrictions on the number of executions,
                respondents and countries involved, is a key limitation of this study. Clearly,
                future quantitative approaches would be required to substantiate these findings in a
                more representative sample of respondents and broader generalisation across
                different countries. Such quantitative approach will also allow us to explore
                individual and cultural differences in preference for different front-of-pack flags
                and more systematically in more detail.</p>
      <p>In summary, even though this study takes a qualitative approach and therefore its
                results can be neither quantified nor extrapolated to the general population, it has
                brought insight into consumers&#x2019; appreciation and understanding of an
                energy communication platform. Our findings suggest that highlighting energy on the
                front of the pack is a promising platform of communication. They also suggest that
                consumers, across different population groups and countries, see added value in
                front-of-pack energy labelling and prefer simple information on the front of the
                pack which is substantiated and detailed on the back of the pack, similar to what
                has been found in the US situation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16"><sup>16</sup></xref>. However, due to the on-pack limitations, there is a need to provide
                substantiation through education and other communication channels (e.g. a trusted

      <p>In light of the emerging obesity pandemic, more research is warranted to more
                specifically figure out how to best convey the concept of energy to different
                population groups in order to foster their informed food choices. The energy
                in&#x2013;energy out relationship should be explained with realistic and
                practical messages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23"><sup>23</sup></xref>. Messaging opportunities should be further explored if we want to achieve
                effective educational campaigns and ultimately to change behaviour. Future research
                looking at means to increase the use of nutrition information of labels during the
                purchase of products could also help.</p>
