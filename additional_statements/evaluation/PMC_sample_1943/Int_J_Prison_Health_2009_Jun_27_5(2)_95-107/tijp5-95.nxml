      <abstract>
        <p>This paper describes the development of a unique prison participatory research project, in which incarcerated women formed a research team, the research activities and the lessons learned. The participatory action research project was conducted in the main short sentence minimum/medium security women's prison located in a Western Canadian province. An ethnographic multi-method approach was used for data collection and analysis. Quantitative data was collected by surveys and analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data was collected from orientation package entries, audio recordings, and written archives of research team discussions, forums and debriefings, and presentations. These data and ethnographic observations were transcribed and analysed using iterative and interpretative qualitative methods and NVivo 7 software. Up to 15 women worked each day as prison research team members; a total of 190 women participated at some time in the project between November 2005 and August 2007. Incarcerated women peer researchers developed the research processes including opportunities for them to develop leadership and technical skills. Through these processes, including data collection and analysis, nine health goals emerged. Lessons learned from the research processes were confirmed by the common themes that emerged from thematic analysis of the research activity data. Incarceration provides a unique opportunity for engagement of women as expert partners alongside academic researchers and primary care workers in participatory research processes to improve their health.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The majority of women with short prison sentences in Canada are imprisoned due to illegal activities stemming from drug and alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Jurgens, 1997/8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Anderson, Rosay, &amp; Saum, 2002</xref>) Women in prison typically have poorer health, with a higher prevalence of HIV, hepatitis C, cervical dysplasia, and psychiatric illness than the general population.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Martin, Gold, Murphy, Remple, Berkowitz, &amp; Money, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Lewis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Mooney, Minor, Wells, Leukefeld, Oser, &amp; Tindall, 2007</xref>) Many women in the provincial correctional system revolve in and out of prison with recidivism rates such as 70% in 2 years.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Corrections Branch Public Safety, 2004</xref>). Incarceration often fails to prepare women for (re)integration into society. Following release, many of these women remain marginalized by society with [0]chronic socio-economic health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Association AC, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brooke, Taylor, Gunn, &amp; Maden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Browne, Miller, &amp; Maguin, 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>Participatory health research offers a means to empower those who engage in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Macauly, Gibson, Freeman, Commanda, McCabe, Robbins, et al., 1999</xref>). The result is an improved self-esteem and facilitated voice, which collectively contribute to changed health behaviour and education, and improved long-term health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Romero, Lucero, Fredline, Keefe, &amp; O'Connell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Tsey, Wilson, Haswell-Elkins, Whiteside, McCalman, Cadet-James, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brown, Hernandez, Saint-Jean, Evans, Tafari, Brewster, et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, empowerment models of health promotion seek to engage citizens in processes of increased self-determination and community empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Frankish &amp; Green, 1994</xref>). Prisons may be described as potential organic settings for health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">St Leger, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Whitelaw, Baxendale, Bryce, MacHardy, Young, &amp; Witney, 2001</xref>) because empowering prisoners to improve their own health also impacts the health of prison staff and prison inter-professional staff. The extent to which prisons adopt health promotion programs varies both within and between countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">UK Department of Health, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Statistics Canada, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">WHO, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>We found no reports of participatory research inside prison in which incarcerated individuals choose the health topics they wish to research. We found one published <italic>description</italic> of a prison in which the warden invited inmates to assist in the process of improving the education and health of all those inside prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bedi, 2006</xref>). The few published reports of prison participatory health research are limited to tightly defined health education topics that were predetermined by the academic research team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Paredes &amp; Colomer Revueltab, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Townsend, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>We previously reported an initial study which described the feasibility of engaging women inside prison with participatory research, the health concerns of incarcerated women, prison staff, and academic researchers, and their suggested research interventions (Martin, Murphy, Chan, Ramsden, Granger-Brown, Macaulay, et al., in press). This paper describes the participatory research processes that centred around incarcerated women forming a research team, the research activities and the lessons learned.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>The participatory action research project was conducted in the main short sentence (2 years or less) minimum/medium security women's prison located in a western Canadian province. At the time of the project, this facility housed up to 140 women in five cottage-style living units with an average stay of 3 months for provincially sentenced women. In addition, some women are remanded to custody while awaiting trial. Approximately 1600 women revolved through this provincial correctional centre each year, with a disproportionately high number of Aboriginal women (30% compared with 3.8% in the general Canadian female population; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">WHO, 2008</xref>). The participatory research project began following a face-to-face meeting that was held in October 2005 (Martin et al., in press). Incarcerated women were invited to form a research team following the face-to-face meeting. Participation on the research team continued to be inclusive of any woman who wanted to join and their activities continued to grow and shape as more women became involved as peer researchers<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1"><sup>1</sup></xref> on the team. The women of the prison research team began to collect self-data in an ethnographic manner in February 2006. This paper reports on project data collected from February 2006 until July 2007. Because participatory action research is a collaborative and progressive endeavour, the development of the activities and research processes are described as part of the results from this study.</p>

        <title>Quantitative data collection and analysis</title>
        <p>Quantitative data from demographic and &#x2018;drug of choice&#x2019; surveys responses were entered into an Excel spreadsheet by incarcerated women peer researchers and a summer research assistant. Demographic information was collected on age, ethnicity, education, total time incarcerated, family disease history, drug of choice, and whether drug use lead to incarceration. The &#x2018;drug of choice&#x2019; survey included questions such as, &#x2018;What is your drug of choice?&#x2019;, &#x2018;What age did you start using?&#x2019;, &#x2018;Are you incarcerated due to drug use?&#x2019;, and &#x2018;What are some of your triggers inside and outside of jail?&#x2019; Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics to provide frequencies and distributions.</p>

        <title>Qualitative data collection and analysis</title>
        <p>Women of the prison research team collected observational data in order to record the research events as they evolved inside the prison. Qualitative data for this project included orientation package entries, which were written by incarcerated women who joined the research team; audio-taping of research team discussions, forums, and debriefings; archives of documents including attendance lists, written descriptions of the forums (face-to-face meetings), women's presentations, their proposals and letters. Forums and discussion groups were audio-recorded. Recordings were transcribed verbatim by trained incarcerated peer researchers, summer research students, and women released from prison who are engaged as community-based peer researchers. Personal identifiers were removed from the resulting transcriptions, which were then returned to participants, whenever possible, in order to verify accuracy. Transcripts of the qualitative data were analysed using standard iterative and interpretative qualitative methods; members of the academic research team and peer-researchers inside and outside of prison reviewed the transcripts and independently identified themes. Transcripts and field notes were reviewed in an iterative manner to ensure all emergent themes were captured. Representative quotes were selected from the transcripts to illustrate the main themes identified. Thematic analysis of transcripts was also conducted, by a research student, using NVivo, a qualitative software program that assisted in managing the data.</p>
        <p>The findings were member-checked with the peer researchers. Three of these are coauthors: KM and DH were members of the prison research team; JM joined the project following release from prison. Based on the analysis, findings were compiled in an iterative manner, which resulted in the main lessons learned about the prison participatory research processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Thorne, Kirkham, &amp; MacDonald-Emes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Sandelowski, 1998</xref>).</p>

        <title>Ethics</title>
        <p>A Certificate of Approval was obtained from the local university Behavioral Research Ethics Board prior to proceeding with this research. All participants were provided with information about the research project and indicated their willingness to participate by signing the Consent Form. Everyone who worked with data signed a confidentiality agreement. Author REM, on behalf of the academic research team, signed a 5-year Research Agreement with the Assistant Deputy Minister, Ministry of Public Safety Solicitor General, Corrections Branch. REM also consulted and collaborated with the prison warden, management team and correctional staff about the implementation of the participatory research processes.</p>

        <title>Development of participatory research processes</title>
        <p>Following an initial face-to-face prison meeting in October 2005, the incarcerated women who had assisted in writing the funding application asked the warden if &#x2018;participatory health research team&#x2019; could become a prison work placement, because the work was so meaningful to them. The five shared values that had been expressed during the face-to-face meeting became guiding principles for the developing research processes (Martin et al., in press). From November 2005 to December 2006, all incarcerated women who wished to join the health research team were invited to become prison peer researchers. From January 2007 to August 2007, a programme officer screened and selected women who requested to work on the research team. Up to 15 women worked each day as members of the prison research team, with a total of 190 women (November 2005-August 2007). Incarcerated women peer researchers worked in collaboration with 10 academic research members from several universities, including University of British Columbia, University of Saskatchewan and McGill University.</p>
        <p>Incarcerated women peer researchers developed an orientation package, which new members joining the research team were invited to complete. The orientation package was revised with minor iterations over several months as new women joined and shaped the group's processes. The final orientation package<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> included:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">

        <p>The prison peer research team developed a daily routine for themselves that included &#x2018;angel words&#x2019; (each person in turn randomly selected an angel card<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref> from a closed bag and shared with the group what the word meant to them that day) and a reading from a spiritual reflection book. These routines often led to discussions, related to their spiritual and emotional healing, which fostered an atmosphere of peer support within the research team. In addition, the prison peer research team developed organizational processes that provided opportunities for them to develop leadership within the group (e.g. administrative and organizational skills, public speaking, liaising with correctional staff, and peer mentoring in computer, language, and writing skills).</p>

        <title>Research activity findings</title>
        <p>Through these processes, nine health goals emerged. These health goals grew out of the five health concerns (categories) that had been identified during the exploratory phase of the project (Martin et al., in press). The prison peer researchers, in collaboration with author REM, conceptualized their nine health goals as a diagram, which they posted on the wall of the prison dining room in order to seek verbal and written feedback from the broader prison community. Feedback was incorporated into a finalized, &#x2018;Bubble Diagram&#x2019; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The nine health goals reflect the incarcerated women's desire for health not only inside prison, but also in the community after their release from prison. The arrows around the edge of each bubble represent iterative cyclical processes necessary for planning, conducting and evaluation of interventions to attain each health goal.</p>

        <p>One-hundred-and-two incarcerated women from the prison research team completed the demographic survey and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The demographics show that 61% were aged 30 or older and 31% were Aboriginal. The strong representation of Aboriginal women in the prison research team influenced the peer research team processes, so that they included Aboriginal methods of dialogue and models of holistic health and healing. For example, the peer research team often discussed topics in a talking circle, practicing a circular and equitable method of discussion. An object that represented a talking stick was often passed around the circle, inviting everyone in turn to add their voice to the discussion without interruption. In addition, the four quadrants of the medicine wheel (physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health) were explored by the research team members, highlighting their holistic approach to health.</p>
        <p>In addition, 117 incarcerated women completed the &#x2018;drug of choice&#x2019; survey and the results are also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Seventy-nine women (74%) reported that drug use led to their incarceration. Of the 57 women who reported past use of cocaine/crack, 51 women (89%) reported that this use led to their incarceration; of the 35 women who reported past use of heroin, 33 (94%) reported that this use led to their incarceration; of the 17 women who reported past use of crystal meth, 13 (76%) reported that this use led to their incarceration. Nine women reported that &#x2018;other&#x2019; drugs had been their drug of choice, including prescription drugs, morphine, opiates (oxycontin, etc.), tobacco, and gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB, the date rape drug). Thirteen women (12%) did not list heroin, cocaine/crack or crystal meth as drug of choice; of these women, 4/13 stated that the misuse of alcohol led to their incarceration.</p>

          <p>Being a part of this research team has changed my perspective on life and what is more relevant. Because, [it's] given me a deeper sense of learning to accomplish something with my life &#x2026; It was good. I learned a lot. It was a different experience to me, you know, something you don't expect happening in jail.</p>

          <p>I saw a side of the girls that was hidden before. It was so well put together that you didn't realize that you have these skills before.</p>

        <p>The peer researchers asserted the development of skills as an important aspect of their growth within the research team:</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>And I'm just thrilled, the stimulation, the mind, the skills that I can use. I can just keep using the skills from the outside. So when I get back out there I'm still gonna be fresh, I'm still gonna be ready to go.

        <p>Incarcerated women who were involved in this project reported encouragement from a newfound self-respect and self-esteem. As a result, they reported that they felt motivation to continue down the road to recovery:</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>I let go of all the expectations and I have learned to love myself regardless to what I have done &#x2026; And I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna make it.</p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>Another key theme that emerged from the women was the benefit of learning how to communicate effectively and confidently. The women on the research team learned to share their story and present it in an impacting way:</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>By presenting my life story, I've been reading it, rereading it and reading it aloud in research and everything and it got to the point where I felt that it was mundane and when I presented it, it felt like it was the first time I actually heard my own words and I looked up and saw those kids. They were listening, they were actually listening and hanging onto my every word and I felt that was great &#x2026; I know my word had an effect. I honestly believed that so I am proud of it.</p>
          <p>When I was talking to the students at the school I got children at that same age and I wished my son or daughter was in there to hear what I had to say because being a crack head or used-to-be-crack head for years, I didn't know how to approach my kids or how to talk to them about drugs and being a hypocritical person, but now with the dry run and seeing their expressions, they were in awe of all the information we were giving them &#x2026; You said I just learned something now I know and it's going to be much easier to talk to my kids about drugs and everything.</p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>By watching the process of the research project and the women that were involved, the prison staff observed the positive effects of allowing incarcerated women to be a part of something new and the theme of independence emerged. Prison staff reported that the independence the incarcerated women were given through this project contributed to the positive experience for most of the women involved.</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>I think they liked it because they had a lot of control over it as well; they take control of it themselves so it is not one of us standing up and teaching them a program and it is not us directing them how to do their workload &#x2026; they are doing it on their own.</p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>As a result of this project, the incarcerated women who became involved repeatedly expressed their passion for their work on the project and their sense of a renewed purpose:</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>&#x2026;it's being busy like this and doing research and doing the typing and seeing everybody's story, reading everybody's story, it's just kind of made me feel like I'm not as depressed as I was here before. Because it has sparked such an interest in me and I feel like I'm useful and doing something to help us while we're here, but also to help the other women that come to the prison in the future. And it just makes me excited that we can actually look forward and hopefully this all does go through to help people, especially the women in prison.</p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>The passion and purpose that the incarcerated women articulated was mirrored in the observations of the research academic team:</p>
        <disp-quote>
          <p>Because I see all of you engaged in doing something worth while and meaningful.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>For the academic research team, the biggest challenge was letting go of our preconceived notions of the focus for this health research project. As the academic researchers let go of a reductionist medical model of health, with its focus on research of diseases such as HIV, cancer, addiction, hepatitis C, they came to learn that the incarcerated woman's view of health and healing is larger and more complex. The health goals of women in prison are consistent with those described as the social determinants of health and determinants of health promotion. As we listened to the women's voices we learned the reality that their health goals are inter-related and inter-dependent, as well as consistent with Maslow's hierarchy of needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Maslow, 1943</xref>) and an ecological model of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Hancock, 1993</xref>). We came to appreciate that participatory research processes embrace interdisciplinary, intersectoral, and complexity theory principles, which underpin the work in this project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">McCall, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>A limitation of the project was that the work occurred in only one woman's prison in Canada and may not be applicable to other prison settings. However, we feel that these participatory health research processes and principles could apply to any prison and other institutional settings, although they are dependent upon the support of the warden and management staff. The challenges of the project included the lack of funding and high-turnover of women with short sentences. Therefore, it was not always possible to return transcripts to discussion participants to check accuracy. Continuity of research work was difficult after a woman's release from prison and continuity of focus within the research team was sometimes difficult to sustain. After we received funding, a summer research assistant (co-author GE), facilitated the continuity of focus and vision during the months of her tenure.</p>
      <p>The strength of the project was its uniqueness: women in prison were engaged as equal partners in participatory health research to design and guide the aims and methods of the health research processes. The research activities of the women in the participatory health research team complemented those of the warden and prison staff, so that changes occurred in the prison setting that could transform the health and social well-being of women inside prison. In addition, this project illustrated the unique position of primary health care practitioners to initiate patient-centred health research projects.</p>
      <p>Incarceration provides unique opportunities for engagement of women as expert partners in participatory research processes to improve their health. It also provides a unique opportunity for engagement of women's voices in health promotion and health research. However, in order for women's health goals to be attained, transformation must occur outside prison and also during the transitioning from prison to the outside, so that women can access support and resources upon their release. Future publications will discuss the details of the next steps in this prison participatory health research project as it moves towards attaining the nine health goals.</p>
