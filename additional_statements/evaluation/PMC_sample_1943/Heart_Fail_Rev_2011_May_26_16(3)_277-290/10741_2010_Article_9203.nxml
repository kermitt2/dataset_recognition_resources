        <p>Impact of variability in the measured parameter is rarely considered in designing clinical protocols for optimization of atrioventricular (AV) or interventricular (VV) delay of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). In this article, we approach this question quantitatively using mathematical simulation in which the true optimum is known and examine practical implications using some real measurements. We calculated the performance of <italic>any</italic> optimization process that selects the pacing setting which maximizes an underlying signal, such as flow or pressure, in the presence of overlying random variability (noise). If signal and noise are of equal size, for a 5-choice optimization (60, 100, 140, 180, 220&#xA0;ms), replicate AV delay optima are rarely identical but rather scattered with a standard deviation of 45&#xA0;ms. This scatter was overwhelmingly determined (&#x3C1;&#xA0;=&#xA0;&#x2212;0.975, <italic>P</italic>&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.001) by Information Content, <inline-formula id="IEq1"><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>After implantation of a resynchronization device (biventricular pacemaker or defibrillator) not all patients undergo optimization even though guidelines recommend that AV and VV delay should be optimized, and even though clinical trials have only demonstrated survival benefit of individually optimized CRT. Are clinicians right to cut corners from the trial-validated, guideline-mandated process? To answer this, the basic science of optimization needs to be examined.</p>
      <p>For optimization of atrioventricular (AV) delay, commonly a range of AV settings is tested, whilst monitoring a marker of cardiac function such as echocardiographic velocity&#x2013;time integral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] (VTI, a surrogate of stroke volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]) or left ventricular d<italic>P</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The pacemaker setting that gives the best cardiac function is then defined as the optimum. A similar process can also be carried out for the delay between activation of left and right ventricular leads (VV delay).</p>
      <p>However, every measurement has uncertainties, which might conceal the true optimum. This uncertainty in our measurement of VTI (or of any other marker for monitoring cardiac function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]) arises from numerous factors including natural biological variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, repeating the &#x201C;optimization protocol&#x201D; often provides different optima, as shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>An example of clinical data from typical patient undergoing three separate Doppler optimization processes (#1, #2 and #3) a few minutes apart, using one heartbeat of velocity&#x2013;time integral as the measurement to be maximized. In this patient, the small differences in velocity&#x2013;time integral between the three optimization processes are enough to cause different AV delay settings to be identified as apparently optimal on the three occasions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10741_2010_9203_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p>There are several clinically important questions. First, if the optimum is not necessarily the &#x2018;true&#x2019; underlying optimum, can we at least express its precision, for example, as a 95% confidence interval?</p>
      <p>Second, can we trust the measured increase in VTI as a good estimate of the &#x2018;true&#x2019; average underlying increase in VTI?</p>
      <p>Third, if optimizations 6&#xA0;months later show that many patients&#x2019; optima have changed, would this imply that patients require more frequent re-optimization?  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</p>
      <p>Finally, how can the precision of the optimization protocol be maximized?</p>
      <p>It would be difficult and contentious to attempt to answer these questions by doing clinical studies. This is partly because in clinical practice it is normally assumed that the apparent optimum is indeed the true optimum (or at least the nearest of the tested settings to the true optimum). Persons other than the operator conducting the optimization process itself rarely entertain the possibility that spontaneous variability of the monitored measurement during the optimization procedure arising from beat-to-beat variability and inherent measurement uncertainty has caused the optimum to be misidentified. Confidence intervals are not reported for individual clinical patients&#x2019; optima [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, therefore, we created mathematical simulation having properties exactly like real-life studies, but in which we could truly know the underlying optimum, despite the presence of overlying noise. To understand the realistic balance between underlying optima and overlying noise, we looked at published studies of optimization.</p>
      <sec id="Sec2">
        <title>Information content</title>
        <p>A convenient way of quantifying in real-life optimizations the relative contributions of underlying true signal information versus overlying random noise (illustrated in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) is using &#x201C;information content&#x201D;. Signal, in this context, is the genuine underlying between-setting difference in VTI, which for computational convenience can be expressed as a variance (average of the squared deviate between the underlying value of each setting and the mean of all settings). Noise, correspondingly, is the unwanted variability that occurs when measures are repeated at the same setting. This too can be expressed as a variance (average of the squared deviate between individual replicate measurements at a setting and the underlying value of that setting). The advantage of using variances is that their sum is the total observed variance. The variance observed over a series of settings can be decomposed into the variance arising from the genuine between-setting differences (signal magnitude) and the remainder which is noise variance. The proportion of the total variance which is signal can be called &#x201C;information content&#x201D;.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>Observed measurements are composed of underlying true difference between settings (&#x201C;signal&#x201D;, <italic>top</italic> panel) and beat-to-beat variability (&#x201C;noise&#x201D;, <italic>middle</italic> panel) which may be small (<italic>left</italic>) or large (<italic>right</italic>) relative to the signal. The relative sizes of underlying signal and overlying noise determine whether the observed measurements (<italic>bottom</italic> panel) reflect the underlying signal faithfully (<italic>left</italic>) or not (<italic>right</italic>). When the noise variability is relatively large (<italic>right</italic>), the observed optimum (<italic>arrow</italic>) is often not the true optimum (140&#xA0;ms in all cases in this figure)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10741_2010_9203_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><tex-math id="M2">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

        <p>The reasons to use information content rather than simply signal-to-noise ratio are three fold. First, the information content conveniently varies between 0 and 1, rather than extending to infinity. Second, it is symmetrical: noise content is 1 minus information content, which makes it clear that there are two contributors to observed differences between settings. Third, it is numerically identical to the intraclass correlation coefficient, a simple index of reproducibility used in biological research.</p>

      <title>Published data</title>
      <p>Information content can be calculated in any study for which both the overall variability and the noise variability are available. We present in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> information content for three detailed physiological studies conducted in research environment where special attention was given to accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For each row of this table, we calculated for each patient the signal size (expressed as a variance) and the noise size (expressed as a variance), and displayed the average values across all patients. Each study had measurements at more than one heart rate, or via more than one monitoring technique, and so had more than one row. Where raw data of multiple replicates were available to us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], noise variance was quantified directly. Where data of only a single replicate were available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], noise variance was defined as the dispersion (expressed as a variance) of raw data away from a best-fit regression parabola between the observed measurements and the AV delay. Where noise variance was published graphically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], it was read off the graph. Signal variance was defined as the total observed variance of that patient minus noise variance. Because the protocols differed between studies, this table should not be used to compare optimization technologies, but rather just to obtain an idea of the realistic range of information content achievable. It should be remembered that these were conducted in ideal research environments when there was effectively no time pressure. Routine clinical practice, because of time pressure, typically falls short of such ideal protocols that might require as many as 1,500 beats to be acquired and analysed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>Information content calculated from published studies of optimization</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Average heart rate (bpm)</th><th align="left">Pacing parameter being optimized</th><th align="left">Study</th><th align="left">Definition of 1 replicate</th><th align="left">Number of replicates (<italic>R</italic>)</th><th align="left">Parameter used for optimization</th><th align="left">Number of patients with sufficient raw optimization data</th><th align="left">Signal size, expressed as a variance</th><th align="left">The noise size, expressed as a variance</th><th align="left">Information content of parameter, when used as an <italic>n</italic>-replicate average (mean&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;SEM)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Resting</td><td align="left">AV</td><td align="left" rowspan="2">Auricchio et al.

      <p>In this study, we present a simple way to establish the impact of spontaneous beat-to-beat variability, by simulating an optimization in which there is a known underlying optimum setting at which cardiac function is best, and alternative settings at which cardiac function decays away. In the simulation, we can then superimpose random variability simulating clinical beat-to-beat variability (the &#x201C;noise&#x201D;). This simulation gives information whose applicability is completely general across any method of optimization that is based on selecting the settings which gives the most favourable value of a cardiovascular measure.</p>

        <p>We constructed a simulation to identify the impact of noise variance, which is the random variability occurring between one beat and another. This noise is superimposed on the signal, which is the &#x201C;true&#x201D; underlying effect of the pacemaker setting changes in real patient data. In clinical practice, signal and noise cannot be separated in individual raw data points because each such observed measurement contains both contributions mixed together (however, if replicate measurements are made, their inter-replicate variance can be subtracted from the total variance of the observed raw data to reveal the signal variance).</p>

        <p>In keeping with real patient data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the underlying signal in our model was constructed as an inverted parabola with its peak&#x2014;the underlying optimum&#x2014;at 140&#xA0;ms. The vertical size of the parabola was scaled to have the desired signal magnitude. The magnitude was defined as the average of the squared deviation from the mean: this definition is computationally identical to that of variance. Separately, we programmed noise as normally distributed random values with mean zero and variance as desired. The signal and noise were added together to create the simulated observations. This process was repeated separately for each simulated patient. For each analysis in this study, 1,000 patients were simulated.</p>
        <p>We tested signal and noise sizes over a wide range, but for clarity in this paper we have presented a limited number of values, ensuring that the full spectrum of relative sizes of signal magnitude and noise variance is encompassed.</p>

        <title>Confidence intervals of the optimum</title>
        <p>We simulated repeat optimizations within the same individual and collected the resulting optima in order to see how widely these optima were scattered. We defined the 95% confidence interval of a single optimization as 1.96&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;the standard deviation of this collection of observed optima. This is the confidence interval that would be appropriate to report for each patient&#x2019;s individual optimization, although by this method it is of course necessary to carry out several optimizations per patient in order to calculate the confidence interval.</p>

        <title>Impact of information content on consistency of detecting optimum, using a single beat at each setting</title>
        <p>With signal and noise both configured to be the same size, the underlying curved shape of the signal was not always evident in the observed measurements (signal&#xA0;+&#xA0;noise). Nevertheless inevitably, in each run, one of the settings yielded the highest measurement and was duly selected as the observed &#x201C;optimum&#x201D;. Since this was not always the true <italic>underlying</italic> optimum, the <italic>observed</italic> optima showed some scatter (as shown schematically in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
        <p>For each combination of signal and noise size, we quantified the observed scatter of optimization as the standard deviation of difference between the optima obtained on two successive optimizations of the same patient. We calculated the information content from the known sizes of signal and noise.</p>
        <p>When signal and noise were equal, there was an optimization scatter (standard deviation) of 45&#xA0;ms. Making the signal magnitude small made the scatter of the observed optimum wider. Making the signal larger made the scatter of the observed optimum narrower (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Spearman rank correlation coefficient &#x3C1;&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.973, <italic>P</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.021). When the noise was made smaller, the scatter of the observed optimum narrowed. When the noise was made larger, the scatter of the observed optimum widened (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, &#x3C1;&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.991, <italic>P</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.0017).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#xA0;3</label><caption><p>Scatter between successive optima increases when noise variance is increased (<italic>Top</italic> panel) and decreases when signal magnitude is increased (<italic>Middle</italic> panel). Information content, encompassing the relative sizes of signal and noise, has a powerful effect on the scatter between successive optima. The <italic>bottom</italic> panel shows the effect of information content (the proportion of variance that arises from signal) on the scatter between successive optima</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10741_2010_9203_Fig3_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
        <p>The information content was the overwhelming determinant of the scatter of optima (&#x3C1;&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.979, <italic>P</italic>&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.001, Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the worst case scenario, i.e. information content near zero, the scatter of optimization was ~80&#xA0;ms, the implied range, 60&#x2013;220&#xA0;ms, covers the full range of settings over which the simulations are performed.</p>
        <p>We can compare this to the expected behaviour of an entirely worthless optimization method, which would be to use no physiological information but simply to select one of the settings (60, 100, 140, 180, 220&#xA0;ms) at random and announce it to be the optimum. From first principles, the mean &#x201C;optimum&#x201D; expected from such an approach is 140&#xA0;ms, and the expected variance (average square of deviate from that mean) is simply (80<sup>2</sup>&#xA0;+&#xA0;40<sup>2</sup>&#xA0;+&#xA0;0<sup>2</sup>&#xA0;+&#xA0;40<sup>2</sup>&#xA0;+&#xA0;80<sup>2</sup>)/5&#xA0;=&#xA0;3,200&#xA0;ms<sup>2</sup>, giving an expected optimization scatter (SD of difference, SDD) of &#x221A;2&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;&#x221A;3,200&#xA0;=&#xA0;80&#xA0;ms. This forms an effective limit on how poorly reproducible any optimization amongst these settings can be: SDD can never be more than 80&#xA0;ms, for this range of tested settings.</p>
        <p>Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows that the information content needs to be rather high before the scatter of optimization even comes close to values that clinicians may consider acceptable. Even to get the SDD of successive optima down to 25&#xA0;ms, for example, we need information content of 0.91, i.e. signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1.</p>

        <title>Impact of averaging multiple replicates on reproducibility</title>
        <p>We tested the impact of changing a clinic&#x2019;s optimization policy to making, not just a single measurement at each pacemaker setting, but several raw replicates (3, 10, 30 or 100), with average of all those replicate raw measurements in that patient being plotted and used to select that patient&#x2019;s optimum setting. This process improved the fidelity with which the observed measurements reflected the underlying physiological value.</p>

        <p>We measured the apparent size of the increase in the measured variable upon optimization.

When there is sufficient noise to cause a setting which is not the underlying optimum to appear to be the optimum (because it happens to have had a positive noise element), then we are effectively selecting the setting whose noise is most positive. This introduces a consistent, positive bias whose size increases as the noise becomes more dominant because the most positive noise element is larger, and because in noisier environments there is a larger group of settings amongst which the apparent optimum might plausibly be drawn. As a result, larger noise consistently inflates the difference between the apparent optimum and any reference setting.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have shown that uncritically selecting the pacemaker setting which gives the best value of a monitored variable might be little better than random selection amongst a set of AV settings. These findings are generally applicable to any optimization method that relies on testing a series of settings whilst monitoring some measure of cardiac function (such as echocardiographic velocity&#x2013;time integral or pressure or any other cardiovascular marker) and then picking the setting that gives the highest measurement.</p>
      <p>It is overwhelmingly important for signal-to-noise ratio (information content) to be high, otherwise a series of illusions automatically arise in any clinical data analysis.</p>
      <sec id="Sec16">
        <title>Illusion 1: &#x201C;We have selected the true underlying optima&#x201D;</title>
        <p>One tends to assume that the setting which gives the highest measurement is the best. However, our study shows that only a very small amount of variability is enough to seriously compromise this assumption because the true biological effect may also be very small. With signal and noise of equal size for example, in ~50% of cases (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) the optimum detected will not be the true optimum but an erroneous alternative.</p>
        <p>The confidence interval of a clinical optimization is never reported and (surprisingly) rarely asked for. A wide confidence interval will have immediate comprehensibility to any clinician reviewing the result. The simplest way to calculate the confidence interval of optimization is to carry it out on several occasions (e.g. immediately, one after the other) and calculate the standard deviation. The 95% CI would be the mean&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;1.96&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;standard deviation. To make this reasonably valid, we would need to perform at least three or four optimizations. Of course this would be extremely time-consuming and is therefore not realistic for routine clinical practice with current monitoring techniques.</p>
        <p>Alternatively one can determine information content of the clinic&#x2019;s optimization process in general. This could be calculated once and then applied to all similar patients without having to carry out multiple replicate optimizations in each new clinical patient. Fortunately, information content is easy to calculate: it is essentially the intraclass correlation coefficient. This can be calculated quickly for a representative group of patients by any laboratory. This is similar, in principle, to using concepts of statistical power analysis to routine clinical practice.</p>

        <title>Illusion 2: &#x201C;The optimization increased flow (or pressure) by <italic>X</italic> and was therefore worthwhile&#x201D;</title>
        <p>It is tempting to average the apparent increments in velocity&#x2013;time integral (or whatever measure was used for optimization) achieved in an optimization service, and believe that first, (a) the process is almost always increasing stoke volume, (b) the size of the average increase in stroke volume is &#x2018;<italic>X</italic>&#x2019; which sounds clinically worthwhile and (c) since the increment is statistically significant it is not likely to be a chance finding.</p>
        <p>This study reveals all three of these tempting conclusions to be wrong. First, the setting selected as apparently optimum will always have a higher measured cardiac function than the reference setting (except where the reference setting happens to be selected as the optimum). Even if an optimization method was just roulette amongst <italic>n</italic> tested settings, then in (<italic>n</italic>&#x2212;1)/<italic>n</italic> cases (i.e. almost always) it would be selecting an optimum different from reference. Therefore, the statement that stroke volume is higher on the optimal setting is meaningless.</p>
        <p>Second, ironically, the worse the optimization method, the larger the illusionary increase in stroke volume.</p>
        <p>Third, unless carefully constructed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the statistical test is assessing whether changes in stroke volume are randomly distributed (some positive, some negative) with a mean of zero. But each patient&#x2019;s increment will always be either positive or zero (never negative), so the average increment will always be statistically significantly positive unless the sample size is very small. Indeed, the worse the optimization method, the more likely the apparent increment is to be statistically significantly positive.</p>

        <p>A well-established and indispensable optimization clinic may start to consider how often these optimizations should be carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Is the contrast between patients&#x2019; optima on subsequent visits a useful guide? Our analyses now show that if a technology has poor information content (low signal-to-noise ratio), reproducibility will be poor. For example, when signal and noise are approximately equal (information content&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.5) at 6&#xA0;months (or any other time), the optimum will falsely appear to have changed, purely through noise, 65% of the time (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Ironically, the worse the optimization process, the more the data will seem to encourage more frequent optimizations. The giveaway clue to this would be that however frequently we re-optimize, there would still be a similar proportion who would seem to need a change in setting.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table&#xA0;4</label><caption><p>The number of replicates required when optimization is performed to reduce the scatter of AV optima obtained to a range of acceptable confidence intervals</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10741_2010_9203_Tab4_HTML" id="MO700"/></table-wrap></p>

        <title>Illusion 4: &#x201C;We should not waste time making multiple replicate measurements at each setting in clinical practice&#x201D;</title>
        <p>In a busy clinical department, it may seem an unnecessary multiplication of work to make more than one measurement at each setting. Instead, it may seem rational to concentrate on ensuring that each measurement is acquired and analysed properly by well-trained staff. Unfortunately, the reasons for beat-to-beat variability in measurement are many, and inadequate skill on the part of the sonographer or interpreter is typically not the dominant contribution. Rather, there is substantial beat-to-beat variability in transvalvular blood flow, ventricular volumes, arterial blood pressure and d<italic>P</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>. These variations may be due to respiration and numerous other less-easily monitored physiological processes that take place over periods of seconds and minutes. They will not disappear through wishful thinking alone. Instead, averaging multiple replicate acquisitions gives us a powerful method to reduce the effective noise. Effective noise (the variance of the averaged value from <italic>R</italic> replicate raw measurements) falls in direct proportion to 1/<italic>R</italic>, providing a simple way to improve the information content. Another strategy is to elevate heart rate, since this increases the size of the signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>

        <title>A simple method of calculating information content of a cardiovascular measure used clinically for optimization</title>
        <p>Because this study was carried out using computer simulation, it was possible to know the size of the true underlying signal, as well as the size of the noise, and thereby state the information content directly.</p>
        <p>In vivo, one can calculate information content by measuring total variance and noise variance, since although the underlying signal magnitude cannot be directly observed, it is the difference between them. We need to carry out several optimizations in the same patients. Suppose one carries out <italic>R</italic> replicate sets of optimizations in one patient.

Then one can calculate the mean measurement at each pacemaker setting and then the variance (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) of these means. <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> will tend to be smaller than <italic>V</italic><sub>raw</sub>, because the impact of noise is reduced by the averaging process. The lower the information content in the measurement, the larger its noise in comparison with its signal, and therefore the more markedly <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> will differ from <italic>V</italic><sub>raw</sub>.

        <p>An example of how to calculate information content in a single patient, using only standard spreadsheet software, is shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#xA0;7</label><caption><p>Calculation of information content using raw clinical data from a single patient. In this example of real-life data from one patient, four replicates of measurements at five settings are entered into a table (columns <italic>E</italic> to <italic>H</italic>), and the mean at each setting calculated (column <italic>K</italic>). The variance of the raw data is calculated (Cell <italic>H21</italic>) using the formula shown immediately below it; the same is done for the variance of the means (Cell <italic>K21</italic>).

        <p>In practice, the examples of published data on information content in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> show that even with time-consuming methodology, including a high number of replicates and many beats measured per replicate, information content can still be low.</p>

        <title>How many replicates are really needed in clinical practice?</title>
        <p>Clinicians cannot afford to waste time in clinical practice on performing unnecessary numerous measurements during optimization. Nor, though, can they waste time performing apparent optimizations that they should know will be worthless before the patient even lies down on the couch. To choose rationally the number of replicates to perform, it is vital to decide how precisely the patient&#x2019;s optimum needs to be identified.</p>
        <p>In clinical practice, each individual physician can decide what level of precision is suitable in their context and can easily calculate the number of replicates required to achieve this as long as the information content of a single replicate of their local method is known. The number of replicates required for a range of such combinations is shown in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>.</p>
        <p>For example, a clinician may wish to know the AV optimum with a 95% confidence interval of &#xB1;10&#xA0;ms. How many replicates are needed depends on the heart rate at which optimization is to be carried out (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Studies at resting heart rate have found rather low information contents around 0.3.</p>
        <p>If a confidence interval of optimization of &#xB1;10&#xA0;ms is wanted in this context, from Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> it can be seen that the number of replicates needing to be conducted at each setting is 59.</p>
        <p>At higher heart rates such as 90&#xA0;bpm, information content is approximately 0.5&#x2013;0.7 for several methods (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Achieving a confidence interval of &#xB1;10&#xA0;ms now only requires 11&#x2013;25 replicates, as shown in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, which might be achievable. At higher heart rates still, the number of replicates needed continues to fall (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig.&#xA0;8</label><caption><p>The effect of heart rate on information content from datasets of published studies regardless of method used for AV optimization</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10741_2010_9203_Fig8_HTML" id="MO10"/></fig></p>
        <p>Adjustment of VV delay, in contrast, exerts a much smaller signal effect on physiological measurements than AV adjustment by a factor of about 5&#x2013;7 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Even if the variation in blood pressure is just fivefold smaller, the information content is roughly 25-fold smaller&#x2014;because it is the variances (squared deviates) that matter. Therefore, even assuming a favourably elevated (90&#xA0;bpm) heart rate, a favourable range of AV optimization information contents of 0.5&#x2013;0.7, and a possible relative signal variance for VV of (1/7)<sup>2</sup> to (1/5)<sup>2</sup>, the information content for VV would lie between 0.01 and 0.03. It can be seen from Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> that this necessitates well over 500 replicates at each setting to achieve the desired precision of optimization.</p>
        <p>Although there are detailed descriptions of meticulous protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] even putting together 1,500 beats of data does not give high information content. Multi beat averages reduce noise, but if signal is small, information content may still be small. High heart rate raises signal magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and has allowed a higher information content to be obtained.</p>

      <title>Clinical implications</title>
      <p>No clinical optimization protocol currently specifies a number of replicates to be carried out, whilst giving a quantitative reasoning. This may be because the impact of noise has not been considered or measured. It may not be rational to conduct an optimization without ensuring adequate precision of the optimum. Although there may be a clinical imperative to be seen to be doing something, we should not necessarily give in to perceived pressure to conduct a placebo procedure. Worse still, if the apparent optimization is in fact no different to randomization amongst a constrained range, it is inescapable that half of all such procedures worsen cardiac efficiency rather than improve it.</p>
      <p>If we want our optimization service to be delivering clinical valuable results, there are three generic steps we should take. First, we should have as large an underlying signal as possible. For blood pressure changes, it has been reported that the signal is larger in absolute terms at higher heart rates than at lower heart rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>Second, we should have as small a noise as possible. We should not criticise operators for inadequate care when they may simply be correctly measuring biological variability. Instead we should design our measured variable and protocol to have a high information content.</p>
      <p>Third, we can take averages of multiple replicate measurements of cardiac function at each AV delay setting. An <italic>R</italic>-fold replication will have the same beneficial effect as reducing the noise variance of individual measurements by <italic>R</italic>-fold. This can be applied to any measurement technique, but of course carries the cost of increased labour.</p>
      <p>Realization of these inherent properties of optimization should encourage us to mandatorily report the noise and information content of our monitored variable in our hands. We should be able to therefore present the confidence interval with every optimization we carry out. This may be uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>We emphasize that in this article we are not recommending one method of measurement (e.g. VTI or pressure) over another, nor suggesting whether measurement should be invasive or non-invasive. The choice of measurement modality for optimization should be prejudged by personal preference or based on whim, but rather selected on the balance of relevant properties. The most important property of optimization (a process that recommends small adjustments to pacemaker settings) is the precision with which the recommendation is given. This is a neutral article which simply provides a language to rationally evaluate, discuss and improve this precision.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec25">
      <title>Practical recommendations</title>
      <p>This analysis is completely general to all optimization schemes which test a range of settings and select the one with the greatest measurement. Any laboratory conducting optimization can use Eq.&#xA0;<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref> and Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> to calculate their typical information content. In concert with device physicians, who can recommend an acceptable confidence interval, the laboratory can see how many replicates are required.</p>
      <p>Such an estimated number of replicates required only applies to an &#x201C;average&#x201D; patient in the population. The size of the signal may vary between patients. For example, one patient may have a particularly critical dependency on AV setting and another a below-average amount of dependency. The former would need fewer replicates to identify the optimum within a given size of confidence interval, and the later would need more. Similarly, one patient may have more noise for one of many reasons, including deeper respiration due to acute physiological distress; chronic lung disease that enhances ventilatory fluctuation in haemodynamics; obesity impairing image quality; agitation impairing probe position maintenance. This would necessitate more replicates.</p>
      <p>But whilst individual patients may have different strict needs for replication, all patients will need more replicates if the optimization technique has poor information content. Any protocol document (which specifies and optimization technique) to be credible must at least give quantitatively sound guidance as to the number of replicates needed for an average patient to obtain optimization with a level of precision widely considered reasonable. If a protocol does not give such guidance, clinical time pressures may lead to all patients having optimizations that are, on average, worthless (helping half slightly and harming half slightly).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec26">
      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Information content, the proportion of the observed differences in the measurements at different settings that is genuinely due to the change in settings, has an overwhelmingly important impact on the meaningfulness of the pacemaker optimization processes. Although easy to measure, it is rarely reported or commented on, and may be surprisingly low unless steps are taken to improve it.</p>
      <p>Low information content leads to frequent misidentification of the optimum. However, worse than this, it inflates the apparent benefit of optimization: counter-intuitively, the worse the optimization method, the better it will superficially appear (unless one asks about information content).</p>
      <p>Worst of all, because low information content makes apparent optima more variable, the poorer the optimization method, the more frequently one will feel compelled to re-optimize the patient (unless we ask about information content).</p>
      <p>Information content is easy to improve for any technique. All that is needed is (a) to use a technique where the underlying difference between settings is as large as possible, (b) to use a technique with beat-to-beat variability as small as possible and (c) to make multiple measurements at each setting and calculate the average.</p>
      <p>If, despite these steps, information content is still low, clinical resources could be saved by selecting a setting arbitrarily or even at random, with no additional loss to the patient&#x2019;s physiology. We do not make this suggestion for fun but to point out the seriousness of the present situation. Optimization is not optimization when it is roulette.</p>
