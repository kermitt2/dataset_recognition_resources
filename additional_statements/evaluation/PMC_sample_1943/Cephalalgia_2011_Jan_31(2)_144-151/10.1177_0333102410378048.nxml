        <p><italic>Background</italic>: Menstrually related migraine (MRM) affects more than
                    half of female migraineurs. Because such migraines are often predictable, they
                    provide a suitable target for treatment in the mild pain phase. The present
                    study was designed to provide prospective data on the efficacy of almotriptan
                    for treatment of MRM.</p>
        <p><italic>Methods</italic>: Premenopausal women with MRM were randomized to
                    almotriptan (<italic>N</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;74) or placebo
                        (<italic>N</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;73), taken at onset of the
                    first perimenstrual migraine. Patients crossed over to the other treatment for
                    the first perimenstrual migraine of their second cycle, followed by a two-month
                    open-label almotriptan treatment period.</p>
        <p><italic>Results</italic>: Significantly more patients were pain-free at two hours
                    (risk ratio [RR]&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.81;
                        <italic>p&#x2009;=&#x2009;</italic>.0008), pain-free from
                    2&#x2013;24 hours with no rescue medication (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.99;
                        <italic>p&#x2009;=&#x2009;</italic>.0022), and pain-free from
                    2&#x2013;24 hours with no rescue medication or adverse events
                    (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.94;
                        <italic>p&#x2009;=&#x2009;</italic>.0061) with almotriptan versus
                    placebo. Nausea (<italic>p&#x2009;=&#x2009;</italic>.0007) and
                    photophobia (<italic>p&#x2009;=&#x2009;</italic>.0083) at
                    two&#x2009;hours were significantly less frequent with almotriptan. Almotriptan
                    efficacy was consistent between three attacks, with 56.2% of patients
                    pain-free at two hours at least twice. Adverse events were similar with
                    almotriptan and placebo.</p>
        <p><italic>Conclusion</italic>: Almotriptan was significantly more effective than
                    placebo in women with MRM attacks, with consistent efficacy in longer-term
                    follow-up.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Menstrually related migraine (MRM) affects &gt;50% of female
                migraineurs, with &lt;10% having migraines exclusively in the
                perimenstrual period (PMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102410378048">1</xref>). The pathophysiology of MRM appears to involve an abnormal
                neurotransmitter and neurohormonal response, or abnormal release of prostaglandins
                triggered by the cyclical drop of estrogen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102410378048">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102410378048">3</xref>). Neurobiological research suggests that
                activated central sensory neurons may gradually become sensitized, leading to
                progression of pain and increasing sensitivity to extracranial stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102410378048">4</xref>). These findings provide a
                pathophysiological rationale for treatment at the first sign of pain; as MRM is
                often predictable, it is an excellent target for strategies initiated during the
                mild pain phase.</p>
      <p>Women with MRM may benefit from short-term prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102410378048">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102410378048">6</xref>), but the condition is characterized by a
                relatively low attack frequency. There is, therefore, a clear need for effective
                acute treatment over and above the benefits of short-term preventive treatment. The
                selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D receptor agonists (triptans) are generally the
                most effective agents available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102410378048">7</xref>) and may therefore be preferable for MRM in view of its
                difficult-to-treat nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102410378048">1</xref>).</p>
      <p>In a retrospective analysis of data from women with MRM from a randomized,
                comparative study of almotriptan versus zolmitriptan for acute treatment of
                migraine, almotriptan was effective and well tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102410378048">8</xref>), while a post-hoc analysis of the
                placebo-controlled AXERT Early Migraine Intervention Study (AEGIS) study showed that
                almotriptan was similarly effective in MRM and non-MRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102410378048">9</xref>). To provide prospective data on
                almotriptan in MRM, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
                trial.</p>

        <title>Objectives</title>
        <p>The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of almotriptan over
                    placebo in the percentage of patients free of pain two hours after drug intake
                    during an MRM attack. Secondary objectives were to investigate the efficacy and
                    tolerability of almotriptan versus placebo in women with MRM, and the
                    consistency of treatment with almotriptan during open-label follow-up.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec4-0333102410378048">
        <title>Study design</title>
        <p>The study (EudraCT: 2005-000244-90) was a two-month, multicenter, randomized,
                    double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial followed by a two-month active
                    treatment open-label follow-up evaluation to assess consistency. The study was
                    performed in the neurology, headache or gynecology departments at seven
                    hospitals in Italy, in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. The protocol was
                    approved by the ethics committees of all participating centers and written
                    informed consent was obtained from each patient.</p>
        <p>Patients enrolled in the study attended the clinic for five study visits,
                    including the screening assessment. Each visit other than the screening visit
                    took place two to six days after each migraine attack recorded in the study. At
                    each visit patients recorded migraine pain intensity, adverse events and
                    concomitant medications in a diary. </p>
        <p>Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive double-blind oral almotriptan malate or
                    identical, matching placebo. Patients were assigned a randomization number in
                    ascending order by the Statistics Group within Almirall SA., according to the
                    relevant standard operating procedure. The randomization list was
                    computer-generated, and randomization data were kept strictly confidential,
                    accessible only by authorized persons. Data were unblinded only when the trial
                    was completed and the data verified and locked. The success of blinding was not
                    formally evaluated during the study.</p>
        <p>Study medication was self-administered at the onset of the first migraine attack
                    occurring during the PMP (defined as day &#x2212;2 to +3 of the
                    menstrual cycle). Participants took one 12.5&#x2009;mg tablet, preferably in
                    the first hour after pain onset or, if possible, when the pain was still of mild
                    intensity, and not more than two hours after pain onset. Patients then crossed
                    over to the other double-blind treatment (almotriptan or placebo) for the first
                    migraine in the PMP of their second menstrual cycle. Two boxes (one box for the
                    first menstrual migraine attack of one menstrual cycle and the other for the
                    first menstrual migraine attack occurring in the subsequent menstrual cycle) per
                    patient were provided, each containing two tablets of study medication or
                    placebo in sealed blisters. One tablet was to be used for the treatment of the
                    attack, with the other to be used only in case of recurrence. In the open-label
                    phase, all patients received almotriptan for the first PMP migraine in their
                    third and fourth menstrual cycles. </p>

                    International Headache Society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102410378048">10</xref>). Patients were required to have
                    regular menstrual cycles, with at least a one-year history of migraine and a
                    six-month history of regularly occurring MRM (migraine attacks without aura,
                    occurring on days &#x2212;2 to +3 of menstruation in at least two of
                    three menstrual cycles, with or without additional attacks at other times of the
                    cycle). Participants were required to be in good general health, and women of
                    childbearing potential were required to use an adequate form of contraception.
                    Key exclusion criteria included: any other type of headache that would confound
                    diagnosis of MRM; migraine headaches that did not typically have a mild pain
                    phase, that were typically associated with vomiting, or hemiplegic or basilar
                    migraines; chronic daily headache (&#x2265;15 headache days per month for the
                    previous six months) or &#x2265;6 migraines per month for the previous three
                    months; use of more than one medication (for any reason) known to be effective
                    in migraine prophylaxis; use of sustained-release opioids, or semisynthetic or
                    long-acting opioids, within seven days before study entry; use of systemic or
                    injectable corticosteroids within 30 days before study entry; previous overuse
                    (&gt;2 days per week) of analgesics, benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics,
                    antiemetics, triptans, opioids or ergotamine-type medications; significant
                    unstable medical disease or a history of a significant mental disorder; or a
                    current or recent history, or suspected history, of substance dependence or
                    abuse. Lactating women were also excluded from the study.</p>
        <p>At baseline, patients were also required to provide a verifiable diary of their

        <title>Assessments</title>
        <p>Headache pain intensity was rated by patients on a 4-point scale:
                    (0&#x2009;=&#x2009;no headache pain; 1&#x2009;=&#x2009;mild
                    headache pain, allowing normal activity; 2&#x2009;=&#x2009;moderate
                    headache pain, disturbing but not prohibiting normal activity, bed rest is

                    has to be discontinued, bed rest may be necessary). Migraine-associated symptoms
                    (nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, photophobia, osmophobia), migraine duration and
                    use of rescue medication were recorded throughout the study. Rescue medications
                    included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and paracetamol, and other agents
                    that investigators considered to be appropriate for each patient at their
                    center. Triptans and ergotamine-containing drugs were not permitted as rescue
                    medication. Tolerability was assessed in terms of adverse events, physical
                    examinations and vital signs. </p>

        <title>Endpoints and analysis</title>
        <p>According to sample size calculations, 130 evaluable patients were required to
                    demonstrate superiority of almotriptan over placebo, and thus it was planned to
                    screen and randomize 160 patients to account for an estimated 20% of
                    withdrawals after randomization. A sample size of 130 patients (pairs of
                    observations) achieves 90% power to detect an odds ratio (OR) of 2.00
                    using a two-sided McNemar test with a significance level of 0.05 and the
                    proportion of patients free of pain at two hours as primary endpoint. The OR is
                    equivalent to a difference between two paired proportions of 0.250, which occurs
                    when the proportion of patients responding to almotriptan and not to placebo is
                    0.500 and the proportion of patients responding to placebo and not to
                    almotriptan is 0.250. The proportion of discordant pairs is 0.750.</p>
        <p>The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients free of pain at two hours
                    after drug intake. Secondary endpoints included percentage of patients pain-free
                    at time points from 0.25 to 24 hours after drug intake; percentage of patients
                    being sustained pain-free (SPF; defined as pain-free from 2 to 24 hours with no
                    rescue medication use); percentage of patients being SPF with no adverse events
                    (SNAE); rate of recurrence (defined as onset of a new attack within 24 hours of
                    successful drug treatment of the first migraine attack); percentage of patients
                    with rescue medication intake; evolution of migraine-associated symptoms
                    (percentage of patients with nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, photophobia or
                    osmophobia 0.25&#x2013;24 hours after study drug intake). </p>
        <p>The evaluation of primary endpoint and all the secondary endpoints, with the
                    exception of &#x201C;duration of migraine attack&#x201D;, was performed by
                    means of a generalized linear model implemented with binomial distribution,
                    log-link function and generalized estimating equations. The model effects were
                    treatment sequence (almotriptan&#x2013;placebo or placebo&#x2013;almotriptan),
                    treatment (almotriptan or placebo) and the period (first and second). As this
                    was a crossover study, a compound symmetry variance&#x2013;covariance matrix
                    was employed to account for clustered data (repeated measures). </p>
        <p>Results were reported as RRs with the associated 95% confidence interval
                    (CI) and two-tailed <italic>p</italic> values. The primary efficacy population
                    was the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, defined as all patients who
                    received at least one dose of study medication and for whom data on the primary
                    endpoint were available (i.e. double-blind phase completers). A per-protocol
                    analysis, from which patients with major protocol violations were excluded, was
                    also performed. The safety population included all patients who received at
                    least one dose of study medication. A post-hoc analysis was conducted to assess
                    the efficacy of almotriptan in comparison with placebo in the subgroups of
                    patients with pain of moderate/severe (intensity
                    score&#x2009;=&#x2009;2&#x2212;3) or mild (intensity

                    almotriptan, compared with 17.2% while receiving placebo
                        (<italic>p&#x2009;=&#x2009;</italic>.0022); the result was also
                    statistically significant in the moderate/severe subgroup (29.1% vs.
                    15.6%; <italic>p&#x2009;=&#x2009;</italic>.0268) but failed to
                    achieve significance in the mild subgroup (52.8% vs. 21.9%;

                    associated with a significantly higher percentage of patients classed as SNAE
                    compared with placebo (33.6% vs. 16.4%;

                    During the two menstrual cycles of the open-label follow-up period, the

                    almotriptan in terms of percentage of patients pain-free at two hours, SPF, and
                    SNAE was highly consistent between the three attacks recorded in the study.
                    Overall, 59 of 105 patients (56.2%) responded to treatment in at least

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study,
                the superiority of almotriptan over placebo for MRM attacks was demonstrated by the
                statistically significantly higher percentage of patients who were pain-free at two
                hours after medication intake. This superiority was also observed in patients with
                mild pain at headache onset; the study was not powered to detect a difference in
                patients with moderate/severe pain. In the open-label follow-up phase (two further
                migraine attacks), the percentage of pain-free patients at two hours with
                almotriptan was maintained or even increased. Results for secondary
                endpoints&#x2014;including percentage of pain-free patients over time, sustained
                freedom from pain with or without adverse events, use of rescue medication and
                occurrence of migraine symptoms&#x2014;confirmed the efficacy of almotriptan in the
                overall patient population. Results in the post-hoc analyses of the mild and
                moderate/severe subgroups also showed a benefit for almotriptan, although some
                results did not achieve statistical significance. It should be noted, however, that
                the study was not powered to detect differences between almotriptan and placebo in
                the post-hoc analyses.</p>
      <p>The results of the present study are highly consistent with those from a previous
                retrospective analysis of almotriptan in women with MRM, in which 44.9% of
                patients receiving almotriptan were pain-free at two hours after medication intake
                (48.4% in the present study), with a recurrence rate of 32.8%
                (28.8% in the present study) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102410378048">8</xref>). The results are also similar to those of
                a post-hoc analysis of the randomized, placebo-controlled AEGIS study, in which
                35.4% of patients with MRM and 35.9% of those with non-MRM were
                pain-free at two hours post-medication, and 22.9% and 23.8%,
                respectively, were SPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102410378048">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the present study, the safety and tolerability evaluations showed a similar
                profile for almotriptan and placebo, as has previously been observed both in women
                with MRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102410378048">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102410378048">9</xref>) and in more general
                migraine populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102410378048">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102410378048">12</xref>). </p>
      <p>The main strengths of the present study are the randomized, double-blind design and
                the adequate sample size for the primary analysis, although there were insufficient
                patients to draw definite conclusions in the post-hoc analysis of mild and
                moderate/severe subgroups. The patient population was sufficiently broad to allow
                generalization of the results to the wider population of women with MRM, with only
                those with very frequent or complicated (e.g. hemiplegic or basilar) migraine
                excluded. One possible limitation of the study is the analysis of treatment
                consistency, for which a more individual intrapatient assessment may have been
                preferred. The present results do show, however, that 56% of patients can be
                expected to respond to almotriptan for at least two of three migraine attacks.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the results of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study
                demonstrated the efficacy of almotriptan in ameliorating the symptoms of migraine
                and confirmed its superiority over placebo in women with MRM attacks, which are
                usually found to be of longer duration and less responsive to acute treatment than
                nonmenstrual attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102410378048">13</xref>). Data from the open-label follow-up phase corroborate those of the
                double-blind phase and show the consistency of effect with almotriptan. Almotriptan
                was well tolerated throughout the study, with an incidence of adverse events similar
                to placebo. In light of its efficacy and tolerability profile, almotriptan can be
                considered a first-choice acute treatment for women with MRM, particularly if given
                during the mild pain phase of migraines.</p>
