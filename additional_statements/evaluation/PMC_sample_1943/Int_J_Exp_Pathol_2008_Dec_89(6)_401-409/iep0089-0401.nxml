      <abstract>
        <p>We transplanted undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells into the spleens of carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-treated mice to determine their effects on liver fibrosis. Carbon tetrachloride at 0.5 ml/kg of body weight was injected intraperitoneally into C57BL/6 mice twice weekly for up to 20 weeks. Four weeks after the first injection, the mice were divided into two groups and those in group 1 received 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> ES cells genetically labelled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the spleens, while group 2 mice received 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. In group 1, GFP-immunopositive cells were retained and found in areas of fibrosis in the liver, and reduced liver fibrosis was observed as compared with group 2. Secondary transplantation of ES cells at 12 weeks after the initial transplantation enhanced the reduction in liver fibrosis. No teratoma formation or uncontrolled growth of ES cells in organs, including the liver and spleen, was observed in any of the mice. In the livers of group 1 mice, metalloproteinase 9-immunopositive cells derived from ES cells as well as those from the recipient were observed. These cells were also found to be immunopositive for the hepatoblast marker Delta-like (DlK-1), a member of the DlK-1 family of transmembrane proteins. These results suggest that ES-based cell therapy is potentially useful for liver fibrosis treatment and that reduction in CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver fibrosis by transplantation of ES cells may be related closely to the emergence of metalloproteinase-producing hepatoblast-like cells.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Liver cirrhosis is one of the most representative forms of liver fibrosis and represents a serious health problem. Recently, transplantation of bone marrow-derived cells including mesenchymal stem cells was reported to reduce carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Fang <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Sakaida <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Wu <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Oyagi <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), while foetal liver epithelial progenitor cells have also been shown to ameliorate diethylnitrosamine-induced liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Thus, transplantation of cells carrying the characteristics of stem cells or progenitor cells seems to improve liver fibrosis.</p>
    <p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are self-renewing and pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell masses of preimplantation blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Evans &amp; Kaufman 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Martin 1981</xref>), and are considered to be an optimal source for cell-replacement therapy, because of their limitless growth and pluripotent differentiation capacity. We previously reported the differentiation of mouse ES cells into dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Nishimura <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), rhodopsin-immunopositive photoreceptor-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Sugie <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), insulin-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Shiroi <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), enteric smooth muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Yamada <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) and hepatocyte-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Ishizaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) <italic>in vitro</italic>. Further, we recently found that ES cells developed into hepatocyte-like cells after intrasplenic transplantation in mice that received short-term treatment with CCl<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Moriya <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). In that study, it was also shown that intrasplenic transplantation of ES cells reduced fibrosis of the liver at the end of the 4-week period of CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment.</p>
    <p>In this study, we transplanted ES cells genetically labelled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the spleens of mice under long-term treatment with CCl<sub>4</sub> to examine their potential efficacy toward liver fibrosis. Green fluorescent protein-immunopositive cells were consistently found in the areas of fibrosis in the mouse livers and liver fibrosis was reduced in mice that received ES cells, as compared with those that received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A second intrasplenic transplantation of ES cells at 12 weeks after the initial transplantation enhanced the improvement of liver fibrosis. Further, metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)-immunopositive cells derived from ES cells were found in the livers of group 1 mice, as well as those derived from the recipients themselves, which were immunopositive for DlK-1, a hepatoblast marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Tanimizu <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). These results suggest the potential usefulness of ES-based cell therapy for liver fibrosis and that improvement of CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver fibrosis by transplantation of ES cells may be due to the emergence of metalloproteinase-producing hepatoblast-like cells.</p>

        <title>Murine ES cell line</title>
        <p>We utilized G4-2 cells from a mouse ES cell line (129/SvJ mouse ES cells, a kind gift from Dr Hitoshi Niwa, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe, Japan), which carry an enhanced GFP gene under the control of the CAG expression unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Niwa <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). For this study, undifferentiated G4-2 cells were maintained on gelatin-coated dishes without feeder cells in Dulbecco&#x2019;s modified Eagle&#x2019;s medium (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO/BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 10 mM non-essential amino acids (GIBCO/BRL), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma) and 1400 U/ml of leukaemia inhibitory factor (GIBCO/BRL). The G4-2 cells carried the blasticidin S-resistant selection marker gene driven by the Oct-3/4 promoter (active under undifferentiated status) and were occasionally cultured in medium containing 10 &#x3BC;g/ml blasticidin S to eliminate differentiated cells.</p>

        <p>Culture dishes (9 cm in diameter) were used to maintain the undifferentiated ES colonies, then washed with 8 ml of ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) thrice and treated with 1.0 ml of 0.025% trypsin/PBS for 2 min at 37 &#xB0;C. Five millilitres of ES maintenance medium containing 10% FBS was added to each dish to stop trypsin activity. Single cell solutions were easily obtained by repeated pipetting. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS thrice and finally prepared for transplantation in a PBS solution at a cell concentration of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup>/ml.</p>
        <p>Green fluorescent protein-positive undifferentiated ES cells at 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> (0.1 ml of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup>/ml solution) were transplanted into the spleen, using an intrasplenic transplantation procedure previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Moriya <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Briefly, a 1-cm incision was made on the left flank and the spleen was extracted through the incision. Then, 0.1 ml of the graft cell solution (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) was slowly infused into the inferior pole of the spleen using a 31-gauge needle and a Hamilton syringe. Once the infusion was complete, the syringe was left in place for 1 min.</p>

        <title>Grouping of animals and outline of experiments</title>
        <p>Female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan) at 6 weeks of age and used as experimental animals. All procedures including the surgical steps were performed in accordance with the Guidelines of Nara Medical University for experiments involving animals and recombinant DNA.</p>
        <p>In experiment 1, 56 mice received CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment for 4 weeks, after which four were killed and fibrosis of the livers was examined, with that day was designated as day 0. The remaining 52 were divided into group 1 (<italic>n</italic>= 28) and group 2 (<italic>n</italic>= 24). Group 1 mice received transplantation of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> graft cells (0.1 ml of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup>/ml solution) on day 0, while group 2 mice were injected with 0.1 ml of PBS, instead of graft cells. Mice in both groups were treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> twice a week consecutively. Liver sampling was performed after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks (W1, W2, W4, W8 and W12 respectively) using four mice from each group, as well as on day 1 using group 1 mice only.</p>
        <p>In experiment 2, the remaining four mice in group 1 received a second transplantation of graft cells into the spleen at W12, while those in group 2 received 0.1 ml of PBS, then both groups continued to receive treatment with CCl<sub>4</sub> for an additional 4 weeks.

        <p>Transplantation was performed after pretreatment with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 4 weeks. GFP-immunopositivity in the liver specimens was examined on day 1, as well as at W1, W2, W4, W8 and W12 in the group 1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). There were a number of GFP-immunopositive cells in the livers of group 1 mice on day 1. Thereafter, although the numbers of those cells decreased, they remained in the livers throughout the duration of the experiment. The distribution of immunoreactivity against GFP was observed predominantly in the periportal regions of the hepatic lobules.</p>

        <title>Decreased fibrosis following ES transplantation</title>
        <p>Liver fibrosis was evaluated histologically using picro-Sirius red and Mallory-azan staining. Pretreatment with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 4 weeks caused considerable liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3a</xref>, top).

        <title>Expression of MMP9 on hepatoblast-like cells in the livers</title>
        <p>To explore the mechanism of fibrolysis, we examined the expression of MMP9 immunohistochemically using liver specimens from group 1 mice taken at W12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5a&#x2013;c</xref>). As expected, the transplanted cells expressed MMP9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5a&#x2013;c</xref>, arrows). Further, there were some cells immunopositive for MMP9 that were not immunopositive for GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5a&#x2013;c</xref>, arrowheads), indicating that they had originated from the recipient mice. Our results suggest that not only transplanted ES-derived cells, but also endogenous fibrolysis activities contributed to improved liver fibrosis. Although MMP9 is known to be expressed in alveolar macrophages in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5d,h</xref>), no expression of F4/80, a marker of macrophages, was found in GFP-immunopositive cells in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5e&#x2013;g</xref> arrows). There were some cells immunopositive for F4/80 in the liver, although they were not immunopositive for GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5e&#x2013;g</xref> arrowheads).</p>

        <title>Liver fibrosis improved by secondary ES cell transplantation</title>
        <p>At W12, the remaining four mice in group 1 received a second transplantation of ES cells into the spleen, while those in group 2 received 0.1 ml of PBS, after which mice in both groups were subjected to an additional 4 weeks of treatment with CCl<sub>4</sub>. However, all mice in group 2 died no later than W15 and exhibited ascites before death, leading us to conclude that the cause of death was liver failure. The livers were isolated within 8 h after death and histology findings for group 1 mice at 4 weeks after the second transplantation (W16) showed reduced fibrosis as compared with W12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6a</xref>), which was determined quantitatively by image analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6b</xref>). In group 2, histological findings of the liver showed advanced fibrosis with lipid accumulation, although there was no significant difference between W12 and W16.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Recently, transplantation of bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Sakaida <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), bone marrow stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Wu <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Fang <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Oyagi <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) and foetal liver progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) has been reported to reduce liver fibrosis. However, the effect of ES cells on liver fibrosis has not been reported. We previously reported that ES cells transplanted into the spleens of CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated mice migrated to the liver and differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Moriya <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). In that study, we also noted the possibility that ES cells might reduce fibrosis of the liver, although the total experimental period was only 5 weeks, which consisted of a 1-week pretreatment with CCl<sub>4</sub> before intrasplenic transplantation of ES cells and then an additional 4 weeks of treatment. In this study, we conducted a long-term experiment to examine the effects of ES cell transplantation on liver fibrosis. Mice were pretreated with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 4 weeks to produce considerable liver fibrosis prior to transplantation, then fibrosis was observed histochemically for up to 16 weeks after the initial transplantation.</p>
      <p>As expected, obvious fibrosis was induced in the livers by pretreatment with CCl<sub>4</sub>. First, we determined whether the transplanted ES cells migrated to and were retained in the liver for a sustained period, because we noted only few grafted cells at 30 days after transplantation in mouse livers in a previous experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Moriya <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). In this study, we found a considerable number of transplanted cells in the liver even at W12. These contrasting results were probably because of the length of the CCl<sub>4</sub> pretreatment protocol, which consisted of two intraperitoneal injections over 1 week in the previous study, whereas we gave eight injections of CCl<sub>4</sub> over a 4-week period in this study. We considered that a more favourable microenvironment might be induced in the liver by the present repeated CCl<sub>4</sub> administration, under which ES cells were able to migrate to and reside in the liver. Recently, the CXCR4/SDF1 system has been suggested to be involved in the migration of bone marrow cells to inflamed organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Dalakas <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), including CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Kollet <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Jung <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Son <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Although the involvement of the CXCR4/SDF1 axis in hepatic migration of ES cells transplanted into the spleen is unknown, we noted a much higher level of SDF1 expression immunohistochemically in the livers of mice pretreated with CCl<sub>4</sub> for 4 weeks as compared with those pretreated for 1 week (data not shown).</p>
      <p>These results demonstrated that transplantation of ES cells improves liver fibrosis, while immunohistochemistry findings also revealed GFP-immunopositive cells in locations neighbouring areas of fibrosis at all observation time-points. Bone marrow cells and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells have been reported to migrate to fibrosis areas of the liver and show activities of matrix metalloproteinases after transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Kollet <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Sakaida <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Higashiyama <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). It is conceivable that ES cells elicit fibrolysis activity similar to that of bone marrow cells. As expected, ES-derived cells in the present livers were immunopositive for MMP9, some of which were negative for GFP. These findings suggest that the improvement in liver fibrosis after transplantation of ES cells was a result of fibrolysis activities by both ES-derived and recipient-derived cells. Next, we attempted to identify the nature of the MMP9-immunopositive cells. As the GFP-immunopositive cells were negative for F4/80, we considered that the ES-derived MMP9-immunopositive cells were also negative for F4/80. Interestingly, MMP9-immunopositive cells, irrespective of their origin from ES cells or the recipient, were immunopositive for DlK-1, a hepatoblast marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Tanimizu <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), suggesting that hepatoblast-like cells play an important role in the regression of liver fibrosis. Investigation of the pathophysiology of the generation of MMP9-expressing hepatoblast-like cells from ES cells and liver resident cells in CCl<sub>4</sub>-injured livers may lead to discovery of a new treatment approach for liver fibrosis.</p>
      <p>We performed a second transplantation of ES cells at W12, which led to an additive effect for improved fibrosis seen at W16. All four mice in group 1 that received ES cell transplantation twice, day 0 and W12, survived to the final observation point at W16. However, none of the mice that received PBS instead of ES cells at the same time-points survived to W16, but rather showed accumulated ascites, leading us to conclude that the cause of death was liver failure. Thus, these findings suggest the potential usefulness of ES cell transplantation to treat liver cirrhosis.</p>
      <p>Recently, a novel trial of intravenous transplantion of autologous bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) in patients with liver cirrhosis reported improved serum albumin and total protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Terai <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). In contrast to that method, the present ES cells used as grafts and host mice were an allogeneic combination, as the cells were derived from 129SvJ mice and transplanted into C57BL/6 mice. In the future, it is considered that human ES cells used in therapeutic strategies will likely be allogeneic to the host, except in cases where ES cells are produced with a nuclear transfer technique using nuclei from the host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Lavoir <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref> or by introducing four recently identified genes into host somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Yu <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Although a high incidence of teratomas in livers was reported following syngeneic transplantation of undifferentiated ES cells and differentiating EBs into C57BL/6 mice receiving CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Chinzei <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Yamamoto <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), we found no tumours in the livers of mice that received undifferentiated allogeneic ES cells during the 16-week experimental period.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results showed that undifferentiated ES cells grafted into the spleen migrated to the liver and reduced liver fibrosis in mice chronically treated with CCl<sub>4</sub>. For the coming era of controlled cell growth, ES cells are a promising cell source for treatment of liver cirrhosis.</p>
