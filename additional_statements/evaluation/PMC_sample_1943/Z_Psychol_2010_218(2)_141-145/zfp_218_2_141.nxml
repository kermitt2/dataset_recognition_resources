    <p>Distressing and intrusive
                reexperiencing of the trauma is a hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder
                (PTSD; <xref id="cr1-1" rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association,
                    1994</xref>). However, unwanted memories of trauma are not a sign
                of pathology per se. In the initial weeks after a traumatic experience, intrusive
                memories are common. For most trauma survivors, intrusions become less frequent and
                distressing over time. A central question for understanding and treating patients
                with PTSD is therefore what <italic>maintains</italic> distressing intrusive
                reexperiencing in these people. Three factors appear to be important: (1) memory
                processes responsible for the easy triggering of intrusive memories, (2) the
                individuals’ interpretations of their trauma memories, and (3) their
                cognitive and behavioral responses to trauma memories.</p>
    <sec id="S-2">
      <title>Characteristics of Reexperiencing in PTSD</title>
      <p>Clues about the memory processes
                underlying reexperiencing symptoms in PTSD can be drawn from their phenomenological
                characteristics. Note that unlike the convention in DSM-IV (<xref id="cr1-2" rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>),
                which classifies ruminative thoughts about the trauma such as “Why did it
                happen to me” or “If only I had …” as a
                part of reexperiencing, the author distinguishes between intrusive memories and
                rumination about the trauma (<xref id="cr7-1" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp;
                    Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref id="cr14-1" rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers
                    &amp; Steil, 1995</xref>). Evidence is accumulating that these
                cognitions are phenomenologically and functionally distinct (e.g.,
                    <xref id="cr17-1" rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Evans, Ehlers, Mezey, &amp; Clark,
                    2007b</xref>; <xref id="cr41-1" rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Speckens,
                    Ehlers, Hackmann, Ruths, &amp; Clark, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Systematic comparisons of
                    <italic>intrusive trauma memories</italic> in people with and without PTSD
                pointed to many important similarities. The intrusions most commonly take the form
                of relatively brief, vivid sensory impressions such as images, sounds, body
                sensations, tastes, or smells (e.g., <xref id="cr11-1" rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers
                    et al., 2002</xref>; <xref id="cr29-1" rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Michael, Ehlers, &amp; Halligan, 2005a</xref>). Yet, there are
                also a number of differences between the intrusions in people with and without PTSD.
                These have been shown to predict chronic PTSD, over and above what can be predicted
                from the frequency of early intrusions, and shown to change with successful therapy
                    (<xref id="cr21-1" rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Hackmann, Ehlers, Speckens, &amp;
                    Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref id="cr30-1" rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Michael, Ehlers, Halligan, &amp; Clark, 2005b</xref>;
                    <xref id="cr40-1" rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">Speckens, Ehlers, Hackmann, &amp;
                    Clark, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>(1) <italic>Nowness</italic>: Trauma
                survivors with PTSD describe to a greater extent that their intrusive memories
                appear to happen in the <italic>here and now</italic> than those without PTSD
                    (<xref id="cr30-2" rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Michael et al.,
                    2005b</xref>). Most dramatically, in a posttraumatic flashback
                people lose all contact with current reality and respond as if the trauma was
                happening at that moment (see, e.g., <xref id="cr10-1" rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers, Hackmann, &amp; Michael, 2004</xref>). To a lesser
                degree, this sense of nowness is also characteristic of other intrusive trauma
                memories in PTSD (<xref id="cr30-3" rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Michael et al.,
                    2005b</xref>). Furthermore, people with PTSD may also show
                    <italic>affect without recollection</italic> (<xref id="cr7-2" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>), that is, emotions
                and behavior from the trauma <italic>without</italic> having a conscious memory of
                the trauma (e.g., collapsing in a fetal position when seeing someone who resembles
                the assailant). Thus, some of the reexperiencing symptoms lack the autonoetic
                awareness which is a defining feature of episodic memories (<xref id="cr44-1" rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Tulving, 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>(2) <italic>Lack of context</italic>:
                Intrusive memories in PTSD lack contextual information and appear
                    <italic>disjointed</italic> from other relevant autobiographical information
                    (<xref id="cr10-2" rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al.,
                    2004</xref>; <xref id="cr30-4" rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Michael et
                    al., 2005b</xref>). People with PTSD keep reexperiencing moments of
                the trauma and the corresponding emotions (e.g., when they believed they would never
                see their children again), even if they know the predicted outcome did not occur.
                Thus, during intrusive trauma memories, people with PTSD have difficulties
                retrieving other information that corrected their original impressions and
                predictions during these moments or their meanings.</p>
      <p>(3) <italic>Ease of triggering by
                    matching cues</italic>: In PTSD, a wide range of situations can trigger
                intrusive memories, including those that do not have an obvious meaningful
                connection with the trauma and those that the individual does not recognize as
                triggers. This has the effect that intrusions may appear to come “out of
                the blue.” Closer analysis of these situations shows that triggers often
                have <italic>sensory</italic> similarities with stimuli present shortly before or
                during the trauma (e.g., similar color, shape, smell, or body sensation;
                    <xref id="cr11-2" rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al.,
                2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>(4) <italic>Distress</italic>: Trauma
                survivors with PTSD describe their intrusive memories as more distressing than those
                without PTSD (e.g., <xref id="cr30-5" rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Michael et al.,
                    2005b</xref>).</p>

      <title>What Is Reexperienced?</title>
      <p>Many things happen during a traumatic
                event. What determines what is later reexperienced? Patients with PTSD
                reported in systematic interviews that they reexperienced brief moments from the
                trauma such as “hearing footsteps behind me” or
                “seeing the perpetrator stand before me with a knife”
                    (<xref id="cr11-3" rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al.,
                    2002</xref>). Further analysis of these intrusions indicated that
                they represented sensory impressions that signaled the onset of the trauma or the
                onset of its worst moments. <xref id="cr11-4" rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al.
                    (2002)</xref> therefore suggested that the intrusions had
                functional significance in that they represented stimuli that predicted the worst
                moments of trauma and had thus acquired the status of warning signals, consistent
                with modern associative learning models that highlight the information value of
                conditioned stimuli (CS) in predicting the unconditioned stimuli (UCS)
                    (<xref id="cr34-1" rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Rescorla, 1988</xref>).
                Thus, in Pavlovian conditioning terms, it appears that people with PTSD reexperience
                the CS rather than the UCS after trauma. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from
                studies of PTSD patients and violent offenders who had intrusive memories of their
                crime (<xref id="cr16-1" rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Evans, Ehlers, Mezey, &amp;
                    Clark, 2007a</xref>; <xref id="cr21-2" rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Hackmann et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p><xref id="cr11-5" rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al.’s
                    (2002)</xref> emphasis that the sensory impressions that are later
                reexperienced <italic>preceded</italic> the trauma or its worst moments has been
                interpreted by some authors (e.g., <xref id="cr3-1" rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen
                    &amp; Rubin, 2008</xref>) as meaning that they needed to be
                    <italic>finished</italic> before trauma onset (Possibility A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>
                ). However, consistent with what is known about
                CS in Pavlovian conditioning (<xref id="cr34-2" rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Rescorla,
                    1988</xref>), the hypothesis concerns sensory impressions that
                    <italic>started</italic> just before the worst moment and thus had
                    <italic>predictive</italic> information value. They may well have still been
                present during the worst moment (this includes possibilities B to D in
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).
                Furthermore, it is important to note that the worst moments of the trauma are
                defined <italic>subjectively</italic> in <xref id="cr11-6" rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al. (2002)</xref>, from the perspective of the
                individual with PTSD, not from the perspective of what other people may find most
                distressing. Furthermore, it is important to note that in prolonged trauma, there
                are usually several moments when the meaning of the event changed for the worse, and
                each of them may be represented in reexperiencing.</p>

                suggested that reexperiencing and the ease with which it is triggered in PTSD can be
                explained by a combination of three memory processes, namely strong perceptual
                priming, strong associative learning, and poor memory elaboration (binding with
                other information in autobiographical memory). Experimental evidence for the role of
                each of these processes in reexperiencing is emerging (e.g., priming:

      <p>The description of phenomenological

                    <xref id="cr7-4" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and Clark
                    (2000)</xref> has been interpreted by some theorists
                    (<xref id="cr2-1" rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>) as
                an argument for <italic>special mechanisms</italic> that are unique to trauma
                memories. This is incorrect. The <xref id="cr7-5" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and
                    Clark (2000)</xref> model proposes that the phenomenology of
                reexperiencing can be explained by the above three basic memory processes. One
                important difference between the <xref id="cr7-6" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and
                    Clark (2000)</xref> model and other approaches that aim to explain
                involuntary memories of trauma by general memory mechanisms (<xref id="cr2-2" rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>; <xref id="cr36-1" rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Rubin, Boals, &amp; Berntsen,
                2008</xref>) is the range of memory phenomena under consideration.
                Whereas <xref id="cr7-7" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and Clark’s
                    (2000)</xref> model was developed to explain the full range of
                intrusive reexperiencing in PTSD, including those that lack autonoetic awareness,
                    <xref id="cr2-3" rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen (2009)</xref> and
                    <xref id="cr36-2" rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et al. (2008)</xref>
                only include the involuntary retrieval of memory content that is recognized by the
                individual as a trauma memory. <xref id="cr2-4" rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen
                    (2009)</xref> explicitly excludes involuntary auditory and visual
                imagery that is not deemed autobiographical and “phenomena in which the
                involuntary mental contents overrule reality more or less completely” (p.
                15). Thus, many of the phenomena that the <xref id="cr7-8" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and Clark (2000)</xref> theory aims to explain (such as
                flashbacks where patients lose all contact with current reality, other intrusions
                that are not recognized by the individual as a memory, reexperiencing strong
                emotions, physiological reactions, or behavior from the trauma without recollection
                of the trauma), are excluded from consideration. However, these phenomena are
                important for understanding PTSD and for developing effective treatments. The wider
                range of reexperiencing symptoms under consideration explains why the
                    <xref id="cr7-9" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and Clark
                    (2000)</xref> model emphasizes memory processes that facilitate

                    intentional recall</italic> of the trauma. Different hypotheses about the nature
                of this deficit have been suggested in the literature, for example, a deficit in
                memory representations that facilitate intentional recall (<xref id="cr4-1" rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, Dalgleish, &amp; Joseph,
                    1996</xref>) or highly fragmented memories (e.g.,
                    <xref id="cr19-1" rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Foa &amp; Rothbaum,
                    1998</xref>; <xref id="cr45-1" rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">van der Kolk
                    &amp; Fisler, 1995</xref>). Building on the work on
                transfer-appropriate processing (for a review see <xref id="cr35-1" rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Roediger, 1990</xref>), <xref id="cr7-10" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and Clark (2000)</xref> suggested that data-driven
                processing during trauma (i.e., the predominant processing the sensory impressions)
                will facilitate strong perceptual priming for accompanying stimuli and (in
                combination with a lack of self-referent processing) will lead to relatively weaker
                intentional recall of the worst moments of the trauma.</p>
      <p>Other theorists (<xref id="cr2-5" rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Berntsen, 2009</xref>; <xref id="cr36-3" rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et al., 2008</xref>) predict the
                opposite and hypothesize that trauma memories are highly accessible so that
                intentional and unintentional retrieval is enhanced. Empirical tests of these
                hypotheses in clinical populations are sparse (for reviews see <xref id="cr10-3" rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al., 2004</xref>;
                    <xref id="cr27-1" rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">McNally, 2003</xref>).
                There is very little evidence for complete psychogenic amnesia (<xref id="cr18-1" rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Evans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref id="cr27-2" rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">McNally, 2003</xref>, but also see
                    <xref id="cr26-1" rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Markowitsch et al.,
                    1998</xref>). Unless there are organic causes for poor memory
                (e.g., head injury or drugs), trauma survivors usually remember most of what
                happened. There is evidence, however, for more subtle problems with intentional
                recall. People with PTSD may be confused about the order of events, have small gaps
                in memory, or may fail to remember details that are important for the meaning of
                especially distressing parts of the event (e.g., a rape survivor who blamed herself
                for not fighting the perpetrator did not remember that he had threatened her with a
                knife beforehand). Trauma survivors with PTSD give more disorganized narratives of
                traumatic events than those without PTSD (e.g., <xref id="cr22-1" rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Halligan, Michael, Clark, &amp; Ehlers, 2003</xref>;
                    <xref id="cr23-1" rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Harvey &amp; Bryant,
                    1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the author’s view, the
                controversy about deficient versus enhanced intentional recall of trauma in PTSD can
                be resolved by considering the trauma as a series of events rather than one event
                    (<xref id="cr10-4" rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al.,
                    2004</xref>). Earlier work defines the traumatic event from an
                external point of view and refers to the memory for this externally defined event as
                “the trauma memory.” The author believes that this is
                misleading. From the trauma survivors’ perspective, the traumatic
                experience may have several distinct parts that are not necessarily remembered as
                one integrated event. For example, <xref id="cr7-11" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers
                    and Clark (2000)</xref> described a patient with PTSD who had
                intrusive memories that contradicted each other and stemmed from different parts of
                the (prolonged) traumatic event. Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that
                only some moments from the traumatic event are later reexperienced. Thus, the
                proposed problems in intentional retrieval may mainly apply to the memory for these
                moments. In line with this argument, <xref id="cr16-2" rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Evans
                    et al. (2007a)</xref> found that narratives of the moments that
                were reexperienced were more disorganized than other segments of the trauma
                narrative that were not; furthermore in 23% of the cases these moments
                were not included in the narrative at all.</p>
      <p>Further clarity is needed about the
                exact nature of the problems in voluntary recall of parts of the trauma memory in
                PTSD and the pathways by which they contribute to the persistence of PTSD.
                    <xref id="cr10-5" rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al.
                    (2004)</xref> suggested that the <italic>disjointedness</italic> of
                the memories of the worst moments during the trauma from other relevant
                autobiographical information is particularly relevant in PTSD. <xref id="cr24-2" rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Kleim et al. (2008)</xref> found experimental
                support for this hypothesis. Disjointedness has the effect that when the individual
                remembers the worst moments, they have difficulty accessing other information that
                puts the meaning of these moments into perspective. This maintains a sense of
                current threat (<xref id="cr7-12" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp; Clark,
                    2000</xref>). Furthermore, poor memory elaboration is thought to
                contribute to reexperiencing as it leads to poor inhibition of cue-driven retrieval.
                Note that this would only be expected to lead to distressing reexperiencing symptoms
                if there is also strong priming for potential triggers and strong associations
                between the triggers and emotional responses as (<xref id="cr7-13" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref id="cr10-6" rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

      <p>People with and without PTSD also
                differ in how they remember other events in their lives. Like people with
                depression, those with PTSD have difficulty remembering specific autobiographical
                events (see <xref id="cr32-1" rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Moore &amp; Zoellner,

      <title>Relationship Between Memory and Appraisals in PTSD</title>
      <p>An important predictor of chronic PTSD
                is how people <italic>interpret</italic> their memories of the trauma.
                    <xref id="cr14-2" rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and Steil
                    (1995)</xref> suggested that people with PTSD show negative
                idiosyncratic interpretations of intrusive trauma memories such as “I am
                going crazy,” which lead to a sense of ongoing threat and distress, and
                motivate dysfunctional control strategies such as rumination, memory suppression,
                and excessive safety-seeking behaviors that maintain PTSD. Prospective longitudinal
                studies of trauma survivors supported this suggestion (e.g., <xref id="cr6-1" rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Dunmore, Clark, &amp; Ehlers, 2001</xref>;
                    <xref id="cr12-1" rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers, Mayou, &amp; Bryant,

      <p>Similarly, <xref id="cr7-14" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and Clark (2000)</xref> suggested that
                negative interpretations of problems in intentional recall such as memory gaps or
                difficulties in remembering the exact order of events (e.g., “I must have
                a brain damage” and “Something even worse and unbearable must
                have happened”) contribute to the maintenance of PTSD. Studies by
                    <xref id="cr6-2" rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Dunmore et al. (2001)</xref>
                and <xref id="cr22-3" rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Halligan et al.
                    (2003)</xref> supported this suggestion.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, what is remembered can
                contribute to problematic appraisals of the trauma. Problems in remembering the
                order of events can contribute to self-blame for the event (<xref id="cr7-15" rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>). Low
                autobiographical memory specificity contributes to appraisals of being permanently
                changed (<xref id="cr38-1" rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Schönfeld, Ehlers,

      <p>The above analysis of memory processes
                in PTSD and their link with problematic appraisals and behaviors that maintain PTSD
                has led to the development of specific theory-guided treatment procedures for this

      <p>The <italic>Updating Trauma
                    Memories</italic> procedure addresses the <italic>disjointedness</italic> of
                memories of the worst moments of the trauma from information that gives them a less
                threatening meaning. This procedure includes (1) identifying the moments during the
                trauma that create the greatest distress and sense of
                “nowness” (“hotspots”) through imaginal
                reliving or writing a narrative, and identification of the patient’s
                intrusive memories, (2) identifying the personal meanings of these moments, and (3)
                identifying “updating” information that puts the impressions
                the patient had at the time or the problematic meanings into perspective. This
                information can be either relevant details from the course, circumstances, and
                outcome of the trauma or the result of cognitive restructuring of the highly
                idiosyncratic meanings of the trauma, and (4) actively linking the updating
                information to the hotspots in memory, for example, by bringing the hotspot vividly
                to mind and simultaneously using verbal reminders, images, incompatible actions, or
                incompatible sensations to remind the patient of the new meanings.</p>
      <p><italic>Stimulus discrimination training</italic> addresses the <italic>easy
                    triggering</italic> of intrusive memories by matching sensory cues. Patients
                learn to identify the subtle sensory triggers of reexperiencing and learn to realize
                that they are responding to a memory. They learn to pay close attention to the
                differences between the harmless trigger and its present context
                (“now”) and the stimulus configuration that occurred in the
                context of trauma (“then”).</p>
      <p><italic>Reclaiming your life</italic> homework assignments address appraisals of
                permanent change and problems in retrieving specific memories of the
                patient’s life before the trauma. These assignments involve doing things
                that the patient has given up since the trauma, for example, resuming social
                contacts, sports, or other leisure activities. These activities provide retrieval
                cues for specific memories of themselves before the trauma.</p>
      <p>Negative interpretations of intrusive
                memories and problems in intentional recall are addressed through information,
                cognitive restructuring, and behavioral experiments. The patient is encouraged to
                experiment with dropping dysfunctional behaviors such as rumination, hypervigilance,
                and excessive precautions.</p>
