      <abstract>
        <p><bold>Objective/Aim:</bold> The aim of this study is to describe the distribution of the platelet blood group A antigenicity in Euro-Brazilians (EUBs) and Afro-Brazilians (AFBs).</p>
        <p><bold>Background:</bold> A small but significant proportion of individuals express high levels of A or B antigen on their platelets corresponding to the erythrocyte ABO group. The mechanism of increased antigen expression has not been elucidated.</p>
        <p><bold>Material/Methods:</bold> A cohort of 241 blood group A donors was analysed by flow cytometry. Although mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) is a typical continuous variable, platelets were screened and divided into two categories: low expressers (LEs) and high expressers (HEs). A three-generation family was investigated looking for an inheritance mechanism.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> The prevalence of the HE platelet phenotype among group A<sub>1</sub> donors was 2%. The mean of MFI on platelets of A<sub>1</sub> subgroup of EUBs differs from that of AFBs (<italic>P</italic> = 0&#xB7;0115), whereas the frequency of the HE phenotype was similar between them (<italic>P</italic> = 0&#xB7;5251). A significant difference was found between sexes (<italic>P</italic> = 0&#xB7;0039). Whereas the serum glycosyltransferase from HE family members converted significantly more H antigen on group O erythrocytes into A antigens compared with that in LE serum, their <italic>ABO</italic>, <italic>FUT1</italic> and <italic>FUT2</italic> genes were consensus. The theoretically favourable, transcriptionally four-repeat <italic>ABO</italic> enhancer was not observed.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The occurrence of HE in several members suggests familial aggregation. Indeed, in repeated measures, stability of the MFI values is suggesting an inherited condition. Factors outside the <italic>ABO</italic> locus might be responsible for the HE phenotype. Whether the real mechanism of inheritance is either of a polygenic or of a discrete Mendelian nature remains to be elucidated.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Human platelets express alloantigens that are platelet specific (e.g. Human Platelet Antigens (HPA)) and others that are shared with other blood cells and tissues (e.g. ABH, P, Le, I and Human Leucocyte Antigens (HLA) class I determinants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kunicki &amp; George, 1989</xref>). Although it has been known for decades that human platelets express A and B antigens corresponding to the ABO blood group of the individual's erythrocytes, many blood banks worldwide transfuse platelets without regarding donor&#x2013;recipient ABO compatibility. Although this practice might relieve inventory pressures, several reports have described platelet refractoriness mediated by anti-A and anti-B antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Skogen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ogasawara <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p>
    <p>In Japan, approximately 7% of the population expresses significantly elevated levels of either A or B antigen on the platelet surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ogasawara <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). It has been suggested that the expression of ABH antigens on platelets is genetically determined and that individuals can be classified as either low expressers (LEs) or high expressers (HEs) depending on the amount of A or B antigen detectable on their platelets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref> showed that platelet A antigen levels in 7% of Caucasian blood group A<sub>1</sub> donors were higher than in the general population mean + 2SD using flow cytometry. The corresponding percentage for B antigen in B donors was 4%. Furthermore, these investigators proposed that HE individuals could be divided into two categories of HEs of group A or B antigen, based on the flow cytometrically generated histogram pattern. The amount of these antigens on the platelets in the HE type I (HE-I) group overlapped with the mean of that in the general population but was, on average, higher. In the HE type II (HE-II) group, there was a clear separation between the amount of platelet A (or B) antigen on these donors' platelets and the mean of the general population as shown by the histogram.</p>
    <p>A recent study indicated that individuals with the A<sub>2</sub> red blood cell (RBC) phenotype may lack A antigen as well as its precursor substance H antigen on their platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cooling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), although this finding has been questioned by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Curtis &amp; Aster, 2006</xref>). We have evaluated the amount of A antigen on the platelet surface of 241 Brazilian blood group A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>int</sub> donors. This is the largest cohort of A donors studied so far and also the first report about ethnic groups. We also present a study on a group A<sub>1</sub> HE Afro-Brazilian (AFB) family with a complete analysis of the underlying <italic>ABO</italic> gene sequence including its 5&#x2032; enhancer region, suggested by some investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gershan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) to play a role in <italic>ABO</italic> transcriptional platelet regulation. The <italic>FUT1</italic> and <italic>FUT2</italic> genes, which are involved in synthesising the ABO precursor substance (H antigen) on RBCs and in secretions, respectively, have also been investigated. The occurrence of HE phenotype in several members suggests familial aggregation of the character. The potential mechanism of inheritance of the platelet HE phenotype is also discussed.</p>

        <title>Specimens</title>
        <p>On giving blood, 241 Brazilian group A blood donors agreed to participate in the study. The study was approved by the Ethical Scientific Committee (Comit&#xEA; de &#xC9;tica em Pesquisa, registration number: 001/003, Hospital Universit&#xE1;rio Clementino Fraga Filho/ Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), and all subjects received oral and written information concerning the study and gave their informed consent. The ethnicity of the donors, either Euro-Brazilian (EUB) or AFB, was assigned at the time of blood donation, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Palatnik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, a possible bone marrow donor, who had shown the highest level of platelet A antigen, and his 13 living relatives were also analysed. Informed consent was obtained from each individual or from the parents on behalf of their children. All of the family members were AFBs born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>
        <p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Michelson <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref>, for platelet studies, a 4-mL venous blood sample was collected from each individual into 3&#xB7;2% sodium citrate-coated polyethylene terephthalate tubes (Vacuette<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, Greiner Bio-One, Americana, SP, Brazil). Saliva and additional blood samples (8 mL in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 10 mL in tubes without additives) from family members and some blood donors for platelet ABO antigen reproducibility tests, glycosyltransferase (GTA) assays and genetic testing were also obtained as described in subsequent sections.</p>

        <title>Erythrocyte phenotyping</title>
        <p>The donors' blood groups were initially determined by slide test with monoclonal anti-A and anti-B reagents (DiaMed, Lagoa Santa, MG, Brazil) and repeated using the microplate system (DiaMed-MP Test<sup>&#xAE;</sup>, DiaMed, Cressier sur Morat, Switzerland). To differentiate between the A subgroups, anti-A<sub>1</sub> (<italic>Dolichos biflorus</italic>, Biotest, Itapecerica da Serra, SP, Brazil, and mouse hybridoma, Biotest, Dreieich, Germany) and anti-H (our own crude extracts of <italic>Ulex europaeus</italic> seeds and a commercial lectin from Biotest, Brazil) testing were carried out according to the manufacturers' instructions. The definitions of the A subgroups followed published recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Palatnik, 1984</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Daniels, 2002</xref>).</p>

        <title>Platelet preparation</title>
        <p>To avoid <italic>ex vivo</italic> platelet activation, samples were processed within 30 min of blood drawing for all assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Mody <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Michelson, 2006</xref>). Each blood sample was centrifuged at 22 &#xB0;C for 5 min at 500 &#xD7;<italic>g</italic> in a Jouan Model BR 4i centrifuge (Societe Jouan, St Herblain, France). To minimise the formation of platelet aggregates, one part of the plasma supernatant (platelet-rich plasma, PRP) was diluted in two parts of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered saline [0&#xB7;14 M NaCl, 5 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 1 m<sc>m</sc> MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 10 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES (sodium salt), pH 7&#xB7;4]. Samples were stabilised by fixation in paraformaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Metcalfe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Mody <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Michelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Michelson, 2006</xref>).</p>

        <title>Quantitative flow cytometric assay</title>
        <p>Fixed platelets (50 &#xB5;L of PRP aliquot, containing approximately 8 &#xD7; 10<sup>7</sup>&#xB5;L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> platelets) were incubated undisturbed for 30 min in the dark at room temperature with saturating dilutions (predetermined by titrations) of fluorescein isothiocyanate- (FITC)- and R-phycoerythrin- (R-PE, PE)-labelled monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies used for dual-colour staining were (i) anti-CD41 (mouse anti-human CD41, platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa R-PE, Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and anti-A antibody [FITC-conjugated mouse IgG<sub>3</sub><italic>&#x3BA;</italic> anti-A monoclonal antibody, clone NaM87-1F6 (Becton-Dickinson Co., BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA)] and (ii) anti-CD41 and anti-H lectin (lectin, FITC labelled, from <italic>U. europaeus</italic> UEA I, Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA). The quantity of antibody used was sufficient to saturate available A antigen sites: some assays when repeated by incubating the conjugate supernatant with a new platelet aliquot yielded histograms similar to the initial ones.</p>
        <p>In order to control the <italic>in vitro</italic> activation, fixed platelets were incubated with anti-CD62p (PE-conjugated mouse anti-human CD62p monoclonal antibody, BD Pharmingen). Any possible neutrophil contamination was discarded by incubation with anti-CD45 (R-PE monoclonal mouse anti-human CD45, leucocyte common antigen, Dako). To detect nonspecific antibody binding, respective isotype controls (negative controls: R-PE-conjugated IgG<sub>1</sub> mouse monoclonal antibody, Dako; PE-conjugated IgG<sub>1</sub> mouse monoclonal antibody, BD Pharmingen; and FITC-conjugated mouse IgG<sub>3</sub><italic>&#x3BA;</italic>, BD Pharmingen) were also used under the same incubation conditions described earlier.</p>
        <p>After staining, platelets were washed (500 &#xD7;<italic>g</italic>, 22 &#xB0;C, 5 min) twice in 0&#xB7;1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0&#xB7;02% NaN<sub>3</sub> (w/v), 0&#xB7;1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (w/v), pH 7&#xB7;2&#x2013;7&#xB7;4, and resuspended in 500 &#xB5;L of wash solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Metcalfe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Mody <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Michelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Michelson, 2006</xref>). Platelet-bound fluorescence and control samples (50 &#xB5;L aliquot of fixed platelets from the same individual) were analysed within 2 h by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Pharmingen). Forward scatter vs side scatter and forward scatter vs fluorescence gates (FL) of platelets were set. A total of 30 000 events per sample were gated and analysed with the computer software recommended by the manufacturer (C<sc>ell</sc>Q<sc>uest</sc>&#x2122; Software, BD Pharmingen).</p>
        <p>Results were recorded as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the platelets positive for both CD41 and either anti-A or anti-H reagents. Maximal platelet activation was considered in the order of &#x2264;1&#xB7;5% (CD62p expression).</p>
        <p>One-colour fluorescence flow cytometry was performed on the RBCs of some individuals. One part of washed RBCs was diluted in two parts of HEPES/BSA-buffered saline and stabilised by fixation in paraformaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Metcalfe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Mody <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Michelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Michelson, 2006</xref>). An aliquot (5 &#xB5;L) of fixed RBCs was stained with either anti-A antibody or anti-H lectin. After staining, RBCs were washed twice and resuspended in wash solution before flow cytometry analysis. The results were reported as the MFI in relation to each fluorochrome.</p>

        <title>Serum enzyme activity assays</title>
        <p>The 3-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (blood group A GTA) activity was measured in three A<sub>1</sub> blood group HE family members following the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Yabe <italic>et al.</italic> (1989)</xref>, using serum from five A<sub>1</sub> blood group LE individuals for comparison. In order to assay the GTA activity, 200 &#xB5;L of 1&#xB7;6 m<sc>m</sc> UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (Sigma), 400 &#xB5;L of 0&#xB7;1 M cacodylic acid, pH 6&#xB7;0 (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA), containing 0&#xB7;1 M MnCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma), and 100 &#xB5;L of 50% suspension of group O RBCs treated with 0&#xB7;1% papain solution (Sigma, lot: 127F8075) were added to 1 mL of each serum. The mixture was agitated at 37 &#xB0;C for 1 h. After incubation, the cells were washed three times in a solution of 0&#xB7;1 M PBS and 0&#xB7;5% BSA. A fraction of the converted RBCs was titrated against human anti-A serum. The remainder, after paraformaldehyde fixation, as described earlier, was incubated with FITC-anti-A antibody and tested by flow cytometry.</p>

        <title>Variability of MFI individual values</title>
        <p>The expresser character may manifest the inherited tendency to remain the same (phenotypic stability) and the tendency to change in response to current environmental conditions. The test for correlated samples is useful in removing the effects of pre-existing individual differences (named SS<sub>wg</sub> or subjects, extraneous to the principal question of the test), leaving only the error (random variability). The variability inside the samples reflects the fact that there is substantial difference among people with respect to the variable fluorescence intensity. Samples of platelets from 20 individuals of A<sub>1</sub> subgroup were studied at 0, 30 and 45 days. The results showed that between groups SS = 0&#xB7;2749, d.f. = 2, MS = 0&#xB7;1375, <italic>F</italic> = 2&#xB7;1756, <italic>P</italic> = 0&#xB7;127479, where SS is the squared sum and MS is the mean square. The variability within days was great; however, when the pre-existing individual differences within each day were removed, the remaining value, the error, which represents the effect of the random variability, and the value of <italic>F</italic> = MS<sub>between</sub><italic>/</italic>error = 0&#xB7;1375<italic>/</italic>0&#xB7;0632 = 2&#xB7;1756 were not significant.

One-way <sc>anova</sc> for three correlated samples also showed no significant variation (<italic>P</italic> = 0&#xB7;127479).

In addition, the entire coding region of both <italic>FUT1</italic> and <italic>FUT2</italic> were also analysed in these two members and no unexpected polymorphisms were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Yazer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In some donors, our studies did not disclose clear-cut differences between the LE and HE-I phenotypes, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref>. The HE-I phenotypes from the point of view of MFI values and also from the histogram patterns cannot always be differentiated from the LE phenotype. For these reasons, we have included both of them as an LE phenotype. On account of these experimental results, we included in the LE platelet phenotype a large spectrum of MFI values.</p>
      <p>The A reactivity on platelets follows the same gradient of MFI values as the respective RBC's control cells, which was also described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Cooling (2006)</xref>.</p>
      <p>A positive correlation was observed between A<sub>1</sub> and H variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). Our results are similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cooling <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref>. The extremely low levels of the H content on platelets of the family HE members (in relation to the amount observed in the population sample) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6b</xref>, on the bottom &#x2013;<italic>propositus</italic>/ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2g&#x2013;i</xref>&#x2013; population sample), together with the almost virtual absence of H antigen on RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6c</xref>) and the higher levels of serum <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-GTA, all agree with the HE-II platelet phenotype described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4 b6">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> (2000, 2008</xref>). Findings made in this family have shown that these platelets carry significantly higher levels of A antigen than other A individuals and have indicated that essentially all H substance, the substrate for synthesis of A antigen, was converted to A by the higher active <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-GTA.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, our results &#x2013; A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>int</sub> platelet donors have MFI means significantly different from those obtained with platelets from group O individuals &#x2013; are at odds with other reports which have indicated that the amount of A antigen on most platelets from A<sub>2</sub> subgroup was very weak or undetectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Holgersson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ogasawara <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hou <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Julmy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). An explanation of this difference is apparently not related to ethnic origins. Furthermore, the A strength on platelets suggests that, at least in our population, it may not be appropriate to transfuse platelets from either A<sub>2</sub> or A<sub>int</sub> blood donors to group O patients (chiefly, if they receive multiple transfusions for a rather long time), unless these patients have a previous test showing weak or null anti-A agglutinin titration scores.</p>
      <p>What remains to be elucidated is the mechanism of inheritance and the factor(s) responsible for producing the HE platelet phenotype. The occurrence of HE in several members suggests familial aggregation. Furthermore, in repeated measures, stability of the MFI values suggesting an inherited condition was observed. Polygenic inheritance &#x2013; which cannot be excluded as a hypothesis &#x2013; is demonstrated in the transmission pattern of other continuous or quantitative traits, such as blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Lander &amp; Schork, 1994</xref>). However, the inheritance of the trait was considered to be transmitted as a dominant Mendelian character related to the A or B antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ogasawara <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). We believe that since the first descriptions of the trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ogasawara <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cooling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), the intensity of fluorescence, a typical continuous variable, was described as a practical approximation to a discrete form of two or three phenotypes. The expresser phenotype appears to be cosegregating with the <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> and <italic>B</italic> alleles in the families described by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ogasawara <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4 b6">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000, 2008</xref>) and in this study. However, this cosegregation does not necessarily mean that the <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> and <italic>B</italic> alleles are conditioning the expresser phenotypes. Against the hypothesis of a trait linked to the <italic>ABO</italic> locus, there is the apparent absence of recombinants in the A or B families.</p>
      <p>The pattern of inheritance of the HE platelet phenotype demonstrated in the family study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6a</xref>) suggests autosomal dominant inheritance of the HE phenotype-producing factor(s). Similar pedigrees in Japanese donors demonstrating an inheritance pattern consistent with autosomal dominance have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ogasawara <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). This proposed mode of inheritance whereby the HE-producing factors affect either the GTA or GTB individually explains why, of the 106 AB Japanese donors studied, none demonstrated simultaneously high expression of both A and B antigens on their platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ogasawara <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>), a fact that argues for an <italic>ABO</italic> locus-linked inheritance as opposed to an independent factor able to &#x2018;boost&#x2019; the action of any ABO transferase present.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cooling <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> and the present report found a linear relationship between the amount of A and H antigens on the platelet surface of group A<sub>1</sub> donors. We hypothesised that a hyperactive 2-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-<sc>l</sc>-fucosyltransferase encoded by the <italic>FUT1</italic> or <italic>FUT2</italic> loci might be responsible for producing the HE phenotype by providing larger quantities of H antigen in secretions and on RBCs, respectively, which could then be converted into group A antigens. However, complete analysis of the <italic>FUT1</italic> and <italic>FUT2</italic> coding regions in two HE individuals revealed only genes without any unexpected polymorphisms consistent with normal H synthesis and thus do not appear to influence the expresser status. All the HE members of the family studied were secretors of A and H substances, thus the passive adsorption of A antigens onto the platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dunstan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kunicki &amp; George, 1989</xref>) cannot be definitively excluded as a contributing factor of the HE state, but it must be realised that based on the frequency of secretor status, this could merely be a coincidence in this family.</p>
      <p>The current data set refutes several previously proposed mechanisms of producing the HE phenotype and points to other theories of its inheritance. There are an allele-specific number of minisatellite repeats in the 5&#x2032; enhancer region of the <italic>ABO</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kominato <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Irshaid <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Those enhancers featuring four repeats are associated with higher rates of transcription in luciferase reporter gene experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). With this in mind, we decided to analyse the 5&#x2032; promoter region in the HE family members for which DNA was available. In an earlier study, which was reported only in abstract form, the presence of the theoretically favourable four-repeat variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) enhancer region associated with an <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> allele was suggested to cause HE phenotype in two donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gershan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). To date, this finding has not been presented in full or confirmed by other investigators. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Irshaid <italic>et al.</italic> (1999)</xref> screened 234 donors of different ethnic/geographic origins and found only a single Jordanian donor who had an <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> allele in <italic>cis</italic> with four repeats. Since then, at least twice as many have been screened and yet no four-repeat enhancers have been found associated with the <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> allele (M. L. Olsson, personal communication). This does not appear to parallel the suggested frequency of HE phenotypes (4&#x2013;7% in different studies) if the <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> allele with four repeats really had a role in the molecular basis of HE. It should also be noted that there are currently no experimental data to support the notion that enhancer repeats are important for <italic>ABO</italic> transcription in haematopoietic tissue. The studies suggesting that they do in fact play a role in regulating the rate of transcription (and thereby theoretically, e.g. the A or B expression on platelets) were performed in cell lines of gastric cancer origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kominato <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this study, the expected single-unit enhancer region associated with the <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> allele of HE individuals, the exons 1&#x2013;7, including splice sites and the putative proximal promoter region had no unexpected mutations/polymorphisms. On the contrary, a closer analysis of the current data reveals some interesting phenomena that might not necessarily be accounted for by a simple inheritance pattern. In spite of the consensus <italic>ABO</italic> gene in the current platelet HE family members (I-1 and II-5 individuals), the serum GTA from other HE family members (II-3 and III-1 individuals) synthesised more A antigens on group O cells compared with the serum GTA from A<sub>1</sub> LE control donors. The higher than normal GTA activity has also been previously reported in other platelet HE individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ogasawara <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), but it is still unclear if this finding is due to a higher concentration of serum GTA or a qualitatively enhanced enzyme at the same concentration as in LE individuals. Yet another possibility to explain the varying ABO antigen levels on platelets is megakaryocyte-related interindividual differences.</p>
      <p>The cause of the platelet phenotype remains elusive, although its aetiology probably lies outside the <italic>ABO</italic> locus itself. We have presented data that support both a single and polygenetic explanation for this phenotype; further research is warranted to more fully elucidate the cause of this fascinating and potentially clinically relevant phenomenon.</p>
