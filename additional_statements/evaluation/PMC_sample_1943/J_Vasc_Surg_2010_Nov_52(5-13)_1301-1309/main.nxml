          <title>Objectives</title>
          <p>Inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration is a potential strategy for reducing intimal thickening during in-stent restenosis and vein graft failure. In this study, we examined the effect of disrupting the function of the VSMC adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, using antagonists, neutralizing antibodies, and a dominant negative, on VSMC migration and intimal thickening. Migration was assessed by the scratch-wound assay of human saphenous vein VSMCs and in a human saphenous vein ex vivo organ culture model of intimal thickening.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Inhibition of cadherin function using a pan-cadherin antagonist, significantly reduced migration by 53% &#xB1; 8% compared with the control peptide (n = 3; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Furthermore, inhibition of N-cadherin function with an N-cadherin antagonist, neutralizing antibodies, and adenoviral expression of dominant negative N-cadherin (RAd dn-N-cadherin), significantly reduced migration by 31% &#xB1; 2%, 23% &#xB1; 1% and 32% &#xB1; 7% compared with controls, respectively (n = 3; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Inhibition of cadherin function significantly increased apoptosis by between 1.5- and 3.3-fold at the wound edge. In an ex vivo model of intimal thickening, inhibition of N-cadherin function by infection of human saphenous vein segments with RAd dn-N-cadherin significantly reduced VSMC migration by 55% and increased VSMC apoptosis by 2.7-fold. As a result, intimal thickening was significantly suppressed by 54% &#xB1; 14%. Importantly, there was no detrimental effect of dn-N-cadherin on endothelial coverage; in fact, it was significantly increased, as was survival of cultured human saphenous vein endothelial cells.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Under the condition of this study, cell-cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin regulates VSMC migration via modulation of viability. Interestingly, inhibition of N-cadherin function significantly retards intimal thickening via inhibition of VSMC migration and promotion of endothelial cell survival. We suggest that disruption of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts is a potential strategy for reducing VSMC migration and intimal thickening.</p>

        <title>Clinical Relevance</title>
        <p>Intimal thickening occurs in a large number of coronary artery vein grafts, lower extremity vein grafts, and stented arteries and is therefore a significant clinical problem. Intimal thickening is caused by migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from the intima to the media where they proliferate. In this study, we have shown that inhibition of the function of N-cadherin (a cell-cell contact protein) significantly retards VSMC migration and intimal thickening, while promoting endothelial coverage, and may therefore be clinically useful for treating intimal thickening.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration from the media to the intima is an important process in atherosclerotic plaque development, in-stent restenosis, and vein graft failure (see review Willis et al<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>). VSMCs in a healthy artery normally have low migration rates. In contrast, VSMC migration is stimulated in response to injury due to the presence of chemoattractants, remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and phenotypic changes.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
    <p>It has been previously demonstrated that expression of the cell adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, may increase cell migration in embryonic development and cancer.<xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3-5</sup></xref> However, other studies have shown that N-cadherin can inhibit cell migration in various cell types including astrocytes, breast carcinoma, and osteosarcoma cells.<xref rid="bib6 bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6-8</sup></xref> These observations suggest that N-cadherin can either promote adhesion or induce migration depending on the cellular context.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Studies using VSMCs have yielded contradictory findings for the role of N-cadherin in VSMC migration. Jones and colleagues found that N-cadherin was upregulated during intimal thickening in the rat carotid balloon injury model and promoted VSMC migration in vitro.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In contrast, Blindt et al observed that downregulation of N-cadherin occurred during intimal thickening in the porcine femoral balloon injury model and inhibited VSMC migration in vitro.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Thus, the role of N-cadherin in VSMC migration is unclear and requires further investigation.</p>
    <p>We previously demonstrated that N-cadherin is essential for VSMC survival.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> We have now investigated whether VSMC migration was affected by perturbation of N-cadherin function using an in vitro migration model. In addition, we assessed whether inhibition of N-cadherin function retarded intimal thickening by modulation of VSMC migration and survival using an ex vivo human saphenous vein model of intimal thickening. We observed that N-cadherin function perturbation reduced VSMC migration and intimal thickening, at least in part by reducing VSMC survival. Importantly, no detrimental effect on endothelial cells was observed.</p>

        <p>Surplus segments of human saphenous vein were obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (Research Ethical Committee number 04/Q2007/6). VSMCs were grown from these segments by the explant method of Southgate and Newby.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> VSMCs were maintained in serum-containing tissue culture media (Dulbecco's modified essential media [DMEM] supplemented with 100 &#x3BC;g/mL of penicillin, 100 IU/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% [v/v] fetal calf serum [FCS]). VSMCs were used at passage 4-8. Three separate populations of human saphenous vein endothelial cells were purchased from Promocell and cultured as described by the supplier.</p>

        <title>Effect of N-cadherin function perturbation on migration</title>
        <p>Cells were plated directly on glass coverslips in 24-well plates at 2 &#xD7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. When cells had grown to confluence, they were injured by rubbing a 1-mL pipette tip across the layer twice. The culture media was replaced and 2 mmol/L hydroxyurea was added to inhibit proliferation. The affect of perturbing N-cadherin function was investigated by addition of the following agents to the culture media: 10 &#x3BC;g/mL neutralizing anti-N-cadherin antibody (GC-4; Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK) or 10 &#x3BC;g/mL nonimmune mouse immunoglobulin G as previously described, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> 1 mg/mL of the pan-cadherin antagonist cyclic peptide (CHAVC, Adherex Technologies Inc) or 1 mg/mL cyclic control peptide <underline>(</underline>CHGVC), 1 mg/mL of the N-cadherin antagonist cyclic peptide (CHAVDIC, Adherex Technologies Inc, NC) or 1 mg/mL cyclic control peptide (CHGVDIC, Adherex Technologies Inc). Although a dose-dependent effect on migration was observed with 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL of the peptides only, 1 mg/mL the highest dose is presented. The cells were left to migrate for 24 hours. In some cases, cells were also treated with 2 nmol/L caspase-3 inhibitor (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK).</p>

        <p>A previously described adenovirus (RAd dn-N-cad),<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> was used to express a dominant negative form of N-cadherin as previously described and RAd LacZ, which expresses &#x3B2;-galactosidase, was used as a control.

VSMCs were infected with 5, 10, and 50 plaque-forming units (pfu) per cell of RAd dn-N-cad or RAd LacZ in serum-containing DMEM culture media for 18 hours (infection period). The cell layer was wounded twice using a sterile pipette tip. After washing the cells, they were cultured in fresh serum-containing DMEM supplemented with 2 mmol/L hydroxyurea for 24 hours.</p>

The adventitial layer was removed to avoid fibroblast overgrowth of the intima, and then the vein was bisected transversely. One segment was infected with RAd dn-N-cadherin, while the other segment was used as a paired control infected with RAd LacZ.

Similarly, the pan-cadherin antagonist (CHAVC: 1 mg/mL) and N-cadherin-specific antagonist (CHAVDIC: 1 mg/mL) significantly increased VSMC apoptosis at the wound edge compared to the same concentration of the appropriate controls (CHGVC and CHGVDIC, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <italic>D</italic>).

A global increase (17.0% &#xB1; 1.2% vs 7.8% &#xB1; 0.4%) in VSMC apoptosis was observed in VSMCs infected with the dn-N-cadherin adenovirus, as previously observed.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
        <p>We next determined the effect of inhibiting active cleaved caspase-3 (an effector caspase involved in apoptosis<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>) on the ability of N-cadherin antagonists to cause VSMC apoptosis. We observed that the number of ISEL-positive VSMCs was significantly lower in the presence of a synthetic caspase-3 inhibitor and either the pan-cadherin antagonist (CHAVC) or the neutralizing N-cadherin antibody compared to peptide or antibody alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <italic>E</italic>). Importantly, there was no significant difference in the number of apoptotic VSMCs in the controls (CHGVC and nonimmune immunoglobulin) and those treated with the caspase-3 inhibitor and pan-cadherin antagonist (CHAVC) or the neutralizing anti-N-cadherin antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <italic>E</italic>). However, the presence of the caspase-3 inhibitor did not restore migration (pan-cadherin antagonist: 270 &#xB1; 4 &#x3BC;m vs 281 &#xB1; 29 &#x3BC;m; neutralizing antibody: 302 &#xB1; 6 &#x3BC;m vs 271 &#xB1; 16 &#x3BC;m, n = 3).</p>

        <title>Effect of N-cadherin inhibition on intimal thickening</title>
        <p>Segments of human saphenous vein were infected with adenoviruses to express the reporter gene &#x3B2;-galactosidase and dn-N-cadherin. Expression of the reporter gene was seen predominantly in the surface cells of the segment at both 3 and 7 days after infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>); however, some deeper expression was detected (inset of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, <italic>A</italic>). Expression of dn-N-cadherin significantly reduced VSMC migration at 7 days but did not affect intimal proliferation or intimal cell density (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>).

        <p>QBend10 staining of human saphenous vein organ cultures at 14 days revealed that endothelial cell coverage was significantly increased in vein segments infected with RAd dn-N-cadherin compared to the virus control (RAd LacZ) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). To determine if N-cadherin inhibition affects endothelial cell apoptosis, migration, or proliferation, human saphenous vein endothelial cells were treated with the neutralizing N-cadherin antibody or N-cadherin-specific antagonist (CHAVDIC). Apoptosis assessed by ISEL was significantly reduced by the neutralizing antibody or N-cadherin-specific antagonist (CHAVDIC) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>, <italic>A</italic>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Intimal thickening of blood vessels results in a significant clinical problem. In particular, approximately 50% of vein grafts fail within 10 years after implantation.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Intimal thickening occurs because of VSMC migration from the medial layer of the blood vessel to the intima where they subsequently proliferate and deposit ECM, causing thickening of the intimal layer. Consequently, reduction of VSMC migration is an attractive target for inhibition of intimal thickening.</p>
      <p>In this study, we examined the effect of inhibiting N-cadherin function on VSMC migration and intimal thickening. We observed that inhibiting N-cadherin function by several methodologies (peptide antagonist, neutralizing antibodies, and dominant negative mutant) significantly reduced VSMC migration. This appears to be, at least in part, due to reduced activation of Akt and increased VSMC apoptosis caused by inhibition of N-cadherin function. Previously, we showed that N-cadherin is essential for VSMC survival via activation of Akt,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and therefore this study corroborates the pro-survival effect of N-cadherin on VSMCs. Interestingly, we observed no effect on VSMC survival in cells located away from the wound edge with the N-cadherin neutralizing antibody and peptide antagonist. These observations suggest that these agents do not affect the viability of VSMCs with established contacts. In contrast, dn-N-cadherin did increase apoptosis away from the wound edge, as this dominant negative disrupts existing N-cadherin-mediated intercellular junctions.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Our results confirm the findings of Jones and colleagues, who showed that VSMC migration is retarded by the inhibition of N-cadherin function using a neutralizing anti-N-cadherin antibody.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> A subsequent study by the same group has suggested that asymmetric distribution of N-cadherin is necessary for the establishment of cell polarity during migration and that N-cadherin over-expression prevents cell polarization during migration.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> However, in both studies, the effect of inhibiting N-cadherin function on VSMC apoptosis was not determined.</p>
      <p>In contrast to both our study and that of Jones and colleagues, Blindt and colleagues previously showed that VSMC migration was increased by the neutralizing anti-N-cadherin antibody.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Although the reason for this discrepancy is unknown, we suggest two possibilities. First, to assess migration, Blindt et al used chemotaxis assays rather than the wound injury model. In the chemotaxis assay, VSMCs are placed in the chamber as single cells, whereas in the wound injury model, cell-cell contacts are established prior to the treatment. Second, the concentration of the neutralizing anti-N-cadherin antibody was higher in the study by Blindt et al compared with our study.</p>
      <p>To examine whether perturbation of N-cadherin function in intact segments of vein affected intimal thickening, we used an established ex vivo human saphenous vein model of intimal thickening.<xref rid="bib18 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,25</sup></xref> In this model, we are able to effectively overexpress transgenes using adenoviral lumenal delivery to segments of human saphenous vein, and we propose that this approach may be clinically useful for the overexpression of transgenes that retard intimal thickening.<xref rid="bib15 bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15-17</sup></xref> Efficient delivery of the transgene was demonstrated by X-gal staining for expression of &#x3B2;-galactosidase from the LacZ control reporter adenovirus. As in our previous studies,<xref rid="bib15 bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15-17</sup></xref> expression was predominantly observed at the lumenal surface, although deeper patchy expression in the medial layer was also detected in approximately 80% of segments. We observed that inhibition of N-cadherin function using the dominant negative form significantly increased VSMC apoptosis and retarded VSMC migration. As a result, intimal thickening was significantly reduced. We observed that the dominant negative N-cadherin did not affect intimal VSMC density, which implies that ECM synthesis was not affected by the dominant negative. Collectively, this demonstrates that inhibition of N-cadherin function in VSMCs close to the lumenal surface, which induces apoptosis of these VSMCs, reduces the number of VSMCs able to migrate to the intima and cause intimal thickening.</p>
      <p>We suggest that overexpression of the dominant negative form of N-cadherin is a more suitable clinical approach for the reduction of vein graft intimal thickening than the peptides. First, we have previously shown potential of this gene therapy approach for vein grafting failure.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Additionally, we are cautious of proposing N-cadherin antagonists as suitable agents for systemic treatment due to potential adverse side-effects that may ensue as a result of affecting N-cadherin junctions in other tissues and cell types, eg, neurones. Consequently, we propose that the N-cadherin antagonists will need to be delivered locally in a relatively short time during the surgical procedure. This may be insufficient exposure to the peptide; however, it is more than adequate to enable the infection with an adenovirus.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The adenoviral infection and resultant protein overexpression will therefore lead to longer bioavailability of the N-cadherin inhibitor compared with the peptides that will be quickly washed away. Moreover, the use of the peptide antagonist for the organ culture experiments and in vivo would be costly. Our group has also previously shown the feasibility of using adenoviral gene delivery for the reduction of in-stent restenosis;<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> however, it may be possible to use N-cadherin peptide antagonist coating of stents to reduce intimal thickening in stented vessels, but future studies to assess this are essential.</p>
      <p>Since endothelial cell coverage of the vein graft is vital for the success of the vein graft,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> we examined whether inhibition of N-cadherin affects endothelial cell coverage. Interestingly, we observed that endothelial cell coverage was enhanced in vein segments expressing dn-N-cadherin. Furthermore, we observed that while N-cadherin perturbation did not affect proliferation or migration, apoptosis of human saphenous vein endothelial cells was significantly reduced. These data are in contrast to a previous report of enhanced apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells treated with the cadherin antagonist,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> but may reflect a difference in capillary and venous endothelial cells. Consequently, we conclude that N-cadherin inhibition results in divergent effects on endothelial cells and VSMCs, which although not unprecedented, is interesting and warrants future analysis.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have shown that in the context of the experimental conditions employed in this study, inhibition of N-cadherin suppresses VSMC migration, at least in part by induction of apoptosis, both in vitro and ex vivo. Consequently, inhibition of N-cadherin effectively retarded intimal thickening in this model. Our findings suggest that inhibition of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact may be a therapeutic target for treatment of intimal thickening, such as that seen during vein graft failure.</p>
