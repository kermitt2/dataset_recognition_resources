          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The pre-leukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX) is part of the PBX family of transcription factors, which is known to regulate genes involved in differentiation of urogenital organs and steroidogenesis. This is of interest with regard to prostate cancer progression as regulation of steroidogenesis is one of the mechanisms involved in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. In light of this we wanted to investigate the possible involvement of androgen regulation of PBX3 expression in prostate cancer.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>In this study, we show that PBX3 is post-transcriptionally regulated by androgen in prostate cancer cells and that the effect might be independent of the androgen receptor. Furthermore, PBX3 was identified as a target of Let-7d, an androgen regulated microRNA. Let-7d was down-regulated in malignant compared to benign prostate tissue, whereas up-regulation of PBX3 expression was observed.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>We demonstrate that PBX3 is up-regulated in prostate cancer and post- transcriptionally regulated by androgen through Let-7d.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Transcription factors play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis due to their function as activators and repressors of gene expression. This key function also highlights their potential role as candidate drug targets and prognostic or diagnostic markers.</p>
      <p>The Pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factors (PBX) are members of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) homeobox gene family. They are involved in regulation of developmental gene expression, differentiation of urogenital organs and steroidogenesis through their abilities to form hetero-oligomeric DNA complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. PBX proteins interact with a subset of HOX proteins and with the Meinox subfamily of TALE class proteins to enhance their DNA-binding affinities and specificities. Human PBX1 was originally identified as a proto-oncogene in pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia where it is expressed as a fusion protein with E2A after a chromosomal translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Later PBX2, PBX3 and PBX4 were identified as other members of the PBX family based on their high degree of sequence homology within and flanking their DNA-binding homeodomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Alternative splicing of PBX transcripts gives rise to high molecular weight (PBX1a, PBX2, PBX3a and PBX4) and low molecular weight (PBX1b and PBX3b, c, d) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Biochemical studies and expression profiling of PBX proteins indicate that they have both overlapping and specific functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Both PBX1 and PBX3 are expressed in the cortex of developing adrenal glands where they play a significant role in regulation of steroidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. More specifically, PBX has been shown to mediate ACTH-induced expression of CYP17A1 (cytochrome P-450 17alpha-hydroxylase), a key enzyme required for cortisol and androgen biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Members of the PBX family have also been shown to regulate metabolism of androgens in prostate cancer cells by modulating the expression of UGT2B17, an enzyme involved in glucuronidation of androgens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>PBX3 is highly expressed in developing central nervous system (CNS), but otherwise expressed at low level in the early phase of mouse organogenesis. Furthermore as a consequence of its role in the CNS, mice that are PBX3 deficient develop to term but die within a few hours due to central respiratory failure. Later, PBX3 becomes more widely expressed in epithelial and mesenchymal tissue throughout the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>As regulation of steroidogenesis is one of the mechanisms involved in the development of castration-resistance prostate cancer, we wanted to study expression and regulation of PBX3 in prostate cancer. Furthermore, previous studies postulated that the PBX expression pattern could be used as a tool for both stratification and treatment of patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. One possible treatment option is to use synthetic peptides that function as antagonists by blocking the HOX/PBX dimer formation. This approach has been reported to inhibit proliferation of ovarian, renal, non-small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p>

        <title>Androgen regulation of PBX3 at protein level in prostate cancer cell lines</title>
        <p>In order to determine whether PBX3 expression is androgen regulated at the protein level, we stimulated LNCaP cells with 10<sup>-10 </sup>M R1881, a synthetic androgen analogue, for 1 to 4 days followed by protein extraction and Western analysis using an anti-human PBX3 antibody. Down-regulation of PBX3 was detected after 24 hours of R1881 stimulation, and was further reduced after 4 days of treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The androgen regulation of PBX3 was also observed in LNCaP C4-2B (C4-2B) and RWPE-1 cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), and when LNCaP cells were stimulated with dihydrotestosterone (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Fig.S1). Over-expression of PBX3 by transfection of LNCaP cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and competition with a competitor peptide (data not shown) were used to confirm the specificity of the anti-PBX3 antibody. The level of PBX3 was unchanged in untreated LNCaP-cells during the experimental period (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Androgen receptor independent regulation of PBX3</title>
        <p>In order to explore the role of the androgen receptor (AR) in androgen regulation of PBX3, LNCaP cells were stimulated with R1881 in the absence and presence of bicalutamide (Bic), an AR antagonist (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). A minor reduction in PBX3 level was seen in the presence of bicalutamide alone and further reduction was observed by adding R1881. Transfection of LNCaP cells with siRNA targeting AR had no effect on the level of PBX3, whereas the level of AR itself and NKX3.1, a known androgen regulated gene, was reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Post-transcriptional regulation of PBX3 by androgen</title>
        <p>Interestingly, no significant change in PBX3 mRNA level was detected between control (CSS) and androgen-stimulated (R1881) LNCaP cells, and no effect of bicalutamide (Bic) was observed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Fig.S2A). To determine whether androgen affects protein synthesis and/or degradation of PBX3 at the protein level, LNCaP cells were androgen stimulated in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. No significant effect of androgen was observed on PBX3 expression level when protein synthesis was inhibited. This indicates that androgen may affect translation/synthesis of PBX3 or that androgen indirectly regulates the protein stability of PBX3 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Fig.S2B).</p>

        <title>Let-7d regulates PBX3 in LNCaP cells</title>
        <p>One possible mechanism through which androgen may regulate protein synthesis of PBX3 is through microRNA that preferentially acts by binding to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of specific mRNAs. MicroRNA that might regulate PBX3 expression was identified by <italic>in silico </italic>analyses using three different bioinformatic analysis software packages available, miRANDA, TargetScan and PicTar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Putative binding sites for Let-7d, miR-101 and miR-222 were identified in the 3'UTR of PBX3 with all three bioinformatic programs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Transfection of LNCaP cells with the three microRNAs identified <italic>in silico </italic>showed that Let-7d mimic decreased the endogenous protein level of PBX3 48 hours post-transfection, demonstrating that Let-7d potentially regulates PBX3 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). MiR-101 and miR-222 appeared not to have any effect on the level of PBX3 in LNCaP cells. A modest up-regulation of PBX3 was observed when transfecting LNCaP cells with a Let-7d mimic hairpin inhibitor (Anti-Let-7d), that blocks Let-7d microRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Transfection of C4-2B and RWPE-1 cells with Let-7d mimic down-regulated the expression of endogenous PBX3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p>

The 3'UTR sequence of PBX3 was cloned into the pMIR-Luc plasmid and transfected into LNCaP cells. The presence of the PBX3 3'UTR (pMIR-Luc-PBX3-3'UTR) reduced the luciferase activity compared to an empty reporter plasmid (pMIR-Luc), as would be expected if microRNA regulated the expression of PBX3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). No significant effect was observed when the 3'UTR PBX3 sequence was cloned into pMIR-Luc in the reverse orientation (pMIR-Luc-PBX3-Rev3'UTR). To test whether Let-7d regulated PBX3 expression, the reporter construct, pMIR-Luc-PBX3-3'UTR, was co-transfected with Let-7d mimic into LNCaP cells. Co-transfection of Let-7d mimic reduced the luciferase activity generated by pMIR-Luc-PBX3-3'UTR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study shows that PBX3 is post-transcriptionally regulated by androgen in prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, PBX3 is identified as a target of Let-7d, an androgen regulated microRNA, indicating that androgen regulates PBX3 expression through Let-7d. PBX3 was up-regulated and Let-7d was down-regulated in prostate cancer compared to normal epithelial prostate cells.</p>
      <p>Androgen regulation of PBX3 was predominantly post-transcriptional since no regulation of PBX3 at the mRNA level following androgen stimulation was detected. This is in contrast to the regulation of PBX1, previously identified as a target gene for PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger), an early androgen responsive gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Kikugawa and colleagues showed that PBX1 was regulated after androgen treatment in DU145 cells transfected with the androgen receptor, indicating that PBX1 was indirectly regulated by androgens through PLZF. Whereas putative PLZF-binding sites are present in the PBX1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], a preliminary analysis using the TFSEARCH software by our group generated no putative PLZF-binding sites in the upstream region of the human PBX3 gene (data not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that all-trans retinoic acid induced the expression of PBX1 at mRNA level in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells, whereas the PBX3 mRNA level remained unchanged. The protein level of PBX3 was, however, induced by all-trans retinoic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>Interestingly, our data indicate that androgen regulates the expression of PBX3 independently of AR as the R1881 effect was observed in LNCaP cells transfected with siRNA targeting AR and in RWPE-1 cells that express very low levels of AR (not detectable on Western blot) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The androgen effect was also seen in the presence of bicalutamide, an anti-androgen. Although most effects of androgens are mediated by AR, some responses like rise in intracellular calcium and cAMP concentrations seem to take place independent of AR in some cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in AR independent effects of androgens.</p>
      <p>Since androgen had no effect on the PBX3 mRNA level or protein stability in our study, we hypothesized that androgen might regulate the protein synthesis of PBX3 through microRNA. MicroRNAs are short oligonucleotide, 28-24 nucleotides long, that binds to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of their target genes. The binding of a mature microRNA to the RNA-inducing silencing complex (RICS) can initiate translational inhibition and RNA degradation. Putative binding sites for three microRNAs, miR-101, miR-222 and Let-7d were identified in the 3'UTR region of the PBX3 gene by using three different microRNA target prediction software. In this study, we have focused on Let-7d, since transfection with Let-7d mimic, in contrast to transfection of miR-101 and miR-222 mimics, reduced the protein level of endogenous PBX3 in LNCaP cells.</p>
      <p>Let-7d is a microRNA that is part of the Let-7 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Many of the 13 Let-7 family members have been shown to be regulated in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Interestingly, Let-7d was recently identified as an androgen-regulated microRNA in LNCaP and LAPC-4 cell lines following microarray analysis, giving support to our data indicating androgen regulation of PBX3 synthesis through Let-7d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The Let-7 family is involved in normal development and differentiation, and has been shown to act as tumor suppressors in many human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In LNCaP cells, Let-7a was recently shown to have an anti-proliferative effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We were able to detect reduced viability in LNCaP cells transfected with Let-7d (data not shown), demonstrating the possible tumor suppressor function of the Let-7 family in prostate cancer, a function that is supported by the observed down-regulation of Let-7d expression in malignant compared to benign prostate cancer tissue. Two studies have previously reported down-regulation of Let-7d in malignant compared to benign prostate tissue using microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] whereas a third study by Volinia et.al. showed an up-regulation of Let-7d in malignant prostate tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>Whereas Let-7d expression was reduced in prostate cancer, increased expression of PBX3 was observed in malignant versus benign prostate tissue by immunohistochemical staining of prostate specimens with an anti human PBX3 specific monoclonal antibody. We observed nuclear staining of basal cells in benign prostate tissue and no detectable staining of luminal cells. However in malignant tissue, staining was detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of secretory luminal cells. Previous work by Crijns and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] reported increased PBX immunohistochemical staining in both cytoplasm and nuclei of ovarian tumor cells using an anti-PBX1/2/3/4 antibody, which does not differentiate between the different PBX members. Future work will show whether PBX3 has a potential role as a biomarker or drug target in prostate cancer as shown in other types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Here we demonstrate for the first time that PBX3 is up-regulated in malignant prostate tissue. The presented results show that androgen regulates PBX3 expression via Let-7d in the prostate cancer cell lines tested. This is of interest in light of the role of androgens in prostate cancer progression and the role of microRNA in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The putative involvement of PBX in regulation of differentiation and steroidogenesis makes the PBX members interesting candidates for therapeutic targeting in later stages of prostate cancer. It would therefore be of interest to establish whether disruption of the PBX transcription complex formation using PBX-binding peptides like HXR9, can halt progression of advanced stages of prostate cancer.</p>

          <p><bold>Figure S2. PBX3 is post-transcriptionally regulated by androgen</bold>. LNCaP cells were pre-treated for 3 days with medium containing 10% CSS. Cells were then stimulated or left untreated (CSS). <bold>A</bold>) Total RNA was extracted after 48 hours of 10<sup>-10</sup>M R1881 (R1881) and/or 10<sup>-8</sup>M bicalutamide (R1881 + Bic or Bic) treatment to determine the effect of R1881 on the expression levels of PBX3 mRNA by sqRT-PCR relative to CSS. <bold>B</bold>) LNCaP cells were either left untreated (CSS), stimulated with 10<sup>-10</sup>M R1881 (R1881) alone or in combination with 10 &#x3BC;g/ml cycloheximide (R1881 + Cyc) for 48 hours. Cells only stimulated with cycloheximide (Cyc) are shown as control. The cells were pre-treated with cycloheximide for 2 hours before adding 10<sup>-10</sup>M R1881. Western blots were probed with anti- PBX3 antibody and densitometrically analysed. Anti &#x3B1;-tubulin antibody was used as loading control. Data is presented as mean &#xB1; SD (n = 3).</p>
