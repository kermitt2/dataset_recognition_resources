      <abstract>
        <p>The polarized trafficking of membrane proteins into the leading edge of the cell is an integral requirement for cell migration. Myosin VI and its interacting protein optineurin have previously been shown to operate in anterograde trafficking pathways, especially for the polarized delivery of cargo to the basolateral domain in epithelial cells. Here we show that in migratory cells ablation of myosin VI or optineurin inhibits the polarized delivery of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) into the leading edge and leads to profound defects in lamellipodia formation. Depletion of either myosin VI or optineurin, however, does not impair the overall ability of cells to migrate in a random migration assay, but it dramatically reduces directed migration towards a growth factor stimulus. In summary, we identified a specific role for myosin VI and optineurin in directionally persistent cell migration, which involves the polarized delivery of vesicles containing EGFR into the leading edge of the cell.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Migration is a fundamental cellular activity that is crucial for a wide range of cellular events that includes embryonic development, wound healing, inflammation and cancer cell dissemination and metastasis. Cell membrane protrusion at the leading edge and subsequent migration involve a complex set of processes initiated by extracellular signals that trigger regulated actin remodelling at the plasma membrane together with endocytic/exocytic membrane delivery. To initiate forward migration, the cell polarizes along the axis of movement and forms protrusions at its leading edge. These protrusions are stabilized by the assembly of cell-substrate adhesion sites, whereas at the trailing rear end of the cell actomyosin II-dependent contraction releases these adhesions and drives the cell body forward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">(1)</xref>. The formation of membrane protrusions at the leading edge is dependent on actin filament polymerization that is regulated by the Arp2/3 complex and the Rho family of small GTPases; e.g. Rac mediates the formation of broad lamellipodia, whereas cdc42 activation induces cell polarization and filopodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">(2)</xref>. This localized actin filament network formation together with substrate adhesion is part of the basic machinery that drives random cell migration. Although the mechanism of random cell migration has been studied in great detail, far less is known about the complex system of regulation that controls directionally persistent migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">(3)</xref>. Directed migration, which can be triggered by extracellular stimuli such as the topography of the extracellular matrix or by a growth factor gradient, is controlled amongst other factors by polarized signalling at the leading edge. The spatial restriction of signalling receptors and pathways at the leading edge stabilizes selected lamellipodia and thereby maintains the orientation and direction of movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">(3)</xref>.</p>
    <p>It is now widely accepted that the delivery of plasma membrane components and cell surface receptors to the leading edge via anterograde membrane trafficking pathways is important for lamellipodia extension. Exocytosis of vesicles not only from the endocytic recycling compartment is essential for cell locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) but also the polarized delivery of newly synthesized proteins from the Golgi complex into the leading edge is required for cell polarization and persistent migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this study, we have focused on the potential role(s) of myosin VI in mammalian cell locomotion. Myosin VI is a unique member of the myosin superfamily, because it moves towards the minus end of actin filaments, in the opposite direction to all other characterized myosins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">(9)</xref>. This reverse movement is mediated by a unique 53-amino acid insertion (reverse gear) between the converter region in the motor domain and the neck (lever-arm) region. Myosin VI is ubiquitously expressed in higher eukaryotic cells, where it has been linked to a wide variety of different intracellular functions. In Drosophila, myosin VI is required for various membrane remodelling processes during embryogenesis, suggesting potential roles for myosin VI in cell motility such as in epithelial cell migration during dorsal closure in the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">(10)</xref>. Furthermore, in Drosophila ovaries myosin VI is involved in border cell migration, where it interacts and stabilizes &#x3B2;-catenin/E-cadherin adhesion complexes and may also be linked to the formation of membrane protrusions at the leading edge of these moving cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">(11)</xref>.</p>
    <p>In mammalian cells, myosin VI plays important roles in endocytic and exocytic membrane trafficking pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) as well as in cadherin-based cell&#x2013;cell contact morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">(15)</xref>. A number of adaptor molecules have been identified that link myosin VI to different intracellular cargoes associated with specific intracellular functions. For example, myosin VI's function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane is mediated by Disabled-2 (Dab2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">(16)</xref> and the phosphoinositide PIP<sub>2</sub> Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">(17)</xref>, whereas GAIP-interacting protein C-terminus (GIPC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">(18)</xref> and the Ser/Thr transmembrane protein kinase LMTK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">(19)</xref> recruit myosin VI to endosomes and the recycling pathway. Recently, GIPC and myosin VI have been linked to &#x3B1;5&#x3B2;1 integrin trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">(20)</xref>, suggesting a role for myosin VI in focal adhesion turnover. In addition, myosin VI together with another of its interacting proteins optineurin performs an important role in the secretory pathway for the delivery of cargo from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Furthermore, in polarized epithelial cells myosin VI and optineurin are required for the sorting of newly synthesized proteins specifically to the basolateral but not to the apical domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">(22)</xref>. In these cells, myosin VI and optineurin can be found on recycling endosomes, which are an important sorting station for cargo <italic>en route</italic> to the basolateral domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Sorting of cargo emerging from the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi network and delivery to distinct plasma membrane domains not only occurs in epithelial cells but has also been described for motile cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). In migrating fibroblasts, proteins with basolateral sorting motifs are transported into the leading edge, whereas in non-motile cells this transport polarity is lost and secretory vesicles are delivered randomly to the entire plasma membrane.</p>
    <p>Here, we have investigated the molecular mechanism and the potential roles of myosin VI and its binding partners in cell migration. We conclusively show that myosin VI and its interacting protein optineurin are required for the polarized delivery of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) into the leading edge and that the loss of either myosin VI or optineurin leads to severe defects in protrusion formation. We further show that both proteins are essential for growth factor-stimulated directionally persistent migration, but are not components of the basic machinery that drives random cell migration. Thus, our results indicate that the role of myosin VI in cell migration is directly linked to optineurin and both proteins are required for the delivery of cargo into the leading edge so as to control the spatial distribution of signalling receptors and cell adhesion molecules that are important for the directed movement of cells.</p>

        <title>Myosin VI is required for lamellipodia and ruffle formation at the leading edge of cells</title>
        <p>The leading edge of a motile cell contains membrane protrusions that are formed by actin filament polymerization together with polarized vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Myosin VI is enriched in those regions of the plasma membrane in the leading edge that exhibit active lamellipodial protrusions, which characteristically contain membrane ruffles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">(28)</xref>.</p>
        <p>In this article, we have studied the potential role of myosin VI at the leading edge by investigating the migratory behaviour of cells depleted of myosin VI. We first examined whether myosin VI is required for lamellipodia formation/ruffling during mammalian cell migration. To induce synchronized migration and protrusion formation, a wound was scratched into a confluent layer of HeLa cells, which had been transfected with control or myosin VI siRNA smart pool oligos. Control HeLa cells extended a broad, flat lamellipodium, whereas in myosin VI-depleted cells the lamellipodium is lost and replaced by long finger-like protrusions extending into the open wound area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>). Identical results were obtained, when myosin VI functions were inhibited by overexpressing the dominant-negative myosin VI tail domain, i.e. missing the functional motor domain. This approach has been previously shown to inhibit myosin VI-dependent processes in the endocytic pathway and during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). HeLa cells overexpressing fully functional full-length green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged myosin VI extend broad membrane protrusions at the base of the cell, whereas in cells overexpressing GFP-myosin VI tail there are less lamellipodia and more filopodia emerging into the wound space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>These results, showing that myosin VI is required for lamellipodia extension and ruffle formation in HeLa cells, were confirmed and quantified in more motile cells, namely A549, the human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line, which extend very prominent lamellipodia that are covered in dorsal ruffles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C</xref>). These A549 cells were transfected with either control oligonucleotides, smart pool siRNA-targeting myosin VI or with four single oligos specific for myosin VI. A scratch wound was made in a confluent layer of cells and after 1 h the cells were fixed and stained for F-actin. Whereas control A549 cells extend very prominent lamellipodia into the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C</xref>), considerably less of these types of extensions were visible in myosin VI-depleted cells. We counted cells extending large lamellipodia with ruffles into the wound and observed a more than 50% decrease in the ability of myosin VI knockdown (KD) cells to form lamellipodia with ruffles compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1D</xref>). Reassuringly, the four single siRNA oligos targeting myosin VI gave a very similar reduction in the number of lamellipodia as compared with cells depleted by the smart pool siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, in the absence of functional myosin VI, which was depleted either by overexpression of the dominant-negative tail or by siRNA-mediated KD using smart pool siRNA or four single oligos, there is a dramatic reduction in the ability of cells to extend lamellipodia at a scratch wound edge.</p>

        <title>The overall protrusion activity at the plasma membrane is reduced in myosin VI-depleted cells</title>
        <p>The loss of myosin VI results in a dramatic reduction in the number of A549 cells that are able to extend a large lamellipodium with dorsal ruffles into the space of a scratch wound. The presence or absence of these large lamellipodia was quantified at a single time-point 1 h after applying the scratch wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1D</xref>). To visualize the overall membrane dynamics, including smaller protrusion activity at the leading edge facing the wound, A549 cells were analysed by time-lapse microscopy. An example of a large lamellipodium (&gt;5 &#xB5;m on average) that was used to quantify ruffling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1D</xref>) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2A</xref>. These large membrane protrusions are present for at least half an hour and show intensive ruffling activity, as can be seen from the corresponding kymograph. We did not observe any significant differences in their overall dynamics such as e.g. their lifetime, which could have explained the reduction in the total number of these large lamellipodia that were detected in fixed cells depleted of myosin VI. However, thorough analysis of the leading edge of the cells facing the wound revealed that depletion of myosin VI leads to a dramatic decrease in the overall protrusion activity of the plasma membrane, which can only be visualized by time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S2</xref>). As can be seen from the kymographs, myosin VI-depleted cells exhibit less plasma membrane fluctuations at the edge of the cell and less membrane ruffles. Comparing the dynamics of smaller lamellipodia protrusions in control and myosin VI KD cells revealed that they had similar lifetimes and protrusion velocities, but the lamellipodia lengths were slightly shorter in myosin VI-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2C</xref>). These results indicate that myosin VI is involved in the initiation of lamellipodia protrusion.</p>

        <title>Loss of the myosin VI-interacting protein optineurin reduces lamellipodia formation</title>
        <p>The intracellular functions of myosin VI are mediated by interacting adaptor proteins, which target myosin VI to different cellular locations and cargoes. Binding partners such as GIPC, Dab2 and LMTK2 link myosin VI to the endocytic pathway, whereas optineurin mediates myosin VI's role in the biosynthetic secretory pathway. To determine which of these binding partners are required in the process of leading edge protrusion and cell migration, we transfected A549 cells with siRNAs specific for GIPC, optineurin, Dab2, LMTK2 or myosin VI and analysed their ability to extend lamellipodia with dorsal ruffles into a scratch wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A</xref>). We observed in cells with reduced expression levels of optineurin a 50% reduction in the number of cells extending lamellipodia into the scratch wound. A very similar inhibition of protrusion formation was present in myosin VI KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3A</xref>). The loss of Dab2 or LMTK2, however, resulted only in a slight drop in lamellipodia formation, whereas in contrast the absence of GIPC did not cause a loss but an increase in the number of cells with lamellipodia at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A</xref>). Even a double KD of Dab2/GIPC, Dab2/LMTK2 or GIPC/LMTK2 did not inhibit protrusion formation indicating that these binding partners involved in endocytic pathways are unlikely to play partially redundant roles in lamellipodia formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A,B</xref>). Overall, only the loss of optineurin leads to very similar changes in cell morphology and the absence of lamellipodia extending into the wound as observed in myosin VI KD cells (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3D</xref>). This phenotype is mimicked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which also causes a 50% inhibition of protrusion formation in control cells. No additional effect was observed in myosin VI KD cells when cycloheximide was added (Figure SB), suggesting that the loss of leading edge protrusions in myosin VI KD cells must be linked to defects in the secretory pathway. Interestingly, the GTPase Rab8, which has been shown to bind to optineurin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">(30)</xref>, is not required for protrusion formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A,B</xref>).</p>

        <p>Membrane ruffles are not only linked to cell motility but are also essential for macropinocytosis, a specialized endocytic pathway that enables the cell to internalize large amounts of fluid from the external environment. Macropinosomes are induced by growth factors and are formed when a circular ruffle closes or folds back onto itself. As macropinosomes are strictly dependent on membrane ruffles, we assessed macropinocytosis in myosin VI and optineurin-depleted cells. The cells were incubated with 70-kDa dextran and the number of cells containing dextran-positive structures larger than 0.5 &#xB5;m in size was counted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3E</xref>, the loss of myosin VI or optineurin in A549 cells causes a reduction in the number of cells that have internalized macropinosomes. These results indicate that myosin VI and optineurin are involved in the formation of large sheet-like membrane protrusions and membrane ruffles that are linked to cell motility and macropinocytosis.</p>

        <title>Myosin VI and optineurin are required for polarized delivery of EGFR into the leading edge</title>
        <p>In a migrating cell, secretory vesicles are delivered preferentially towards the leading edge by a process that requires intact microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">(7)</xref> and the positioning of the pericentrosomal Golgi ribbon towards the wound edge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">(8)</xref>. In these studies after depolymerization of microtubules or dispersal of Golgi membranes from their pericentrosomal position, normal secretion kinetics were maintained, but the polarized delivery towards the leading edge was lost and defects in directionally persistent migration were observed. As myosin VI and the optineurin-interacting protein Rab8 have been shown to be required for polarized delivery of cargo to the basolateral domain in epithelial cells and towards the synapse in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), we tested whether the loss of myosin VI or optineurin affects directed secretion of newly synthesized proteins towards the leading edge. We investigated the localization of EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase, in control and KD A549 cells at the edge of a scratch wound. In this cell type, the EGFR is concentrated in membrane protrusions extended into the wound edge, thereby generating a spatial distribution of the receptor supporting localized RTK signalling so as to produce directed cell migration. The concentration of EGFR in lamellipodia can be detected with a monoclonal antibody to the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>) and also by incubating the cells for short times (&lt;5 min) with fluorescently labelled epidermal growth factor (EGF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, both assays indicate that active receptor, which is able to bind EGF, is enriched in membrane protrusion in this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>). In the absence of myosin VI or optineurin, however, we observe a dramatic change in the polarized distribution of EGFR at the cell surface lining the wound edge. We specifically detected a loss of EGFR from the plasma membrane facing the wound, but in contrast there was no obvious reduction in the amount of EGFR on the rest of the cell surface such as on lateral membranes that are in contact with neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>). This observation was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, which showed that there was no difference in the amount of EGFR on the total surface of control or KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6A</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that myosin VI and optineurin are required for the polarized delivery, i.e. the directed secretion of EGFR into the leading edge but not for steady-state exocytosis of these membrane proteins. Interestingly, in myosin VI and optineurin KD cells, but not in control cells, we detected an accumulation of small vesicles in the cytoplasm using a monoclonal antibody to the EGFR (13A9, Genentec) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref>). This antibody has been reported to bind to both the occupied and empty EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">(34)</xref> and therefore is able to recognize the receptor in the biosynthetic pathway, before it reaches the cell surface. These small EGFR-containing vesicles are not labelled after endocytosis of Alexa 488-EGF, which further confirms the biosynthetic nature of this compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3</xref>). In optineurin KD cells, we observed that these EGFR-containing vesicles can cluster into larger aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3</xref>). To further characterize the nature of these EGFR-containing vesicles in myosin VI KD cells, double labelling experiments were performed with antibodies to marker proteins of the early and late endocytic pathways such as vps26 (retromer complex), cathepsin D and mannose-6-phosphate receptor. None of these marker proteins showed extensive colocalization with this EGFR-containing compartment, supporting our hypothesis that the EGFR-containing vesicles accumulate in the exocytic and not in the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S4</xref>). Interestingly, also the delivery of &#x3B2;1-integrin towards the front of the cell is affected in myosin VI or optineurin KD cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

        <p>To determine whether myosin VI or optineurin depletion has any effect on random single cell migration in an isotropic environment, A549 cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated glass chambers, time-lapse videos collected and the movements of individual cells were followed using tracking software. The tracks of 3434 control cells, 2577 myosin VI siRNA-treated cells and 1950 optineurin siRNA-treated cells were analysed. Still images of time-lapse microscopy videos of control or siRNA-treated A549 cells with migration tracks superimposed onto the original image sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7A</xref>. Measuring the individual trajectories of the cell centroids and subsequent analysis of the cell movements showed that myosin VI or optineurin depletion results in an increase in the average diffusion coefficient from 0.72 &#xB1; 0.02 (control cells) to 1.08 &#xB1; 0.03 &#xB5;m<sup>2</sup>/min (myosin VI KD cells) and 1.21 &#xB1; 0.05 &#xB5;m<sup>2</sup>/min (optineurin KD cells), which corresponds to the steeper mean-squared displacement (MSD) curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref>.

        <title>Myosin VI and optineurin are requiredfor chemotactic migration</title>
        <p>The directed movement of cells is dependent on spatially restricted receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. As the polarity of EGFR localization is lost in myosin VI and optineurin KD cells, we tested the ability of myosin VI or optineurin KD cells to migrate towards a chemotactic stimulus using a Transwell migration assay. SiRNA-treated A549 cells were plated in the upper chambers of Transwells and the lower chambers were filled with medium with or without 20 ng/mL of EGF. In the absence of EGF, the number of control cells that had migrated after 5 h to the underside of the filter was similar to the number of myosin VI or optineurin KD cells. However, in the presence of EGF in the lower chamber, control cells responded with a fivefold increase in the number of cells migrating towards a chemotactic gradient, whereas in myosin VI or optineurin-depleted cells only a 2.5-fold or 2.8-fold increase in migration was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8A,B</xref>). These results indicate that both myosin VI and optineurin are required to sustain directed migration towards a chemotactic stimulus, and the mechanism involved is the polarized trafficking of membrane components into the leading edge of the cell.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that myosin VI and its interacting protein optineurin are essential for directed cell migration in mammalian cells. The loss of either optineurin or myosin VI inhibits the delivery of EGFR to the leading edge at the front of the cell and causes a dramatic defect in lamellipodia formation. Surprisingly, this does affect random migration of myosin VI or optineurin KD cells; however, both proteins are crucial for cells to perform directed migration towards a chemotactic gradient. As optineurin has been shown to mediate the function of myosin VI in post-Golgi membrane transport, our results indicate that the role of myosin VI in cell motility is linked to anterograde membrane trafficking pathways.</p>
      <p>Numerous lines of evidence now suggest that in a motile polarized cell plasma membrane proteins are delivered into the leading edge in an anterograde direction from the Golgi complex and/or the endocytic recycling pathway. In this process, directed secretion towards the wound edge is dependent on Golgi positioning; however, very little is known about the other constituents of the machinery responsible for polarized delivery into the leading edge. Interestingly, in neither myosin VI or optineurin KD cells was a defect in Golgi reorientation towards the wound observed, indicating that myosin VI and optineurin are not involved in this process, but are most likely involved in polarized post-Golgi transport or sorting steps. Furthermore, as cdc42 is the key regulator of cell polarity and Golgi reorientation, our results suggest that myosin VI and optineurin are not major players in this cdc42-dependent signalling pathway. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that depletion of functional myosin VI and optineurin leads to a reduction of Rac-dependent lamellipodia but to an increase in finger-like protrusions known as filopodia, which in most cell types are formed after cdc42 activation. This replacement of broad lamellipodia and ruffles with finger-like filopodia can be observed both in myosin VI-depleted cells in scratch wound assays of cell monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>) and also during single cell spreading in GFP-myosin VI tail-expressing cells. Interestingly, these dramatic morphological changes do not result in changes in the speed of spreading of myosin VI-depleted cells (data not shown).</p>
      <p>In epithelial cells, distinct pathways for the selective sorting of cargo leaving the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi network to either the apical or basolateral cell surface have been described. In polarized MDCK cells, we have shown a role for myosin VI and optineurin in the selective sorting of cargo such as vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) to the basolateral domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">(22)</xref>. In a motile fibroblast, VSV-G is targeted to the leading edge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">(35)</xref>, suggesting that similar pathways and machinery used for delivery of proteins to the basolateral domain are also required for targeting of proteins to the leading edge in motile cells. Interestingly in neurons, trafficking in the biosynthetic pathway is also targeted to distinct subdomains of the plasma membrane, e.g. to the dendritic surface of the cell body, which is similar to the basolateral domain and to the axonal membrane, which can be regarded as analogous to the apical domain of MDCK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref>. Thus, in hypocampal neurons, exocytic trafficking of AMPA (&#x3B1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor to the postsynaptic membrane at the somatodendritic cell surface, the basolateral analogue, has been shown to require myosin VI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref>. These observations give further support to our observations that a complex of myosin VI and optineurin drives the local delivery of EGFR into the leading edge of a motile cell at the wound edge.</p>
      <p>Previously, myosin VI and optineurin have been linked to constitutive exocytosis of reporter molecules such as secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and VSV-G; depletion of either myosin VI or optineurin resulted in a kinetic delay in delivery of the reporters to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). In this study, we show that the steady-state surface levels of endogenous transmembrane proteins, such as the EGFR, are not affected in myosin VI or optineurin KD cells. The absence of myosin VI or optineurin, however, dramatically impairs the selective delivery of these membrane proteins into the leading edge. These results indicate that myosin VI and optineurin are required for the spatial delivery of membrane proteins in the anterograde trafficking pathway, but are not essential for steady-state secretion of every cargo to the plasma membrane. Transmembrane proteins are either delivered directly from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane or via an intermediate recycling endosome. In polarized epithelial cells, myosin VI and optineurin are present on a specialized recycling compartment, a sorting station for proteins delivered to the basolateral domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">(22)</xref>. In epithelial cells, cargo <italic>en route</italic> to the basolateral domain can pass through a possibly specialized type of recycling endosome, and also in macrophages this type of organelle is important for polarized secretion of cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">(36)</xref>. This proposed role of myosin VI and optineurin in anterograde trafficking pathways, which include the route from the recycling compartment to the plasma membrane, is supported by our finding that polarized delivery of &#x3B2;1-integrin towards the cell front is also affected in myosin VI or optineurin A549 KD cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S5</xref>). Future work will confirm whether the myosin VI-dependent delivery of the EGFR to the leading edge involves a sorting step in a recycling compartment, whereas transport to the rest of the plasma membrane proceeds directly from the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi network and therefore may not be dependent on myosin VI.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the absence of myosin VI or optineurin, which leads to a dramatic reduction in lamellipodia formation at the leading edge, does not lead to defects in random cell migration. In contrast, myosin VI or optineurin-depleted cells show an increase in motility, which is reflected in an increase in MSD as well as the velocity over time. Although it seems surprising that myosin VI and optineurin KD cells with less lamellipodia show increased random migration, this is not a new observation. In epithelial PtK1 cells, non-muscle tropomyosin inhibition causes a loss of lamellipodia, but a dramatic increase in random migration velocity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">(37)</xref>, supporting our observation that indeed cells can migrate without a lamellipodium.</p>
      <p>Although myosin VI or optineurin KD cells do not lack the ability to move, they are impaired in performing directed migration towards a stimulus gradient. This type of movement requires a signal perceived and amplified in a restricted area at the front of the cell. Although a polarized concentration of signalling receptors at the leading edge is not required in all cell types for chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">(38)</xref>, we clearly observed an accumulation of EGFR in the plasma membrane of protrusions at the front of A549 cells close to the coverslip using confocal microscopy. Therefore, we believe that the polarized localization of EGFR at the leading edge of A549 cells enhances localized signalling at the front, which is important for directed migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">(39)</xref>. Polarized secretion has also been shown in migrating fibroblasts, where secretory vesicles are preferentially delivered and inserted at the leading edge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">(7)</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results are consistent with previous work in Drosophila that implicated myosin VI in epithelial cell migration required for dorsal closure during embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">(10)</xref> and in border cell migration in oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">(11)</xref>. In these border cells, inhibition of myosin VI also leads to a reduction in protrusion formation at the leading edge. From Drosophila oocytes, myosin VI can be isolated in a complex with Drosophila E-cadherin and it was therefore proposed that myosin VI promoted protrusion formation by moving towards the minus end of the polymerizing actin filaments while binding to a stationary E-cadherin complex and thereby pushing the actin filaments into the leading edge. At present, we cannot exclude this role for myosin VI in protrusion formation in mammalian cells; however, we did not observe any association of myosin VI with focal adhesion complexes at the leading edge in A549 cells or any other defects in focal adhesion formation or cell spreading in myosin VI-depleted cells. Our results, however, are supported by data showing that although vinculin is a downstream effector of myosin VI at E-cadherin-dependent cell&#x2013;cell contact sites, no changes or defects at integrin-based cell-matrix adhesion sites were observed upon myosin VI depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">(15)</xref>. In contrast, a recent study indicates that in endothelial cells myosin VI and its interacting protein GIPC are important for &#x3B1;5&#x3B2;1 integrin endocytosis and that the absence of either protein causes defects in cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">(20)</xref>. These different results suggest that there are probably cell-specific variations in the involvement of myosin VI in cell adhesion formation.</p>
      <p>In addition, we cannot exclude a role for myosin VI in actin filament reorganization at the leading edge, although so far no interacting protein directly linking myosin VI to the machinery regulating actin filament dynamics has been identified in mammalian cells. However, we have previously shown the recruitment of myosin VI into the leading edge after EGF stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">(28)</xref>. Furthermore, in Drosophila myosin VI has been shown to stabilize actin filaments required for spermatid individualization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">(40)</xref>. Therefore, future work is required to show whether myosin VI coordinates membrane delivery and actin organization at the leading edge.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have clearly shown that myosin VI together with the adaptor protein optineurin is required for the delivery of specific cargo such as the EGFR in the anterograde pathway towards the front of a migrating cell. This delivery is essential for protrusion formation at the leading edge of the cell and for the generation of directionally persistent migration.</p>

        <title>Live-cell imaging and analysis of membrane dynamics</title>
        <p>A549 cells growing on coverslips were wounded with a pipette tip, washed and left to recover at 37&#xB0;C in CO<sub>2</sub>-independent medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Time-lapse videos were acquired between 1 and 2 h after wounding using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a heated stage, 60&#xD7; oil phase-contrast objective and a Photometrics Cool Snap CCD camera (Roper Scientific) driven by O<sc>pen</sc>L<sc>ab</sc> software (Improvision). Images were captured with 2- or 5-second intervals. The dynamics of lamellipodial extensions was analysed using V<sc>olocity</sc> software (Improvision). Kymographs were created from time-lapse sequences and the following parameters were calculated: maximum height of individual peaks (corresponding to lamellipodia length), maximum width of individual peaks (corresponding to lamellipodia lifetime) and the slope of the ascending contours (corresponding to protrusion velocity).</p>

        <title>Flow cytometry</title>
        <p>Steady-state surface and total EGFR and &#x3B2;1 integrin levels were measured by flow cytometry. A549 cells were detached using non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Invitrogen), pelleted by centrifugation, washed with medium, cooled down on ice and incubated with antibodies to EGFR or &#x3B2;1 integrin on ice for 30 min. Unbound antibodies were washed off with ice-cold PBS, the cells were then fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. At this point, each sample was split into two, one half (representing surface amount of the antigen) was incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature and the second half (representing total amount of the antigen) was incubated again with the corresponding primary and then with secondary antibody. Cell-associated Alexa 488 fluorescence was determined using BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cells labelled with secondary antibody only were used as negative controls in each experiment. All experiments were performed in duplicates and repeated three times. Mean fluorescence intensity was calculated using F<sc>low</sc>J<sc>o</sc> software.</p>

        <title>Migration assays</title>
        <p>To assess random migration, A549 cells were labelled with 5 &#xB5;<sc>m</sc> of Cell Tracker CMRA (Invitrogen) for 30 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labelled cells were dissociated using accutase (PAA Laboratories) and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, glutamine and 10 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES. The cells were plated onto a fibronectin-coated coverglass system (chambered 1.0 borosilicate; Lab-Tek) at a density of 20 000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and left in the incubator for 2 h before time-lapse analysis. Cells were visualized using an RT live-imaging workstation (Deltavision; Applied Precision, LLC) and an Olympus IX-70 microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Micromax 1300 YHS; Roper Scientific) in a heated environmental chamber (37&#xB0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Images of cells were taken with 4&#xD7;/0.13 NA objective and Rhodamine-Texas Red filter set (Chroma Technology Corp.) with 2-min intervals for 4 h using S<sc>oftworx</sc> acquisition software (Applied Precision, LLC). Myosin VI or optineurin siRNA-treated cells were imaged simultaneously with controls; 3434 control, 2577 MyoVI and 1950 optineurin siRNA cell tracks were analysed combined from four (for myosin VI) or three (for optineurin) independent siRNA KD experiments. Measurement of <italic>XY</italic> coordinates of cells centroids and subsequent analysis of cell movement were performed using single particle tracking algorithm in G<sc>mimpro</sc> software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">(41)</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/gmimpro/">http://www.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/gmimpro/</ext-link>. MSD of cells was calculated using overlapping intervals. The cell speed was calculated by fitting the MSD data into the random walk equation.</p>
        <p>For Transwell migration assays, 24-well Falcon chambers with 8-&#xB5;m pore membrane (Beckton Dickinson Labware) were used. Both sides of the membrane were coated with 10 &#xB5;g/mL collagen I (Sigma). A549 cells were starved overnight and seeded to the upper chambers at a density of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup>/well in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. The same medium with or without 20 ng/mL EGF was added to the lower well and the cells were allowed to migrate for 5 h at 37&#xB0;C. At the end of the assay, the inserts were fixed and stained using Hema Gurr rapid staining set (BDH), cells from the upper surface were removed with a cotton swab and the cells migrated to the under surface were counted under low magnification. At least 10 independent fields were counted for each membrane, all experiments were performed in duplicates and repeated three times.</p>

      <p><bold>Figure S1: Lamellipodia formation in A549 cells.</bold> A) To assess lamellipodia formation, A549 cells were transfected with control siRNA, siRNA specific for Rab8 or for double knockdowns with siRNA specific for myosin VI and optineurin, for Dab2 and GIPC, for LMTK2 and Dab2 or for LMTK2 and GIPC. The wound healing assay was performed as described in Figure 3. The graph shows a representative experiment presenting the percentage of cells that extend large lamellipodia into the wound. B) Western blot of siRNA knockdown experiment using antibodies to LMTK2, myosin VI, Dab2, optineurin, GIPC and Rab8.</p>

      <p><bold>Figure S5: Myosin VI and optineurin are required for targeting of &#x3B2;1-integrin to the plasma membrane facing the wound.</bold> A) A549 cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA specific to myosin VI or optineurin. The cells were grown to confluence, wounded, left to recover for 1 h, then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibody to &#x3B2;1-integrin and fluorescently labelled phalloidin to label F-actin. Merged colour images are shown in the right-hand panel. The images presented are confocal slices through the base of the cells. B) The steady-state surface levels of &#x3B2;1-integrin in control and myosin VI or optineurin knockdown A549 cells were analysed by FACS as described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>. The graph shows the ratio of surface to total antigen for each condition. Values shown are means &#xB1; SD from three independent siRNA experiments. Bar, 10 &#xB5;m.</p>
