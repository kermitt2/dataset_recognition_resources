      <abstract>
        <p>Slug, a member of the Snail family of transcription factors, has a crucial role in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing several epithelial markers and adhesion molecules, including E-cadherin. A recent study demonstrated that no relationship exists between Slug and E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer. Another study showed that in malignant mesothelioma effusions Slug was associated with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, but that there was no association with E-cadherin. F-ascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types. In this study, we investigated Slug, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 expression using immunohistochemistry in 60 patients with pancreatic cancer and their correlation with carcinoma invasion and metastasis. Additionally, we observed the effects of Slug on invasion and metastasis in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1. Alterations in Slug, MMP-9, and E-cadherin were determined by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Alterations in MMP-9 and F-actin cytoskeleton were determined by immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry (FCM), or gelatin zymography. Slug, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 expression in pancreatic cancer was significantly associated with lymph node metastases and we found a significant correlation between Slug and MMP-9 expression; however, no significant correlation was observed between Slug and E-cadherin expression. Slug transfection significantly increased invasion and metastasis in PANC-1 cells and orthotopic tumor of mouse <italic>in vivo</italic>, and significantly upregulated and activated MMP-9; however, there was no effect on E-cadherin expression. Slug promoted the formation of lamelliopodia or filopodia in PANC-1 cells. The intracellular F-actin and MMP-9 was increased and relocated to the front of the extending pseudopodia from the perinuclear pool in Slug-transfected PANC-1 cells. These results suggest that Slug promotes migration and invasion of PANC-1 cells, which may correlate with the reorganization of MMP-9 and remodeling of the F-actin cytoskeleton, but not with E-cadherin expression.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Epithelial tissues are separated from the stroma by a basement membrane and are highly organized by lateral belts of cell-to-cell adhesion complexes. During the progression from a tumor <italic>in situ</italic> to invasive carcinoma, epithelial tumor cells are released from their neighbors and breach the basement membrane barrier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> It has frequently been suggested that the process underlying this phenomenon involves epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> During EMT, initially polarized epithelial cells acquire attributes reminiscent of mesenchymal cells, thereby inducing cellular invasion into neighboring tissues. Similar processes have been observed in embryogenesis, eg, during gastrulation or during migration of neural crest cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></p>
    <p>EMT can promote metastasis principally, and several master gene regulatory programs known to promote EMT during development have recently been discovered to have key roles in cancer progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Recent work in hepatocellular carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> breast cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> suggests that the transcriptional factors Snail and Slug are important effectors of the process of invasiveness and tumorigenicity through regulation of the expression of E-cadherin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Two zinc finger proteins repress E-cadherin transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> through interaction of the C-terminal region with E-box in the <italic>E-cadherin</italic> promoter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The genetic aberration of <italic>E-cadherin</italic> is a rare event in sporadic carcinomas, and transcription repressors are considered to take a central role in E-cadherin loss. However, the relationship between Slug transcription, Snail transcription, and E-cadherin is largely dependent on tissue and cell type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> In pancreatic cancer, the expression of Snail and Slug showed that pancreatic cancer cells with high Snail expression had no or only low E-cadherin expression. In contrast, cells with low Snail expression had high expression levels of E-cadherin, however, Slug expression exhibited no systematic relationship to the expression levels of E-cadherin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> In malignant mesothelial cells, Snail, Slug and Sip1 levels did not exhibit an inverse association with E-cadherin levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> However, Victoria Bol&#xF3;s <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> have reported that stable expression of Slug in MDCK cells leads to the repression of E-cadherin at the transcriptional level and triggers a complete epithelial to mesenchymal transition.</p>
    <p>In addition to E-cadherin, Snail and Slug can induce the expression of genes associated with a mesenchymal and invasive phenotype, such as fibronectin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Joseph <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> have reported that induction of Slug in UMSCC1 cells did not repress E-cadherin levels or regulate individual movement of UMSCC1 cells. Instead, Slug enhanced cohort migration and Matrigel invasion by UMSCC1 cells, and additionally Slug increased MMP-9 levels, and MMP-9-specific siRNA blocked Slug-induced Matrigel invasion.</p>
    <p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is known for its aggressive growth, characterised by early tissue invasion and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Statistical analysis has revealed a relationship between tumor MMP-9 expression with lymph node involvement and occurrence of distant metastases in PDAC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Koorstra <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> found that invasion and migration in pancreatic cancer was highly related to the transcript level of the EMT-associated transcription factors Slug, Snail, Twist, and MMP-9 mRNA levels. Slug expression showed no systematic relationship to the expression levels of E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer tissue,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> but in mouse skin carcinoma cell lines, Slug and Snail collaborate on tumor growth and metastasis properties by E-cadherin repression, Slug or Snail alone can decrease these properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> In this study, we aimed to examine the expression of Slug, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 in pancreatic cancer and to obtain further insight into the question of whether Slug promotes E-cadherin or MMP-9-induced EMT in pancreatic cancer.</p>

        <title>Patients and Tissue Samples</title>
        <p>Between 1999 and 2009, 60 consecutive pancreatic adenocarcinoma (ordinary ductal carcinoma) specimens for which tissue was available for immunohistochemical staining were identified from the files of General Surgery, the affiliated hospital of medical college, Qingdao University. The principally clinical information, such as pathology, was collected from the hospital charts. All research involving human participants was approved in written form by the patients studied and the ethics committee at the affiliated hospital of medical college, Qingdao University.</p>

        <title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
        <p>Four-micron thick paraffin-embedded sections were cut, removed from paraffin with xylene, and rehydrated in descending dilutions of ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 30&#x2009;min of incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase in absolute methanol. Tissue slides were immunohistochemically stained for Slug (dilution at 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or E-cadherin (dilution at 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or MMP-9 (dilution at 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The samples were digested with 0.01% saponin before incubation with the primary MMP-9 antibody or Slug antibody or E-cadherin antibody for 30&#x2009;min. Background staining was minimized by pre-incubation with 1% normal goat serum for 10&#x2009;min. The sections were incubated with the primary MMP-9 antibody (Slug antibody or E-cadherin antibody) at 4&#xB0;C overnight. This was followed by the avidin-biotin procedure with a streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
        <p>For Slug expression in PANC-1 cells, Slug-transfected or mock-transfected or untreated PANC-1 cells were plated at a density of 5 &#xD7; 10<sup>4</sup>/mm<sup>2</sup> in culture dishes for 24&#x2009;h. After incubation, dishes were washed twice with cold saline. Subsequently, the cells in the dishes were fixed in 0.3&#x2009;mol/l NaCl in 70% ethanol for 30&#x2009;min. The fixed cells were lysed in 0.12&#x2009;N HCl in 70% ethanol for 10&#x2009;min and washed with PBS for 5&#x2009;min three times. The cells were incubated with 1% normal horse serum in PBS for 30&#x2009;min at room temperature. After washes with PBS for 5&#x2009;min, Slug antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as the primary antibody, followed by the rabbit ABC staining system. Slug-positive cells were counted by light microscopy at &#xD7; 200 magnification and expressed as the number of positive cells per 1000 cancer cells.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of Immunohistochemistry Results</title>
        <p>The results of the immunohistochemical stainings were evaluated by the percentage of positively stained carcinoma cells. Expression of Slug or MMP-9 was determined as positive when cytoplasmic and/or perinuclear staining was seen in more than 10% of the tumor cells. Expression of Slug was considered negative when no cells or less than 10% of the tumor cells were stained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Expression of E-cadherin was determined as described in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Briefly, the tumor cells that stained as strongly as normal epithelial cells were considered to be &#x2018;preserved expression' (positive), and those which exhibited weaker staining than normal epithelial cells or showed completely negative staining were considered to be &#x2018;reduced expression' (negative).</p>

        <title>Cell Culture and Stable Transfection of PANC-1 Cells</title>
        <p>The source of pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cell lines used in this study has been described recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> The PANC-1 cell line used in present study was obtained from ATCC, and maintained in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37&#xB0;C in RPMI 1640/Ham's F-12 mixed (1:1) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Human full-long Slug cDNA was prepared by PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed products of total RNA from PANC-1 cells, using the specific primers (5&#x2032;-GGATTCCTCCATTTCCTAAACCTGGTAGTC-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GGATTCGTACTTGCCAGCGGGTCTGGC-3&#x2032;) and LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara). The human slug cDNA was then inserted into the pcDNA3 vector to produce pcDNA3&#x2013;Slug cDNA. The PANC-1 cells were transfected with 3&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>g of pcDNA3&#x2013;Slug cDNA or control pcDNA3 vector as recently described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Gibco BRL). Transient Slug cDNA transfection was obtained in PANC-1 cells, with 2&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>g of plasmid and Lipofectamine reagent in OptiMEM serum-free medium and expression was screened after 24&#x2013;48&#x2009;h. Transfection efficiencies were initially optimized with pcDNA3-GFP plasmid (SinoGenoMax Co., Ltd., China). Stable transfectants were generated after selection with 600&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>g/ml G418 over a period of 4 weeks. Cells were routinely maintained in selection media containing 200&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>g/ml of G418-sulfate to avoid overgrowth of non-transfected cells.</p>

        <p>Normally, PANC-1 expresses Slug only at low levels, as analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> In the present study, PANC-1 cells transfected with Slug cDNA expressed higher levels of Slug protein than the mock-transfected cells and untransfected PANC-1 cells as analyzed by western blot and immunohistology (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). Moreover, the cellular localization of overexpressed Slug was in the cytoplasm.</p>
        <p>We analyzed the effect of Slug on MMP-9 expression in PANC-1 cells, one of the most aggressive pancreatic cancer cell lines. RT-PCR, Q-PCR, and western blot analysis showed that Slug overexpression upregulated MMP-9 at the mRNA and protein level when compared with control or PANC-1 cells infected with empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b&#x2013;d</xref>).</p>
        <p>The ELISA assay of supernatant medium confirmed that overexpression of Slug in PANC-1 cells exhibited a higher level of MMP-9 protein compared with mock or untransfected PANC-1 (<italic>P</italic>=0.039) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p>
        <p>Zymographic analysis was used to assess whether the invasive nature of the Slug overexpression correlated with the gelatinase activity. Gelatinase activity of 82-kDa could be observed with Slug overexpression (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01), but low activity was observed for mock and untransfected PANC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then analyzed the effect of Slug overexpression on E-cadherin expression in PANC-1 cells and no significant change was found in PANC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b&#x2013;d</xref>).</p>
        <p>Subsequently, we investigated whether Slug directly promotes MMP-9 upregulation. Slug-transfected clones were treated with 0.1&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>mol/l BB94, a specific MMPs inhibitor for 24&#x2009;h. It was shown that BB94 decreased MMP-9 upregulation in mRNA and protein level induced by Slug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The importance of Slug, a transcription factor and E-cadherin repressor, to allow cancer cells to downregulate epithelial markers and upregulate mesenchymal markers in order to become motile and invasive has recently been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Moreover, Slug has been shown to modulate expression of a variety of adhesion structures, including desmosomes and adherens junctions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Recent studies have shown that Slug is upregulated in many types of epithelial cancers, including breast,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> gastric carcinomas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> esophageal squamous cell,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> ovarian carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> and cholangiocarcinoma. Slug seems to have an important role in tumor progression and invasion as well as in the downregulation of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin.</p>
      <p>In our study, we reported that immunohistochemical analysis using clinical samples revealed the expression of Slug in pancreatic cancer, suggesting that Slug might have a critical role regarding tumor node metastasis in pancreatic cancer, as Slug reportedly does in other types of malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> A significant relationship was observed between Slug upregulation and tumor node metastasis status; Slug expression was increased in node-positive tumors. Slug may serve as a marker for the prediction of the malignancy of pancreatic cancer after operation. However, in a previous study a correlation between the expression level of Slug and tumor node metastasis status was not obvious in human pancreatic cancer specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> The difference may be because of the limited number of patients or the evaluation the immunohistochemistry results.</p>
      <p>E-cadherin is an important mediator of epithelial adhesion and signaling transduction. Loss of E-cadherin expression has been described in invasion and metastasis of many cancers, including pancreatic cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> In the present study, we found that reduced E-cadherin was significantly associated with histological grade, TNM stage and tumor-node-metastasis, but expression of Slug in pancreatic cancer cells showed no significant relation to a decreased expression of E-cadherin.These results are consistent with recent data indicating that Slug was not associated with E-cadherin in hepatocellular carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>A previous study found that there was no relationship between the expression of E-cadherin or MMP-9 with stage, histology stage, or perineural invasion, but a significant relationship was found between the expression of E-cadherin/MMP-9 ratio and perineural invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> In this study, we found that expression of MMP-9 was significantly associated with nodal metastasis and nervous metastasis in pancreatic cancer tissue; results were consistent with previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> We also found that the pancreatic cancer tissue with high Slug expression had strong MMP-9 expression, and moreover the expression of Slug was significantly associated with MMP-9. This suggests that Slug promotes migration and invasion, and may correlate with the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9, but not with E-cadherin expression.</p>
      <p>To test the significance of Slug expression in pancreatic cancer, we transfected the Slug cDNA into pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1. After transfection, the invasive ability of PANC-1 cells increased dramatically. Slug-transfected cells implanted into nude mice metastasized widely compared with parental untransfected cells. This corroborated the role of Slug in pancreatic cancer progression, and indicates that Slug has an important role in pancreatic cancer invasion and metastasis.</p>
      <p>We also found that Slug cDNA promoted metastasis in pancreatic cancer, but it did not inhibit the expression of E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer cells. We suggested that Slug accelerates pancreatic cancer progression, but not through E-cadherin repression; results that are consistent with a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Thus, it would be unlikely that <italic>E-cadherin</italic> would be the only target gene for Slug proteins, and similarly unlikely that it drives the whole process. These apparent discrepancies in relation to E-cadherin regulation could be a reflection of the specific contribution of various cellular contexts.</p>
      <p>It is reasonable to theorize that Slug is largely involved in migration, ie, cell motility of tumor cells. However, it has been largely unclear how Slug proteins exhibit the invasive activity, and the exact mechanism of Slug-dependent invasion is almost unknown. The present study for the first time has explored the relationship between Slug and MMP-9 in pancreatic cancer and clarified the novel mechanism.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we found that MMP-9 is mainly located in the perinuclear cisterna in PANC-1 cells, but in Slug-transfected clones, MMP-9 is mainly located in the anterior extremity of the filopodia, allowing MMP-9 to digest the extracellular matrix (ECM). <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies showed that Slug apparently upregulated both the expression levels and activities of MMP-9, leading to enhancement of the invasive activity. MMP-9-specific BB94 blocked Slug-induced Matrigel invasion in the malignant PANC-1 cells. These findings indicate that Slug may regulate the metastatic nature of PANC-1 by directly upregulating MMP-9, through enhancement of the invasive activity, ie, the degradation of the ECM. Such Slug-dependent transcriptional change in MMP-9 genes is a new and interesting finding, and the detailed mechanisms, especially the transcriptional factors linking to Slug, may be clarified in future studies.</p>
      <p>A key cellular process associated with the invasive or metastatic program in many cancers is the transformation of epithelial cells toward a mesenchymal state, a process called EMT. Actin-dependent protrusion of cell pseudopodia is a critical element of mesenchymal cell migration and, therefore, of cancer metastasis. However, whether EMT occurs in human cancers and, in particular, whether it is a prerequisite for tumor cell invasion and metastasis, remains a subject of debate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup></p>
      <p>F-ascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types. Fascin forms stable actin bundles with slow dissociation kinetics <italic>in vitro</italic> and is regulated by phosphorylation of serine 39 by protein kinase C (PKC). Cancer cells use invasive finger-like protrusions termed invadopodia to invade into and degrade the ECM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> In the present study, we initially analyzed the intracellular F-actin in Slug-transfected clones and FCM showed that the intracellular F-actin in Slug-transfected clones increased 2.1-fold. We then studied the expression of F-actin using immunofluorescence staining and determined that, in non-treated PANC-1 cells, F-actin is mainly located in the perinuclear cisterna; however, in Slug-transfected clones, F-actin is principally located in the anterior extremity of the filopodia. The results suggested the invadopodia in PANC-1 cells was formed by intracellular F-actin polymerization induced by Slug. We also found that MMP-9 and F-actin together were mainly located in the anterior extremity of the filopodia in Slug-transfected clones, suggesting Slug might transport MMP-9 via F-actin networks. These findings indicate that Slug may regulate the metastatic nature of PANC-1 by stimulating cell motility (probably by modulation of the cytoskeletal structure that is well established).</p>
      <p>Taken together, there is a possibility that Slug may not only transcriptionally increase MMP-9 expression, but is also responsible for the remodeling of the cytoskeleton network. Acting in concert, they may together mediate invasion and metastasis in PANC-1 cells; further study is warranted to elucidate the exact mechanisms involved, and also to evaluate the potential scope of application in additional human carcinoma cell types.</p>
