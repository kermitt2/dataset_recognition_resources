      <abstract>
        <p>The fixed concentration procedure (FCP) has been proposed as an
               alternative to the median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) test
               (organisation for economic co-operation and development
               (OECD) test guideline [TG] 403) for the
               assessment of acute inhalation toxicity. The FCP tests animals of a single gender
               (usually females) at a number of fixed concentration levels in a
               sequential fashion. It begins with a sighting study that precedes the main FCP study
               and is used to determine the main study starting concentration. In this paper, we
               propose a modification to the sighting study and suggest that it should be conducted
               using both male and female animals, rather than just animals of a single gender.
               Statistical analysis demonstrates that, when females are more sensitive, the new
               procedure is likely to give the same classification as the original FCP, whereas, if
               males are more sensitive, the new procedure is much less likely to lead to incorrect
               classification into a less toxic category. If there is no difference in the
                  LC<sub>50</sub> for females and males, the new procedure is slightly more likely
               to classify into a more stringent class than the original FCP. Overall, these results
               show that the revised sighting study ensures gender differences in sensitivity do not
               significantly impact on the performance of the FCP, supporting its use as an
               alternative test method for assessing acute inhalation toxicity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The current internationally accepted methods for assessing the acute inhalation toxicity
            of chemicals are the LC<sub>50</sub> method (described in organisation for
            economic co-operation and development (OECD) TG 403<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327110370983">1</xref></sup>) and the acute toxic class method (ATC; described in OECD TG 436<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327110370983">2</xref></sup>), both of which require lethality as the endpoint. The fixed
            concentration procedure (FCP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327110370983">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327110370983">4</xref></sup> has been proposed as an alternative method and uses signs of &#x2018;evident
            toxicity&#x2019; as the endpoint. The FCP aims to determine a concentration level that
            will lead to evident toxicity, where this means clear signs of toxicity indicating that
            exposure to the next highest concentration would cause severe toxicity requiring
            euthanasia or death in most animals within 14 days. The FCP provides a refinement in
            animal welfare terms over the LC<sub>50</sub> and the ATC methods as it does not require
            death or severe toxicity as an endpoint. In addition, it uses fewer animals,
            particularly in comparison with the LC<sub>50</sub> test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327110370983">1</xref></sup>
         </p>
      <p>Since acute toxicity tests are used to assess the potential hazards and risks to human
            health, the information obtained from the FCP regarding non-lethal signs of toxicity
            provides additional value. However, a major use of the output of acute toxicity studies
            is for the purpose of classification and labelling of chemicals, based on their
            potential hazard. It is therefore important to establish that the proposed FCP protocol
            is satisfactory for this purpose.</p>
      <p>A recent statistical evaluation of the performances of the FCP, the LC<sub>50</sub>
            method and ATC method showed that all three methods perform well in the absence of
            gender differences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327110370983">5</xref></sup> However, performance is affected in all cases when unanticipated gender
            differences are present. While the effect is relatively minor for the ATC and
               LC<sub>50</sub> methods, which test both males and females, the performance of the
            FCP is substantially worsened. In particular, the statistical evaluation of the FCP when
            the LC<sub>50</sub> for males is one-tenth of that for females showed that
            misclassification into a less toxic category can occur with high probability; in some
            cases, nearly 100% of the time.</p>
      <p>The FCP tests animals of a single gender at one or more of four fixed concentration
            levels in a stepwise manner, and unless it is believed that males are likely to be more
            sensitive, females are used for testing. The fixed concentrations correspond to the
               LC<sub>50</sub> values on the boundaries between the Globally Harmonised Scheme
            (GHS) acute toxicity classes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327110370983">6</xref></sup> For example, for dusts and mists, testing is conducted at concentrations of 0.05,
            0.5, 1 or 5 mg/L. Unless there is reliable prior knowledge about the toxicity of the
            test substance, for example if a limit test is to be conducted, the study will generally
            be preceded by a sighting study that is used to determine an appropriate starting
            concentration for the main study. The sighting study and main study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0960327110370983">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0960327110370983">2</xref> , respectively.</p>

      <p>If testing in the main study starts at the highest concentration level, such as 5 mg/L
            for dusts and mists, and no evident toxicity is observed, the substance is regarded as
            unclassified. In this case, the FCP is effectively a limit test. For substances that do
            evoke toxicity and thus require full testing, the use of a sighting study to rapidly
            determine an appropriate starting concentration for the main study, and the use of
            non-fatal evident toxicity as an endpoint, means that the FCP typically uses
            considerably fewer animals and leads to fewer deaths than alternative acute inhalation
            toxicity testing procedures such as those described by TG 403<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327110370983">1</xref></sup> and TG 436,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327110370983">2</xref></sup> as indicated by Price et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327110370983">5</xref></sup>
         </p>
      <p>The use of a single gender in the FCP means that if there are unanticipated gender
            differences in the sensitivity of the animals to a test substance, and the least
            sensitive gender is used erroneously, the procedure may lead to an incorrect
            classification. In a previous analysis of data from the assessment of acute inhalation
            toxicity for 56 substances using LC<sub>50</sub> testing, statistically significant
            gender differences were found in 16 substances (29%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327110370983">5</xref></sup> In the majority of substances where a gender difference was indicated, females
            were more sensitive, with LC<sub>50</sub> values for males up to 19 times that for
            females. However, in some cases, males were more sensitive, with the LC<sub>50</sub>
            value for females up to 12 times that for males. These findings demonstrate that the
            potential for gender differences in sensitivity following inhalation exposure needs to
            be taken into account in assessing the performance of acute inhalation toxicity test
            methods.</p>
      <p>To address the impaired performance of the FCP when male animals are more sensitive than
            females, we propose a modification to the sighting study that is used to determine the
            starting concentration of the main study. It is suggested that the sighting study should
            be conducted using both male and female animals, as described in detail in the next
            section. A statistical evaluation of the performance of the revised protocol is
            presented in the presence and absence of gender differences.</p>

        <title>Modification of the FCP to include both genders in the sighting study</title>
        <p>In order to detect any substantial gender differences in sensitivity to acute
               inhalation toxicity, as well as selecting an appropriate main study starting
               concentration, a new sighting study for the FCP is proposed in which both males and
               females are tested. The new proposed sighting study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0960327110370983">Figure 3</xref> . Initially, two animals, one male and
               one female, are simultaneously exposed at a chosen starting concentration. If both
               animals demonstrate the same response of death, non-fatal evident toxicity or no
               effects, the sighting study either stops and leads to a main study conducted in
               females or continues to test two animals (one male and one female) at
               the next concentration, exactly as in the original proposed FCP sighting study.</p>

        <p>If, at any concentration, a gender difference is indicated, the main study will be
               conducted using the gender that is shown to be the more sensitive, and the sighting
               study continues with that gender alone in such a way as to determine an appropriate
               main study starting concentration. Specifically, if one animal dies and the other
               survives, the sighting study continues by exposing another animal of the more
               sensitive gender at the next lower concentration, unless testing at that
               concentration has already been conducted, in which case the main study starts in the
               more sensitive gender at the next lower concentration to that at which death
               occurred. If instead one animal demonstrates evident toxicity and the other shows no
               toxic effects, the main study starts at that concentration using the gender of the
               animal in which the evident toxicity was observed.</p>
        <p>The main study is conducted using five animals per concentration of the gender
               indicated by the new sighting study as described above but is otherwise identical to
               that proposed previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327110370983">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327110370983">4</xref></sup>

        <title>Statistical evaluation of the FCP with modified sighting study</title>
        <p>Stallard et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327110370983">4</xref></sup> described a method for the statistical evaluation of the FCP. The method is
               based on the assumption that both the probability of death and the probability of
               either death or non-fatal evident toxicity are given by probit concentration-response
               curves with the same slope. Based on these concentration-response curves,
               calculations can be performed to obtain the probability of each possible outcome at
               each of the fixed testing concentrations. This enables the probabilities of
               classification into each of the toxic classes, together with the average number of
               animals required and deaths resulting from the testing of hypothetical substances, to
               be calculated. A gender difference in sensitivity to acute inhalation toxicity may be
               assumed by including concentration-response curves for males and females with the
               same slope but different LC<sub>50</sub> values. Further details are given by Price
               et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327110370983">5</xref></sup>

               TC<sub>50</sub>, denoted by <italic>R</italic>, was taken to be 5, where the

               in 50% of the animals. Concentration-response curve slope values of 10 and 4
               were investigated. A value of 10 was the median concentration-response curve slope
               reported by Greiner,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0960327110370983">7</xref></sup> while 4 was the first percentile value, indicating that 1% of
               substances might have concentration-response curves shallower than this. As the
               performance of all test methods worsens with shallower concentration-response curves,
               it is of particular interest to consider this low value. Results were obtained
               assuming no gender difference or a 10-fold difference in LC<sub>50</sub> values for
               males and females.</p>

      <p>For each LC<sub>50</sub> value (plotted across the bottom of the graph),
            the first vertically sloping line shows the probability (according to the scale
            on the left-hand axis) of classification into class 1, the second into class 1
            or 2 (so that the difference this and the one below is the probability of
            classification into class 2), the third into class 1, 2 or 3 (so that
            the difference between this and the one below is the probability of classification into
            class 3) and so on. The vertical dotted lines give the correct classes based on
            the true LC<sub>50</sub> value and the dashed lines horizontally across the plot show
            the expected number of animals and deaths (using the scale on the right-hand
            axis, with the higher line representing the number of animals). For each
               LC<sub>50</sub> value, the height of the shaded areas gives the probability of
            correct classification, the height of the area below the shaded area is the probability
            of classification into too toxic a class (impossible for true class 1)
            and the height of the area above the shaded area is the probability of classification
            into a class that is not toxic enough (impossible for true class 5). It
            should be noted in the interpretation of the figures that true LC<sub>50</sub> values
            are not evenly spread across the range illustrated. In particular, substances with
            higher LC<sub>50</sub> values are much more common than those with the lower values.
            Properties of the procedures for the majority substances are thus given by the curves
            towards the right-hand side of the plots, although classification of more toxic
            substances remains important.</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0960327110370983">Tables 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0960327110370983">3</xref> give the properties of the
            procedure for hypothetical dusts and mists with LC<sub>50</sub> values 0.03, 0.15, 0.7,
            1, 1.1, 2.5 and 10 mg/L, <italic>R</italic> equal to 5 and concentration-response curve
            slope values of 4 and 10. The sighting study starting concentration was assumed to
            depend on the true LC<sub>50</sub> to reflect the situation in which prior knowledge of
            the test substance is used to choose the initial concentration. As such, for the
            hypothetical substances listed above, starting concentrations of 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.5,
            0.5, 1 and 5 mg/L were used, respectively. In practice, if prior knowledge was available
            to determine the sighting study starting concentration, a sighting study may not be
            needed and the procedure could commence with the main study. However, this would depend
            on the reliability of the prior information. As in the figures, results in the tables
            are presented assuming no gender difference or a 10-fold difference in LC<sub>50</sub>
            values for males and females. The probabilities of classification into the correct GHS
            class based on the true LC<sub>50</sub> value are shown in bold.</p>
      <p>In the absence of a gender difference, the new procedure is slightly more stringent than
            the FCP using the original single-gender sighting study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327110370983">5</xref></sup> For small gender differences, the performance of the procedure will be similar to
            that when there is no gender difference. However, as the difference between the genders
            increases, an observation of death or non-fatal toxicity in one of the genders drives
            the choice of starting concentration, and it is easier to identify the more sensitive
            gender for subsequent use in the main study. As such, in the presence of larger gender
            differences, the revised sighting study substantially improves the performance of the
            FCP.</p>
      <p>The default for the FCP main study, which remains unchanged, is to use females. This
            means that the FCP with the revised sighting study is most like the FCP with the
            original single-gender sighting study when females are the more sensitive gender. In
            fact, a comparison of the probabilities in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0960327110370983">Table 2</xref> (females more sensitive)
            with those generated by Price et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327110370983">5</xref></sup> for the case of no gender difference using the original sighting study shows
            nearly identical probabilities of correct classification.</p>
      <p>If males are more sensitive than females and the concentration-response curve is
            shallow, in this case a slope of 4, there is a small chance that evident toxicity or
            death will occur at the same concentration in both males and females. In this case, the
            main study would use females despite them being the less sensitive gender. The result of
            this is that the procedure is a little less stringent when males are more sensitive than
            females, with a slightly higher chance of misclassification into a less toxic class. As
            shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0960327110370983">Table 3</xref>, this is
            particularly true for substances with a true LC<sub>50</sub> of 0.03 mg/L belonging to
            the most toxic class 1. In this case, there is a 7% chance of misclassification
            into the less toxic class 2 when males are more sensitive than females compared to a
            0.1% chance when females are more sensitive than males (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0960327110370983">Table 2</xref>). It should be
            stressed, however, that the chance of under-classification is small and certainly no
            larger than for other test procedures. The substantial under-classification observed for
            the original female-only FCP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327110370983">5</xref></sup> when females are less sensitive than males is avoided.</p>
      <p>The number of animals required in the FCP with revised sighting study is, not
            surprisingly, slightly higher than for the FCP using the original sighting study, since
            the revised sighting study requires exposure of both males and females. When the
            sighting study starts at a concentration above the LC<sub>50</sub>, the number of deaths
            is also increased slightly. Despite this, the number of animals exposed and the number
            of deaths remain considerably lower than for other test procedures.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this paper, we have proposed a new sighting study for the FCP. In the original
            sighting study, a single female animal is tested at each concentration in order to
            determine an appropriate starting concentration for the main study. The main study is
            then conducted using females. In the revised sighting study, two animals, one male and
            one female, are tested at each concentration. If a gender difference is apparent, the
            main study is conducted in the more sensitive gender, otherwise females are used.</p>
      <p>This modification is proposed in light of our previous analyses that demonstrated the
            potential for gender differences in sensitivity to acute inhalation toxicity, with males
            or females being the more sensitive gender, and the impaired performance of the FCP when
            males are more sensitive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327110370983">5</xref></sup> In the absence of a gender difference, the classification performance of the FCP
            is good and is broadly comparable to both the LC<sub>50</sub> method (OECD TG 403<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327110370983">1</xref></sup>) and the ATC method (OECD TG 436<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327110370983">2</xref></sup>), which are currently used for the assessment of acute inhalation
            toxicity.</p>
      <p>A statistical evaluation of the new procedure has been reported here. It is shown that
            if there is no gender difference in sensitivity to acute inhalation toxicity, the new
            procedure is slightly more stringent than the original. This is unsurprising since the
            main procedure is more likely to start at a lower concentration. To illustrate this,
            suppose that evident toxicity is possible at 1 mg/L but very unlikely at any lower
            concentration. According to the original sighting study, if toxicity is observed for the
            single animal tested at 1 mg/L, the main study will start at 1 mg/L. If toxicity is not
            observed, the main study will start at 5 mg/L. With the modified sighting study, the
            main study will start at 1 mg/L if either of the two animals tested at 1 mg/L
            demonstrate toxicity, and at 5 mg/L otherwise. The probability of observing signs of
            toxicity in at least one animal is obviously higher when two animals are observed than
            when one is observed, so that the lower starting concentration is more likely for the
            revised sighting study than for the original. This in turn leads to an increased chance
            of observing evident toxicity or death at the lower concentration, and hence to a more
            stringent classification.</p>
      <p>If females are more sensitive than males, the classification properties of the new
            procedure are nearly identical to those of the original FCP, which uses females by
            default. Moreover, the larger the gender difference, the more similar the procedures
            become due to the increased likelihood of selecting females for the main study.</p>
      <p>If males are more sensitive than females, the original procedure, which does not
            generally test males, carries a high risk of under-classifying substances. This was a
            cause for concern given that males have been shown to be more sensitive than females to
            some substances, and that this might not be anticipated prior to testing. While the new
            procedure, which includes males in the sighting study, does not completely eradicate
            under-classification, it corrects the tendency of the original FCP to substantially
            under-classify substances when males are more sensitive than females.</p>
      <p>As in previous similar statistical evaluations, the results are based on the assumption
            that concentration-response curves are of the probit form. An additional assumption is
            that these curves have equal slopes for males and for females and for lethality and
            toxicity. Whilst further evaluations could be conducted based on different statistical
            modelling assumptions, the qualitative comparison of the procedures is unlikely to be
            changed.</p>
      <p>In all cases, the new procedure uses a slightly larger number of animals than the
            original FCP, since pairs of animals rather than single females are now required in the
            sighting study. However, animal numbers remain considerably lower than for other test
            methods, and the test continues to provide a refinement. We therefore consider that this
            additional cost is worthwhile in light of the improved characteristics of the new
            procedure.</p>
