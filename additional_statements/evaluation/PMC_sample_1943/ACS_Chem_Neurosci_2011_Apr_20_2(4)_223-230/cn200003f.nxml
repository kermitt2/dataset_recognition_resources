        <p>Calmodulin (CaM) and neurogranin (Ng) are two abundant neuronal proteins whose interactions are implicated in the regulation of synaptic responses and plasticity. We employed the &#x201C;low-calcium&#x201D; model of epilepsy in hippocampal slices to investigate the mobilization of these two proteins in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Perfusion of mouse hippocampal slices with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free artificial CSF (ACSF) caused a suppression of synaptic transmission and generation of epileptic activity; these responses could be reversed by normal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing ACSF. Fluorescence immunochemical staining of control hippocampal slices bathed in normal ACSF revealed that CaM and Ng were more concentrated in soma than in dendrites; especially for CaM, it was concentrated in the nucleus. Perfusion of hippocampal slices with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free ACSF caused translocation of these two proteins from soma to dendrites, and this trafficking was also reversed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing buffer. A reduction of &#x223C;15 and 40 nM intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, caused half-maximum translocation of Ng and CaM, respectively. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were the most responsive to this Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive translocation as compared to those from other areas of the hippocampus. These results illustrated the unique feature of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in sequestering high concentrations of CaM and Ng in soma and releasing them to distal dendrites at reducing level of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p>

    <p>Interactions of CaM and Ng have been shown to be sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in vitro;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> however, the effect of changing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, on their interactions in neurons has not been investigated. Since a reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is expected to affect the interactions of CaM and Ng, we sought the &#x201C;low-calcium&#x201D; model of epilepsy in hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) to investigate the trafficking of these two proteins in CA1 pyramidal neurons.

    <p>In this study, we employed immunochemical staining and confocal microscopy to investigate cellular and subcellular localizations of CaM and Ng in hippocampal slices in response to changing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. These tissue slices were bathed alternately in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffers for monitoring their effects on the synaptic responses, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and trafficking of CaM and Ng. Our results revealed that CaM and Ng were more concentrated in the soma and less abundant in the dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons under basal conditions. In particular, we found that a high level of CaM was sequestered in the nucleus. Perfusion of the tissue slices with EGTA-containing buffer caused a suppression of synaptic response, induction of epileptic activity, and a slow reduction of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This treatment also caused translocation of CaM and Ng from soma to dendrites. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive mobilization of CaM was most prominent for CA1 pyramidal neurons and was less pronounced among those in the neighboring CA2 and CA3 areas.</p>

        <title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Sensitive Mobilization of CaM and Ng between Soma and Dendrites</title>
        <p>Hippocampal slices bathed in normal ACSF have been used routinely for monitoring the synaptic responses. First, we investigated the cellular and subcellular localization of CaM and Ng of these tissue slices by fluorescence immunochemical staining. The immunoreactivity (IR) of these two proteins appeared to colocalize in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Py) (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For CaM, it was largely concentrated in the nucleus, whereas its staining intensity in dendrites within stratum radiatum (Sr) and stratum oriens (So) was very weak (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and E). For Ng, its localization in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and apical dendrite was evident but the staining pattern in basal dendrite within So was patchy (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and F). Both proteins exhibited strong colocalization in nucleus as seen in the merged images with DAPI staining (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C and D).</p>

Control tissue sections were examined with 100&#xD7; objectives for CaM (Alexa 594) and Ng (FITC) IR, and nucleus (DAPI) of neurons in the CA1 region. CaM IR (A and E) of CA1 pyramidal neurons was largely confined to the nucleus and that of Ng was in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and dendrites (B and F). The nuclear staining of CaM and Ng could be seen in the merged images (D and H), where Ng- and CaM-IR coincide with that of DAPI (C and D). The dendritic staining of Ng in the stratum radiatum (Sr) was evident, and that in stratum oriens (So) was patchy. In comparison, the dendritic staining of CaM was very weak (compare E and F). Also noted that there were several DAPI-positive cells among these confocal images that did not stain positively with either CaM or Ng (indicated by the arrows); these cells are likely interneurons. The scale bars are 5 &#x3BC;m.</p>

        <p>We then tested whether bathing hippocampal slices in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free ACSF had any effect on neuronal activity by monitoring the evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the CA1 region. Perfusion of EGTA-containing ACSF (EGTA/ACSF) caused a suppression of the slope of fEPSP, and this response induced by either a short-term (5 min) or long-term (20 min) exposure could be completely reversed by switching back to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing ACSF (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results indicate that a reduction of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by perfusion of EGTA/ACSF up to 20 min does not cause any obvious ill effect to the neurons.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Immunochemical staining patterns of the hippocampal slices exposed to EGTA/ACSF for different lengths of time showed that there was a progressive increase in the IRs of CaM and Ng in dendrites with a concomitant reduction of those in the cell layers (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This response was most prominent for the CA1 pyramidal neurons and less so among those in other regions of the hippocampus. For CaM, the increase in dendritic IR was most evident for those slices exposed to EGTA/ACSF for 15 and 20 min (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D and E). It was most striking that after 20 min of exposure to EGTA/ACSF the CaM IR of CA1 pyramidal cell layer appeared even less intense than that of the dendrites (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E). For Ng, the increase in dendritic IR was discernible after 5 min of exposure (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B) and also became more prominent after 15 and 20 min (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D and E). Re-perfusion of the EGTA/ACSF-treated slices with normal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing ACSF restored the original localization patterns of these two proteins (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F). These findings indicate that CaM and Ng are uniquely responsive to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated mobilization in CA1 pyramidal neurons.</p>

        <title>Distinct Differences among the CA1 and Neighboring CA2 and CA3 Neurons</title>
        <p>In hippocampus, Ng and CaM were colocalized in all principle neurons at the various subfields. Under the basal conditions, these proteins exhibited higher concentrations in soma than in dendrites with the exception of pyramidal neurons in subiculum complex, which exhibited a uniform distribution of both Ng and CaM in all cellular compartments (data not shown). Treatment of the slices with EGTA/ACSF caused exit of CaM and Ng from soma to dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons; however, this trafficking was less apparent for those neurons residing in CA2 and CA3 subfields (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). For these latter two neuronal populations, a reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> caused an exit of CaM from nucleus to cytoplasm and proximal dendrites, but much less to distal dendrites (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E and F). Thus, a prominent somatic colocalization of CaM and Ng was observed in the merged images (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F). In these EGTA/ACSF-treated tissues, the neuronal populations between CA1 and CA2, and also those of CA3, could be clearly distinguished.</p>

The CA3 region was identified by the appearance of stratum lucidem (SLu). Pyramidal neurons from CA2 and CA3 regions appeared slightly larger than those of the CA1. In the merged images of control (C), CaM was colocalized with Ng in the nucleus with a relatively low abundance in the cytoplasm and dendrites within stratum radiatum (Sr) and stratum oriens (So). In the EGTA/ACSF-treated tissue (F), CaM was greatly reduced in the soma of CA1 neurons, whereas those in the CA2 and CA3 retained CaM in the soma and proximal dendrites. Mixed populations of CA1 and CA2 neurons were distinguishable in this EGTA/ACSF-treated tissue. The scale bars are 50 &#x3BC;m.</p>

        <p>The fluorescence intensity of doubly stained sections was measured extending from soma to distal dendrites (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In the control (panel A), the peak staining intensities of CaM (red) and Ng (green) resided in the cell layer and their average intensities in dendrites were approximately 10 and 30% of the value of soma, respectively. After 20 min of exposure to EGTA/ACSF (panel B), the somatic CaM and Ng IRs were greatly reduced compared to the control. Translocation of Ng from soma to dendrites could be detected 5 min after exposure to EGTA/ACSF, and there was a delay for the movement of CaM, which was apparent 10 min after the treatment. After 15 min, the CaM IR spread evenly in the entire dendritic field. Re-perfusion with normal ACSF restored the original cellular distribution patterns of these two proteins (panel C).</p>

        <title>EGTA-Induced Changes in the Intracellular Calcium</title>
        <p>Hippocampal slices loaded with Fluo-4AM Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator were imaged by two-photon excitation generated by a titanium:sapphire (Ti:Sa) pulsed infrared laser, which allowed for penetration into tissue slices. Bathing the tissue slices with ACSF resulted in a slow decay of neuronal Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity in spite of the measures to reduce laser transmission and shorten the exposure time during image acquisition. Thus, a control decay curve was established before treating the slices with EGTA/ACSF (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In these time-series experiments, images of the CA1 neurons were collected for 5 min in the presence of normal ACSF, then switched to EGTA/ACSF for 15 min, and finally perfused with EGTA/ACSF + 10 &#x3BC;M 4-Br-A23187 (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). Five minutes after exposure to EGTA (at 10 min time point), the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was reduced by &#x223C;30% of the control, and after 10 and 15 min exposure the reductions were &#x223C;35 and 40%, respectively. Upon exposure to EGTA/ACSF + Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore for 10 min (at 30 min) the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was &#x223C;10% of the control. Addition of calcium ionophore in the presence of EGTA/ACSF was used for estimation of the approximate maximal reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the neurons. Since the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> of hippocampal neurons in normal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing buffer is &#x223C;100 nM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> and the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of Fluo-4/Ca<sup>2+</sup> is 1 &#x3BC;M in situ, the net reduction in the Fluo-4 fluorescence from the basal level could be used as an approximate measure of the reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. The observed mobilization of Ng reached near maximum after 5 min of exposure to EGTA/ACSF (see Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C); we estimated that a half-maximum response would occur at a reduction of &#x223C;15% of Fluo-4 fluorescence, namely, &#x223C;15 nM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. A similar estimate for the half-maximum mobilization of CaM, after 15 min exposure to EGTA/ACSF, was a reduction of &#x223C;40 nM of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. The EGTA-mediated reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> could be reversed by re-perfusion with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing buffer (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A).</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Perfusion of mouse hippocampal slices with low levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (&#x2264;0.2 mM) or EGTA-containing solution blocks synaptic transmission of pyramidal neurons and results in the development of seizurelike activity in the CA1 region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> induces neuronal hyperexcitability caused by several potential mechanisms, including reduction of the surface-charge screening, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> current, synaptic GABAergic inhibition, as well as increasing field effects and gap junctions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> However, the extent of reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in this model system has not been investigated. To our surprise, perfusion of the tissue slices with EGTA/ACSF only caused a minor reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and this may explain why the perfusion with this solution for 20 min did not cause any obvious deleterious effect of the neurons. Under the basal conditions, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is maintained at &#x223C;100 nM while the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is significantly higher at 1&#x2212;2 mM. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer, regulators of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, and efflux pathways are responsible for maintaining such a low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> inside the cell.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) Fine tune regulation of each of these components prevents a large increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that could cause cell death as in the cases of ischemia- or epilepsy-induced neurotoxicity. These regulatory components are also likely to play a role in preventing excessive loss of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. The reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> together with the increase in neuronal excitability may trigger the redistribution of Ng and CaM from soma to distal dendrites in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Recently, we have also observed that high frequency stimulation-mediated induction of LTP in the CA1 region also triggered translocation of both Ng and CaM from soma to dendrites.</p>
      <p>Studies with hippocampal neurons in cultures showed that stimulation-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and NMDA receptors caused translocation of CaM from cytoplasm to nucleus.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) Another study indicated that unless pretreatment of hippocampal neuron cultures with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer containing 2 mM EGTA, elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by glutamate or NMDA was not effective to cause nuclear translocation of CaM.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>) In these EGTA-treated neurons, EGFP-CaM, visualized by confocal imaging, appeared to localize more in the cytoplasm and proximal dendrites than in the nucleus. This observation agreed with the results shown here for the EGTA/ACSF-treated acute hippocampal slices, in which CaM was redistributed to cytoplasm and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Re-perfusion with normal ACSF induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent translocation of CaM from cytoplasm and dendrites to the nucleus. Thus, the direction of CaM trafficking may be dependent on its basal levels at different cellular compartments. In the acute hippocampal slices, CaM is already concentrated in the nucleus of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and a perturbation of its resting state causes its exit from nucleus to cytoplasm and dendrites. In this &#x201C;low-calcium&#x201D; model of epilepsy in hippocampal slices, translocation of Ng and CaM from soma to dendrites may contribute to the development of epileptiform activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons.</p>
      <p>The net movement of somatic Ng to dendrites was not as pronounced as that of nuclear CaM, which, eventually, became equal to or even slightly less than its concentration in the dendrites. Mobilization of CaM from nucleus to distal dendrites could be caused by the dissociation of CaM from its nuclear binding components, changes in the permeability of the nuclear pore complex for free diffusion, and/or transported by a carrier. It is also possible that an initial exit of Ng from the nucleus facilitates the translocation of CaM.</p>
      <p>Pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region are the most sensitive to the low-calcium induced epileptiform activity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) This neuronal population also exhibited a higher sensitivity to the low-calcium mediated translocation of Ng and CaM from soma to dendrites as compared to other neurons in the hippocampus, such as those in the neighboring CA2 and CA3. Morphologically, CA2 neurons are similar to those of the CA3 in size but they are not innervated by the mossy fibers from the dentate gyrus. Molecularly, CA2 neurons express some distinct genes from the neighboring field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> and they, CA3 neurons too, are uniquely spared in Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>) CA2 neurons are also resistant to temporal lobe epilepsy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>) and are resistant to plastic changes by conventional protocols that induce LTP and LTD in the CA1 region.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>) Much of these characteristics of the CA2 neurons are likely related to their differences from the CA1 neurons in handling Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated responses (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The boundary between CA1 and CA2 is not easily defined because mixed populations of cells are present. However, the current study clearly distinguished the CA1 from the CA2 neurons following treatment of the tissue slices with EGTA/ACSF.</p>

        <title>Preparation and Treatment of Hippocampal Slices</title>
        <p>Transverse hippocampal slices (400 &#x3BC;m) were kept for recovery after slicing for &#x223C;2 h in oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) ACSF containing the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 4.9 KCl, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25.6 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 <sc>d</sc>-glucose, pH 7.4. The slices were submerged in a chamber superfused with oxygenated ACSF at a flow rate of &#x223C;2 mL/min. Glass electrodes (1&#x2212;4 M&#x3A9;) filled with ACSF were used both for stimulation of Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers and for recording of fEPSP from stratum radiatum and the amplitude of POPS from the cell layer of the CA1 area. The slope of fEPSP was calculated for indexing the synaptic response. After maintaining a stabled baseline at a current that gave &#x223C;1/3 of the maximal fEPSP response for at least 20 min, the slice was perfused with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free ACSF that contained 2.5 mM EGTA for a timed period as stated in the figure legend. Afterward, the perfusate was switched back to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing ACSF. At the end of incubation, the tissue slice was quickly removed from the recording chamber and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Synaptic responses were amplified with an AxoClamp 2B or Multiclamp 700B apparatus, digitized by CED power 1401, and analyzed by Signal 4 software (Cambridge Electronic Design).</p>

Tissue sections were treated sequentially with PBS containing 0.5% NP-40 and 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> each for a minimum of 15 min and blocked with 2.5% horse serum. Tissues were incubated with a mixture of primary antibodies (rabbit anti-Ng Ab#2641, 1/1250; mouse anti-CaM, 1/500) in PBS containing 0.025% horse serum and 0.1% thimerosal overnight at room temperature. CaM was first revealed by incubation with ImmPRESS peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 4 h and Alexa 594-tyramine/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution (one hydrogen peroxide-urea adduct tablet and stock Alexa 594-tyramine in 10 mL of 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0) at room temperature for 10 min; the reaction was terminated with 10 mM HCl for 30 min. Then, Ng was revealed by incubation with ImmPRESS anti-rabbit IgG for 4 h and FITC-tryamine/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min, and then terminated with 10 mM HCl.
