      <abstract>
        <p>Several studies indicate that adult stem cells may improve the recovery from acute tissue injury. It has been suggested that they may contribute to tissue regeneration by the release of paracrine factors promoting proliferation of tissue resident cells. However, the factors involved remain unknown. In the present study we found that microvesicles (MVs) derived from human liver stem cells (HLSC) induced <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation and apoptosis resistance of human and rat hepatocytes. These effects required internalization of MVs in the hepatocytes by an &#x3B1;<sub>4</sub>-integrin-dependent mechanism. However, MVs pre-treated with RNase, even if internalized, were unable to induce hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis resistance, suggesting an RNA-dependent effect. Microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that MVs were shuttling a specific subset of cellular mRNA, such as mRNA associated in the control of transcription, translation, proliferation and apoptosis. When administered <italic>in vivo</italic>, MVs accelerated the morphological and functional recovery of liver in a model of 70% hepatectomy in rats. This effect was associated with increase in hepatocyte proliferation and was abolished by RNase pre-treatment of MVs. Using human AGO2, as a reporter gene present in MVs, we found the expression of human AGO2 mRNA and protein in the liver of hepatectomized rats treated with MVs. These data suggested a translation of the MV shuttled mRNA into hepatocytes of treated rats. In conclusion, these results suggest that MVs derived from HLSC may activate a proliferative program in remnant hepatocytes after hepatectomy by a horizontal transfer of specific mRNA subsets.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Several reports suggest that the administration of <italic>in vitro</italic> expanded stem cells might promote liver regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>]. Sources of pluripotent cells with hepatic potential include adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>], bone marrow derived-stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>] and embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. However, the mechanisms involved in hepatic regeneration are not completely understood and the relative contribution of mature hepatocytes and of resident stem cells is still intensely debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. It has been suggested that bone marrow derived stem cells may engraft in the liver undergoing transdifferentiation or fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. However, more recent studies have suggested that tissue regeneration triggered by exogenous stem cells may depend on the release of paracrine factors rather than on stem cell transdifferentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>]. The liver is known to have the capacity to regenerate after injury induced by chemicals, partial surgical resection or sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. Following partial hepatectomy, most of the quiescent hepatocytes in the remnant liver tissue quickly proliferate leading to rapid restoration of liver mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. Whether resident stem cells are involved in such regeneration remains unknown. We recently described in the adult human liver a population of pluripotent resident liver stem cells (HLSC) able to localize within the injured liver and contribute to liver regeneration when injected in mice with acute liver failure induced by acetoaminophene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. Recently, it has been proposed that a dynamic stem cell regulation may occur as result of differentiated cell-stem cell interaction <italic>via</italic> a microvesicle (MV)-based genetic information transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. Progenitor/stem cells may re-direct the behaviour of differentiated cells by a horizontal transfer of mRNA shuttled by MVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>] and conversely differentiated cells may influence the stem cell phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. MVs are derived from the endosomal membrane compartment after fusion with the plasma membrane and are shed from the cell surface of activated cells. MVs are now recognized to have an important role in cell to cell communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. Ratajczak and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>] demonstrated that MVs derived from embryonic stem cells may contribute to the cell-fate decision and may represent one of the critical components that support self-renewal and expansion of stem cells. We demonstrated that MVs derived from endothelial progenitor cells may activate an angiogenic program in mature quiescent endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>] and that mRNA shuttled by MVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells may induce repair of acute kidney injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. Recently Kostin and Popescu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>] demonstrated that the interstitial Cajal-like cells that have been described to be present in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>], communicate with neighbouring cells <italic>via</italic> shedding of MVs.</p>
      <p>In the present study we characterized the MVs derived from HLSC and their potential to induce proliferation and apoptosis resistance in cultured human hepatocytes and to favour liver regeneration in the model of 70% hepatectomy in rats.</p>

        <title>Isolation and characterization of HLSC</title>
        <p>HLSC were isolated from human cryopreserved normal adult hepatocytes (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). The isolation, culture and characterization of HLSC were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. By cytofluorimetric analysis HLSC expressed the mesenchymal stem cell markers CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90 but not the haematopoietic and endothelial markers CD34, -CD45, -CD14, -CD117, -CD133, -CD31, -CD144. Moreover, HLSC were positive for &#x3B1;<sub>5</sub>-integrin, &#x3B1;<sub>4</sub>-integrin, &#x3B1;<sub>6</sub>-integrin and -&#x3B1;v&#x3B2;<sub>3</sub>-integrin. By immunofluorescence HLSC were positive for the hepatic markers human albumin and &#x3B1;-fetoprotein, for the resident stem cells markers vimentin and nestin and were negative for the oval cell markers CD34, CD117 and cytocheratin19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. In addition, HLSC expressed the embryonic stem cell markers nanog, Oct4, SOX2 and SSEA4. Before use HLSC were shown to undergo osteogenic, endothelial and hepatic differentiation under appropriate culture conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>].</p>

        <title>Isolation of MVs</title>
        <p>MVs were obtained from supernatants of HLSC cultured overnight in &#x3B1;-MEM deprived of foetal calf serum (FCS). The viability of HLSC at the time of MV collection was &gt;99% as detected by trypan blue exclusion. After centrifugation at 2000 &#xD7;<italic>g</italic> for 20 min. cell-free supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 &#xD7;<italic>g</italic> (Beckman Coulter Optima L-90K, Optima L-90K, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) for 1 hr at 4&#xB0;C, washed in serum-free medium 199 containing Hepes 25 mM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and submitted to a second ultracentrifugation in the same conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. The protein content of MV preparation was quantified by Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). To trace MVs by fluorescent microscopy or cytofluorimetry, MVs were labelled with the red fluorescent aliphatic chromophore PKH26 (Sigma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. Endotoxin contamination of MVs was excluded by Limulus test (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA).</p>
        <p>In selected experiments MVs from HLSC were treated with 1 U/ml RNase (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>] for 1 hr at 37&#xB0;C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 U/ml RNase inhibitor (Ambion) followed by ultracentrifugation. The effectiveness of RNase treatment was evaluated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>] by spectrophotometer analysis of total extracted RNA (untreated: 4.1 &#xB1; 0.3 &#x3BC;g RNA/mg protein MVs; RNase treated: &lt;0.2 &#x3BC;g RNA/mg protein MVs). As control, MVs were treated with 1 U/ml DNase (Ambion) for 1 hr at 37&#xB0;C.</p>

        <title>Cytofluorimetric analysis of MVs</title>
        <p>The size of MVs was determined by cytofluorimetry as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>] using beads of different sizes (1, 2 and 4 &#x3BC;m; Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). The analysis was performed using a log scale for forward scatter and side scatter parameters. Moreover, the size of MVs, was evaluated by the Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments, Malvern Worcestershire, UK). Cytofluorimetric analysis for the detection of surface molecules was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>], using the following FITC- or PE-conjugated antibodies directed to: CD44 (Dakocytomation, Copenhagen, Denmark), CD29, &#x3B1;4-integrin, (BD Pharmingen), &#x3B1;5-integrin, &#x3B1;6-integrin (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and HLA-I (BD Pharmingen). FITC or PE mouse nonimmune isotypic IgG (Dakocytomation, Copenhagen, Denmark) were used as control.</p>

        <title>Culture of hepatocytes</title>
        <p>Human hepatocytes (Lonza) were cultured in William's medium supplemented with 10% of FCS, 7.5 &#x3BC;g/ml hydrocortisone, 200 &#x3BC;g/ml streptomycin and 200 U/ml penicillin. Rat hepatocytes were obtained from liver of healthy male Sprague&#x2013;Dawley rats using a two-step collagenase perfusion procedure and were cultured as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>]. Cell viability was greater than 90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion.</p>

        <title>Incorporation of MVs in hepatocytes</title>
        <p>To study the incorporation of MVs into hepatocytes, we incubated 50 &#x3BC;g/ml of MVs labelled with PKH-26 dye for 3 hrs at 37&#xB0;C. We studied the MV incorporation by cytofluorimetry and confocal microscopy (LSM 5 Pascal Confocal Microscope, Carl Zeiss International, Oberkochen, Germany).</p>
        <p>To investigate the role of adhesion molecules expressed by MVs in the incorporation in hepatocytes, MVs were pre-incubated (15 min. at 4&#xB0;C) with blocking antibodies (1 &#x3BC;g/ml) against the identified adhesion molecules anti-&#x3B1;<sub>4</sub>-integrin (Biolegend), &#x3B1;<sub>6</sub>-integrin (Biolegend), CD29 (&#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>- integrin) (BD Pharmingen) or with soluble hyaluronic acid (sHA) (100 &#x3BC;g/ml from Rooster comb; Sigma) before the incubation with the cells. In selected experiments labelled MVs were treated with 0.5 mM trypsin for 30 min. at 37&#xB0;C and the integrity of MVs and removal of surface molecules was checked by cytofluorimetric analysis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Cell proliferation and apoptosis</title>
        <p>Hepatocyte were seeded at 50,000 cells/well into 48-well plates in William's medium E (Gibco, Paisley, UK) deprived of FCS. DNA synthesis was detected as incorporation of 5-bromo-2&#x2032;-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) into the cellular DNA after 48 hrs of culture. This time point was chosen on the base of preliminary comparative experiments with [3H] thymidine incorporation. Cells were then fixed with 0.5 M ethanol/HCl and incubated with nuclease to digest the DNA. BrdU incorporated into the DNA was detected using an anti-BrdU peroxidise conjugated antibody (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Optical density was measured with an ELISA reader at 405 nm.</p>
        <p>Apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) technology (Chemicon, CA, USA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>]. To induce apoptosis hepatocytes were incubated with 5 mM of D-galactosamine (GalN) for 24 hrs in DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>]. Apoptosis was also evaluated in paraffin-embedded liver sections by TUNEL.</p>

          <title>RNA extraction, samples labelling and hybridization on BeadChips</title>
          <p>RNA was extracted from MVs using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) following the procedure suggested by the manufacturer. Total RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically (Nanodrop ND-1000, Wilmington DE, USA). cRNA was synthesized using three different quantities of total RNA (0.25, 0.5 and 1 &#x3BC;g). cRNA synthesis and labelling was done using Illumina RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion) following the procedure suggested by manufacturer. Sentrix&#xAE; Human-6 Expression BeadChip hybridization, washing and staining were also done as suggested by the manufacturer. Arrays were scanned on Illumina BeadStation 500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).</p>

          <title>Microarray data analysis</title>
          <p>BeadChip array data quality control was performed with Illumina BeadStudio software version 3.0. Transcript average intensity signals were calculated with BeadStudio without background correction. Raw data were analysed using Bioconductor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>].

        <p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care and approved by the Local Committee for Experimental Animal Research. Adult Sprague&#x2013;Dawley rats (Charles River, Calco, Italy) weighing 180&#x2013;200 g were anesthetized and subjected to 70% hepatectomy as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. In sham-operated animals, livers were briefly exposed outside the peritoneal cavity. Immediately after hepatectomy, animals received an intravenous injection of 30 &#x3BC;g HLSC-derived MVs either untreated or RNase treated. Control rats received an equal volume of saline i.p. To measure hepatocyte proliferation in excised livers, rats received an i.p. injection of BrdU (100 mg/kg) 2 hrs before being killed as suggested by Lanier <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>] for the evaluation of hepatocellular proliferation in rodents. Rats were killed at 8, 24, 48 or 72 hrs after surgery to collect the remnant liver. Blood was also withdrawn from the abdominal aorta and serum was obtained by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 20 min.) to measure alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and albumin. Six animals were used for each time point. Liver samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C until used in molecular biology studies. Additional liver samples were paraffin embedded for histology, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis. Body and liver weights were recorded at each post-operative time to assess liver regeneration rate that was expressed as the ratio wet liver weight to body weight (%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>].</p>

Ten non-consecutive sections were counted for BrdU<sup>+</sup> and PCNA<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes at 200&#xD7; magnification. Confocal microscopy analysis was performed on frozen sections for detection of specific human AGO2 protein. Sections were blocked and labelled with rabbit anti-human AGO2 (Abcam) (1:300 dilution). Omission of the primary antibodies or substitution with non-immune rabbit IgG was used as controls. Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) was used as secondary antibody.

        <title>Characterization of HLSC-derived MVs</title>
        <p>By cytofluorimetric analyses MVs produced by HLSC were detected mainly below the forward scatter signal corresponding to 1-&#x3BC;m beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). When determined by Zetasizer, the size of MVs ranged from 80 nm to 1&#x3BC;m, with a mean value of 195 nm. Cytofluorimetric analyses showed the presence of several adhesion molecules also present on HLSC plasma membrane such as &#x3B1;<sub>4</sub>-integrin, CD29 and CD44. MVs did not express &#x3B1;<sub>5</sub>- and &#x3B1;<sub>6</sub>-integrins and HLA-class I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>) at variance with the cells of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>].</p>

        <title>Gene array analyses of HLSC-derived MVs</title>
        <p>mRNA extracted from MVs was submitted to microarray analysis to define which transcripts were present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>]. A total of 65 transcripts were found with this procedure; 60 were associated to Entrez gene identifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>] by IPA 6.0 analysis (see additional information). This observation indicated that MVs shuttled a specific subset rather than a random sample of cellular mRNA. MVs contained mRNA related to several cell functions involved in the control of transcription and metabolism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In particular the following genes, that were detected in MVs, are known to be involved in cell proliferation: MATK, MRE11A, CHECK2, MYH11, VASP and CDK2. In particular, CDK2 gene has been shown to be involved in liver regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>]. Moreover, MVs contained the AGO2 (EIF2C2) gene which is a translation regulator with a critical role in the control of microRNA production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>]. Quantitative real time PCR confirmed the presence in MVs of genes randomly chosen from those detected by Microarray <italic>(AGO2</italic>, <italic>CHEK2</italic>, <italic>CDK2</italic>, <italic>MATK</italic>).</p>

        <title>Incorporation of MVs in cultured hepatocytes</title>
        <p>MVs labelled with PKH26 dye were incorporated by cultured human hepatocytes after 3 hrs of incubation at 37&#xB0;C as shown by FACS analysis and confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A, C</xref>). In order to investigate the role of adhesion molecules expressed by the MV surface in the incorporation in target cells, MVs were pre-incubated (15 min., at 4&#xB0;C) with blocking antibodies against the identified adhesion molecules or with sHA to block CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). MV treatment with anti-&#x3B1;<sub>4</sub>-integrin blocking antibody inhibited MV incorporation in human hepatocytes. Blockade of CD44 or CD29 only slightly reduced incorporation of MVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>). The anti-&#x3B1;<sub>6</sub>-integrin blocking antibody used as negative control did not prevent MV internalization. Moreover, removal of surface molecules by trypsin treatment of MVs inhibited their incorporation in human hepatocytes confirming the relevance of surface expressed molecules in the process of MV internalization by target cells. Similar results were obtained using rat hepatocytes (data not shown).</p>

        <p>Incubation of human hepatocytes with MVs derived from HLSC promoted a significant proliferation in respect to control cells incubated with vehicle alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, incubation of human hepatocytes with increasing doses of MVs significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by GalN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, when MVs were incubated with RNase, that we previously showed to induce a complete degradation of the RNA shuttled by MVs without affecting their structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>], proliferation and apoptosis resistance elicited by MVs were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). As previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>], RNase treatment did not modify the expression of surface molecules or the internalization of MVs (not shown). These results suggest that the MV biological effects were mediated by the transfer of mRNA following MV internalization, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>].

        <title>HLSC-derived MVs enhanced hepatic regeneration in rat with 70% hepatectomy</title>
        <p>In the rat model of 70% hepatectomy, we observed a significant rise in AST and ALT and a significant reduction in serum albumin at 24, 48 and 72 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A&#x2013;C</xref>). In MV-treated rats the rise of AST and ALT was significantly lower after 72 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A, B</xref>) in respect to the untreated. Moreover, in MV-treated rats an enhanced production of albumin was detected at 24 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>). The liver/body weight ratio gradually increased after 70% hepatectomy in rats treated or not with MVs. However, after 72 hrs a significant enhancement of liver/body ratio was observed in MV-treated in respect to untreated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3D</xref>). The histological examination of 70% hepatectomized rats showed a marked hepatocyte swelling and vacuolization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>). The staining for triglyceride with Oil red O indicated a diffuse hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>). When animals were treated with MVs, the lesions were less severe at all the time points in respect to animals with 70% hepatectomy treated with vehicle alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>) and the steatosis was minimal or absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figs 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>, MV-treatment of rats with 70% hepatectomy significantly enhanced <italic>in vivo</italic> hepatocyte proliferation as detected by BrdU<sup>+</sup> and PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells in respect to hepatectomized rats injected with vehicle alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figs 5A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6A, B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we demonstrated that MVs derived from human HLSC promoted hepatocyte proliferation and suppressed hepatocyte cell death. MV administration accelerated <italic>in vivo</italic> liver regeneration in 70% hepatectomized rats. The RNase treatment of MVs abrogated both the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of MVs, suggesting that the RNA shuttled by MVs was the final effector of their biological effect.</p>
      <p>The 70% hepatectomy in rats is a classical model to study liver regeneration. The remaining hepatic lobes of the rats can restore the liver mass two weeks after partial hepatectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. It has been suggested that the regeneration process is due to the proliferation of residual mature hepatocytes that re-enter into the cell cycle and undergo proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. It is not clear whether resident or bone marrow derived stem cells may contribute to liver regeneration and whether resident stem cells may orchestrate the cell cycle entry of differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. Recently, Quesenberry and Aliotta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>] proposed a dynamic reconsideration of the stem cell niches suggesting that the lability of stem cell phenotype depends on complex interactions with differentiated cells based on MV mediated cell-to-cell transfer of genetic information. Moreover, these authors suggested that transfer of genetic information from injured cells may explain stem cell functional and phenotypic changes without the need of transdifferentiation into tissue cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. On the other hand, we showed that transfer of genetic information from stem cells may re-direct altered functions in target cells suggesting that stem cells may repair damaged tissues without directly replacing parenchymal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. Indeed, the genetic information shuttled by MVs may be exploited to activate angiogenic and regenerative programs in target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>Shedding of MVs is no longer considered an artefact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>] and it has been shown to occur <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. It has been suggested that shedding vesicles could participate in important biological processes and their significant number at the surface of a Cajal-like cell of the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>] suggests that these structures may transport important information to other cells.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we demonstrated that MVs derived from HLSC may induce <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation and apoptosis resistance in human and rat hepatocytes. HLSC is a pluripotent stem cells population resident in the adult human liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> HLSC were shown to contribute to liver regeneration in a model of acute liver injury in SCID mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. In the present study we found that HLSC spontaneously released MVs in culture. MVs released from HLSC had a size similar to that described for MVs released from endothelial progenitors cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>] or from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>] and expressed several adhesion molecules known to be present on the surface of HLSC such as CD44, CD29 (newb1-integrin), &#x3B1;<sub>4</sub>-integrin. It has been previously reported that the adhesion molecules expressed by MVs are instrumental in their internalization into target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. We found that &#x3B1;<sub>4</sub>-integrin blockade prevented MV incorporation into hepatocytes whereas blockade of CD44 and CD29 had only minor effects.</p>
      <p>The internalization of MVs in target cells was previously found to be essential for their biologic activity but not the final mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. Indeed, RNase treatment almost completely abrogated MV-induced angiogenic and regenerative effects suggesting a critical role of RNA transfer mediated by MVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. In the present study, we found that MV treatment with RNase abrogated the <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of hepatocytes.</p>
      <p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> administration of MVs derived from HLSC was found to accelerate liver regeneration in 70% hepatectomized rats. This was possibly related to an <italic>in vivo</italic> stimulation of proliferation of hepatocytes, as indicated by the incorporation of BrdU, the expression of PCNA and of cyclin A1 by hepatocytes. Moreover, MV treatment significantly reduced liver apoptosis as seen by TUNEL. Pre-treatment of MVs with RNase abrogated also the protective effect of MVs in 70% hepatectomized rats. One can speculate that the delivery of exogenous mRNA by MVs to hepatocytes may stimulate hepatic regeneration. Indeed, MVs derived from HLSC contained a defined pattern of mRNA associated with several cell functions involved in the control of transcription, translation and proliferation. <italic>In vivo</italic> evidence for an effective horizontal transfer of mRNA was obtained by the presence of the human specific mRNA for AGO2, chosen as reporter gene, and by its <italic>de novo</italic> protein expression in the liver of MV-treated hepatectomized rats. AGO2 is a regulatory protein with a central role in RNA silencing processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>]. The results of present study are in line with the recent evidence that MVs may shuttle biologically active mRNA or microRNA able to regulate cell function of different target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>]. Of interest, the pattern of genes present in HLSC-derived MVs was substantially different from that of endothelial precursors and mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>] indicating a specificity for the cell of origin. Moreover, MVs were shown to contain Staufen 2 suggesting a role of ribonucleoproteins in carrying and stabilizing RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>] within MVs.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, MV-mediated transfer of mRNA from HLSC to hepatocytes may represent a mechanism that contribute to liver regeneration and that could be exploited in regenerative medicine.</p>
