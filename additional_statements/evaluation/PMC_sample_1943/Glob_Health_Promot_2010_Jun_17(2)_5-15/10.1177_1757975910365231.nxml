        <p>This article focuses on results of the systematic review from the Guide for
                    Useful Interventions for Activity in Latin America project related to
                    school-based physical education (PE) programs in Latin America. The aims of the
                    article are to describe five school-based PE programs from Latin America,
                    discuss implications for effective school-based PE recommendations, propose
                    approaches for implementing these interventions, and identify gaps in the
                    research literature related to physical activity promotion in Latin American
                    youth. Following the US <italic>Community Guide</italic> systematic review
                    process, five school-based PE intervention studies with sufficient quality of
                    design, execution and detail of intervention and outcomes were selected for full
                    abstraction. One study was conducted in Brazil, two studies were conducted in
                    Chile and two studies were conducted on the US/Mexico border. While studies
                    presented assorted outcomes, methods and duration of interventions, there were
                    consistent positive increases in physical activity levels for all outcomes
                    measured during PE classes, endurance and active transportation to school in all
                    three randomized studies. Except for one cohort from one study, the
                    non-randomized studies showed positive intervention effects for moderate and
                    vigorous physical activity levels during PE classes. The core elements of these
                    five interventions included capacity building and staff training (PE specialists
                    and/or classroom teachers); changes in the PE curricula; provision of equipment
                    and materials; and adjustment of the interventions to specific target
                    populations. In order to translate the strong evidence for school-based PE into
                    practice, systematic attention to policy and implementation issues is required.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Regular physical activity (PA) reduces the risk of chronic disease, including some
                types of cancer, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975910365231">1</xref>). Despite this evidence, PA levels
                continue to be far from ideal in most parts of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757975910365231">2</xref>). Of special concern is the evidence
                indicating that children, particularly in the developed world, establish a sedentary
                lifestyle early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757975910365231">3</xref>). Some developing countries are experiencing similar patterns associated
                with lifestyle changes, such as sedentary habits and high caloric intake that
                contribute in part to the worldwide obesity epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757975910365231">4</xref>). The Latin American region is
                experiencing increasing rates of obesity among youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757975910365231">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757975910365231">9</xref>). In developing countries, high prevalence
                of overweight and obesity lead to early mortality in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757975910365231">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>Children today have fewer opportunities to be active in a safe and independent
                manner, especially in large cities in developing countries that are rapidly
                urbanizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757975910365231">11</xref>).
                According to a birth cohort study conducted in Pelotas, Brazil, the prevalence of
                sedentary lifestyles, characterized by excessive TV viewing and lack of PA, among
                youth is as high as 58% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757975910365231">12</xref>). Factors that decrease energy
                expenditure, such as the declining time for physical education (PE) in schools, may
                play an important role in the prevalence of overweight among children. Because
                students spend large amounts of time in school, there is a great potential for
                increasing their level of PA through school-based interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757975910365231">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757975910365231">14</xref>). In a systematic review of 14
                evidence-based PA promotion strategies, the US <italic>Guide to Community Preventive
                    Services</italic> (<italic>Community Guide</italic>) found strong supporting
                evidence that school-based PE programs increased PA among school children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757975910365231">15</xref>). The school-based PE
                interventions included modified PE classes, generally with more classroom time and
                more moderate-to-vigorous PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975910365231">16</xref>).</p>
      <p>The recommendations of the <italic>Community Guide</italic> and its process of
                systematic review have not yet been systematically examined and applied in
                developing countries. Many promising PA interventions are being carried out in Latin
                America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757975910365231">17</xref>); however,
                their effectiveness has generally not been evaluated. The Guide for Useful
                Interventions for Activity in Latin America (GUIA) was initiated in 2005 to examine
                and promote evidence-based strategies, with the intention of increasing PA in Latin
                America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975910365231">18</xref>). The purpose
                of the initial phase of GUIA was to conduct a review of the Latin American
                literature on community-based PA promotion strategies and to determine the
                applicability of the <italic>Community Guide</italic> recommendations in this
                region. According to <italic>Community Guide</italic> criteria<italic>,</italic>
                school-based PE was found to be the only type of PA intervention with a strong
                enough body of evidence to make a practice recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975910365231">18</xref>). This article focuses on the results of
                the GUIA systematic review related to school-based PE programs in Latin America. The
                aims of the article are to (i) describe selected school-based PE interventions from
                the GUIA review; (ii) discuss implications of effective school-based PE
                recommendations in the Latin America region; (iii) propose approaches for
                implementing these interventions in Latin America; (iv) identify gaps in the
                research literature related to PA promotion in Latin American youth.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>Although this article focuses specifically on the school-based PE findings of the
                GUIA literature review, the method used to search, categorize and abstract the
                papers for the present study were the same used in the overall review. Therefore, in
                order to understand the process of reviewing and evaluating the Latin America
                literature related to PA interventions, it is necessary to review the methods
                previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975910365231">18</xref>). First, five databases of peer-reviewed literature and Brazilian theses
                were systematically searched for studies of PA community interventions by using
                search terms in Portuguese, Spanish and English. Intervention studies were then

                abstraction process. This process followed the <italic>Community Guide</italic>
                procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757975910365231">19</xref>), with
                some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975910365231">18</xref>).
                On the basis of previously described criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757975910365231">15</xref>), studies were evaluated by two
                measures: design suitability (classified as greatest, moderate and least [Appendix
                1]) and quality of intervention execution (classified according to the number of
                limitations to assess the strength of the evidence [Appendix 2]).</p>
      <p>Relative effect sizes for the school-based PE intervention studies were calculated as
                the net percentage change from baseline for all reported measures of aerobic
                capacity and physical activity levels and for all time periods. The formula for
                calculating the net effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757975910365231">Figure
                    1</xref>) varied depending on the study design &#x2013; with or without a
                control group or pre-intervention outcome measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975910365231">16</xref>). To identify common characteristics of
                the school-based PE interventions, the authors reviewed each of the school-based PE
                articles and abstraction forms in detail, categorizing and listing intervention
                components. These &#x2018;core components&#x2019; were determined according
                to frequency of use by most of the studies and also by taking into account the
                intervention activities recognized by the <italic>Community Guide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975910365231">16</xref>).</p>
      <p>Additionally, Brazilian experts provided input to address issues related to PE
                typically not available in the literature. These experts made available additional
                literature sources, such as peer-non-reviewed manuscripts and meeting reports, not
                included in the evidence-based review.</p>

      <p>The systematic literature review yielded five school-based PE intervention studies
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975910365231">24</xref>), out of six that met
                all of the inclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975910365231">18</xref>). The excluded study was a duplicate of one included thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>), which contained more
                details about the intervention and evaluation for the abstraction process than the
                peer-reviewed article. All five studies had sufficient quality of design, execution
                and detail regarding the intervention and outcomes to undergo the second phase of
                the abstraction process. Three studies used randomized group design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757975910365231">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975910365231">23</xref>) and two used a non-randomized group
                design with a concurrent comparison group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757975910365231">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975910365231">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975910365231">24</xref>). One study was conducted in elementary
                public schools in Brazil (children aged 7&#x2013;10 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>), two were carried out
                in public schools in Chile (first- through ninth-grade classes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757975910365231">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975910365231">22</xref>) and the remaining two took place in US
                elementary schools mainly attended by Latino students and located on the US/Mexico
                border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975910365231">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975910365231">24</xref>).</p>
      <p>Two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975910365231">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975910365231">24</xref>) reported minutes spent
                in moderate and vigorous PA, and one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>) reported four different outcomes
                related to behavior: percentage of children biking or walking to school, estimated
                energy expenditure based on observed PA behavior of children, percentage of children
                who were very active during PE classes and percentage of time spent walking during
                PE classes. Further reported outcomes were aerobic capacity as estimated by maximal
                oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> max) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757975910365231">21</xref>), results from timed runs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975910365231">23</xref>) or endurance testing
                (shuttle runs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975910365231">22</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although the outcomes, ascertainment methods, and duration of interventions varied
                between studies, there were consistent positive increases in PA levels for all
                outcomes measured during PE classes (relative net effects ranged from 7%
                to 307%) in all three randomized studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757975910365231">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975910365231">23</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757975910365231">Figure 1</xref>). The extreme magnitude of the
                307% net effect is explained by the low baseline walking levels in the
                intervention group versus the control group (5.6 vs. 14.4%,
                respectively). At post-test the intervention group increased time spent walking
                during PE classes nearly 5&#x2013;6 times that of baseline, while the control
                group increased walking time by only 1.5 times baseline. Likewise, endurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975910365231">23</xref>) and active
                transportation to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>) outcomes showed small but positive net effects for the same group of
                studies. With the exception of one cohort in Heath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975910365231">24</xref>), the non-randomized studies increased
                moderate and vigorous PA levels during PE classes. These increases ranged from
                5% to 69% for moderate and 50% to 55%
                for vigorous PA levels during PE classes. The results from the shuttle run test
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975910365231">22</xref>) demonstrated
                increased endurance performances among boys (35%) and girls
                (37%).</p>
      <p>After reviewing the details of each study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757975910365231">Table 1</xref>), four types of intervention
                activities were identified and summarized as the &#x2018;core

      <p>Our results identified several common characteristics, the core components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757975910365231">Table 2</xref>), of successful
                school-based PE interventions in Latin America that were comparable to some of those
                used in the <italic>Community Guide</italic>. These included the addition of
                supplementary PE classes, the lengthening of existing PE classes, and an increase in
                time spent in moderate and vigorous PA without necessarily changing duration of PE
                classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975910365231">16</xref>). Four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975910365231">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975910365231">24</xref>) out of the five studies reviewed in the
                current study were adaptations of North American school-based interventions and
                therefore delivered analogous activities to the 13 studies reviewed by the
                    <italic>Community Guide</italic>, both in terms of content and quality. With
                appropriate adjustments for national, local, and cultural contexts, the identified
                core components from interventions from two schools in Chile, a Brazilian elementary
                school and two elementary schools on the US/Mexican border could be a logical
                approach to guide PE recommendations and implementation across diverse countries,
                cultures and populations such as those found in Latin America.</p>
      <p>High-quality school-based PE programs, combining all or some of the core components
                described here, increase PA among children in Latin America in the same way as they
                do in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975910365231">18</xref>).
                Similar to the GUIA literature review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975910365231">18</xref>), the 13 US qualifying studies revealed
                consistent increases in time spent in PA at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975910365231">16</xref>), The net increase in the amount of PE
                class time spent in moderate and vigorous PA was 50%, ranging from
                6% to 125%. The percentage of class time increase in moderate
                and vigorous PA was 10%, ranging from 3% to 15%,
                although one study reported a 762% increase from a very small baseline
                value. Two studies showed increases in energy expenditure, and 11 studies reported
                increases in aerobic capacity with a median of 8% (interquartile range
                3% to 19%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975910365231">16</xref>).</p>
      <p>When comparing intervention effects for the same outcomes, the five studies from the
                present study are generally consistent with the US <italic>CG</italic> results, both
                in direction and effect size. Some of the US <italic>CG</italic> net effects also
                had a wide range, particularly for the amount and percentage of PE class time spent
                in moderate and vigorous PA. The three studies that reported increased levels of PA
                during PE class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975910365231">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975910365231">24</xref>) used the same observational method
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975910365231">16</xref>) to measure the
                amount of PE class time spent in moderate and vigorous PA<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1757975910365231"><sup>i</sup></xref>, but for different outcomes, such as the time spent being very active and
                the amount of walking during PE classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>). The wide range in net effect sizes

                intervention and comparison (if applicable) groups before and after the
                intervention. They also reflect the magnitude of the pre-intervention measures (see

      <p>Among the three reviewed studies, the net effects for various outcomes (e.g.
                frequency of exercise-related behaviors, any moderate and vigorous PA in the
                previous week) ranged from 0.0 to 0.2; net effects for 11 of the 14 outcomes were
                between 0 and 0.1. These net effects tended to be much lower in magnitude than those
                observed for the school-based PE interventions, which suggests that merely providing
                health information and promoting behavioral skills for healthy decision-making may
                be insufficient to significantly change PA behavior. However, more research of
                classroom-based health education, both in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975910365231">16</xref>) and in Latin America, is needed to
                confirm this finding.</p>
      <p>The impact of an intervention is determined not only by its reach and efficacy but
                also by the extent to which the intervention is adopted, implemented as intended and
                maintained at the system and individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757975910365231">25</xref>). An effective intervention needs to
                have broad reach and be feasible to implement in &#x2018;real-world&#x2019;
                settings in order to make a public health impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757975910365231">25</xref>). Some of the major challenges for
                interventions are finding creative and cost-effective ways to implement
                evidence-based programs and policies at the population level, while providing
                adequate information and resources (e.g. infrastructure, training, proper economic
                and social environments) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757975910365231">26</xref>). This is particularly important in a region where legislation to promote
                school-based PE is highly variable. In addition, it is key to consider differences
                in terms of social influences that may affect children's and
                adolescents&#x2019; behavior (e.g. family, social networks, culture) when
                adapting programs that are effective in a specific setting or population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757975910365231">27</xref>). Although the purpose
                of school-based PE is larger than enhancing physical fitness only, it also has great
                potential for PA promotion because of its effectiveness in increasing PA among
                children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975910365231">18</xref>) and because
                school programs reach virtually all children at relatively low cost with preexisting
                infrastructure.</p>
      <p>In a context of increased academic and political credibility for PA promotion and PE
                during the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757975910365231">28</xref>), supportive school PE policies appear to exist in many Latin American
                countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757975910365231">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1757975910365231">30</xref>). In these countries,
                even though PE is mandatory for students in public and private elementary and
                secondary schools, the requirements concerning frequency and duration of classes is
                generally low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757975910365231">31</xref>). An
                optimal PE curriculum should include a variety of learning and practice experiences
                that will provide the basis for active living in the adult years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757975910365231">32</xref>). However, according to
                experts in the area, PE programs in Latin America are often of low quality and
                quantity. Therefore, a comprehensive school policy to increase PA practice during
                school-based PE and enhance its quality is required. In addition, frequency and
                duration of classes is often less than optimal because of challenges related to
                salary, work environment, physical space and curriculum structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757975910365231">31</xref>); consequently, barriers
                to implementation exist primarily within the school systems and need to be addressed
                as well.</p>
      <p>According to Melo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757975910365231">28</xref>),
                there is a call for academic institutions where PE teachers are trained to push for
                an adequate transition from what is learned in the academic world to what is needed
                in everyday practice in the schools. Often, the fields of academic knowledge
                production (e.g. universities/research institutes) and policy
                formulation/implementation are very different, frequently with incompatible goals
                and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1757975910365231">33</xref>).
                Therefore, collaborative partnerships between researchers and practitioners, along
                with regulatory and legislative enforcement and political commitment and support for
                PE, are particularly desirable to help bridge the gap between theory and practice
                and for successful and sustainable program implementation.</p>
      <p>Some limitations of this review should be considered. The five identified studies
                applied diverse ways to measure similar or same outcomes (e.g. moderate and vigorous
                PA levels during PE classes), which limited the ability of the previous review to
                derive a summary measure for the effect of school-based PE across the five reviewed
                studies. The net effect plot is an effort to be transparent in illustrating the
                variability in measures and lack of a gold standard in PA measurement in kids. By
                computing the net intervention effect, we were able to standardize and compare the
                effects. Although the literature search was conducted to identify interventions
                delivered in Latin America, we discuss findings from only five studies, two of which
                were implemented on the US/Mexican border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975910365231">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975910365231">24</xref>). However, because these interventions
                took place in schools attended mainly by Hispanic children of low socioeconomic
                status, and since information on quality or availability of equipments and
                facilities was not available in the reviewed papers, we considered this population
                and setting comparable to those from other Latin American countries. The three
                remaining studies were limited to Chile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757975910365231">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975910365231">22</xref>) and Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>). This limitation should be taken into
                account when disseminating school-based PE interventions in Latin America. Another
                consideration is the variability in the interventions&#x2019; duration (4 months
                to 3 years). The two longest studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975910365231">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975910365231">24</xref>) are funded adaptations of a broad,
                well-designed, tested and documented intervention study<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1757975910365231"><sup>ii</sup></xref>, which could justify in part the length of these two interventions. The
                three remaining studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975910365231">22</xref>) were much less supported and were single initiatives largely developed
                by academic institutions (University of Chile, Catholic University of Chile and
                Federal University of Sao Paulo) in collaboration with local health or education
                sectors. Nevertheless, the two longest interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975910365231">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975910365231">24</xref>) did not result in larger net effect for
                similar outcomes when compared with the study with shortest duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975910365231">20</xref>).</p>
      <p>Identifying interventions to increase PA levels in school settings is particularly
                important in Latin America because of the rapid demographic, epidemiologic and
                nutritional transitions associated with the increase in risk factors for chronic
                disease, including obesity and physical inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757975910365231">4</xref>). These problems are unequally distributed
                across populations, and they disproportionately affect the most impoverished Latin
                Americans. Given the limited literature on evidence-based interventions for PA
                promotion in Latin American countries, developing recommendations to address
                physical inactivity among youth is essential.</p>
      <p>The five studies in the GUIA review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975910365231">18</xref>) and the 13 studies from the
                    <italic>Community Guide</italic> review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975910365231">16</xref>) were of sufficient quality to be
                included in the evidence-based review process and form the basis for the
                recommendation of school-based PE for PA promotion among children and adolescents in
                Latin America. Even though this may appear to be a small number of studies upon
                which to base global public health policy, relatively few other public health
                intervention recommendations are supported by systematic reviews of the scientific
                literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757975910365231">27</xref>). Further
                implementation of school-based PE interventions could greatly benefit from
                systematic evaluation and publication of peer-reviewed studies on
                schools&#x2019; PE efforts to promote PA.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Given the importance of promoting PA in youth to improve the health of Latin
                Americans, our results provide the impetus to implement high-quality school-based PE
                interventions in this region. Enhancing the quality of PE in the schools and
                increasing the level of PA among youth depends on capacity building and training for
                PE teachers and instructors, appropriate changes in the PE curricula, proper
                infrastructure including equipment and materials, and adjustments to various
                political, cultural and socioeconomic characteristics. Additionally, future research
                is needed to identify other practical key elements, such as legislation, policy,
                barriers and facilitators for promoting school-based PE in Latin America.</p>
