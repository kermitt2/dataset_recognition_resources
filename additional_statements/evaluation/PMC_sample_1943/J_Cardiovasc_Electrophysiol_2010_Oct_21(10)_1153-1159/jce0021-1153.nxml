      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Brugada syndrome (BrS) is associated with a loss of Na<sup>+</sup> channel function and increased risks of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), potentially leading to sudden cardiac death. The arrhythmogenicity in BrS is thought to be a result of electrophysiological alterations localized to the right ventricle, reflected in ST elevation in the right precordial leads, right bundle branch block and changes specific to right ventricle (RV) epicardial action potential (AP) waveforms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref></sup> Previous studies have implicated either slowed RV AP conduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref></sup> or alterations in AP repolarization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref></sup> in the arrhythmogenesis associated with BrS. Thus, on one hand, reduced Na<sup>+</sup> currents in BrS would be expected to compromise AP conduction. On the other, their reduction in relationship to <italic>I</italic><sub>to</sub> currents in BrS would shorten the RV epicardial APD and consequently permit reentrant waves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Experimental models for BrS have involved a number of pharmacological manipulations in canine systems. These have involved use of agents producing K<sup>+</sup> channel opening by pinacidil, Na<sup>+</sup> channel block by flecainide, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel block by verapamil, increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, metabolic inhibition or simulated ischemia. Such studies have implicated repolarization gradients caused by regional heterogeneities in electrical activity. However, there is uncertainty as to whether such pharmacological systems provide accurate or complete replication of the physiological changes underlying BrS. Furthermore, the pharmacological manipulations themselves inherently lack a specificity of action. Experimental systems using genetic modifications to replicate BrS may provide a more specific model to clarify physiological abnormalities associated with the disease condition.</p>
      <p>Thus far, only the <italic>Scn5a</italic> gene, which encodes the cardiac Nav1.5 &#x3B1;-subunit, has been extensively studied in connection with BrS. Our previous studies using a heterozygotic <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; mouse have recapitulated features of the human clinical condition in demonstrating an enhanced arrhythmogenesis that is exacerbated by flecainide and relieved by quinidine. This model has previously shown a 50% reduction in the transmembrane Na<sup>+</sup> current and evidence for slowed ventricular and atrioventricular conduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref></sup> As yet, no evidence has been found for accentuated repolarization gradients in this model although to date no study of the RV has been made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In the present experiments, we seek for the first time in a genetic whole-heart BrS model to discriminate the contributions of alterations in conduction and repolarization gradients in the arrhythmogenesis, and to localize the pathophysiological mechanism in the RV. We were particularly interested in the effects upon conduction velocity and repolarization gradients of 2 clinically used drugs: flecainide, which is known to unmask ventricular arrhythmogenesis in otherwise asymptomatic BrS patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref></sup> and quinidine, which has shown protective actions in symptomatic BrS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></sup> We correlate alterations in RV gradients in the BrS model that are specifically exacerbated by flecainide, with the observed arrhythmogenic properties and with clinical findings implicating the RV in the arrhythmogenic mechanism. This may contribute to future work investigating possible pharmacological treatments for a disease for which the current mainstay of treatment is implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref></sup></p>

        <title>Langendorff Perfusion</title>
        <p>Mice aged 4&#x2013;8 months were obtained from breeding pairs of heterozygote <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; and wild-type (WT) inbred 129/sv mice initially supplied by Harlan (UK). Experiments used a Langendorff-perfused preparation adapted for the murine heart, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref></sup> Following the start of perfusion, viable hearts suitable for subsequent experimentation regained a pink coloration and spontaneous rhythmic contraction with warming. Where used, 10 &#x3BC;M flecainide and 5 &#x3BC;M quinidine (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) dissolved in buffer solution were perfused for 15 minutes prior to and throughout data acquisition. Concentrations were within the same range as known clinical therapeutic levels (flecainide: 0.2&#x2013;0.9 mg L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>; quinidine: 2.0&#x2013;5.0 mg L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></sup> All procedures conformed to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>

        <title>Monophasic Action Potential Recording</title>
        <p>Monophasic action potentials (MAPs) were recorded using an established contact-electrode technique detailed previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></sup> Epicardial MAPs were recorded from the basal surface of the ventricular epicardium, both on the left and on the right using a miniaturized MAP electrode tip (Linton Instruments, Harvard Apparatus, UK). Endocardial MAPs used electrodes constructed from galvanically chlorided, Teflon-coated 0.25 mm diameter silver wire introduced into the ventricular cavity through a small access window created in the ventricular wall. Pilot experiments showed that both sets of electrodes provided equivalent MAP traces. MAP signals were amplified and band-pass filtered between 0.1 Hz and 300 Hz (Neurolog AC amplifiers and filters Models NL104 and NL125/6, respectively: Digitimer, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, UK), then digitized using a 1401plus interface (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Paired platinum stimulating electrodes paced the heart high on the interventricular septum.</p>
        <p>The stimulating electrode and the epicardial LV and RV recording electrodes were clamped at a constant position through all experiments. This was at a distance of approximately 10 mm between stimulating and each recording electrode, although it was slightly larger for the LV than for the RV. This distance allowed the hearts to be placed into the rig, with the stimulating electrode coming into contact with the septum and the recording electrodes coming into contact with the left and right ventricles. While the direct absolute distance between electrodes would not necessarily reflect the path through which the electrical signal would be conducted in the spherical whole heart, the fact that the distance was maintained between experiments allowed consistent measurements of activation latencies. As the clamp was secure throughout experiments, this distance was constant to &#x223C;0.5 mm, i.e., 5% of the distance between stimulating and recording electrodes.</p>
        <p>For measurement of APDs, hearts were paced at 8 Hz for 5 minutes and recordings were made at LV and RV, epicardial and endocardial sites. For activation latencies, only epicardial sites were used, as the point of endocardial recording could not be accurately determined. For calculations of arrhythmia incidence, as well as regular 8 Hz pacing, the hearts also underwent an S1S2 protocol, imposing S2 extrastimuli following pacing S1 stimulus trains at S1&#x2013;S2 intervals, reduced by 1 ms between successive drive trains until the preparation became refractory, and a dynamic pacing protocol progressively increasing pacing frequency every 100 beats. Thus for each heart, 12 recordings in total were made, with 3 protocols and 4 cardiac regions employed. MAP recordings were made both before and during treatment with either flecainide (10 &#x3BC;M) or quinidine (5 &#x3BC;M).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Data Analysis</title>
        <p>MAP waveforms were analyzed using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). The point of maximum positive deflection was considered the point of 0% repolarization; that of full return to baseline of 100% repolarization. The intervening waveform was described in terms of APD<sub>x</sub> measurements at x = 90% (APD<sub>90</sub>), 70% (APD<sub>70</sub>) and 50% (APD<sub>50</sub>) repolarization. The effect of heterogeneous repolarization on the difference between different cardiac regions was expressed empirically as the difference (&#x394;APD<sub>x</sub>) between neighboring APD values: LV transmural = LV endocardial APD&#x2014;LV epicardial APD, RV transmural = RV endocardial APD&#x2014;RV epicardial APD, epicardial transventricular = LV epicardial APD&#x2014;RV epicardial APD, endocardial transventricular = LV endocardial APD&#x2014;RV endocardial APD.</p>
        <p>Activation latencies for MAPs recorded from the RV and LV epicardium were measured from the stimulus time to peak amplitude of the MAP to give an indication of conduction velocities. With the positions of the stimulating and recording electrodes constant between experiments, comparisons could be made between WT and <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; hearts, and before and after drug. However, as the distance from stimulating electrode on the septum was slightly greater to the LV recording electrode than the RV recording electrode, no direct comparison could be made between LV and RV. For the calculation of arrhythmic incidence, each run was labeled as either nonarrhythmic or showing one of 3 possible arrhythmias: VT (exceeding 1 second in duration), nonsustained VT (nsVT, lasting less than 1 second), or having one or more ventricular ectopic (VE).</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Statistical Procedures</title>
        <p>Sixteen WT and 16 <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; mice were used in our experiments, as this was a number sufficient to enable categorical statistical analysis for incidence of arrhythmogenesis. Although we also attempted quantitative measurements in all 16, we only included measurements from hearts whose MAPs strictly attained the accepted criteria of rapid upstroke phases, consistent amplitudes, smooth contoured repolarization phases and stable baselines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></sup> in all 4 cardiac regions. We consequently used 12 hearts of each genotype for the calculation of activation latencies and repolarization gradients. In all cases, half of each group was exposed to flecainide and 6 to quinidine.</p>
        <p>All results were expressed as mean &#xB1; S.E.M. values. The significance of differences in arrhythmic incidences used Fisher exact and Chi-squared tests. Differences in activation latencies, APDs and &#x394;APDs between different regions were analyzed using Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests; these were paired where results could be compared from the same heart. Previously, ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's honestly significant different tests have been used to analyze multiple paired data sets; however, this assumes that all data sets are compared with each other and thus increases the likelihood of Type II errors. We accordingly adopted a procedure using a modified Bonferroni correction factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref></sup> using the following procedure: <italic>t</italic>-tests were grouped into independent data sets and the significance values rank-ordered from smallest to largest. The significance of the test with P-value at alpha/(number of tests) was evaluated and, if statistically significant, the test result from the test with the next smallest significance value was selected and evaluated at alpha/(number of tests&#x2014;1), and so on. Alpha was set at 0.05.</p>

        <p>WT and <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; hearts could either be resistant to arrhythmia or could show VEs, nsVT, or polymorphic VT during recording. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref> illustrates these possible outcomes by showing RV epicardial MAP records from <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; hearts during regular 8 Hz pacing.

        <p>WT hearts showed low incidences of arrhythmia, even when subjected to PES protocols or with flecainide or quinidine treatment. In contrast, <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; hearts showed markedly greater arrhythmic tendencies. In both cases, Fisher exact tests excluded significant differences in arrhythmia incidence between cardiac region or stimulus protocol (regular pacing, S1S2 or dynamic pacing protocols: see Methods). These results were therefore combined for Chi-squared testing sorted by genotype and drug condition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). WT hearts showed only small, insignificant increases in their low incidence of arrhythmogenesis with either drug treatment. However, flecainide and quinidine exerted contrasting effects in the <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; hearts through all cardiac regions studied and protocols employed. <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; hearts showed markedly increased arrhythmogenicity with flecainide, while quinidine reduced arrhythmic incidence in <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; hearts to levels statistically indistinguishable from those normally observed in WT.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The BrS has been associated with a heterogeneous group of genotypes; nevertheless, &#x223C;15% of BrS patients do show a loss-of-function Na<sup>+</sup> channel mutation. This prompted the recent development and use of a <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; murine genetic model in studies of the BrS condition. Having first confirmed arrhythmogenicity in the <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; hearts, we systematically investigated arrhythmic incidence in all 4 cardiac regions with 3 different stimulation protocols for the first time. We demonstrated that this model reproduces the clinical BrS condition by displaying ventricular arrhythmias that were exacerbated by flecainide, in line with its clinical effects in unmasking ventricular arrhythmogenesis in otherwise asymptomatic BrS patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref></sup> and reduced by quinidine, in line with its protective action on symptomatic BrS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></sup> Equal arrhythmia incidence in all 4 cardiac regions is consistent with arrhythmic activity arising in any one cardiac region ultimately spreading throughout both ventricles, therefore involving the entire heart. That stimulation protocol did not significantly affect arrhythmogenic incidence is consistent with clinical observations that the inducibility of VT during PES fails to predict sudden cardiac death in BrS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The differences in arrhythmic properties could be associated with both delayed epicardial activation latencies and increased right transventricular repolarization gradients in <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; hearts. Such findings complement previous reports of <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; myocytes having Na<sup>+</sup> current amplitudes reduced to &#x223C;50% of the levels shown by WT, as well as slowed AP conduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref></sup> Our study supports earlier work measuring regional APDs in canine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref></sup> and rat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref></sup> WT systems, as well as molecular and cellular studies of regional ion channel location.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></sup> The present results also extend findings of altered repolarization gradients in canine wedge preparations that mimic BrS by pharmacological rather than genetic means.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref></sup> However, our study is the first using a genetic model for BrS and in which all 4 cardiac regions have been systematically compared.</p>
      <p>Comparison of such altered conduction and repolarization properties through the epicardia and endocardia of the right and left ventricles demonstrated that while both slowed conduction and accentuated repolarization gradients could potentially contribute to the arrhythmogenic mechanism in BrS, it was only the repolarization abnormalities that could be localized to the RV epicardium. Thus, while conduction slowing may provide a background arrhythmic substrate, the RV origin of the arrhythmias in clinical BrS suggests that the heightened repolarization gradients in this region may be the specific trigger. These findings also shed light on the pathophysiology of ST elevation seen in BrS, for which 2 mechanisms have been proposed: either it is due to the difference in AP morphology between the RV epicardium and endocardium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref></sup> or it is secondary to conduction slowing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref></sup> The localization of the enhanced repolarization gradients to the RV may suggest that the physiological mechanism underlying ST elevation is also more closely related to a repolarization disorder than a delay in depolarization.</p>
      <p>The increase in both latencies and transmural gradients produced by flecainide correlates with its proarrhythmic effects in both the model and clinical situations. The former finding parallels the clinical findings implicating slowed conduction in the RV outflow tract in Brugada patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref></sup> that is exacerbated with class 1C drug challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref></sup> The latter result supports findings in canine models, where high flecainide concentrations result in loss of the AP dome and marked AP abbreviation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref></sup> and clinical studies demonstrating that pilsicainide administration in BrS patients triggers T wave alternans, which is known to reflect enhanced spatial and temporal dispersion of repolarization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref></sup> However, whereas the action of flecainide on activation latencies occurred in both the RV and the LV, its action on transmural repolarization gradients was again significant specifically for the RV.</p>
      <p>The increase in conduction delay produced by quinidine was not unexpected given its effect in blocking Na<sup>+</sup> channels, but is in contrast to its effect in decreasing arrhythmic incidence in murine <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; and human BrS hearts. On the other hand, its action in reducing transmural repolarization gradients correlated with its antiarrhythmic effects. Quinidine has correspondingly been shown to reverse the associated electrocardiographic abnormalities and prevent phase 2 reentry and polymorphic VT in experimental canine BrS models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref></sup> and normalize the ST segment in clinical circumstances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The main limitations of the study are associated with the differences between mouse and human physiology. The small size of the mouse heart means that strong electrotonic forces may act to minimize the effect of any spatial heterogeneities that are created and reduce their potential to create reentrant substrate. The AP morphology differs between humans and mice, as mice use less L-type Ca channel current, which means that the mouse AP does not have a plateau phase and has a shorter APD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref></sup> This means that the spike and dome morphology present in larger mammals is not present in our mouse model. However, despite these difficulties, we were able to demonstrate a clear propensity to arrhythmia in our BrS mouse model and correlate this with enhanced RV transmural gradients.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In summary, this study has for the first time in a genetically modified BrS model assessed activation latency, APDs and derived AP repolarization gradients from 4 regions of the heart under a range of stimulation protocols and a range of pharmacological conditions. The experiments correlate the increased arrhythmogenicity in <italic>Scn5a</italic>+/&#x2212; hearts with both increased activation latency and decreased RV epicardial APD and increased RV &#x394;APDs. However, while conduction delay was not localized specifically to the RV and was increased by both flecainide and quinidine, the respective pro- and antiarrhythmic effects of flecainide and quinidine could be directly correlated with their actions in increasing and decreasing RV &#x394;APDs. Thus, these findings, while not excluding a contribution of conduction delay, support most closely an arrhythmogenic trigger based on reentry from abnormal repolarization gradients between RV epicardial and endocardial sites.</p>
