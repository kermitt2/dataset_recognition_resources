          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Long-distance axonal growth relies on the precise interplay of guidance cues and cell adhesion molecules. While guidance cues provide positional and directional information for the advancing growth cone, cell adhesion molecules are essential in enabling axonal advancement. Such a dependence on adhesion as well as guidance molecules can be well observed in dorsal commissural interneurons, which follow a highly stereotypical growth and guidance pattern. The mechanisms and molecules involved in the attraction and outgrowth towards the ventral midline, the axon crossing towards the contralateral side, the rostral turning after midline crossing as well as the guidance along the longitudinal axis have been intensely studied. However, little is known about molecules that provide the basis for commissural axon growth along the anterior-posterior axis.</p>

          <p>MDGA2, a recently discovered cell adhesion molecule of the IgCAM superfamily, is highly expressed in dorsolaterally located (dI1) spinal interneurons. Functional studies inactivating MDGA2 by RNA interference (RNAi) or function-blocking antibodies demonstrate that either treatment results in a lack of commissural axon growth along the longitudinal axis. Moreover, results from RNAi experiments targeting the contralateral side together with binding studies suggest that homophilic MDGA2 interactions between ipsilaterally projecting axons and post-crossing commissural axons may be the basis of axonal growth along the longitudinal axis.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Directed axonal growth of dorsal commissural interneurons requires an elaborate mixture of instructive (guidance) and permissive (outgrowth supporting) molecules. While Wnt and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling pathways have been shown to specify the growth direction of post-crossing commissural axons, our study now provides evidence that homophilic MDGA2 interactions are essential for axonal extension along the longitudinal axis. Interestingly, so far each part of the complex axonal trajectory of commissural axons uses its own set of guidance and growth-promoting molecules, possibly explaining why such a high number of molecules influencing the growth pattern of commissural interneurons has been identified.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>For its function the mammalian central nervous system depends on precisely organized neuronal circuits. Synaptic connections between the cells of a circuit are established during development when axonal growth cones grow along specific pathways, reaching even very distant targets with exceptionally high precision. A combination of cell adhesion molecules, surface receptors and axon guidance molecules enables the growth cone to invade permissive areas and grow along specific molecular gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Long distances are covered by splitting the entire trajectory into smaller segments with intermediate targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Such intermediate targets, also called choice points, mark the end of one segment and the beginning of another. At choice points the growth cone morphology as well as the axonal trajectory change dramatically, often leading to temporary stalling and a decrease in growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Choice points have first been described in invertebrates such as grasshopper or <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where these intermediate targets are represented by specific cells called guidepost cells, whose ablation leads to axon stalling and miss-projections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>One of the best studied choice points in vertebrates is the ventral midline, where specialized cells called floor-plate cells selectively regulate axon crossing in bilaterally symmetric animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. While some axons are attracted by the floor plate, others are selectively repelled. Cell populations whose axons are attracted by the floor plate are dorsolateral commissural interneurons (dI1 and dI2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Upon reaching the midline, commissural axons cross the floor plate to reach the contralateral side, where they turn orthogonally into the longitudinal axis, growing either along the floor-plate or extending laterally to join the ventral or lateral funiculus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>The role of the floor-plate as an important choice point for commissural axons has been clearly demonstrated in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The floor-plate-derived molecule netrin-1 was identified as the major chemoattractant for dorsolaterally located commissural axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Inactivation of either netrin-1 or its receptor, DCC (Deleted in colorectal cancer), causes severe miss-projections of commissural axons, leaving only few axons reaching the midline correctly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. No axons reached the midline when <italic>netrin-1<sup>-/- </sup></italic>mice were treated with the Shh inhibitor cyclopamine, demonstrating a role of Shh not only as a morphogen but also as a guidance molecule that cooperates with the chemoattractant netrin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>While both netrin-1 and Shh are responsible for attracting commissural axons towards the ventral midline, other short-range guidance cues and adhesion molecules govern midline crossing. The best-studied molecules in this context are cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, such as axonin-1/TAG-1, NgCAM/L1, NrCAM, nectins and SynCAMs/Nectin-like molecules (Necls) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Axonin-1 is highly expressed by commissural interneurons, whereas NrCAM, Nectin3, and SynCAM2/Necl3 are strongly up-regulated in floor-plate cells during the period of axonal midline crossing. Direct evidence for a role of these molecules in commissural axon outgrowth came from <italic>in vivo </italic>perturbation assays demonstrating that, in the absence of axonin-1/NrCAM, heterophilic nectin or heterophilic SynCAM interactions, axons either failed to enter and cross the floor plate or had problems turning into the longitudinal axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>Aberrant pathfinding at the ventral midline was also found when ephrinB/EphB signalling was perturbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or in the absence of F-spondin function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. While F-spondin seemed to regulate the turning angle of commissural axons, the morphogens Shh and Wnt were shown to be required for post-crossing commissural axon guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the mouse, <italic>Wnt4 </italic>is expressed in a decreasing anterior-to-posterior gradient in the floor plate and attracts post-crossing commissural axons rostrally in a Frizzled3-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>Shh </italic>was found to be expressed in an opposite gradient, with the highest expression levels in the caudal spinal cord. <italic>In vivo </italic>loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrated that Shh was required for the correct navigation of post-crossing commissural axons in the chicken spinal cord and that this effect was mediated by hedgehog-interacting protein (Hhip) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Intriguingly, in chicken, <italic>Wnts </italic>were not expressed in a gradient along the anteroposterior axis. Rather, a Wnt activity gradient was formed by the graded expression of the Wnt antagonist <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>(<italic>secreted frizzled related protein 1</italic>), which was shaped by Shh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Both a <italic>Wnt </italic>activity gradient and a <italic>Shh </italic>expression gradient provide directional information for post-crossing commissural axons. However, it is less clear whether they also affect neurite elongation directly. Interestingly, Avraham and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] have recently shown that the axons of contralaterally and ipsilaterally projecting dI1 interneurons intermingle during longitudinal growth, suggesting that adhesive interaction between different fascicles might be a driving force for longitudinal growth.</p>
      <p>Recently, we have isolated two novel cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, called MDGA1 and MDGA2, which are exclusively expressed in the peripheral and central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Rat MDGA1 shows high expression levels in developing dI1 interneurons, whereas rat MDGA2 is predominantly expressed in spinal motoneurons and some subpopulations of spinal interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In chicken, MDGA1 has been shown to be highly expressed in motoneurons and in the floor plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast to the rat counterpart, expression of chicken MDGA1 in commissural interneurons is rather low and can be observed only at later stages, raising the question of whether some functions of the mammalian MDGA1 are covered by the MDGA2 homolog in chicken. In order to study MDGA2 function <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have cloned the chicken <italic>MDGA2 </italic>ortholog. Chicken <italic>MDGA2 </italic>RNA is highly expressed in commissural interneurons and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Using RNA interference (RNAi) and function-blocking antibodies, we were able to show that MDGA2 plays a crucial role in the growth of commissural axons along the longitudinal axis, suggesting that MDGA2 is required for axonal elongation, whereas Wnt and Shh signalling controls the growth direction of commissural axons after midline crossing.</p>

      <p>With the development of <italic>in ovo </italic>RNAi as a tool for specific gene silencing, the chicken embryo became a powerful system to study gene function during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We thus decided to use the chicken embryo for studies addressing MDGA function. Database searches indicated that the chicken genome, as observed for other vertebrate species, contains two <italic>MDGA </italic>genes. The domain organization of the chicken MDGA proteins is identical to that of the corresponding rat ortholog: six immunoglobulin C-2 type repeats are combined with a fibronectin type III repeat and a MAM domain. Amplification of <italic>MDGA2 </italic>resulted in the identification of two different cDNA transcripts. One transcript shows an identical organization to rat <italic>MDGA2</italic>, and the other transcript has an insertion of 48 bp at position 2,032. Conservation between chicken and rat MDGAs is in the range 80% to 90%, suggesting that rat and chicken proteins might have conserved functions. For more details on the conservation and the phylogenetic relation of MDGAs, see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>.</p>

        <title><italic>MDGA2 </italic>transcripts are highly expressed in spinal interneurons</title>
        <p>As <italic>MDGA1 </italic>expression in the spinal cord during the period of commissural axon outgrowth has recently been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], we decided to focus our attention on the expression of <italic>MDGA2</italic>. In contrast to chicken <italic>MDGA1</italic>, which is not or only weakly expressed by dorsally located dI1 commissural interneurons, <italic>MDGA2 </italic>transcripts could be readily detected in this neuronal subpopulation (white asterisk in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, stage 22; for information on chicken stages see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; for details on the identity of commissural interneurons see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Expression started as early as stage 22, when dorsal commissural axons had just entered the floor plate. Expression was up-regulated by stage 24, the age at which commissural axons made a sharp turn into the longitudinal axis. Expression levels in commissural interneurons remained high until stage 28 but dropped significantly by stage 30. In addition to the expression observed in dI1 interneurons, <italic>MDGA2 </italic>transcripts could also be observed in other interneuron subpopulations, such as dI3 and more ventrally located V1 interneurons (arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), motoneurons as well as DRG neurons. At stage 36, <italic>MDGA2 </italic>expression in spinal interneurons was no longer detected, but could still be seen in some motoneurons (arrowheads in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), boundary cap cells (arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and very strongly in DRG neurons.</p>

Cross-sections of lumbosacral chicken spinal cords were incubated with Dig-labelled <italic>MDGA2 </italic>antisense RNA and the resulting RNA complexes were visualized using AP-conjugated anti-Dig antibodies. At stage 20, expression is mainly restricted to boundary cap cells at the ventral motor exit points (black asterisks). At stages 24 and 26, <italic>MDGA2 </italic>mRNA is clearly detectable in commissural interneurons (white asterisks). Starting at stage 24, transcripts can also be observed in dI6/V0 (white arrowheads) and ventrally located V1 interneurons (white arrow) and in a subpopulation of DRG neurons. Between stages 24 and 26 a weak transient expression of <italic>MDGA2 </italic>transcripts can also be seen in floor-plate cells (FP) and in various interneuron subpopulations. By stage 24, expression of <italic>MDGA2 </italic>transcripts become up-regulated in different motoneuron subpopulations. Expression levels of <italic>MDGA2 </italic>transcripts in the spinal cord gradually decrease after stage 28, and by stage 36 only expression in DRG neurons and a subpool of motoneurons persists.

        <title>MDGA2 is present on growth cones and neurites of commissural and dorsal root ganglia neurons</title>
        <p>As a tool for our analysis, we raised peptide antibodies against different MDGA2 epitopes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Two of the three peptides were designed in regions of immunoglobulin folds and one peptide was located within the MAM domain. The specificity of the antibodies was tested on a variety of flag-tagged IgCAM ectodomain fusion proteins, including MDGA2, MDGA1, NrCAM and axonin-1. Conditioned media derived from transfected 293T cells contained the expected recombinant tagged proteins as shown by western blotting with flag-specific antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The MDGA2 peptide antibodies only gave a signal in the lane containing MDGA2, indicating that the antisera did not cross-react with the tested IgCAM superfamily members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). When a full-length MDGA2 amino-terminal flag tagged construct was transfected into COS7 cells, a specific surface staining could be detected, suggesting that MDGA2 was indeed present on the surface of transfected cells, either as a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked molecule or as a transmembrane variant (for details on surface staining and GPI anchor prediction see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p>

While the flag antibody clearly recognizes all recombinant IgCAMs, the pooled MDGA2 peptide antibodies specifically recognize the MDGA2 protein. Note that even when loading higher protein concentrations or using much longer exposure times, no cross-reactivity of the MDGA2 peptide antibodies with other IgCAMs could be detected.</p>

        <title>Down-regulation of MDGA2 causes pathfinding errors of commissural axons</title>
        <p>To test whether MDGA2 is indeed involved in axonal growth and/or guidance, we performed RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments in commissural interneurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In open-book preparations of stage 26 embryos commissural interneurons were labelled with DiI. Trajectories of dorsolateral commissural axons in control-injected embryos expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were indistinguishable from non-injected controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C, D</xref>). The YFP expression pattern demonstrated that the electroporation efficiency was very high, as brightly labelled YFP-positive cells could be easily detected in the electroporated half of the spinal cord (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). In contrast to non-injected and YFP plasmid-injected embryos, embryos injected and electroporated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) derived from different regions of the <italic>MDGA2 </italic>message showed aberrant commissural axon growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F,G</xref>). No such change in commissural axon outgrowth was observed when dsRNA for <italic>MDGA1 </italic>was electroporated into the dorsolateral part of the spinal cord (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Electroporation of <italic>MDGA2 </italic>dsRNA resulted in downregulation of its mRNA on the targeted side to 28.9 &#xB1; 8.0% when compared to the unelectroporated side (for details see Material and methods). While the circumferential growth towards, as well as their entry into, the floor plate seemed to be unaffected by <italic>MDGA2 </italic>knockdown, both floor-plate exit and especially growth along the anteroposterior axis were clearly disturbed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, this phenotype was quite different from the ones observed when axonin-1, NgCAM or NrCAM were downregulated by dsRNA ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and data not shown). In embryos treated with dsRNA derived from <italic>MDGA2 </italic>about 25% of the commissural axons were unable to reach the contralateral side and stalled within the floor plate. More importantly, the axons that made it to the contralateral side displayed no growth along the longitudinal axis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p>

However, as seen after RNAi-mediated knockdown of MDGA2, post-crossing commissural axons of embryos treated with MDGA2 antibodies did not turn into the longitudinal axis. The majority of the axons stalled at the floor-plate exit site. In contrast to embryos treated with MDGA2 antibodies, embryos injected with IgG control antibodies did not show any perturbation of commissural axon growth, demonstrating that high concentrations of IgGs diffusing from the central canal did not influence axonal growth and pathfinding of commissural neurons unspecifically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>).</p>

        <title>MDGA2 interacts homophilically</title>
        <p>The fact that both RNAi-mediated protein knockdown as well as antibody perturbation prevented post-crossing commissural axon growth along the longitudinal axis suggested that MDGA2-mediated interactions were required for axonal elongation. As IgCAMs often engage in homophilic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we first tested the self-aggregating activity of MDGA2 in two independent assays. Because IgCAM interactions are often of low affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we used a fluorescent bead aggregation assay as well as chemical cross-linking to visualize interactions. To test for the efficiency and the specificity of our methods, we performed a variety of control experiments, testing the binding properties of proteins known to exist as monomeric entities as well as IgCAMs known to form dimers or multimers. While bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated beads as well as beads coated with proteins from conditioned media of control transfected HEK293T cells did not form any aggregates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,B</xref>), beads coated with axonin-1 formed large aggregates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Beads coated with MDGA2 also resulted in the formation of large aggregates, indicating that MDGA2 was also capable of mediating homophilic interactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>), similar to findings for axonin-1. To independently verify the results seen in the bead aggregation assays, we used bivalent chemical cross-linkers. While the addition of chemical cross-linkers did not lead to the formation of higher molecular weight aggregates in concentrated BSA suspension (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>), axonin-1- as well as MDGA2-containing suspensions did show protein aggregates in the presence of chemical cross-linkers, indicating that these proteins can self aggregate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F,G</xref>). As neither of our aggregation assays could discriminate between interactions occurring in <italic>cis </italic>or in <italic>trans</italic>, we additionally performed cell aggregation assays using cells transfected with full-length MDGA2. While cell suspensions of cells transfected with GFP revealed mainly single cells, transfection of cells with MDGA2 resulted in the formation of larger cellular aggregates (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>), demonstrating that MDGA2 interactions can indeed occur in <italic>trans</italic>.</p>

        <title>Ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting axonal tracts intermingle in the longitudinal axis</title>
        <p>As MDGA2 was found to be expressed in both contralaterally as well as ipsilaterally (dI1, V1) projecting interneurons, we tested whether MDGA2-mediated homophilic interactions would be required for axon growth along the longitudinal axis. To this end we first needed to analyze whether V1 ipsilaterally projecting and dI1 contralaterally projecting interneurons indeed intermingled in the longitudinal axis. Labelling dorsal and ventral populations of interneurons with different dyes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref>) resulted in the staining of contra- (DiI, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>) as well as ipsilaterally located axonal tracts (DiA, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>).

        <title>Contralateral knockdown of MDGA2 causes similar turning phenotypes</title>
        <p>The fact that MDGA2 was able to mediate homophilic interactions and the finding that longitudinal axon tracts formed by ipsi- and contralateral projecting axons intermingled in the longitudinal axis raised the question of whether the growth of commissural axons along the longitudinal axis depended on homophilic MDGA2 trans-interactions. To test this hypothesis, we performed knockdown experiments targeting the contralateral instead of the ipsilateral side. While most commissural axons were still able to cross the floor plate in embryos with contralateral MDGA2 knockdown, the growth of commissural axons along the longitudinal axis was almost completely abolished (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A-C</xref>). Quantification of the phenotype indicated that less than 15% of the post-crossing commissural axons were able to grow along the longitudinal axis compared to control embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). The fact that down-regulation of MDGA2 on the contralateral side had such a strong effect on the growth of dorsal commissural interneurons clearly indicated that homophilic MDGA2 interactions were required for their proper elongation along the longitudinal axis.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Commissural interneurons located in the dorsal part of the chicken spinal cord send out axons along very specific, highly stereotypic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the lumbosacral spinal cord, outgrowth of commissural axons starts as early as stage 19, and by stage 22 commissural axons have reached the ventral midline and start crossing it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. By stage 25, most commissural axons have turned into the longitudinal axis and extend rostrally within the ventral funiculus before deviating from the ventral midline to join more dorsally located fibre tracts. Our experiments have shown that <italic>MDGA2 </italic>is strongly expressed in pre- as well as post-crossing commissural axons and that RNAi-mediated knockdown and antibody perturbation causes severe pathfinding defects in commissural axons.</p>
      <p>However, knockdown of MDGA2 did not influence axon outgrowth towards the floor plate, nor did it cause obvious axon stalling at the ipsilateral side. Commissural axons stalled at the floor-plate exit site and growth along the anteroposterior axis was completely abolished after <italic>MDGA2 </italic>knockdown or antibody perturbation. In contrast to the pathfinding defects seen after perturbation of Wnt and Shh signalling, the phenotype obtained after perturbation of MDGA2 may reflect the failure of post-crossing commissural axons to grow. In contrast to the guidance effect mediated by opposing gradients of Shh and Wnt, MDGA2-mediated commissural axon growth seems to be based on an entirely different mechanism. The fact that MDGA2 was able to form homophilic interactions and that <italic>MDGA2 </italic>knockdown on the contralateral side resulted in commissural axon stalling after midline crossing suggests that ipsilaterally projecting axons serve as a substrate for commissural axons to elongate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). In accordance with this model, ventrolaterally located ipsilaterally projecting interneurons express high levels of <italic>MDGA2 </italic>transcripts between stages 24 and 26 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Therefore, MDGA2 might exert its growth-promoting effect by mediating fasciculation of post-crossing commissural axons with early established ipsilaterally projecting fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The fact that we also see the phenotype after contralateral <italic>MDGA2 </italic>knockdown suggests that the observed axon outgrowth defect is not based on a failure of commissural axons to change their responsiveness to different guidance cues upon midline crossing, a mechanism recently suggested for several cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. As neither MDGA2 in commissural neurons nor in the floor plate is targeted in the contralateral knockdown experiments, such a scenario seems unlikely. Moreover, the patterning or specification of dI1 neurons should be unaffected in contralateral <italic>MDGA2 </italic>knockdowns, as the unelectroporated side receives no dsRNA that could alter <italic>MDGA2 </italic>expression. Instead, a homophilic interaction between MDGA2 is in line with the observation that the phenotypes after ipsi- and after contralateral knockdown of <italic>MDGA2 </italic>are identical.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>At this point it is worth mentioning that MDGA2 is also transiently expressed by floor-plate cells during the time when commissural axons cross the ventral midline. This most likely explains how perturbation of MDGA2 function could also interfere with midline crossing of commissural axons. About 25% of the commissural axons failed to cross the midline. However, due to the redundancy of IgCAMs with growth-promoting function, 75% of the axons reached the contralateral side normally. Previous studies demonstrated a growth-promoting effect of NrCAM and NgCAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Like NrCAM, MDGA1 and MDGA2 are also expressed by floor plate cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] (MG and PJ, unpublished observation). Expression of these molecules may enable commissural axons to enter and cross the ventral midline area. In this respect it will be interesting to study the binding properties of MDGA2 in more detail. While we have clearly demonstrated homophilic interactions between MDGA2 molecules, heterophilic interaction partners have not yet been identified. Putative candidates might be other members of the Ig superfamily, especially MDGA1, axonin-1, F11, NrCAM and NgCAM. Binding sites for MDGA1 within the developing spinal cord have been studied by Fujimura and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, MDGA1 binding sites only partially overlap with MDGA1 or MDGA2 expression sites, suggesting that MDGA1 does not or only weakly interacts homophilically or heterophilically with MDGA2. Using chemical cross-linkers we indeed found neither homophilic MDGA1 interactions nor did we observe the formation of MDGA1-MDGA2 heterodimers (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>While chicken MDGA2 is highly expressed in dorsal commissural interneurons, its rat counterpart seems to be absent or only weakly expressed in the corresponding dI1 interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In rat, however, MDGA1 is highly expressed in dI1 interneurons, suggesting that functions might have been shifted between rat and chicken MDGA1 and MDGA2 during evolution. Such functional shifts have already been observed for a number of proteins, such as NgCAM/L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and Wnt proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. While such species differences might initially lead to some confusion about protein function, it will ultimately help to better understand and predict functional divergence between different species, including humans.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>An essential mechanism enabling axonal growth is the generation of neuron-substrate interactions via cell adhesion molecules. In contralaterally and ipsilaterally projecting spinal interneurons the cell adhesion molecule MDGA2 is expressed during the period of growth along the longitudinal axis. Axons of these neuronal populations intermingle during elongation in the ventral funiculus. Elongation of dorsal commissural neurons after midline crossing is impaired when <italic>MDGA2 </italic>is knocked down in this neuronal population; a defect that is phenocopied when MDGA2 is downregulated on the contralateral side. Hence, for longitudinal growth of post-crossing commissural axons a homophilic interaction of MDGA2 is required.</p>

Subsequently, tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek<sup>&#xAE; </sup>compound (Sakura Finetek Europe, Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands), frozen on dry ice and stored at -80&#xB0;C. Sections cut at a thickness of 25 &#x3BC;m were collected on SuperFrost Plus slides (Menzel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Braunschweig, Germany) and immediately dried for 2 to 4 hours. Sections were hybridized with two RNA probes for MDGA2 (1 to 1,284; 1,285 to 2,920) using previously published protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. After hybridization, sections were developed in colouring solution (240 &#x3BC;g/ml levamisole, 35 &#x3BC;g/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 17.5 &#x3BC;g/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in TBS buffer) in the dark until the desired intensity of reaction product was achieved.</p>

Serum-free conditioned media containing recombinant MDGA2 carrying either a flag or a myc tag were concentrated to approximately 20 &#x3BC;g/ml using the Centricon centrifugation device (Milipore-Amicon, Billerica, MA 01821, USA). Chemical cross-linkers (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, ethylene glycolbis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate), 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylproprionate)) were added at a ten-fold molar excess (in respect to the present free amino groups) and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 mM Tris-buffered saline and the formed protein complexes were analyzed by western blot. Beads (Fluorosbrite PolyFluor Microspheres; Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA 18976, USA) were coupled according to the manufacturer's instructions with either BSA or conditioned medium containing different forms of recombinant MDGA2. Prior to the aggregation, assay beads were briefly sonicated.

Between 0.1 and 0.5 &#x3BC;l dsRNA (300 ng/&#x3BC;l) mixed with a YFP control plasmid (20 ng/&#x3BC;l) and Trypan Blue (0.04% v/v; Invitrogen) were injected into the central canal of 3-day-old chick embryos (stages 18 to 20) using glass capillaries. Five pulses of 50-ms duration at 25 V were given using platinum electrodes (BTX, Genetronics, San Diego, CA, USA) of 4 mm length with a distance of 4 mm between anode and cathode. MDGA2 antibodies were raised against three different peptides whose sequences are indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>. A standard immunisation protocol offered by Eurogentec was used for the antibody production (Eurogentec, 4102 Seraing, Belgium). Antibodies from the final bleed were affinity purified against the corresponding peptides. Peptide antibodies against MDGA2 (3 to 5 &#x3BC;g/&#x3BC;l) were injected into the central canal of stage 18 chicken embryos as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

In order to cover a broad spectrum of different species, three mammalian (hs, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>; mm, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>; rn, <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>), one marsupial (md, <italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>), two avian (tg, <italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic>; gg, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), one reptilian (ac, <italic>Anolis carolinensis</italic>) and one amphibian (xt, <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>) species were used. As an outgroup to root the tree, an MDGA homolog found in <italic>Ciona intestinalis </italic>was included. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A conserved stretch of 809 amino acids determined by the program Gblocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] was used for phylogenetic reconstruction. The phylogenetic tree was built using the maximum likelihood method with the WAG amino acid replacement matrix. The approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) was used to judge branch reliability. aLRT values above 0.5 are shown. Avian proteins are shown in red. The scale bar represents the percentage (0.3 equals 30%) of amino acid substitutions required to generate the corresponding tree.

MDGA sequences were analyzed using the PredGPI predictor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Sequences of chicken, human and rat MDGA proteins were used. For all six sequences, a putative GPI-anchor was predicted, with the highest probabilities for rat MDGA1, human MDGA2 and mouse MDGA2. The lowest probability was seen in chicken MDGA1. Predicted omega-site positions (position after which cleavage of the polypeptide chain occurs) are highlighted in red and the specificity of GPI anchor attachment to this site is shown in green. Similar results were obtained using the GPI-SOM program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. <bold>(B) </bold>Comparison of the putative GPI-anchoring sequences of the MDGA proteins to membrane dipeptidase (MDP). When compared with the GPI anchoring sequence of MDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], MDGAs share the anchoring characteristics. The &#x3C9;-site is followed by a spacer region and a hydrophobic stretch. The different regions are indicated. <bold>(C) </bold>Recombinant full-length MDGA2 is targeted to the cell membrane. Live stainings on cells transfected with a full-length MDGA2 flag-tagged construct resulted in surface staining with anti-flag antibodies, whereas cells transfected with a construct lacking the putative GPI anchoring sequence showed no staining. Anti-actin antibodies did not stain living cells. In permeabilised cells anti-flag staining resulted in a typical endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi staining with either MDGA2 construct, demonstrating that these constructs are processed in the secretory pathway. Under these conditions, cytoskeletal actin staining can also be observed with anti-actin antibodies. Note that the cell density in both cultures is identical, but that only around 20% of the cells were transfected with the MDGA2 full-length or MDGA2&#x394;GPI plasmids. For the live staining pre-cooled cells were incubated with the primary antibody in culture medium for 30 minutes at 4&#xB0;C. The antibody was washed away with culture medium and the cells were fixed in PFA for 30 minutes at 4&#xB0;C. After several wash steps in PBS the cell were incubated with secondary antibody, washed again and imaged with a fluorescent microscope. For the permeabilised conditions cells were fixed and permeabilised using triton before adding the primary antibody.</p>
