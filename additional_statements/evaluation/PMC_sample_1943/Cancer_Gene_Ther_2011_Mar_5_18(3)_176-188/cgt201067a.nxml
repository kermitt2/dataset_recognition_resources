      <abstract>
        <p>The inhibitor of growth (ING) family proteins have been defined as candidate tumor suppressors. ING4 as a novel member of the ING family has potential tumor-suppressive effects. In this study, we explored the combined effect of adenovirus-mediated <italic>ING4</italic> (Ad-ING4) gene transfer plus chemotherapy drug cisplatin (CDDP) on SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and its underlying mechanism. We demonstrated that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP induced synergistic growth inhibition, enhanced apoptosis, and had an additive effect on upregulation of Fas, Bax, Bak, cleaved Bid, cleaved caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, and on downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells. Moreover, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP synergistically suppressed <italic>in vivo</italic> SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma subcutaneous (s.c.) xenografted tumor growth and reduced tumor vessel CD34 expression and microvessel density (MVD) in athymic nude mice. Most importantly, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP did not have overlapping toxicities in HL-7702 normal human liver cells and normal liver tissues of mice. The <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> enhanced antitumor effect elicited by Ad-ING4 plus CDDP was closely associated with the cooperative regulation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways and synergistic inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Thus, our results indicate that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP is a potential combined treatment strategy for hepatocarcinoma.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world, and is the third highest cause of cancer-related mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> The incidence is increasing worldwide because of the dissemination of hepatitis B and C virus infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Surgical resection is the mainstay of curative treatment for early HCC, but prognosis remains unsatisfactory because of frequent recurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Liver transplantation is another potentially curative treatment for HCC, but its application is limited by the shortage of grafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> For unresectable HCC, various locoregional therapies may be used to palliate symptoms and prolong survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, conventional chemotherapy has not been shown to be effective in HCC, and there is no proven effective systemic therapy for HCC patients with metastatic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Hence, the search for novel therapeutic modalities for HCC is of paramount importance.</p>
      <p>Cancer gene therapy represents a new and promising therapeutic modality for cancers, which is based on the introduction of genetic material into cells to generate a curative biological effect. A variety of gene therapy-based anticancer strategies have been effective in animal tumor models, including replacement of tumor suppressor genes, selective activation of prodrugs, genetic immunotherapy and antiangiogenic actions. Inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4), a novel member of the ING tumor suppressor family, was first isolated and characterized by Shiseki <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Recently, ING4 has attracted much attention as a strong candidate tumor suppressor that has an important role in oncogenesis, DNA repair, tumor growth, angiogenesis, migration and gene transcription regulation. ING4 has a functionally conserved plant homeodomain-finger motif in the COOH-terminal region involved in chromatin remodeling and subsequent gene transcriptional regulation by its interaction with histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> It also has a potential bipartite nuclear localization signal domain in the middle region, which is essential for nuclear localization of ING4 and its binding and functional interaction with p53.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Previous studies showed that ING4 was dramatically downregulated in glioblastoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> head and neck carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> HCC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> and gastric carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> which was closely associated with tumor grade, metastasis and prognosis. ING4 can significantly inhibit tumor cell growth and induce cell cycle alteration and apoptosis in different tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> such as colorectal, glioblastoma, melanoma, hepatocellular, myeloma, lung and pancreatic carcinomas, and enhance chemosensitivity to doxorubicin and etoposide in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> ING4 can also suppress the activity of NF-&#x3BA;B and HIF-1&#x3B1;, leading to inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> In addition, ING4 can suppress the loss-of-contact inhibition elicited by MYCN or MYC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> More recently, it has been reported that ING4 can exhibit a marked inhibitory effect on tumor cell spreading, migration and invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Therefore, ING4 is a potent tumor suppressor that exerts its tumor-suppressive effect via multiple pathways in a variety of tumors.</p>
      <p>Chemotherapy is one of the most conventional therapeutic strategies for human cancers. Conventional chemotherapy drugs include cisplatin, also named cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP), adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil. CDDP is deemed to be the &#x2018;penicillin of cancer drugs' because of its universal, early and effective treatment for many cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Unlike many anticancer drugs, CDDP is an inorganic molecule with a simple structure that is often used as an attractive chemotherapy drug and broadly used for the treatment of various forms of malignant tumors. Although the mechanism has not yet been fully understood, CDDP is generally believed to kill cancer cells by binding to DNA and interfering with the cell's repair mechanism, which eventually leads to cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Despite these merits, severe toxic side effects and drug resistance that limit its efficacy are major clinical obstacles associated with CDDP-based chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> Thus, it is urgent to explore novel approaches to reduce drug dosage, minimize side effects and enhance therapeutic efficacy to promote the application of CDDP in cancer chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>Combination therapy with multiple drugs or modalities such as the combined treatment of gene therapy and conventional chemotherapy (chemo-gene therapy) or radiotherapy is a common practice in the treatment of cancers, which can achieve greater therapeutic benefit and reduce the side effects and resistance to drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Interestingly, the tumor suppressor ING4 can sensitize HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells to DNA-damaging agents such as doxorubicin and etoposide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> suggesting that it may be used as a chemosensitive modulator in the combination therapy with chemotherapy drugs for cancers. Therefore, we hypothesized that a combination of adenovirus-mediated <italic>ING4</italic> (Ad-ING4) gene transfer and chemotherapy drug CDDP would exhibit an enhanced antitumor activity for human cancers. To date, the therapeutic effect of the conjugation of Ad-ING4 with CDDP on human cancers has not been reported. To enhance the therapeutic efficacy and develop a novel combination therapeutic modality for HCC, in this study, we investigated the potential combined effect of Ad-ING4 plus CDDP against SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in an athymic nude mouse model, and also elucidated its underlying molecular mechanism.</p>

        <title>Analysis of adenoviral infection efficiency and <italic>ING4</italic> transgene expression</title>
        <p>The recombinant replication-incompetent Ad5E1- and E3-deleted adenovirus with two independent cytomegalovirus promoters driving ING4 and GFP expression, Ad-ING4 and its control adenovirus Ad-GFP expressing GFP under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter were prepared as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> The titer of Ad-ING4 and Ad-GFP adenoviruses was determined using the gene transfer unit (GTU) method by calculating the number of the reporter gene <italic>GFP</italic>-expressing QBI-293A cells under fluorescence microscopy within 18&#x2009;h after adenoviral infection. To assess the optimal ratio of infectious adenovirus (GTU) to target cells, called multiplicity of infection (MOI), for a maximal infection and transgene expression in SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells, the SMMC-7721 and HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells and HL-7702 normal human liver cells were infected with Ad-GFP and Ad-ING4 at various MOIs (0, 1, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200), respectively. The adenoviral infection efficiency was examined according to GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, the <italic>ING4</italic> transgene expression mediated by adenoviral infection in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells and HL-7702 normal human liver cells was determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blot analysis. Total cellular RNAs were extracted from Ad-ING4- or Ad-GFP-infected and uninfected SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells using Trizol, and first-strand complementry DNA was reversely transcribed with RNA as template and oligo d(T)<sub>18</sub> as primer. The PCR reaction was carried out using complementry DNA as template and ING4-F (5&#x2032;-GCGTCGACATGGATGATGGGATGTATTTGGAAC-3&#x2032;) and ING4-R (5&#x2032;-GCAAGCTTCTATTTCTTCTTCCGTTCTTGGGAG-3&#x2032;) as primers under the conditions 1 cycle at 94&#x2009;&#xB0;C (2&#x2009;min) and then 72&#x2009;&#xB0;C (10&#x2009;min) followed by 35 cycles at 94&#x2009;&#xB0;C (50&#x2009;s), 58&#x2009;&#xB0;C (50&#x2009;s) and 72&#x2009;&#xB0;C (55&#x2009;s). All PCR reaction products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. Total cellular lysates derived from Ad-ING4 or Ad-GFP-infected and uninfected SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells were resolved by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subsequently transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked by incubation with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1&#x2009;h at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C. For western blot analysis, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody polyclonal goat anti-ING4 (1:1000) in blocking solution for 1&#x2009;h at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C. The membrane was washed with TBST and incubated with peroxidase horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:3000) in blocking solution for another 1&#x2009;h at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C. The membrane was then washed and developed by use of a SuperEnhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. The protein bands were visualized after exposure of the membranes to Kodak X-ray film.</p>

        <title>Cell viability assay</title>
        <p>To assess the cytotoxic effect of Ad-ING4 or CDDP alone on SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells, the SMMC-7721 and HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells and HL-7702 normal human liver cells were dispensed in a 96-well culture plate at a density of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well, respectively, and incubated at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C. After 24-h incubation, the SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells were treated with Ad-ING4 at the optimal MOIs, 50 (SMMC-7721), 25 (HepG2) and 25 (HL-7702), or various doses of CDDP (0.75, 1.5, 3, 6 or 12&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) for 3 days, respectively. The medium containing Ad-GFP was used as a blank adenovirus control, whereas the medium containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without Ad-ING4, Ad-GFP or CDDP was used as a cell control (PBS control). At 3 days after treatment, the SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells were incubated with 10&#x2009;&#x3BC;l MTT (5&#x2009;mg&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) for 4&#x2009;h at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C. The formazan crystals in the cells were solubilized with stop solution and the plate was then read at 570&#x2009;nm using a Microplate Reader Model 550 (BIO-RAD, Shanghai, China). To further determine the combined effect of Ad-ING4 and CDDP on hepatocarcinoma cells, the SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells, a relatively non-sensitive hepatocarcinoma cell line to chemotherapy drug CDDP, and an optimal dose of 1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP were employed in the <italic>in vitro</italic> combination therapy studies. Briefly, the SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma cells were dispensed in a 96-well culture plate at a density of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well and incubated at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C. After 24-h incubation, the SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells were treated with Ad-ING4 (50 MOI), Ad-GFP (50 MOI) or CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) alone, Ad-ING4 (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), or Ad-GFP (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) for the indicated time periods (0&#x2013;4 days). The medium containing PBS without Ad-ING4, Ad-GFP, CDDP, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP, or Ad-GFP plus CDDP was used as a cell control (PBS control). To investigate whether Ad-ING4 combined with CDDP exhibits overlapping inhibitory effect on normal liver cells, the HL-7702 normal human liver cells were used as a normal liver cell control by treatment with Ad-ING4 (25 MOI), Ad-GFP (25 MOI) or CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) alone, Ad-ING4 (25 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), Ad-GFP (25 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), or PBS. Before treatment and at different time points after treatment, the viability of HL-7702 normal liver cells was assessed by MTT assay as described above.</p>

Briefly, the SMMC-7721 tumor cells (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup>) were treated with Ad-ING4 (50 MOI), Ad-GFP (50 MOI) or CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) alone, Ad-ING4 (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), or Ad-GFP (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The medium containing PBS without Ad-ING4, Ad-GFP, CDDP, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP, or Ad-GFP plus CDDP was used as a cell control (PBS control). After 24&#x2009;h, the treated and untreated SMMC-7721 tumor cells were collected and washed with cold PBS, respectively. Then the cells (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup>) were suspended in 100&#x2009;&#x3BC;l of 1 &#xD7; binding buffer and incubated with 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;l Annexin V-PE and 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;l 7-AAD at room temperature. After 15-min incubation, 400&#x2009;&#x3BC;l of 1 &#xD7; binding buffer was added and the apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.</p>

        <p>The SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma cells were treated with Ad-ING4 (50 MOI), Ad-GFP (50 MOI) or CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) alone, Ad-ING4 (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) or Ad-GFP (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The medium containing PBS without Ad-ING4, Ad-GFP, CDDP, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP or Ad-GFP plus CDDP was used as a cell control (PBS control). After 24-h treatment, the treated and untreated SMMC-7721 tumor cells were collected, washed with cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells per 1&#x2009;ml lysis buffer). Total cellular proteins were extracted and the protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay using a spectrophotometer. To elucidate the molecular mechanism involved in Ad-ING4 plus CDDP-induced enhancement of growth inhibition and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells, the cellular lysates containing 100&#x2009;&#x3BC;g of total protein were subjected to western blot analysis as described above using primary antibodies specific for Fas, caspase-8, Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, Bax, Bak, caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP, respectively.</p>

        <p>Female athymic nude mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) inoculated on the armpits of their right anterior limbs with 2 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup> SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma cells, and then monitored daily for tumor growth. Tumor volume was measured with a caliper and calculated by the formula, tumor size=<italic>ab</italic><sup>2</sup>/2, where <italic>a</italic> is the larger and <italic>b</italic> is the smaller of the two dimensions. When the tumors grew up to a mean tumor volume of around 0.2&#x2013;0.3&#x2009;cm<sup>3</sup>, SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma s.c. xenografted tumor-bearing mice were subjected to <italic>in vivo</italic> CDDP-dose-finding study and Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment, respectively. In the CDDP-dose study, tumor-bearing mice (three mice each group) were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with various doses of CDDP (1, 3, 5 or 10&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> body weight) or PBS every other day for a total of five times. Tumor volume and body weight were monitored over time. According to the preliminary CDDP-dose pilot study, an optimal dose of 1&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP was selected for the subsequent Ad-ING4 plus CDDP <italic>in vivo</italic> combination treatment. In the <italic>in vivo</italic> combination treatment, tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into six groups (six mice each group) and intratumorally injected with Ad-ING4 (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>8</sup> GTU), Ad-GFP (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>8</sup> GTU) or PBS alone, or i.p. injected with CDDP (1&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) alone or plus Ad-ING4 (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>8</sup> GTU) or Ad-GFP (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>8</sup> GTU) by intratumoral injection every other day for a total of five times, respectively. Tumor progression and body weight were monitored daily. In addition, the tumor-bearing mice were killed 3 weeks after single or combination treatment, and the SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma s.c. xenografted tumors and normal liver tissues of mice were removed, weighted, fixed by 10% neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin for hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively. On the day of euthanization, blood samples were also collected by tail veil breeding for measurement of liver serum enzymes such as ALT and AST by ELISA using mouse ALT and AST ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

        <p>The expression of CD34 in SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma xenografted tumors was tested by immunohistochemistry analysis using an UltraSensitiveTM SP kit. The presence of buffy or brown diaminobenzidine precipitates is indicative of positive reactivity for CD34.

        <title>Ad-<italic>ING4</italic> transgene expression</title>
        <p>To determine the optimal MOI for a maximal infection and transgene expression, the SMMC-7721 and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells and HL-7702 normal liver cells were infected with Ad-GFP and Ad-ING4 at various MOIs (0, 1, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200), respectively, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. More than 90% of GFP expression was found in the Ad-GFP- or Ad-ING4-infected SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells at MOIs of 50, 25 and 25 or above, respectively, whereas the GFP expression was not found in the uninfected SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 control cells (data not shown). Therefore, we selected an MOI of 50, 25 and 25, respectively, as an optimal dose for adenoviral infection of SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells in the following experiments. To assess Ad-<italic>ING4</italic> transgene expression, the total cellular RNAs and lysates extracted from Ad-ING4- or Ad-GFP-infected and uninfected SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells were subjected to reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, a significant amount of ING4 expression was found in the Ad-ING4-infected SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells, but not in the Ad-GFP-infected and uninfected SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 control cells, indicating that transgene <italic>ING4</italic> mediated by adenovirus is expressed in Ad-ING4-infected SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells at both the transcriptional and translational levels. In addition, chemotherapy with CDDP did not affect adenoviral infection and Ad-ING4 expression in the combination treatment (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Ad-ING4 or CDDP alone inhibits <italic>in vitro</italic> hepatocarcinoma cell growth</title>
        <p>Before initiating the experiment involving a combination of Ad-ING4 and CDDP, we assessed the effect of Ad-ING4 or CDDP alone on the viability of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells and HL-7702 normal liver cells, respectively. The SMMC-7721, HepG2 and HL-7702 cells were treated with Ad-ING4 at the optimal MOIs of 50, 25 and 25, respectively, or various doses of CDDP (0.75, 1.5, 3, 6 or 12&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), and the cell growth was examined at day 3 after treatment using MTT assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, Ad-ING4 treatment significantly inhibited SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cell growth (35% reduction compared with viability of control cells), whereas it moderately inhibited HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell growth (21% reduction), compared with the Ad-GFP- and PBS-treated control group (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). However, Ad-ING4 had minimal effect on HL-7702 normal liver cells (7% reduction). These results indicated that <italic>ING4</italic> transgene overexpression exerts selective killing activity for tumor cells such as hepatocarcinoma cells. Treatment of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells and HL-7702 normal liver cells with various concentrations of CDDP resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the number of viable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Furthermore, SMMC-7721 and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells and HL-7702 normal liver cells are different in their sensitivity to chemotherapy drug CDDP. The moderate reduction in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cell viability was observed at 1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP (19% reduction), and significant reduction was observed starting at 3&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (37% reduction), with maximum reduction observed at 12&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (69% reduction). Unexpectedly, the significant reduction in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell viability was observed starting at the lowest concentration of CDDP (0.75&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) (49% reduction), with maximum reduction observed at 12&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (89% reduction). However, the significant reduction in HL-7702 normal liver cell viability was observed at 6 (29% reduction) and 12&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (47% reduction), with slight reduction observed at 3&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (14% reduction). These results indicated that HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells are much more sensitive to chemotherapy drug CDDP than SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells, and only a higher concentration of CDDP ranging from 6 to 12&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> exhibits significant cytotoxic effect on HL-7702 normal liver cells. Therefore, we selected the relatively non-sensitive hepatocarcinoma cell line to CDDP, SMMC-7721 and the optimal dose of 1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP in the <italic>in vitro</italic> combination treatment to minimize toxicity to normal cells and elicit only modest antitumor activity when used as single therapy, while leaving a window for observation of the additive or synergistic effects of Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination therapy.</p>

        <title>Ad-ING4 plus CDDP synergistically suppresses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cell growth</title>
        <p>To investigate whether Ad-ING4 plus CDDP elicits enhanced cytotoxicity to hepatocarcinoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, the SMMC-7721 human hepotacarcinoma cells were cultured in the presence of Ad-ING4 (50 MOI), Ad-GFP (50 MOI) or CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) alone, Ad-ING4 (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), or Ad-GFP (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The tumor cell viability was examined daily for 4 days using MTT assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment synergistically inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cell growth in a time-dependent manner, compared with single Ad-ING4- and CDDP-treated group (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; CI&gt;1), whereas the phenomenon did not occur in the Ad-GFP plus CDDP combination treatment, indicating that it is Ad-ING4 expression that contributes to the combined suppressive effect on SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells. Moreover, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP exhibited minimal cytotoxic effect on HL-7702 normal liver cells, equal to that of CDDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The result further indicated that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment selectively exerts synergistic antitumor activity in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells but not in HL-7702 normal liver cells. To determine the optimal dose of CDDP employed <italic>in vivo</italic> in an athymic nude mouse animal model combination treatment, a dose-finding study was performed in which SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma s.c. xenografted tumor-bearing mice (three mice each group) were treated with a range of CDDPs (1, 3, 5 or 10&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) by i.p. injection. Tumor volume and body weight were monitored over time. Mice treated with higher doses of CDDP (5 or 10&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) resulted in a significant loss of body weight and had to be euthanized within a week, whereas those treated with 1 or 3&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP showed no significant body weight losses with only minimal toxicity (data not shown). Compared with the PBS-treated control group, tumor progression was significantly retarded in the mice treated with 3&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP, but moderately retarded in those treated with 1&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP (date not shown). Therefore, an optimal dose of 1&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP was selected for the Ad-ING4 plus CDDP <italic>in vivo</italic> combination treatment. To further explore whether the combination of Ad-ING4 with CDDP would result in <italic>in vivo</italic>-enhanced antitumor effect, the athymic nude mice (six mice each group) bearing SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma s.c. xenografted tumors were intratumorally injected with Ad-ING4 (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>8</sup> GTU), Ad-GFP (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>8</sup> GTU) or PBS alone, or i.p. injected with CDDP (1&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) alone or plus Ad-ING4 (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>8</sup> GTU) or Ad-GFP (1 &#xD7; 10<sup>8</sup> GTU) by intratumoral injection every other day for a total of five times. The tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> was monitored daily and tumor volume and weight were measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, the tumor growth was more significantly retarded in the Ad-ING4 plus CDDP group, compared with the single Ad-ING4- and CDDP-treated group (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; CI&gt;1), indicating that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment also remarkably suppresses <italic>in vivo</italic> SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma s.c. xenografted tumor growth in an athymic nude mouse model with synergistic effect. To assess Ad-ING4 plus CDDP-mediated <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity, body and liver weight were investigated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and d</xref>, there was no difference in body and liver weight among various groups. Histological sections of liver in different groups also showed no significant hepatic damage (data not shown). In addition, ELISA analysis of liver serum enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) showed a slight increase in ALT and AST elicited by CDDP, but no additive effect in the Ad-ING4 plus CDDP group. These results indicated that the combination of Ad-ING4 and CDDP also exhibits minimal toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic> without overlapping effect.</p>

        <title>Ad-ING4 plus CDDP enhances apoptosis in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells</title>
        <p>To examine whether Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment elicits enhanced apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cells, the SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma cells were treated with Ad-ING4 (50 MOI), Ad-GFP (50 MOI) or CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) alone, Ad-ING4 (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), or Ad-GFP (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) for 24&#x2009;h and harvested for staining with Annexin V-PE (early apoptotic marker) and 7-AAD (late apoptotic marker), and the apoptosis of SMMC-7721 tumor cells was then analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment resulted in 32.8% Annexin V single-positive cells, indicating that these SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells are in early stage of apoptosis, whereas there was 1.9, 2.6, 17.5, 10.2 and 11.9% early apoptotic cells occurring in SMMC-7721 tumor cells grown in the medium with PBS, Ad-GFP, Ad-ING4, CDDP and Ad-GFP plus CDDP, respectively. Compared with the single Ad-ING4- and CDDP-treated group, the combination of Ad-ING4 with CDDP more efficiently induces SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cell apoptosis with synergistic effect (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; CI&gt;1), which closely correlates with the Ad-ING4 plus CDDP-mediated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> synergistic growth inhibition of SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells.</p>

        <p>To further address the underlying molecular mechanism by which Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment results in enhanced antitumor effect, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as Fas, caspase-8, Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, Bax, Bak, caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP in SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma cells with different treatments was determined by western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, the expression of Fas, Bax and Bak in Ad-ING4, CDDP, Ad-GFP plus CDDP, and Ad-ING4 plus CDDP group was significantly increased, whereas the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> was decreased, compared with the Ad-GFP and PBS control group. The activation of caspase-8, Bid, caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP was also found in Ad-ING4, CDDP, Ad-GFP plus CDDP, and Ad-ING4 plus CDDP groups, but not in the Ad-GFP and PBS control group. Moreover, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment elicited an additive effect on the altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins involved in the activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, indicating that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP synergistically suppresses SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cell growth and induces apoptosis closely associated with the cooperative regulation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.</p>

In all SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma s.c. xenografted tumors collected, the CD34 expression of tumor vascular endothelial cells in the Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment group was weaker or less, compared with the single Ad-ING4- and CDDP-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), indicating that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP additively or synergistically downregulates CD34 expression of SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma xenografted tumor vessels.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Recent studies have shown that ING4 as a novel tumor suppressor is involved in a variety of processes including oncogenesis, cell cycle control, apoptosis, DNA repair, angiogenesis, migration and gene transcription regulation. ING4 can significantly inhibit tumor cell growth and induce cell cycle alteration and apoptosis in a variety of tumors. ING4 can also suppress brain-tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting the activity of NF-&#x3BA;B leading to transcriptional repression of NF-&#x3BA;B-responsive genes such as <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>IL-8</italic> and <italic>Cox-2</italic> by physically interacting with the p65 subunit of NF-&#x3BA;B.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Nozell <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> further confirmed that ING4 can specifically regulate the activity of NF-&#x3BA;B molecules that are bound to target gene promoters. Furthermore, Colla <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> reported that ING4 can suppress HIF-1a activity and its target gene <italic>NIP-3</italic> expression in myeloma cells under hypoxic condition and consequently inhibit tumor angiogenesis. In addition, ING4 can suppress tumor-cell spreading, migration and invasion by colocalizing and interacting with liprin &#x3B1;1 at the lamellipodia and downregulating the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> These findings revealed that ING4 as a potent tumor suppressor negatively modulates tumor growth via multiple pathways.</p>
      <p>Chemotherapy is one of the commonly used strategies in HCC treatment, especially for unresectable patients. Conventional chemotherapy drugs often have severe side effects that limit their efficacy. Moreover, tumor cells are able to acquire resistance to chemotherapy. The increased dose of chemotherapy drug that is necessary to overcome resistance of tumor cells, even a small increase, may result in severe cytotoxicity to normal cells. Therefore, it is urgent to explore novel approaches to broaden the application of the chemotherapy drug in cancer therapy. To enhance therapeutic effect, eliminate drug resistance and reduce side effects, several conjugated strategies such as the combined treatment of gene therapy and conventional chemotherapy (chemo-gene therapy) have been applied successfully in cancer chemotherapy. Our previous studies demonstrated that Ad-<italic>ING4</italic> gene transfer can induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in human lung and pancreatic carcinoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> A recent study has shown that ING4 can enhance chemosensitivity to doxorubicin and etoposide in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> suggesting that it may be used as a chemosensitive modulator in the combination therapy with chemotherapy drugs. However, the combined effect of Ad-<italic>ING4</italic> gene therapy and CDDP, an attractive chemotherapy drug, on human cancers, is still unknown. Therefore, in this study, we were interested in addressing the therapeutic effect of chemo-gene therapy by combining Ad-ING4 with CDDP on human hepatocarcinoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in an athymic nude mouse model and its potential mechanism.</p>
      <p>Before initiating <italic>in vitro</italic> combination therapy, we first assessed the cytotoxic effect of Ad-ING4 or CDDP alone on SMMC-7721 and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells and HL-7702 normal liver cells. We found that Ad-ING4 significantly inhibited SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma cell growth, whereas it moderately inhibited HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell growth. However, Ad-ING4 had only a minimal effect on HL-7702 normal human liver cells, indicating that transgene <italic>ING4</italic> overexpression exerts selective tumor-killing activity in hepatocarcinoma cells. In addition, chemotherapy drug CDDP induced a dose-dependent growth inhibition in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells or HL-7702 normal liver cells. Furthermore, the HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells were more sensitive to CDDP than SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells. Different tumor cell lines are different in their susceptibility to drugs. In this study, the HepG2 and SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cell lines are both adherent and epithelial-like cells, but from different origins. The former was established from the tumor tissue of a 15-year-old Argentine boy with HCC in 1975, which was reported to produce a variety of proteins such as alpha-fetoprotein, albumin, alpha2-macroglobulin, alpha1-antitrypsin and transferrin. The latter was established from the tumor tissue of a 56-year-old Chinese man with HCC in 1980. The different origins and different biological activities may be one of the reasons for the different susceptibility to Ad-ING4 and CDDP. In addition, higher concentration of CDDP (6 or 12&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) exhibited significant growth-suppressive effect on HL-7702 normal liver cells, while 3&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP only induced slight cytotoxicity. To minimize toxicity to normal cells and produce only modest antitumor efficacy when used as monotherapy, while leaving a window for observation of additive or synergistic effects of Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination therapy, we selected the relatively non-sensitive hepatocarcinoma cell line to CDDP, SMMC-7721, and the optimal dose of 1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP in the <italic>in vitro</italic> combination treatment. We demonstrated that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment selectively exerted <italic>in vitro</italic> synergistic therapeutic activity in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells, but not in HL-7702 normal liver cells. Moreover, treatment of SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells with Ad-ING4 plus CDDP resulted in enhancement of apoptosis. To further address the underlying mechanism involved in Ad-ING4 plus CDDP-induced enhanced antitumor activity, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as Fas, caspase-8, Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, Bax, Bak, caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP in different treatments of SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells was assessed by western blot analysis. Fas as an important apoptotic marker has been shown to regulate FasL&#x2013;Fas extrinsic apoptotic pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Associated with the increase in Fas expression is the cleavage of Caspase-8 and Bid, downstream targets of Fas, that have a important role in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Moreover, caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid, which translocates to the mitochondria, also results in the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Bcl-2 protein family is known to be a key regulator of apoptosis and an important determinant of cell fate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> The ratio of anti- to pro-apoptotic molecules (Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>; Bax, Bak) constitutes a rheostat that sets the threshold of susceptibility to apoptosis for the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which promotes pore formation in the mitochondrial outer membrane leading to loss of mitochondrial integrity and the release into the cytosol of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> followed by the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and cleavage of downstream substrate PARP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> Western blot results showed that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment elicited an additive effect on the altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins, leading to the cooperative activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, which may closely account for the Ad-ING4 plus CDDP-mediated synergistic growth inhibition and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells. In the <italic>in vivo</italic> combination treatment, a CDDP-dose-finding study was also primarily performed in SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma s.c. xenografted tumor-bearing athymic nude mice by i.p. injection with various doses of CDDP. Mice treated with higher CDDP doses (5 or 10&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) caused significant toxicity, while those treated with 1 or 3&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP showed only minimal toxicity. Moreover, tumor progression was significantly retarded in the mice treated with 3&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP, but moderately retarded in those treated with 1&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP. Therefore, an optimal dose of 1&#x2009;mg&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of CDDP was selected for the <italic>in vivo</italic> combination treatment. We demonstrated that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP also synergistically suppressed <italic>in vivo</italic> SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma s.c. xenografted tumor growth in an athymic nude mouse model without additive toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic>. The progressive growth and metastasis of solid tumors is dependent on the process of angiogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> Tumor angiogenesis has a critical role in the development and progression of HCC. It has been shown that ING4 can suppress tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting the activity of NF-&#x3BA;B and HIF-1a.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> It has also been demonstrated that CDDP can exert a potent antiangiogenic activity during CDDP-based cancer chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> To explore the combined effect of Ad-ING4 plus CDDP on tumor angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, the MVD in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma xenografted tumor tissues was determined by CD34 immunohistochemistry analysis. We further found that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP synergistically downregulated CD34 expression and suppressed angiogenesis in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma s.c. xengrafted tumors, which may be another important mechanism involved in Ad-ING4 plus CDDP-mediated <italic>in vivo</italic> synergistic growth inhibition of SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma xenografted tumor in an athymic nude mouse model.</p>
      <p>Taken together, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combined treatment resulted in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> synergistic growth inhibition, enhanced apoptosis, had an additive effect on upregulation of Fas, Bax, Bak, cleaved Bid, cleaved caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, and on downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells, and synergistically reduced CD34 expression and MVD in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma s.c. xenografted tumors. Most importantly, the combination of Ad-ING4 with CDDP did not have overlapping toxicities in <italic>in vitro</italic> HL-7702 normal liver cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> normal liver tissues of mice. The enhanced antitumor effect <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> elicited by Ad-ING4 plus CDDP was closely associated with the increased Fas expression and cleavage of Caspase-8 and Bid, and decrease in the ratio of anti to pro-apoptotic molecules (Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>; Bax, Bak) followed by activation of Caspase-9 leading to Caspase-3 activation and apoptosis by cooperatively regulating extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, and the <italic>in vivo</italic> synergistic inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Thus, our results indicate that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP is a potential combined treatment strategy for hepatocarcinoma.</p>

The SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells were treated with Ad-ING4 (50 MOI), Ad-GFP (50 MOI) or CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) alone, Ad-ING4 (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), Ad-GFP (50 MOI) plus CDDP (1.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), or PBS for 24&#x2009;h, then the apoptotic cells and expression of apoptosis-related proteins in SMMC-7721 tumor cells were assessed by flow cytometric and western blot analysis, respectively. (<bold>a</bold>) Ad-ING4 plus CDDP enhances apoptosis in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells. The apoptotic cells were analyzed using Annexin V-PE/7-AAD double staining by flow cytometry. The Annexin V single-positive cells (early apoptotic cells) in the total cell population represented apoptotic cells. Ad-ING4 plus CDDP enhanced apoptosis in SMMC-7721 tumor cells with synergistic effect (<sup>*</sup><italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, compared with Ad-GFP and PBS group, one-way repeated measures ANOVA and multiple comparisons, <italic>n</italic>=3 replicates per condition; <sup>#</sup>CI in the Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment &gt;1). (<bold>b</bold>) Ad-ING4 plus CDDP cooperatively regulates extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Total cellular lysates of treated and untreated SMMC-7721 tumor cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with a panel of antibodies specific for Fas, Caspase-8, Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, Bax, Bak, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, PARP and &#x3B2;-actin (an internal control). The quantities of protein expression were normalized to the internal control &#x3B2;-actin measured in the same samples. Ad-ING4 plus CDDP combination treatment elicited an additive effect on the altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as Fas, Caspase-8, Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, Bax, Bak, Caspase-9, Caspase-3 and PARP. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
