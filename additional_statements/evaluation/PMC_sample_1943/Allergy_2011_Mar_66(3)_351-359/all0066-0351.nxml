          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Recently, we found that <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> produces extracellular vesicles (EV) that contain pathogenic proteins. Although <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection has been linked with atopic dermatitis (AD), the identities of the causative agents from <italic>S. aureus</italic> are controversial. We evaluated whether <italic>S. aureus</italic>-derived EV are causally related to the pathogenesis of AD.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Extracellular vesicles were isolated by the ultracentrifugation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> culture media. The EV were applied three times per week to tape-stripped mouse skin. Inflammation and immune dysfunction were evaluated 48 h after the final application in hairless mice. Extracellular vesicles-specific IgE levels were measured by ELISA in AD patients and healthy subjects.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> application of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV increased the production of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, macrophage inflammatory protein-1&#x3B1;, and eotaxin) by dermal fibroblasts. The <italic>in vivo</italic> application of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV after tape stripping caused epidermal thickening with infiltration of the dermis by mast cells and eosinophils in mice. These changes were associated with the enhanced cutaneous production of IL-4, IL-5, IFN-&#x3B3;, and IL-17. Interestingly, the serum levels of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV-specific IgE were significantly increased in AD patients relative to healthy subjects.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>These results indicate that <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV induce AD-like inflammation in the skin and that <italic>S. aureus</italic>-derived EV are a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for the control of AD.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Skin lesions in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients display histological alterations such as epidermal thickening and infiltration by eosinophils and mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The pathogenesis of AD is believed to involve repeated abnormal innate and adaptive immune responses to environmental causative agents when the skin barrier is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Aeroallergens, including house dust mites and pollens, are well known to induce AD through IgE-mediated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In addition, microbes represent another important group of extrinsic causative factors in the pathogenesis of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) appears to be particularly important because it colonizes almost all lesional skin in AD patients, and a reduction in its colonization has been shown to decrease disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Some AD patients produce IgE antibodies specific to staphylococcal enterotoxin A or B (SEA or SEB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Lipoteichoic acid, cell wall component in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, has been detected in the lesions of AD patients and is correlated with AD severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). This finding together with the fact that about 20&#x2013;40% of AD patients display intrinsic AD with no sensitization to any protein allergen suggests the importance of microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p>
    <p>Gram-negative bacteria secrete outer membrane vesicles (OMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), which have pathogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated for the first time that the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>S. aureus</italic> produces OMV-like vesicles called extracellular vesicles (EV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The EV produced by <italic>S. aureus</italic> are spherical with a diameter of 20&#x2013;100 nm and are shed from the bacterium's membranes. Proteomic analysis revealed that the protein expression pattern in these EV differs from that in whole bacteria, and that they contain various pathogenic molecules. Among these, &#x3B1;-hemolysin and cysteine protease have been linked with AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). These findings suggest that EV is a potent initiator of host immune responses.</p>
    <p>In AD patients, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, rather than invading and infecting the skin, colonizes it. It is thus reasonable to assume that the skin is affected by secretory products from <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Given that staphylococcal secretory products are relevant to the pathogenesis of AD, we hypothesized that <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV, which are complexes of various pathogenic molecules secreted by the bacterium, are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. In this study, we found through <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies that <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV are causative agents in AD, and the clinical observation also supports this hypothesis.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Mice</title>
        <p>SKH-HR1 (hairless) mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc. (Yokohama, Japan) and were bred in a pathogen-free facility at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH; Pohang, Korea). All animal experiments were approved by the POSTECH Ethics Committee.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Patients</title>
        <p>Skin lavage fluids were obtained from two AD patients visiting Pediatric Clinic of Seoul Suncheonhyang Hospital (Seoul, Korea). Serum samples were obtained from 60 AD patients (30 patients aged 6&#x2013;9 years and 30 patients aged over 10 years) and 20 healthy subjects aged 6&#x2013;16 years, who were recruited from Seoul Samsung Hospital (Seoul, Korea). Skin lavage fluids and serum samples were isolated after written informed consent had been obtained. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Seoul Suncheonhyang Hospital and Seoul Samsung Hospital, respectively.</p>

        <title>Isolation of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> extracellular vesicles</title>
        <p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> EV were obtained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Briefly, <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC14458) was cultured in nutrient broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and grown at 37&#xB0;C to 1.0 of optical density (at 600 nm). Bacteria were removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-&#x3BC;m vacuum filter. The filtrate was concentrated by ultrafiltration using the QuixStand Benchtop System (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in conjunction with a 100-kD hollow-fiber membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting concentrated filtrate was passed through a 0.22-&#x3BC;m vacuum filter. Extracellular vesicles were isolated from the resulting filtrate by ultracentrifugation at 150 000 <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>. The concentration of protein in the EV was measured by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Hereafter, the reported doses of EV refer to the amount of EV protein. Isolated EV were stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C before use. Bacteria and EV removed, and then &lt; 100 and &gt;100-kD soluble fractions of bacterial culture media were concentrated. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assays, and culture media were stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C before use.</p>

        <title>The generation of an atopic dermatitis mouse model using <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> extracellular vesicles</title>
        <p>To create a mouse model of AD, <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV were applied to mouse skin according to the following protocol. To disrupt the cutaneous barrier, the dorsal skin of 6-week-old mice was stripped five to six times using Durapore surgical tape (3M Co., St. Paul, MN, USA). Gauze (1.5 &#xD7; 1.5 cm) soaked with <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV in 100 &#x3BC;l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was then placed on the stripped skin and secured using Tegaderm bio-occlusive tape (3M Co.). For the evaluation of inflammation and immune dysfunction, the mice were euthanized 48 h after the final challenge.</p>

        <p>Skin lavage fluids were obtained by rinsing patients' skin lesions three to four times with 50 ml of sterile PBS and were stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C. To remove bacteria and other debris, 40 ml of skin lavage fluids was centrifuged at 5000 and 10 000 <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>. After centrifugation, supernatants were filtered through 0.45 and 0.22 &#x3BC;m serially. Then, lavage fluids were concentrated to 1 ml by using Centriprep YM-50 (Millipore, Carringtwohill, Ireland). Same volume of PBS was added on concentrated lavage fluids, and they were ultracentrifuged at 150 000 <bold><italic>g</italic></bold> for 3 h at 4&#xB0;C. The pellet was used as EV fraction.</p>

        <title><italic>In vitro</italic> production of pro-inflammatory mediators from mouse dermal fibroblasts treated with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> extracellular vesicles</title>
        <p>Recently, we found that <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV contain 90 proteins, including proteins with pathological function, by proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Scanning electron microscopic images showed that <italic>S. aureus</italic> secreted EV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). We evaluated whether EV or soluble fractions of <italic>S. aureus</italic> culture media induce the production of pro-inflammatory mediators from skin fibroblasts. We found that the production of IL-6, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1&#x3B1;, and eotaxin by dermal fibroblasts was higher by stimulation with EV than with soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). It was reported that the presence of IgE antibodies to SEA and SEB was correlated with the severity of skin lesions in children with AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Western blotting using anti-SEA and anti-SEB antibodies showed that SEB was present in soluble fraction, but not in EV, whereas SEA absent in both fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). We compared <italic>in vitro</italic> activity between EV and SEB on the production of pro-inflammatory mediator. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>, 1 or 10 &#x3BC;g/ml of SEB did not enhance the production of IL-6, TSLP, MIP-1&#x3B1;, and eotaxin, whereas 1 &#x3BC;g/ml of EV upregulated the production of these mediators. Collectively, these findings suggest that <italic>S. aureus</italic>-derived EV are more potent compared to soluble components, in terms of production of pro-inflammatory mediators.</p>

        <title>Local inflammation induced by the application of different doses of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> extracellular vesicles to tape-stripped mouse skin</title>
        <p>We evaluated the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV on the induction of skin inflammation. Different doses of EV were applied to tape-stripped mouse skin, and changes in skin inflammation were assessed 4 weeks after initial application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). Histological analysis showed that the application of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV to tape-stripped skin induced AD-like inflammation, including epidermal thickening and infiltration of the dermis by inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). Moreover, <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV dose dependently induced epidermal thickening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). As with dermal infiltration by inflammatory cells, significantly higher numbers of mast cells were found in the dermis of mice treated with <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV (at 5 or 10 &#x3BC;g, but not 0.1 &#x3BC;g) compared to PBS-treated controls. In addition, the numbers of eosinophils were significantly higher in EV-treated mice than in PBS-treated controls at all doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the application of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV to tape-stripped skin induces AD-like inflammation.</p>

        <title><italic>In vivo</italic> immune dysfunction induced by the application of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> extracellular vesicles to tape-stripped mouse skin for 3 weeks</title>
        <p>To test whether the application of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV to the skin induces immunological dysfunction, 5 &#x3BC;g of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV was applied to tape-stripped mouse skin three times per week for 3 weeks. Histological analysis showed that the application of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV induced epidermal thickening and infiltration of the dermis by inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). Tape stripping itself induced epidermal thickening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). To characterize the immune dysfunction induced by <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV, we measured the production of Th1, Th17, and Th2 cytokines by T cells from skin-draining LNs following <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV. The production of IFN-&#x3B3; and IL-17 was significantly higher in cells from the EV-treated mice than in those from the PBS-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>). IL-4 and IL-5 were not detected in the supernatants from cells isolated from either treatment group (data not shown). In terms of the skin production of Th1, Th17, and Th2 cytokines, the levels of IFN-&#x3B3;, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-5 in skin homogenates from EV-treated mice were significantly higher than those from PBS-treated mice. Tape stripping did not itself enhance the production of these cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3D</xref>). With regard to the production of antibodies, we found the serum levels of total IgG1 and IgE to be similar in the EV- and PBS-treated mice (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that exposure to <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV for 3 weeks induces a mixed Th1-/Th17-/Th2-type inflammatory response in the skin, whereas a mixed Th1/Th17 cell response in skin-draining LNs.</p>

        <p>To assess the effects of long-term exposure to <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV, <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV (5 &#x3BC;g) were applied to tape-stripped skin three times per week for 8 weeks. Histological analysis showed that prolonged exposure to <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV induced epidermal thickening and increased infiltration of the dermis by inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). Infiltration of the dermis by mast cells and eosinophils was significantly increased in EV-treated mice relative to PBS-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). Furthermore, long-term <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV enhanced the production of IL-17 by T cells in skin-draining LNs stimulated with <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>). However, it did not enhance the EV-induced production of IFN-&#x3B3; and IL-4 (data not shown).

In addition, the serum SEB-specific IgE levels were significantly higher in only &gt;9 years aged AD patients than in age-matched healthy subjects; this IgE levels were elevated in 33.3% of 6&#x2013;9 years aged and 33.3% of &gt;9 years aged AD patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Elucidating the pathogenesis of AD has been difficult because of complex interactions between the causative factors and host immune response. Among the known causative factors, microbes are thought to be particularly important in the pathogenesis of AD by elaborating secretary products, including soluble toxins. Recently, we found that <italic>S. aureus</italic> secretes EV, in which pathogenic proteins are incorporated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In the present study, experimental and clinical data support the hypothesis that <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV are involved in the pathogenesis of AD.</p>
      <p>In terms of host immune responses of AD pathogenesis, recent studies showed that IL-17 producing cells are found in the blood of AD patients and that AD pathogenesis is related with IL-17-mediated immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). In the present study, we found that the cutaneous application of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV induced Th17-cell response in skin-draining LNs, suggesting that Th17-cell response is important in the AD pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>The present data showed that the cutaneous application of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV induced skin inflammation characterized by infiltration of mast cells and eosinophils. This inflammatory response was associated with enhanced production of not only Th1/Th17-type cytokines, but also Th2-type cytokines in the skin. In addition, the present study showed that <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of fibroblasts with <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV increased the secretion of the Th2-type cytokines, such as TSLP and eotaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). These findings suggest that Th2-type inflammation induced by <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV is mediated by local production of Th2-type cytokines from dermal fibroblasts.</p>
      <p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> can colonize in skin or nasal passage in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In the present study, we firstly demonstrated that <italic>S. aureus</italic>-derived EV are present on the skin of AD patients. We also found that <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV-specific IgG1 were detected in serums from not only AD patients but also healthy subjects. These findings suggest that <italic>S. aureus</italic> secretes EV in skin, which induce systemic immune responses.</p>
      <p>Previous studies showed that serum levels of IgE specific to staphylococcal enterotoxins were not only elevated in AD patients, but also correlated with disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Our present data indicate that serum levels of both <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV- and SEB-specific IgE were elevated in the AD patients compared to healthy subjects. In addition, the present study showed that <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV did not contain enterotoxins and <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV-specific IgE levels did not correlate with SEB-specific IgE. These findings suggest that the production of EV-specific IgE is not influenced by staphylococcal enterotoxins.</p>
      <p>Recently, it was reported that IL-17 can induce IgE production in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). The present study showed that the cutaneous application of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV for 8 weeks induce Th17-cell response, but not Th2-cell response, along with the elevation of serum total IgE in mice. These findings suggest that <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV can induce systemic IgE production by Th17-cell response.</p>
      <p>Recent evidence indicates that EV from Gram-negative bacteria induced systemic inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). We found that Gram-positive bacteria produced EV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). This is the first report to show that EV obtained from Gram-positive bacteria can cause inflammatory disease. Given the abundance of Gram-positive bacteria in our environment, further research will be needed to elucidate the relationships between EV from Gram-positive bacteria and the pathogenesis of immune-based inflammatory diseases.</p>
      <p>In summary, our present data indicate that <italic>S. aureus</italic>-derived EV can induce AD-like inflammation in the skin, and that the physiological animal model we employed represents a useful tool for performing translational research into AD. Furthermore, our clinical findings provide strong evidence of the importance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> EV in the pathogenesis of AD.</p>
