        <p>Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) is a genetic disorder resulting from the expansion of the CAG repeats in the <italic>ATXN3</italic> gene. The pathogenesis of SCA3 is based on the toxic function of the mutant ataxin-3 protein, but the exact mechanism of the disease remains elusive. Various types of transgenic mouse models explore different aspects of SCA3 pathogenesis, but a knock-in humanized mouse has not yet been created. The initial aim of this study was to generate an ataxin-3 humanized mouse model using a knock-in strategy. The human cDNA for ataxin-3 containing 69 CAG repeats was cloned from SCA3 patient and introduced into the mouse ataxin-3 locus at exon 2, deleting it along with exon 3 and intron 2. Although the human transgene was inserted correctly, the resulting mice acquired the knock-out properties and did not express ataxin-3 protein in any analyzed tissues, as confirmed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Analyses of RNA expression revealed that the entire locus consisting of human and mouse exons was expressed and alternatively spliced. We detected mRNA isoforms composed of exon 1 spliced with mouse exon 4 or with human exon 7. After applying 37 PCR cycles, we also detected a very low level of the correct exon 1/exon 2 isoform. Additionally, we confirmed by bioinformatic analysis that the structure and power of the splicing site between mouse intron 1 and human exon 2 (the targeted locus) was not changed compared with the native mouse locus. We hypothesized that these splicing aberrations result from the deletion of further splicing sites and the presence of a strong splicing site in exon 4, which was confirmed by bioinformatic analysis. In summary, we created a functional ataxin-3 knock-out mouse model that is viable and fertile and does not present a reduced life span. Our work provides new insights into the splicing characteristics of the <italic>Atxn3</italic> gene and provides useful information for future attempts to create knock-in SCA3 models.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3), which is also called Machado&#x2013;Joseph disease (MJD), is a dominant genetic disorder that results from the expansion of the CAG repeats in the coding sequence of the <italic>ATXN3</italic> gene (Coutinho and Andrade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1978</xref>; Kawaguchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1994</xref>) (MJD and <italic>ATXN3</italic>: OMIM 109150 and 607047). The majority of patients suffering from SCA3 carry one allele of <italic>ATXN3</italic> with 60&#x2013;82 CAG repeats and a second allele containing the normal number of repeats, which is usually between 13 and 41 (Kawaguchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1994</xref>; Giunti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1995</xref>). Expression of the mutant allele leads to the onset of neurological symptoms, typically in the third or fourth decade of life. SCA3 patients commonly suffer from motor and mental abnormalities, such as gait ataxia, ocular symptoms, and dementia (Coutinho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1982</xref>; Ishikawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2002</xref>; Kawai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>; Fran&#xE7;a et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>; Riess et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although the relevant pathogenesis of SCA3 is based on the toxic function of the mutant ataxin-3 protein, the exact mechanism of disease remains elusive (Paulson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>; Riess et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2008</xref>). Expanded CAG repeats in the ataxin-3 mRNA result in long polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts within the protein, resulting in protein misfolding. These changes may affect features, such as protein binding, subcellular localization of the protein, and its degradation and elimination from the cell (Chow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>; Lessing and Bonini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>). In the misfolded protein, the polyglutamine chains are exposed and can scaffold normal and mutant ataxin-3 as well as important proteins, such as histone acetylases, deacetylases, transcription factors, and the proteasome complex (Evert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>; Bilen and Bonini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>; Ferro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>; Lessing and Bonini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>; Jia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>). In turn, the scaffolding and subsequent events can affect gene expression, change the cellular localization of different proteins, and lead to the dysfunction of the protein elimination pathway in cells.</p>
      <p>Knock-out, transgenic, and YAC transgenic mouse models have been created to explore various aspects of SCA3 pathogenesis. The transgenic animals in these studies were generated by the random integration of a transgene in the form of an artificial construct that contained either full-length human ataxin-3 cDNA or some fragment of the gene. The transgene was usually driven by a different promoter, such as a Purkinje-specific L7 promoter (Ikeda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>). Model animals containing the polyQ fragment of ataxin-3 develop the disease phenotype. However, animals with full-length mutant ataxin-3 protein are viable and healthy. To explain this surprising result, the authors hypothesized that the lack of proteolytic cleavage of the mutant transgenic protein is necessary to produce the disease phenotype. Consistent with this hypothesis, transgenic mice expressing higher levels of ataxin-3 with expanded repeats developed a phenotype reminiscent of SCA3 and had a cleavage fragment in brain (Goti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2004</xref>). The YAC transgenic animals created by Cemal et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>) expressed human ataxin-3 driven by its native gene promoter. This strategy resulted in a close reproduction of human SCA3 pathology in the mouse model, a result that is probably due to the similar expression pattern of the mutant ataxin-3 protein. This result reveals the importance of non-coding sequences and native protein processing in the onset and progression of SCA3. The impact of the cellular localization of ataxin-3 on the pathology of SCA3 has been investigated using mouse models generated by introducing transgenes coupled to either a nuclear localization signal (NLS) or a nuclear export signal (NES) (Bichelmeier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>). The resulting animals containing the NLS transgene showed markedly enhanced SCA3 symptoms relative to animals containing the NES transgene. The role of co-chaperones and the ubiquitin ligase C-terminus of the Hsp70-interacting protein in enhancing disease progression and increasing aggregate formation was explored in the SCA3 mouse model (Williams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2009</xref>) created by Goti et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2004</xref>). Recently, Boy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2009</xref>) provided evidence that the behavioral SCA3 phenotype could be reversible by creating an inducible model of SCA3 using the Tet-off system. The same group demonstrated the late-onset transgenic model with ataxin-3 driven by huntingtin promoter (Boy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>). The mouse model where ataxin-3 is driven by the CMV promoter does not show intranuclear inclusions (Silva-Fernandes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). In addition, one knock-out model of mouse ataxin-3 has been created. These animals exhibit increased levels of total protein ubiquitination and minor behavioral changes, but they are viable and fertile (Schmitt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>We have created a K300 transgenic mouse model that lacks functional ataxin-3 protein expression confirmed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The mouse model was generated as a result of a knock-in strategy wherein human ataxin-3 cDNA was inserted into the mouse ataxin-3 locus. The final mouse model exhibited the presence of several splice forms of ataxin-3 mRNA and the presence of deleted non-functional ataxin-3 proteins that were detected at very low levels only when using a massive excess of protein extract. The correctly spliced mRNA isoform containing mouse exon 1/human exons was detected at very low levels using PCR with increased sensitivity, but the protein of interest was not detected even when using a massive excess of protein extract for immunoblotting. The most prominent mRNA isoforms detected in mut/mut animals were mouse ataxin-3 missing exons 2 and 3 and the mRNA comprising mouse exon 1 spliced with human exon 7. We conclude that the reason for the lack of ataxin-3 protein expression was the occurrence of alternative splicing events at the <italic>Atxn3</italic> locus after targeting. In summary, these transgenic mice are functional knock-out of ataxin-3, are viable and fertile, and do not have a reduced life span.</p>

        <title>Strategy and Generation of the K300 Mouse Model</title>
        <p>The K300 (ICS internal project number) SCA3 transgenic mouse model was generated at the Institut Clinique de la Souris (ICS) in Strasbourg, France, as part of the &#x201C;RNA Interference Technology as Human Therapeutic Tool&#x201D; (RIGHT) project. The human mutant ataxin-3 cDNA sequence containing 69 CAG repeats was cloned from total mRNA isolated from human fibroblasts (GM06153) that were derived from a patient suffering from SCA3. The mouse model was generated using a knock-in strategy that introduced a human cDNA sequence that spanned exons 2 through 11 of the human mutant ataxin-3 mRNA into the mouse ataxin-3 gene. To inactivate the mouse ataxin-3 gene, the strategy was designed to preserve mouse exon 1 and intron 1 in the native gene and introduce human exons 2&#x2013;11 in place of mouse exons 2 and 3 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the final construct used for homologous recombination, an SV40 polyadenylation signal and a loxP-NEO<sup>R</sup>-loxP cassette were introduced downstream of the human ataxin-3 cDNA. The homologous arms present in the construct were 4.5 and 3.5&#xA0;kb for the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; arms, respectively. The construct was subsequently introduced into Sv129/Pas embryonic stem cells, and clones were selected based on neomycin resistance and tested for proper recombination by PCR and sequencing. The clones were then injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice to obtain chimeras, which were then bred to obtain transgenic animals. The loxP-NEO<sup>R</sup>-loxP cassette was excised by breeding the transgenic animals with animals expressing Cre recombinase.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>The structure of the mouse ataxin-3 gene and the targeting strategy.

        <title>Genotyping Strategies</title>
        <p>All animals were genotyped using a protocol based on the facts that the mutant allele does not contain an intron between exons 2 and 3 and that the sequences of both exons 2 and 3 are identical between humans and mice. Therefore, primers binding to both human and mouse exons 2 and 3 would generate PCR products that differed only by the length of the intron. The PCR product lengths resulting from this approach would be 376&#xA0;bp in wild-type (wt/wt) animals, 150&#xA0;bp in mutant (mut/mut) animals, and both products in wt/mut animals. The sequences of primers for genotyping are as follows: forward exon 2 CAAGGAGAATATTTTAGCCCTGT, reverse exon 3 GCCGCTGTCATCCATATTTCCA.</p>

        <title>Structure of the Targeted <italic>Atxn3</italic> Gene and the Expression of Ataxin-3 in Targeted ES Cells</title>
        <p>Prior to the electroporation of ES cells, the entire cassette used for homologous recombination was sequenced (ICS; Strasburg). This verified the correct structure and sequence (for a description of the cassette, see the Materials and Methods). Stable ES cell clones were selected, and PCR and sequencing were performed to detect proper transgene integration into the <italic>Atxn3</italic> gene locus (ICS; Strasburg). These analyses confirmed that the human cDNA was inserted at mouse exon 2 and that the mouse genomic sequence containing exon 2, intron 2, and exon 3 was deleted. Mouse exon 1 and intron 1 were preserved in the gene structure and were followed by human exons 2&#x2013;11 and an SV40 polyadenylation signal. The knock-in targeting strategy of the <italic>Atxn3</italic> gene is depicted in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. To demonstrate the correct positioning of the transgene in the genome, two distinct pairs of primers were designed to bind mouse intron 1/human exon 2 (5&#x2032;-flank) and human exon 10/mouse intron 3 (3&#x2032;-flank). The PCR amplification generated 2 PCR products of 278&#xA0;bp and 476&#xA0;bp in length, corresponding to the expected bp count. The PCR products generated from the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of the construct were sequenced and revealed the correct insertion of the transgene (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Mouse exons and introns beyond exon 3 were unchanged.</p>
        <p>Additionally, to investigate the ataxin-3 protein expression in targeted ES cells, the total protein extract was analyzed by western blotting, and the expression of both the mouse ataxin-3 protein (41&#xA0;kDa) and human mutant ataxin-3 (57&#xA0;kDa) was detected (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). For a positive control, the blots of the total protein extracted from GM06153 SCA3 human fibroblasts revealed a mutant ataxin-3 band with 69 CAG repeats that had an estimated molecular weight of 57&#xA0;kDa.</p>

        <title>Analyses of the Ataxin-3 Protein in K300 Mouse Tissues</title>
        <p>To investigate the expression of the ataxin-3 protein in the transgenic mice, total protein was extracted from the cerebral cortex, skeletal muscles (quadriceps), heart, lungs, liver, spleen, testis, and GM06153 human fibroblasts as a positive control and resolved by 12% SDS&#x2013;PAGE. In wt/wt animals, the immunoblot analyses revealed a specific band representing mouse ataxin-3 with an estimated molecular weight of 41&#xA0;kDa that was present at relatively high concentrations in testis, cerebral cortex, lungs, liver, and spleen and was hardly detectable in skeletal muscles and the heart (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The band detected in wt/wt mice had a lower molecular weight than the positive control band of wt human ataxin-3 (48&#xA0;kDa). The similar mouse ataxin-3 41-kDa band and the expected human mutant 57-kDa band were not detected in mut/mut animals in any of the tissues analyzed (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Moreover, none of these immunoreactive bands was observed upon increasing the protein load to 200&#xA0;&#x3BC;g of mut/mut protein extract from cerebral cortex and testis per lane (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Additionally, analysis of the ataxin-3 protein in testis from wt/wt animals revealed an additional strongly immunoreactive band of 34&#xA0;kDa that we describe as ataxin-3 isoform, since it was not present in testis of mut/mut animals (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). Upon increasing the total protein extract content to the large amount of 200&#xA0;&#x3BC;g per lane, we were able to observe two faint immunoreactive bands of 33 and 26&#xA0;kDa, respectively, that only appeared in mut/mut animals, but exclusively in testis and not in cerebral cortex (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Note that the apparent 7-kDa molecular weight difference was also present between mouse ataxin-3 (41&#xA0;kDa) and the 34-kDa ataxin-3 isoform detected in wt/wt testis.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#xA0;3</label><caption><p>Immunoblot analysis of ataxin-3 expression in tissues of K300 mice.

The extracts were resolved by 12% SDS/PAGE, and the blot was stained with a polyclonal antibody for ataxin-3. In wt/wt animals, the analysis revealed a mouse ataxin-3 41-kDa band present at relatively high concentrations in testis, cerebral cortex, lungs, liver, and spleen that was hardly detectable in skeletal muscles and heart. A similar 41-kDa band and the human mutant ataxin-3 57-kDa band were not detected in any tissues from mut/mut animals. Additionally, we detected a 34-kDa band of the ataxin-3 isoform in testis from wt/wt animals. This isoform was not present in the testis of mut/mut animals (<bold>a</bold>). Upon increasing the total protein load to 200&#xA0;&#x3BC;g per lane, we were still unable to detect a human mutant ataxin-3 57-kDa band, but we did detect two faint immunoreactive bands of 33 and 26&#xA0;kDa, only in testis of mut/mut animals. The apparent 7-kDa molecular weight difference between the 33- and 26-kDa bands is the same as that between mouse ataxin-3 (41&#xA0;kDa) and the 34-kDa ataxin-3 isoform detected in wt/wt testis (<bold>b</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12017_2010_8137_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>

        <title>The Cellular Phenotype of the K300 Mouse</title>
        <p>Nuclear inclusions are the hallmark of polyglutamine disorders and are present in both patients and mouse models.

        <title>Expression of Ataxin-3 mRNA in the Brain of K300 Animals</title>
        <p>The examination of protein expression and the lack of ataxin-3 staining in tissue provided strong indications that the expression from the targeted <italic>Atxn3</italic> allele was defective, leading us to hypothesize that the allele had acquired knock-out properties. To further investigate this issue and the possible reasons for the lack of ataxin-3 protein in mice, we tested <italic>Atxn3</italic> mRNA expression. Since the expression of ataxin-3 and the pathology of SCA3 are both located in the brain, we initially examined the expression of ataxin-3 mRNA in brain samples from transgenic animals, including samples of cortex, cerebellum, pons, and basal ganglia. A representative set of RT&#x2013;PCR results generated using tissue samples from the cerebral cortex was selected for this publication and described below. RT&#x2013;PCR results from other brain regions yielded similar results (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Specific primers were used to selectively detect either human (mut allele) or mouse ataxin-3 mRNA (wt allele) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). A single forward primer was designed for exon 1 to bind mRNA from both wt and mut alleles. The human-specific reverse primer was designed to bind exon 8 and generate a mut-specific PCR product of 677&#xA0;bp. The mouse-specific reverse primer was designed to bind exon 9 and generate a wt-specific product of 823&#xA0;bp. Interestingly, the standard 28 PCR cycles did not allow us to detect the mut-specific product (677&#xA0;bp) using the RT template from mut/mut or wt/mut animals. A detailed description of the detection of the mut-specific product and other splice forms is provided below. Unexpectedly, the wt-specific product was present in mut/mut animals, but was shorter than the wt/wt&#x2014;specific product (613&#xA0;bp). Wt-specific RT&#x2013;PCR of wt/mut animals revealed two products, the 613-bp product described above and the expected 823-bp wt-specific product. As expected, the wt-specific product was present in wt/wt animals (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The presence of the short 613-bp wt product in the mut/mut animals was even more puzzling, as this product appeared to be shortened by the combined length of mouse exons 2 and 3, which had been deleted. Sequencing analysis demonstrated that the sequence of mouse exon 1 was directly linked with mouse exon 4 and subsequent exons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These results indicate that the aberrant splicing of the mRNA expressed from the targeted allele may be responsible for the lack of ataxin-3 protein expression.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#xA0;5</label><caption><p>Expression of ataxin-3 mRNA in brain samples from transgenic animals.

The RT&#x2013;PCR product that was specific for mouse mRNA containing exon 1 was detected in transgenic animals (mut/mut and wt/mut).

        <title>Alternative Splicing Events Present in the K300 Ataxin-3 Knock-Out Mouse</title>
        <p>We investigated whether the mouse exon 1/exon 4 splicing form was the only splicing event that hindered the splicing of mouse exon 1 with human exons. We also asked whether a similar splicing isoform was present in the K300 model in tissues other than brain, and for this purpose, we analyzed the total mRNA from skeletal muscles, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and testis of mut/mut animals. We detected two major splice forms in all analyzed tissues of K300 animals except liver where the exon 1/human exon 7 isoform was not present (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). As previously demonstrated for the cerebral cortex, we detected the presence of the mouse exon 1/exon 4 splice variant that was strongly expressed in testis and lungs and was less pronounced in liver, skeletal muscles, heart, and spleen (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b; data shown for testis and cortex). Moreover, we detected a PCR product representing a splice variant containing mouse exon 1 and part of human exon 7 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). This splice variant was spliced at the splicing site that was inside human exon 7, but it was in frame, so that the putative protein would be the exon 2&#x2013;6 deleted form of ataxin-3. A particularly pronounced expression of the mouse exon 1/human exon 7 isoform was detected in testis, and this isoform was detected in other tissues at lower levels. Because some splicing events and the resulting splice variants may be rare, we decided to increase the sensitivity of our detection by increasing the number of PCR cycles. Indeed, in cortex and testis using 37 PCR cycles, we were able to detect a very faint signal of the 677&#xA0;bp band representing the mut/mut&#x2014;specific splice variant containing mouse exon 1 and the human exons. The variety of reverse primers binding to all exons of the ataxin-3 gene (2&#x2013;11), and the forward primer for mouse exon 1, were used to detect splicing events throughout the primary transcript of the targeted allele. Therefore, Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> summarizes the experiments detecting splice variants with three primers binding to exon 1, mouse exon 8, and human exon 8 that best reflect the presence of all splice variants in K300 tissues. Based on our experiments, we estimate that the cellular levels of splice variants had the following relationship: the 1/4 splice variant was the most prominent, the level of the 1/7 variant was 10% that of the 1/4 variant, and the 1/2 variant was hardly detectable.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The initial goal of this project was to create a mouse model of SCA3 using a knock-in strategy that would introduce human ataxin-3 cDNA into the mouse ataxin-3 gene. In this approach, intron 1, exon 1, the promoter, and other 5&#x2032; regulatory sequences were left unmodified, and the human <italic>ATXN3</italic> cDNA was inserted into mouse exon 2. This allows the human sequence containing 69 CAG repeats to be expressed from the native mouse ataxin-3 promoter together with other putative natural regulatory sequences, such as CpG methylation islands located in intron 1. After the homologous recombination cassette was checked thoroughly by sequencing, it was electroporated into ES cells. The selected clones were screened for proper homologous cassette recombination, and the clones revealed an exact insertion of human cDNA at exon 2. Moreover, the targeted ES cells revealed the expression of mutant transgene protein, but the mutant protein was expressed at a lower level than the native mutant protein in human fibroblasts and also at a lower level than wt mouse ataxin-3. The mice were generated, and the transgene was validated in animals by PCR amplification and sequencing of 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; insert flanks as well as by PCR amplification of the internal transgress region composed of exons 2&#x2013;9, confirming correct placement in the genome in vivo. Analyzing brain, lungs, heart, spleen, testis, muscles, and liver from the generated animals, we did not detect the mutant human ataxin-3 protein that was previously detected in targeted ES cells. Therefore, we increased the sensitivity of our western blotting protocol by increasing the protein load up to 200&#xA0;&#x3BC;g, but we were still unable to detect mutant protein expression. Instead, in testis of mut/mut mice, we detected very low levels of two proteins that were much shorter (33 and 26&#xA0;kDa) than the wt mouse ataxin-3 protein. The apparent molecular weight difference between the two molecules was 7&#xA0;kDa, similar to the difference between wt mouse ataxin-3 protein and the second ataxin-3 protein isoform, with the most pronounced expression in testis (41 and 34&#xA0;kDa, respectively). The two isoforms (33 and 26&#xA0;kDa) were probably proteins with deleted protein fragments equivalent to the sequences of exons 2 and 3. The presence of splice variant (exon 1/exon 4) equivalent to 33-kDa protein was detected in all tissues. The 33-kDa protein must lack the segment of the catalytic Josephine domain that spans from amino acids Q9&#x2013;Q78 and includes the C14 residue. The substitution of C14 to alanine (C14A) in wild-type ataxin-3 was previously shown to be sufficient to render ataxin-3 nonfunctional by abolishing ubiquitin-specific protease activity (Burnett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The presence of the second ataxin-3 protein isoform (wt: 34&#xA0;kDa; mut: 26&#xA0;kDa) detected in testis was not confirmed by the detection of an equivalent transcript. Because we screened and designed primers in all exons, the equivalent transcript would have to appear repeatedly as a PCR product resulting from many different reverse primers and the forward primer for exon 1. Therefore, we conclude that this protein is the ataxin-3 isoform (because it is not present in mut/mut mice), that it is a proteolytic fragment, and, being found at relatively high levels, that it is quite stable and accumulates in testis. Pronounced expression of a similar peptide was previously reported in C57BL mouse testis, skeletal muscles, and heart (do Carmo Costa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Because we did not detect the mutant ataxin-3 protein using western blotting of the mut/mut protein extract, we investigated the expression of this protein using immunochemistry. The intranuclear inclusions often appear in the brains of patients and in mouse models of polyglutamine diseases and are usually strongly ubiquitinated (Cemal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>; Bichelmeier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>; Alves et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>). Intranuclear inclusions positive for ubiquitin were not detected in cerebellum or cerebral cortex of K300 animals, indicating the lack of mutant ataxin-3 protein accumulation. Moreover, the direct staining of the testis, the most prominent source of ataxin-3 expression, revealed a complete loss of this protein in mut/mut K300 animals. This strongly indicates that the targeted allele acquired knock-out properties and that the mut/mut K300 mice are knock-out animals. The knock-out of ataxin-3 created by Schmitt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2007</xref>) exhibited enhanced total protein ubiquitination, but we did not detect this effect in K300 animals. Since the genome encodes nearly 100 deubiquitinating enzymes, the changes produced by one of them may be compensated for by other DUBs.</p>
      <p>To determine the reason for the lack of correct protein expression, we investigated the transcripts of the targeted <italic>Atxn3</italic> locus and the level of ataxin-3 mRNA expression. Initially, we examined the brain and were not able to detect a common PCR product representing mRNA that contained mouse exon 1 and the human exons of ataxin-3. Instead, we detected human RNA using PCR for expanded repeats (Suppl. Fig.&#xA0;1). This indicated that the human transgene was transcribed. Surprisingly, in homozygous transgenic animals, but not in wt animals, we detected a PCR product containing exon 1 that was specific for mouse mRNA. However, this PCR product was shorter than the wt product by the combined length of mouse exons 2 and 3. Sequencing revealed that mouse exon 1 and the remaining mouse exons 4&#x2013;11 were spliced. The presence of a similar splice variant was recently detected in the blood of healthy human individuals (Bettencourt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>). Additionally, we characterized the primary and mature transcripts and revealed that the entire locus was expressed, and the cellular levels of both the mouse and the human portions of the transcript in the mut/mut mouse were relatively high. The cellular level of human transcript was lower than the level of mouse transcript, but it was almost twice as high as the level of primary transcript (Suppl. Fig.&#xA0;2).</p>
      <p>The lack of mutant protein expression may result from aberrant mRNA splicing in targeted allele where mouse exons 4&#x2013;11 are still expressed and induce preferences in splicing that led to the exclusion of the exon 1/human exon 2 isoform. We investigated the splicing aberrations in the targeted allele in more detail and found the presence of another splicing form, the splicing of exon 1 and part of exon 7. Moreover, both exon 1/exon 4 and exon 1/exon 7 splicing forms were also present in other tissues of the K300 model. Additionally, we tried to increase the sensitivity of our PCR detection and were able to detect the expected exon 1/exon 2 splice form at a very low level after 37 PCR cycles. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other splice variants were produced from this targeted allele. In summary, we detected the presence of three splice variants and observed that the splicing favored distant splicing acceptor sites, such as mouse human exon 7 and exon 4, and virtually eliminated splicing to human exon 2. This situation is surprising since the splicing acceptor site in exon 2 remained identical to the mouse sequence up to the 24th nucleotide and contained only 3 single-nucleotide changes in the first 70 nucleotides of exon 2. We used the SROOGLE webserver, which scores splice sites according to 9 different algorithms (Schwartz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>). This analysis revealed that combining mouse intron 1 and human exon 2 (like the transgene structure) returned exactly the same splice site characteristics and the same score as the combination of mouse intron 1 and mouse exon 2. Further bioinformatic characterization revealed that the mouse or human intron 1/exon 2 splice site was very weak, with a score of 0.78 (human) and 0.52 (mouse), according to the maximum entropy-based scoring method (Yeo and Burge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2004</xref>). Additionally, the algorithms failed to detect the branching site in intron 1. Interestingly, the score for the intron 3/exon 4 splice site was 10.55 (mouse; max. entropy). Therefore, the splicing aberrations present in the targeted allele most likely did not result from changing the properties of the natural intron 1/exon 2 splice site. These aberrations may be attributed to the deletion of splicing sites present in intron 2, exon 3, and intron 3. The lack of these structures and therefore the lack of splicing probably exposed the strong acceptor site in exon 4 to the donor site in exon 1. Moreover, it is possible that the natural low-efficiency splicing between exons 1 and 2 of the ataxin-3 gene may be the limiting step that, at least to some extent, regulates the expression of the protein. These facts provide important lessons for future attempts to create a knock-in mouse model of SCA3. The most important conclusion is to avoid the 5&#x2032; region of the <italic>Atxn3</italic> gene in future knock-in strategies due to its splicing characteristics, such as week exon 1/exon 2 splicing efficiency.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>We have attempted to create a K300 SCA3 mice using the knock-in strategy. The mouse model turned out to be nonfunctional and lacked ataxin-3 protein expression and expressed very low levels of nonfunctional proteins. We have systemically demonstrated the loss of protein expression in all analyzed tissues and concluded that we have produced a knock-out of ataxin-3. We have provided evidence that the reason for the lack of expected protein expression was the occurrence of intensive splicing events present in the targeted locus, since the model (mut/mut) expresses a long primary transcript containing mouse exons and human exons with CAG repeats. The animals do not exhibit changes in fertility or life span relative to their non-transgenic counterparts.</p>
