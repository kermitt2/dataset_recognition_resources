        <p>Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) is known to be central for salivary fluid secretion. A study of the temporal-spatial distribution of AQP5 during submandibular gland (SMG) development and in adult tissues might offer further clues to its unknown role during development. In the present work, SMGs from embryonic day (E) 14.5&#x2013;18.5 and postnatal days (P) 0, 2, 5, 25, and 60 were immunostained for AQP5 and analyzed using light microscopy. Additional confocal and transmission electron microscopy were performed on P60 glands. Our results show that AQP5 expression first occurs in a scattered pattern in the late canalicular stage and becomes more prominent and organized in the terminal tubuli/pro-acinar cells towards birth. Additional apical membrane staining in the entire intralobular duct is found just prior to birth. During postnatal development, AQP5 is expressed in both the luminal and lateral membrane of pro-acinar/acinar cells. AQP5 is also detected in the basal membrane of acinar cells at P25 and P60. In the intercalated ducts at P60, the male glands show apical staining in the entire segment, while only the proximal region is positive in the female glands. These results demonstrate an evolving distribution of AQP5 during pre- and postnatal development in the mouse SMGs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) belongs to a family of water channel proteins that allow water to pass through the plasma membrane by osmosis (Ishibashi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Krane and Goldstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>). This aquaporin has previously been detected in acinar cells of adult humans, mice, and rats (Akamatsu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>; Gresz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>; Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>), and its mRNA and protein have also been found to be expressed in the mouse submandibular salivary gland (SMG) during  embryonic (Abate et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>; Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2008</xref>; Wei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>) and postnatal development (Larsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>). Although several aquaporins (AQPs) are present in the mouse SMG (Larsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>), studies with AQP5<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice have demonstrated a key role for AQP5 in salivary fluid secretion (Krane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2001</xref>; Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>). However, its temporal-spatial distribution during development is not well documented. A detailed characterization is, therefore, needed to work towards an understanding of the role of this important aquaporin, frequently used as an acinar marker, during development. Also, a systematic knowledge of changes in AQP5 expression and localization could reduce misinterpretations when comparing published results from various developmental stages.</p>
      <p>On the basis of structure, prenatal development of the SMG can be roughly divided into several stages. Briefly, from an initial bud, the gland undergoes branching morphogenesis and reaches the pseudoglandular stage (~embryonic day 14.5; E14.5) as a solid stalk having terminal end buds. In the following early and late canalicular (~E14.5-E16.5) and early and late terminal bud (~E16.5-18.5) stages, lumens start to develop in the ductal segments and by birth a continuous lumen is present (see (Jaskoll and Melnick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1999</xref>; Tucker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>) for further details). The SMG continues its development postnatally and by postnatal day 25 (P25) (young adults), the secretory units consist of seromucous cells (Young and Van Lennep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1978</xref>). The intralobular duct segments found most proximal to these units are intercalated ducts (ID), followed by granular convoluted tubules (GCT), and striated ducts (SD). At this point, sexual dimorphism is evident in the mouse SMG (Gresik and Macrae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1975</xref>). In general, morphological gender differences in adult glands are primarily manifested by a higher percentage of prominently larger GCT cells and smaller acinar cells in the male as compared to the female gland (Chai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1993</xref>).</p>
      <p>This study describes in detail the AQP5 localization during prenatal development as well as selected postnatal ages of the mouse SMG. A combination of three immunohistochemical techniques was used to investigate the expression pattern of AQP5 in the adult mouse SMG. In the prenatal gland we first detect AQP5 in a scattered pattern in the terminal bud cells. Towards birth, AQP5 is found in all terminal bud cells and adjacent ductal cells. In addition, during the last stage of prenatal development, AQP5 is expressed in the entire intralobular duct (IAD). In acinar cells of adult animals, AQP5 is localized to luminal, lateral, and basal membranes of acinar cells of both sexes, whereas we find a gender-specific expression pattern for AQP5 in the intercalated duct of adult glands at P60.</p>

        <title>Animals</title>
        <p>CD-1 mice were treated according to the Norwegian Animal Welfare Act and the Regulation of Animal Experiments. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation (adult mice) or decapitation (embryonic and newborn stages). Mice from E14.5-18.5 (from pseudoglandular stage to terminal bud stage) and P0, 2, 5, 25, and 60 were used. The day of plug discovery was designated as day 0.5. Due to the lack of morphological sexual dimorphism present in the mouse SMG during prenatal (E14.5-18.5) and early postnatal development (P0, P2, P5), investigations of segregated sexes were only performed on young adults (P25) and adults (P60). Three SMGs from each time point were harvested from three independent litters/adult mice.</p>

        <title>Antibodies</title>
        <p>The same primary AQP5 antibody (#AQP-005, Alomone Laboratories, Israel) was used in light (0.06&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml), confocal (1.5&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml), and electron microscopy (20&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml). Other primary antibodies used in confocal microscopy recognized AQP5 (AB3559, Millipore, 0.4&#xA0;mg/ml), total collagen type IV (coll IV, AB769, Millipore, 4&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml), E-cadherin (clone 36, BD Transduction, 1&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml), and Zonula occluden-1 (ZO1) (clone ZO1-1A12, Invitrogen, 5&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml). The secondary antibody used for light microscopy was HRP-conjugated OMap anti-Rb secondary antibody (Ventana Medical Systems, Illkirch CEDEX, France). For confocal microscopy Cyanine dye-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab&#x2019;)<sub>2</sub> antibodies were used (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 24&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml): Cy2 anti-mouse for E-cadherin, Cy3 anti-rabbit for AQP5, Cy5 anti-goat for collagen IV, and Cy2 anti-mouse for ZO1. The cognate peptide for AQP5 was from Alomone Laboratories. Isotyped matched immunoglobulin G (IgG) control from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA) was used in light (1&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml) and electron microscopy (20&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml).</p>

        <title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
        <p>The submandibular salivary glands were isolated, transferred to 10% NBF (neutral buffered formalin, Sigma&#x2013;Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA), and kept in this solution over night at 4&#xB0;C. After 24&#xA0;h, glands were placed in 70% ethanol and kept at 4&#xB0;C until the day of embedding. On the day of embedding, the tissue was dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (70, 96, 100%) and then transferred to xylene at room temperature (20&#xB0;C). Following paraffin infiltration for 1&#xA0;h at 60&#xB0;C, the tissue was paraffin embedded. Serial sections (6&#xA0;&#x3BC;m) of entire glands (E13.5-E18.5, P0, P2, and P5) or parts of glands (P25 and P60), were cut using a rotary microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). As many sections as possible were placed on SuperFrost<sup>&#xAE;</sup> Plus glass slides (Menzel-Gl&#xE4;ser, Braunschweig, Germany), and each glass slide (containing material from one gland) was dried for 2&#xA0;h at 60&#xB0;C prior to immunohistochemical staining. Automated staining was performed using a Discovery XT (Ventana Medical Systems, Illkirch CEDEX, France) and the Research IHC Omni-UltraMap HRP XT procedure (Ventana Medical Systems, Illkirch CEDEX, France). Briefly, the sections were preconditioned using a Tris/Borate/EDTA based buffer (pH 8, 100&#xB0;C, Ventana) before being incubated in primary AQP5 antibody for 60&#xA0;min. The slides were then incubated in a HRP-conjugated OMap anti-Rb secondary antibody for 16&#xA0;min, followed by an 8&#xA0;min incubation in 3,3&#x2032;-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and hematoxylin counterstaining. The slides were rinsed in Reaction Buffer (Ventana Medical Systems, Illkirch CEDEX, France) between each step. After the automated staining, the slides were thoroughly rinsed in water containing detergent to remove any oily residues. The slides were then dehydrated in ethanol (70, 96, 100%) and xylene before coverslip mounting. Negative controls were performed by incubating the antibody with tissue known to contain several other AQPs but not AQP5 (E18.5 kidney) (Parreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>) and by using an isotyped matched IgG in place of the primary antibody. Sections were examined with a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope (Nikon Instrument Inc., Melville, New York, USA) and photographed with a Nikon DS-5M camera (Melville, New York).</p>

        <p>Submandibular salivary glands were harvested and fixed in 10% NBF, as described above, and stored at 4&#xB0;C in 70% ethanol prior to performing whole mount immunocytochemistry. Prior to immunocytochemistry, the glands were sliced into thick sections approximately 500&#xA0;&#x3BC;m in diameter and 50&#xA0;&#x3BC;m thick to improve antibody penetration. These slices were then rehydrated by rinsing for 10&#xA0;min in 50 and 25% ethanol followed by 1&#xD7; PBS. Immunostaining was performed as previously described (Daley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>; Larsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2003</xref>). Briefly, tissues were incubated in blocking solution (20% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) containing Mouse on Mouse (M.O.M.) blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) in 1xPBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T)). Primary antibodies were diluted in an antibody diluent consisting of 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma&#x2013;Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (PBSA) and incubated overnight at 4&#xB0;C. Antibody dilutions used were: AQP5 (Alomone antibody; 1:300, Millipore antibody; 1:100), coll IV (1:100), E-cadherin (1:100), and ZO1 (1:100). SMG sections were washed 4&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10&#xA0;min in 1xPBS-T after each antibody incubation step. Cyanine dye-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab&#x2019;)<sub>2</sub> fragment secondary antibodies were diluted 1:50 in diluent and incubated with the tissue overnight at 4&#xB0;C. Following the final wash sequence, tissues were mounted on glass coverslips with Secure-seal imaging spacers (Grace Bio-Labs) in 35&#xA0;&#x3BC;l FLUORO-GEL Gel-Mount (Electron Microscopy Sciences) containing 1&#xA0;mg/mL p-phenylene-diamine (PPD) antifade reagent. Three glands from three animals of both sexes were analyzed.</p>
        <p>Tissues were imaged on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope using argon (488&#xA0;nm), HeNe1 (543&#xA0;nm) and HeNe2 (633&#xA0;nm) laser lines at 20&#xD7; (Plan Apo/0.75 NA) or 63&#xD7; (Plan Apo/1.4 NA) magnification, with no bleed through between channels detected. All images were captured using identical settings. Negative controls included incubations with secondary antibody only, which showed no detectable signal, and peptide-preabsorbed negative control. The peptide-preabsorbed antibody control was prepared with a molar ratio of 10:1 (peptide: antibody) overnight at 4&#xB0;C. This solution was centrifuged at 13,000<italic>g</italic> for 30&#xA0;min prior to addition of the supernatant to the tissues as a peptide-pre-absorbed control. The preabsorbed control supernatant was incubated overnight with the tissue at 4&#xB0;C in parallel with the other samples.</p>

        <p>Submandibular salivary glands from male and female animals (P60) were cut into pieces and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopic Sciences, Industry Road, Hatfield, PA, USA) in S&#xF6;rensen&#x2019;s phosphate buffer (0.1&#xA0;M solution of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.2) (Prolabo chemicals, VWR International, West Chester, PA, USA) over night at 4&#xB0;C. After 24&#xA0;h, glands were placed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and kept at 4&#xB0;C until standard embedding in Lowicryl HM23 (Electron Microscopic Sciences, Industry Road Hatfield, PA, USA). Ultrathin sections (70&#xA0;nm) of the glands were cut using a Leica ultracut UCT microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), and the sections were placed on a 300 mesh nickel grid (Electron Microscopic Sciences Industry Road, Hatfield, PA, USA). The sections were blocked for non-specific staining in 5% BSA (BSA, Sigma&#x2013;Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA) in PBS for 120&#xA0;min before incubation overnight with anti-AQP5 (Alomone labs). The sections were then washed in 1% PBSA 5&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;5&#xA0;min in room temperature before incubation with 10&#xA0;nm colloidal gold conjugated with protein A in 1% PBSA for 90&#xA0;min (1:60, gift from Dr. Brorson, Institute of Pathology, University of Oslo, Norway). After washing in 1% PBSA 3&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;5&#xA0;min followed by 4&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;2&#xA0;min wash in ultrapure water, the sections were post-fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1 sodium cacodylat buffer (Fluka/Sigma&#x2013;Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA) for 2&#xA0;min at room temperature. The sections were washed again in ultrapure water at room temperature 4&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;2&#xA0;min before staining with 1% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopic Sciences Industry Road, Hatfield, PA, USA) for 15&#xA0;min. The sections were rinsed with distilled water and further stained with 0.3% lead citrate (Fluka, Sigma&#x2013;Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA) for 3&#xA0;min before the final rinse with distilled water. Negative controls were performed using IgG in place of primary antibody or by omitting the primary antibody. Three glands from three animals of both sexes were analyzed. The sections were examined using a CM 120 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Images were captured using a Morada camera on the iTEM platform (Soft Imaging System, M&#xFC;nster, Germany).</p>

        <title>Prenatal development</title>
        <p>During prenatal development, SMG cells showed an increasing degree of AQP5 staining (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The glands do not uniformly mature, and we will therefore not refer to embryonic days but rather to developmental stages. At the pseudoglandular stage, no AQP5 was detected in the terminal bud or in the epithelial stalk (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Similarly, in the early canalicular stage, the terminal bud and presumptive duct were also negative (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). In the late canalicular stage the first indication of AQP5 expression was detected in some cells in the terminal bud. All of the positive cells showed cytoplasmic staining, while some of them also had prominently positive plasma membranes. No AQP5 could be detected in the presumptive duct at this stage (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). In the early terminal bud stage, where the pro-acinar cells appeared to be more organized, all stained positive for AQP5 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). Similar to the late canalicular stage, cytoplasmic staining could be observed, and apical and lateral membranes were prominently positive in all pro-acinar cells. In the IAD, the cells closest in proximity to the pro-acinar cells were also positive for AQP5, but only in the apical membrane. The rest of the IAD and the IED were negative (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). In the late terminal bud stage, where the pro-acinar cells are further organized, AQP5 was primarily detected in the apical and lateral membranes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). The cytoplasmic staining appeared to be less prominent than in the previous stages, although there was some variability, which may be explained by pro-acinar cells within the same gland existing in multiple stages of maturation. The passage from the pro-acinar cells to the IAD cells was readily observed at this stage, and the entire IAD showed positive apical staining. However, the IED was still negative (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F).

        <title>Postnatal development</title>
        <p>During postnatal development, the submandibular gland cells demonstrated a distinct pattern of AQP5 staining (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The postnatal development has not yet been classified as named stages and we will, therefore, refer to the specific postnatal days. Some studies have described two cell types in the secretory portion of the gland at birth (P0), terminal tubule cells and pro-acinar cells, based on intracellular features (Denny et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1988</xref>; Zinzen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>). In this study, we refer to them both as pro-acinar cells and all of them showed extensive apical and lateral staining at P0. A weaker staining was detected within the basal membrane and in the cytoplasm (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). The ductal segments adjacent to the pro-acinar cells had become closely packed with high-cuboidal cells with dense nuclei, and could be characterized as ID. AQP5 was present in the apical membranes of these cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). The rest of the IAD was negative, unlike the previous developmental stage (late terminal bud stage; right before birth). The remaining duct system was also negative (interlobular and main excretory duct). The AQP5 localization pattern at P2 was consistent with what found at P0 (data not shown). Five days after birth (P5), the pro-acinar cells exhibited a similar staining pattern as P0 and P2. Apical staining could also be observed in the ID segment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). At this stage, the remaining ductal segment within one lobe, referred to as the SD, consisted of one layer of cuboidal cells and was negative for AQP5. The remaining ductal segments outside the lobes consist of both interlobular and main excretory ducts, and all were negative for AQP5. In young adults (P25), where the pro-acinar cells had developed into mature acinar cells, AQP5 was clearly localized to the apical and lateral membrane. Weaker staining was detected in the basal membrane and in the cytoplasm (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). The ID was more convoluted and branched, making the transition between acini to ID more difficult to observe than in less mature glands. Nonetheless, in both sexes, the area proximal to the acini showed apical staining, while the distal part was negative. The following ductal segment had developed into the GCT, which could be recognized as larger cells with central nuclei. These were negative for AQP5 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C), as seen for all other ductal segments. In the adult gland of both female and male animals at P60, AQP5 could be detected in the luminal, lateral, and basal membrane of the acinar cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, E). At this age, sexual dimorphism is further developed in the gland (Gresik and Macrae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1975</xref>) and was evident when compared to glands from younger animals. Unlike what was observed in glands of young adults, AQP5 localized in the ID was found to be expressed in a gender specific manner at P60. While the ID of the female gland was, as shown at P25, only positive in the part proximal to the acini (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D), the male ID showed apical staining throughout the segment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E). The AQP5 negative GCT segment is at this age further matured, and the sexual dimorphism was more apparent. The cells were larger than in younger glands, and the nuclei were now basally placed (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, E). The remaining duct segments were also negative in both sexes. Immunostaining of embryonic kidney tissue, which expresses AQP1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 11 but not AQP5, showed no reactivity, as expected (data not shown). Additionally, immunostaining of isotyped-matched negative control showed no staining in any region of SMG tissue (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>AQP5 localization during postnatal development</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"/><th align="left" rowspan="2">P0</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">P2</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">P5</th><th align="left" colspan="2">P25</th><th align="left" colspan="2">P60</th></tr><tr><th align="left">Female</th><th align="left">Male</th><th align="left">Female</th><th align="left">Male</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Pro-acini</td><td align="left">+A, L (B, C)</td><td align="left">+A, L (B, C)</td><td align="left">+A, L (B, C)</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">Acini</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left">+A, L (B, C)</td><td align="left">+A, L (B, C)</td><td align="left">+A, L, B</td><td align="left">+A, L, B</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Intercalated duct</td><td align="left">+A</td><td align="left">+A</td><td align="left">+A</td><td align="left">+A*</td><td align="left">+A*</td><td align="left">+A*</td><td align="left">+A</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Intralobular duct</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">GCT</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Striated duct</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Interlobular duct</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Excretory duct</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td><td align="left">&#x2212;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>+ positive staining, <italic>A</italic> apical staining, <italic>L</italic> lateral staining, <italic>B</italic> basal staining, <italic>C</italic> cytoplasmic staining, A* apical staining only closest to the acini, &#x2212; negative staining, () weak staining, empty slots: structure not present</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>AQP5 expression pattern during postnatal development of the mouse submandibular gland (SMG). <bold>A</bold> At birth (postnatal day 0, P0), the pro-acinar cells (<italic>arrow</italic>) and the intercalated ducts (<italic>ID</italic>) are AQP5 positive.

        <p>To examine the subcellular localization pattern of AQP5 in adult tissues that had not been subjected to embedding, confocal microscopy was used to compare AQP5 with other proteins of known localization. A cytosolic scaffolding component of tight junctions (Baker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>), ZO1, has been detected in the apical-lateral region in a spider like distribution pattern in mature SMG acini of humans and mice (Kriegs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>; Larina and Thorn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>; Maria et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). Comparison of AQP5 with ZO1 confirmed the luminal membrane localization of AQP5 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, B, C). The co-localization of AQP5 with E-cadherin, a cell&#x2013;cell adhesion protein found in lateral membranes of both acini and GCTs (Actis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2002</xref>), confirmed a lateral localization of AQP5 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D, E, F). Also evident from these images was the lack of AQP5 expression within GCTs, which were classified on the basis of their distinct morphology (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D, E, F). Immunostaining of collagen type IV (coll IV) was used to detect the basement membrane (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G). The merged image of AQP5 and coll IV (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>I) demonstrated the localization of AQP5 within the basal cell membrane, detected as a signal apical to the basement membrane (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G, H, I). Preabsorption of the antibody using its cognate peptide completely eliminated the apical, lateral, and basal expression of AQP5 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>J, K). Also, comparison of the AQP5 antibody staining pattern with that of another anti-AQP5 antibody, showed similar results (data not shown).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#xA0;3</label><caption><p>Confocal imaging of the adult SMG (P60).

        <p>To confirm the localization of AQP5 within the different regions of the acinar plasma membrane at higher resolution, both male and female P60 glands were immunogold labeled and analyzed using TEM. AQP5 was localized to the luminal membranes, including the laterally placed intercellular canaliculi and the apical membrane portion (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, B, C). Some staining was also found in the remaining portion of the interdigitated lateral membrane facing the neighboring cell (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). In basal regions, AQP5 was especially observed in areas with digits; mainly found between adjacent cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, D). There was also some staining scattered in the ER. AQP5 negative myoepithelial cells could be found in between the acinar cells&#x2019; basal membrane and the basal lamina. The acinar basal membrane adjoining the myoepithelial cells was mostly negative, but did have some staining where digits were present. The general acinar AQP5 localization pattern was indistinguishable in male and female SMG tissues.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#xA0;4</label><caption><p>Gold labeling of AQP5 in the SMG of adult animals (P60). <bold>A</bold> Overview of AQP5 gold staining in the basal membrane, membranes of intercellular canaliculi, as well as the lateral membrane (<italic>LM</italic>). <italic>CL</italic> canalicular lumen, <italic>BD</italic> basal digits (scale bar, 1&#xA0;&#x3BC;m). <bold>B</bold> Gold labeling of AQP5 was detected in the apical membrane of acinar cells (scale bar, 1&#xA0;&#x3BC;m). <bold>C</bold> Longitudinal section of an intercellular canaliculus showing gold labeling of AQP5 in the membrane (scale bar, 0.5&#xA0;&#x3BC;m). <bold>D</bold> AQP5 was localized in the basal membrane in areas where digits could be seen, while no AQP5 was detectable in the basement membrane (scale bar 0.2&#xA0;&#x3BC;m).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study revealed the temporal-spatial AQP5 expression pattern during mouse SMG development. AQP5 was primarily distributed in the secretory portion of the gland, with some variation in ductal localization. Interestingly, positive AQP5 staining in the entire IAD was found in the late terminal bud stage. Also, a gender difference was apparent in the adult gland ID but not in acinar cells.</p>
      <p>The appearance of AQP5 in the late canalicular stage confirms previous reports where it was first detected in late embryonic development (Abate et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>; Larsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>). In the early terminal bud stage, where cytodifferentiation is well on its way, all pro-acinar cells were positive and had strong cytoplasmic staining. Intracellular localization of AQP5 has also been detected at a comparable stage of development in the rat SMG (Akamatsu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>). In addition, AQP5 membrane staining was more apparent at this stage compared to the previous one. One could speculate that due to the increased AQP5 expression in the membranes, the cytoplasmic distribution represents AQP5 proteins being processed in the ER and Golgi apparatus. An earlier study using organ culture indicated that lumen formation and cell polarization indirectly regulate the AQP5 polarized membrane localization (Hashizume and Hieda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>). Thus, the modification of AQP5 localization during embryonic development seen in our results may reflect cell polarization and lumen formation in the terminal buds.</p>
      <p>In the postnatal gland, AQP5 plays a significant functional role in salivary fluid secretion (Kawedia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>; Krane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2001</xref>; Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>). In the adult mouse SMG, AQP5 has previously been reported to be localized to the luminal membrane, apical pole, or apical region of acinar cells (Larina and Thorn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>; Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>; Nandula et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>). The present study; however, depicts a more nuanced pattern of AQP5 in pro-acinar/acinar cells with not only luminal (apical and canalicular), but also lateral and an increasingly prominent basal membrane localization. Although localization of AQP5 in the basal membrane has not previously been found in the mouse SMG, studies from both the mouse parotid gland and the rat SMG have shown similar results (Matsuzaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>; Murdiastuti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>). It has been proposed that basally placed AQP5 in the rat SMG may act as an osmosensor, thereby regulating paracellular fluid transfer (Murakami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). In the mouse parotid gland, transcellular and paracellular fluid transport work in conjunction, and an association of AQP5 and tight junction complexes seems to play a role in this process (Kawedia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>). The relationship between AQP5 and tight junctions in the mouse SMG has not been specifically examined, but our results do demonstrate a close association between the two proteins.</p>
      <p>Although a previous report showed low levels of AQP5 in the developing ducts as early as E15.5 (Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2008</xref>), we could not confirm this finding in the present study. AQP5 was, however, found in the apical membrane of juxta-acinar cells from the early terminal bud stage, and this pattern was consistent towards birth and during postnatal development. Surprisingly, the entire IAD showed extensive, stage-specific AQP5 distribution in the late terminal bud stage, just prior to birth. This finding has, to our knowledge, never been described, although a previous study identified increased AQP5 protein expression levels during the same period by Western analysis (Larsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>). The reason for this transient AQP5 increase is not known, but might point to a novel developmental role in addition to its well known importance in salivary fluid secretion.</p>
      <p>Sexual dimorphism in the mouse SMG is not present at birth, but develops postnatally and is previously reported to be evident by young adult stages (Gresik and Macrae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1975</xref>). Previous studies have shown that in the ID segment there are sexual differences with regards to both cell morphology and physiology (Chai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1993</xref>; Denny and Denny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1999</xref>; Gresik and Macrae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1975</xref>). Based on morphology, the segment can be divided into two portions during postnatal development: a granulated and a non-granulated portion found in females, while only the latter is found in males (Caramia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1966</xref>; Gresik and Macrae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1975</xref>). It might be speculated that AQP5 is associated with the granulated portions of the ID in the female gland. However, such an association does not explain the presence of AQP5 in the entire male ID, which consists of non-granulated cells. At P25 sexual dimorphism in the ID segment is not yet fully developed (Gresik and Macrae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1975</xref>), which is consistent with the AQP5 distribution reported here. The localization of AQP5 in the ID of rat SMG has previously been found by some (Gresz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>; Matsuzaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1999</xref>), but has not been reported in the mouse SMG. Further studies are needed to fully understand the age and gender specific role of AQP5 in the ID.</p>
      <p>In this investigation we have evaluated AQP5 expression at all stages of embryonic development and at various adult stages. Additionally, we have used three different techniques to verify the AQP5 localization in the adult SMG. AQP5 is widely used as an apical marker in various mouse SMG experiments, ranging from embryonic to adult SMGs. It is, therefore, important to know its specific distribution throughout gland development. This study describes AQP5 as first appearing well after the initial branching period with a relatively stable expression pattern confined to the terminal tubuli/pro-acinar and the juxta-acinar cells throughout embryonic development. In the postnatal gland, a general pattern is observed where the ID and pro-acini/acini express AQP5. Taken together, the expression pattern of AQP5 is shown to reflect the complexity of SMG development by demonstrating an evolving distribution throughout glandular growth and maturation.</p>
