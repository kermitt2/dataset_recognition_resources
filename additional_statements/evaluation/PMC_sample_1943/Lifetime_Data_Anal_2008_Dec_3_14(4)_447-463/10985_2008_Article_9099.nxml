      <title>1 Introduction</title>
      <p>This paper discusses the problem of obtaining dynamic x-year survival predictions during the follow-up of patients using all current information. We compare two approaches to obtain such predictions. One approach is the recently developed landmark methodology of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">van Houwelingen (2007)</xref>. The other approach is the more traditional multi-state modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">Putter et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The data used in this paper are obtained from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebmt.org/">http://www.ebmt.org/</ext-link>) registry. We consider all 2297 acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) patients who had an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from an HLA-identical sibling donor between 1985 and 1998. The data were extracted from the EBMT database in 2004. All patients were transplanted in first complete remission. Events recorded during the follow-up of these patients were: acute graft versus host disease (AGvHD), platelet recovery (PR, the recovery of platelet counts to a level of &gt;20&#xD7;10<sup>9</sup>/l), relapse and death. AGvHD has been defined as a GvHD of grade 2 or higher, appearing before 100 days post-transplant. Prognostic information at time of transplant are: donor recipient gender mismatch, T-cell depletion (TCD), year of transplant and age at transplant. The same data have been studied in a multi-state model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Fiocco et al. (2008)</xref>. This system of engraftment and acute GvHD has been previously modeled and analyzed using quite similar multi-state models, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Klein et al. (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">Klein and Shu (2002)</xref>.</p>
      <p>For the sake of this paper we combine the events relapse and death into a single event &#x201C;Failure&#x201D;. The clinical purpose of our modeling is to obtain a dynamic prognostic model for 5-year failure free survival given the history on AGvHD and PR and the prognostic covariates.</p>
      <p>The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> we will describe a traditional data analysis of failure free survival with AGvHD and PR as time-dependent covariates and the prognostic information as fixed covariates. In Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> we will describe the landmark approach and develop a dynamic prediction model for 5-year failure free survival given the patient history during the first year. In Sect. <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref> we will develop a multi-state model for the data, use that to obtain dynamic 5-year failure free survival predictions and compare those predictions with the landmark predictions. In Sect. <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">5</xref> we will discuss the pros and contras of the two approaches and competitors.</p>

    <sec id="Sec2">
      <title>2 A closer look at the data</title>
      <p>To simplify the presentation and the calculations tied event times are broken randomly. We first show the Kaplan-Meier estimates of the failure free survival distribution and the censoring distribution in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Kaplan-Meier estimates of the failure-free survival distribution (<bold>a</bold>), the censoring distributing (<bold>b</bold>), and estimates of the cumulative incidence functions for time until AGvHD (<bold>c</bold>) and time until PR (<bold>d</bold>)</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10985_2008_Article_9099_Fig1" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p>It is clear from the survival graph that the situation of the patients is quite stable after 5 years. The graph of the censoring distribution shows that the follow-up is quite complete in the first 5 years. Attempting to predict long term survival, e.g. 10-year survival, using this data set would be tricky because of the lack of follow-up in the recent cohorts. (At 10-years of follow-up there are 298 patients at risk, 237 from the first cohort (1985&#x2013;1989), 61 from the second cohort (1990&#x2013;1994) and 0 from the last cohort (1995&#x2013;1998).</p>
      <p>Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the distribution of the risk factors and the (univariate) hazard ratios for treatment failure.
<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the prognostic factors and the corresponding hazard ratios for treatment failure (relapse or death)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Prognostic factor</th><th>Category</th><th>N(%)</th><th>Hazard ratio (95% CI)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Donor recipient gender mismatch</td><td>No gender mismatch</td><td>1.734 (76)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Gender mismatch (F donor, M patient)</td><td>545 (24)</td><td>1.14(0.98&#x2013;1.32)</td></tr><tr><td>GvHD prevention</td><td>No TCD</td><td>1,730(76)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td/><td>TCD</td><td>549 (24)</td><td>1.29(1.11&#x2013;1.49)</td></tr><tr><td>Year of transplant</td><td>1985&#x2013;1989</td><td>634 (28)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td/><td>1990&#x2013;1994</td><td>896 (39)</td><td>0.74 (0.63&#x2013;0.86)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>1995&#x2013;1998</td><td>749 (33)</td><td>0.73 (0.62&#x2013;0.87)</td></tr><tr><td>Age at transplant (years)</td><td>&#x2264;20 20-40</td><td>551 (24)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td/><td>20&#x2013;40</td><td>1,213 (53)</td><td>1.37 (1.16&#x2013;1.63)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>&gt;40</td><td>515 (23)</td><td>1.64(1.35&#x2013;1.99)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
      <p>We categorized age and year of transplantation for didactical reasons. Both factors show a clear effect. Younger patients have a better prognosis and transplantations before 1990 had a worse prognosis. Donor recipient gender mismatch seems to be of minor importance, while TCD shows a clear negative effect on failure free survival.</p>
      <p>To get an impression when AGvHD and PR occur, we show estimates of the cumulative incidence functions of time to AGvHD and time to PR in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>. By definition, AGvHD appears before 100 days post-transplant. Since PR after 1 year is very rare, we truncated the time axis after 1 year. It is clear that both AGvHD and PR mostly occur within the first 3 months.</p>
      <p>In order to define sensible landmark models in the next section, we explore the potentially time varying effect of the time dependent factors AGvHD and PR. In order to do so, we fit a Cox model with four binary time-dependent covariates: AGvHD(<italic>t</italic>), recent-AGvHD(<italic>t</italic>), PR(<italic>t</italic>) and recent-PR(<italic>t</italic>). Here AGvHD(<italic>t</italic>) stands for having experienced AGvHD before time <italic>t</italic>, while recent-AGvHD is defined as having experienced AGvHD within the last month, that is between <italic>t</italic> &#x2212; 1/12 and <italic>t</italic>. The definition of &#x201C;recent&#x201D; as in the past month is based on some exploratory analysis. We have no biological rationale other than the general observation in the analysis of this type of data that the effects of intermediate events have a tendency to &#x201C;fade out&#x201D;. The results in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> show that recent-AGvHD is not significant, while recent-PR is highly significant. There remains a significant, but much smaller effect of PR after 1 month of its occurrence.
<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Estimated parameters for time-dependent effects of AGvHD and PR</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th><italic>^&#x3B2;</italic></th><th>SE(<italic>^&#x3B2;</italic>)</th><th><italic>P</italic>-value</th><th>exp(<italic>^&#x3B2;</italic>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AGvHD(<italic>t</italic>)</td><td>0.405</td><td>0.072</td><td>0.000</td><td>1.500</td></tr><tr><td>Recent-AGvHD(<italic>t</italic>)</td><td>&#x2212;0.2200</td><td>0.179</td><td>0.218</td><td>0.803</td></tr><tr><td>PR(<italic>t</italic>)</td><td>&#x2212;0.2630</td><td>0.073</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.768</td></tr><tr><td>Recent-PR(<italic>t</italic>)</td><td>&#x2212;1.0700</td><td>0.257</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.343</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The effects of these time-dependent covariates are assumed to be additive; so for instance the effect on failure of recent-PR is the sum of the coefficients of PR(<italic>t</italic>) and recent-PR(<italic>t</italic>)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
      <p>In further model building we will consider AGvHD(<italic>t</italic>), PR(<italic>t</italic>) and recent-PR(<italic>t</italic>) and will denote them simply by AGvHD, PR and recent-PR.</p>
      <p>We also checked in the same Cox model that there is no significant interaction between AGvHD and PR. Therefore, we will not consider this interaction in our future modeling. For simplicity in further analyses we will consider year of transplantation prior to 1990 versus 1990 and later.</p>

      <title>3 Dynamic prediction based on the landmark model</title>
      <p>As described in the introduction we want to develop a dynamic prediction model for 5-year failure free survival based on the time-dependent covariates AGvHD, PR (and recent-PR) and the fixed covariates: donor recipient gender mismatch, TCD, year of transplantation and age at transplantation. Traditionally, this is done by making a model for time to failure with time-dependent and fixed covariates, plus models for time to AGvHD and time to PR depending on the fixed covariates and history and deriving a predictive model from that by conditioning on being failure free and the AGvHD and PR-status at the moment of prediction. As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">Zheng and Heagerty (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">van Houwelingen (2007)</xref> predicting models can well be constructed without making comprehensive models by constructing landmark data sets with all relevant information needed for the prediction. From the original data set we constructed such data sets for 25 landmark (prediction) time points <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub> = 0, 1/24, 2/24, &#x2026;, 1 year. We denote <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub> by <italic>s</italic> to simplify the notation whenever convenient. In all data sets we take all patients still at risk for failure, compute the current value of AGvHD, PR and recent-PR and set the horizon for the failure time at <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub> = 5 to indicate that we want to obtain dynamic models for 5-year failure free survival. The variation of AGvHD and PR over time is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The distribution of the current value of AGvHD and PR at each landmark point</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10985_2008_Article_9099_Fig2" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
      <p>It is interesting to observe that the potentially important predictor recent-PR is only present in a very limited time window between the first and the third month. We will come back to that at the end of the section.</p>
      <p>At each landmark point we can fit a simple Cox model on the interval (<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>) and use that to obtain a prediction of failure free survival at <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub> = 5. As argued in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">van Houwelingen (2007)</xref> using arguments similar to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">Xu and O'Quigley (2000)</xref>, this will give a reasonably accurate estimate even if the predictors available at <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub> have time-varying effects in the interval (<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>).</p>
      <p>In general terms we take a grid of landmark time points <italic>s</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x2264; <italic>s</italic> &#x2264; <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> (in our application <italic>s</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0, <italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub> = 1 and we have 25 equally space landmark points). Let <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) stand for the current vector of predictors that might depend on the landmarking time-point.</p>
      <p>For each landmark point we postulate the prediction model

      <p>Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> only gives the results as obtained after some data-driven model building. The main findings are:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Recent-PR suffices to describe the PR-effect. In contrast with Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the PR-effect itself was not significant in a model with recent-PR.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The effect of AGvHD and PR does not depend significantly on the landmark <italic>s</italic>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Donor recipient gender mismatch has no significant effect.</p></list-item><list-item><p>TCD has a significant constant effect.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The cohort &#x201C;before 1990&#x201D; has a significantly worse prognosis. There is no significant difference between the other two cohorts.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Age at transplantation has a major effect that depends significantly on <italic>s</italic>.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>It might seem a bit unnatural that only recent-PR is used in the predictive model. The statistical explanation is that (i) there is very little effect of PR for those who are still alive at the landmark time-point after 6 months; (ii) for landmarking in the very beginning of the follow-up recent-PR has a stronger effect that PR-present. The reader should bear in mind that the effects in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> apply to 5-year survival while those in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> apply to the hazard.</p>
      <p>The predicted 5-year failure free survival probabilities for TCD=0 and Tx after 1989 are shown for the three age categories in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.
<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Estimated 5-year failure-free survival probabilities for subject with no TCD and transplanted after 1989 based on the landmark model.

      <p>The curves look quite smooth showing that the model allows predictions at any time in the first year, not only in the 25 landmark points. However, the smooth appearance does not imply that the dynamic prediction itself is smooth. Everybody starts in the upper left corner curve with No AGvHD, no recent-PR. The other curves are actually meaningless for <italic>s</italic> close to zero. At the occurrence of either PR or AGvHD a patient shifts to one of the other curves. One month after PR, a patient with recent-PR moves back to the No recent-PR status. This also implies that the curves for recent-PR are only relevant in the first quarter of the follow-up. Another way of presenting would be to show how the prognosis changes over time for a patient who, for example, experiences PR after 6 weeks and AGvHD after 8 weeks. We leave that to the reader. It is not hard to write a little program that implements the predictions based upon the ipl*-model given by Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and approximation (<xref rid="Equ11" ref-type="">11</xref>).</p>

    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>4 Dynamic prediction based on the multi-state model</title>
      <p>The multi-state model we use for the comparison follows the methods outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">Putter et al. (2007)</xref> and the <italic>mstate</italic> software developed for the prediction based upon the multi-state model. In this approach we use a single time-scale, years since transplantation. The transition intensities and their covariate effects are modeled by imposing Cox proportional hazards models for the transition intensities. Some restrictions on the baseline hazards and the covariate effects are made in order to follow the landmark model and some states have to be introduced to handle the time-varying effect of PR. After estimating the baseline hazards and the covariate effects, the 5 years relapse-free survival probabilities for a patient with a given set of covariate values are obtained by first &#x201C;deducing&#x201D; the patient-specific transition intensities for all the transitions in the model and by subsequently applying the Aalen and Johansen formula to these patient-specific transition intensities. Each of these steps is detailed below.</p>
      <p>The multi-state model that allows an effect of recent-PR as described in Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.
<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The multi-state model</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10985_2008_Article_9099_Fig4" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
      <p>The multi-state model has seven states, indicated by boxes, and thirteen direct transitions between states, indicated by arrows. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> we have also indicated the abbrevations that will be used to denote these states. We distinguish between PR within the last 30 days and PR more than 30 days ago by assigning two distinct states to PR, states P (recent-PR) and P30 (past-PR). Since PR may occur after AGvHD, also two states are used to indicate AGvHD plus PR. A patient in state P will automatically move to state P30 after 30 days, unless another event or a censoring occurs before 30 days after PR. A similar transition after 30 days is defined from state AP to AP30. We further want to create a model in which AGvHD(<italic>t</italic>) and PR(<italic>t</italic>) act as time-dependent covariates in a Cox model for the transition to Failure with a time-varying effect for PR(<italic>t</italic>) (recent-PR versus past-PR). Moreover, we want to exclude such a time-varying effect of PR(<italic>t</italic>) on the transition to AGvHD for the patients who have experienced PR. We create such a model by imposing the following restrictions:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>No covariates are incorporated into the transitions P &#x2192; P30 and AP &#x2192; AP30</p></list-item><list-item><p>Transitions P &#x2192; AP and P30 &#x2192; AP30 have identical baseline transition intensities and covariate effects</p></list-item><list-item><p>Transitions P &#x2192; F and P30 &#x2192; F differ only with respect to a proportionality coefficient indicating the effect of recent-PR (the effect of prognostic factors is assumed to be identical)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Transitions AP &#x2192; F and AP30 &#x2192; F differ only with respect to a proportionality coefficient indicating the effect of recent-PR (the effect of prognostic factors is assumed to be identical)</p></list-item><list-item><p>All transitions into state F (failure) are assumed to be proportional, with transition T &#x2192; F being the baseline, and two proportionality coefficients being estimated, indicating the effect of recent-PR and of AGvHD.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>For the remainder the model has been chosen as free as possible; all transition intensities are freely estimated and the effects of all fixed covariates are allowed to differ between transitions. The fixed covariates we consider are the same as in Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref>: TCD, transplant before 1990 and age at transplant (in three groups). In terms of parameters that need to be estimated, the basis is a Cox proportional hazards model for the transition intensity of transition <italic>i</italic> &#x2192; <italic>j</italic> of the form

After some data preparation, using transition-specific covariates [see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">Andersen et al. (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">Putter et al. (2007)</xref>] and defining appropriate strata, all regression parameters and baseline transition hazards can be fitted within a single stratified Cox regression model. For more details the reader is referred to our website mentioned under Software.</p>
      <p>The estimated baseline cumulative transition hazard estimates of the transitions (not shown) resemble the form of the plots of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The cumulative transition intensities of P &#x2192; P30 and AP &#x2192; AP30 were estimated by adding a time to P30 (AP30) in the data used for estimation of the parameters of the multi-state model for patients reaching P (AP). These times were given by <italic>t</italic> + 30 for patients reaching P (AP) at time <italic>t</italic>. The transition intensities were then estimated from the data without using covariates for those transitions (see restrictions stated above). The estimates of the cumulative transition intensity result in very high cumulative hazards, reflecting the fact that almost all patients reaching the P state will move on to the P30 state after 30 days. The estimated cumulative hazards also have large jumps, and we shall see later that this results in slight irregularities in some of the predictions, but it is a consequence of our wish to stay in the Markov model framework in order to apply the Aalen-Johansen formulas for obtaining prediction probabilities. In this case it would have been more logical to have used the semi-Markov or clock-reset approach [see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Lagakos et al. (1978)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">Dabrowska et al. (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Putter et al. (2006)</xref>], but that would have made prediction far more difficult.</p>
      <p>The effects of the covariates are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. Again a number of transitions are not shown. The transitions P &#x2192; P30 and AP &#x2192; AP30 are assumed not to depend on covariates. The effects of covariates are assumed to be identical for the transitions P &#x2192; F and P30 &#x2192; F, and also for P &#x2192; AP and P30 &#x2192; AP30, and for AP &#x2192; F and AP30 &#x2192; F. The most consistent findings are the effects of age; higher age generally implies a higher transition rate to failure, and a lower transition rate to PR after AGvHD. TCD, given as a treatment to prevent AGvHD is effective as such, but also has negative side effects, such as a lower PR rate. Moreover, due to the well known reverse biological mechanisms of AGvHD and relapse, TCD has a higher relapse rate and hence generally a higher intensity of the transitions into failure. A more detailed analysis distinguishing between relapse and death as endpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Fiocco et al. 2008</xref>) revealed a higher relapse rate for TCD but no direct effect of TCD on death. The adverse effect of TCD on failure was not seen as clearly here because in this analysis no distinction was made between relapse and death.

<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Estimated 5-year failure-free survival probabilities for subject with no TCD and transplanted after 1989 based on the multi-state model. In light grey age &lt;20, in grey age 20&#x2013;40, in black age &#x2265;40</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10985_2008_Article_9099_Fig5" id="MO5"/></fig></p>
      <p>Each picture is based on predictions starting from a different state in the multi-state model (states T, A, P, AP, P30, AP30, respectively). The jumps in the prediction No AGvHD, recent-PR (state 3), and to a lesser extent those in the prediction AGvHD, recent-PR (state 4) are caused by the jumps in the cumulative hazards of the P &#x2192; P30 and AP &#x2192; AP30 transitions. Although we attempted to stay close to the model of Sect. 3, there are two striking differences: in Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> only recent-PR matters, merging patients with no PR and patients with past-PR. Such a merging is not possible in our implementation of the multi-state modeling. The caveats given in Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> for the interpretation of such curves apply here as well. Another striking difference between Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> is the reversed age effect in the group of patients with No AGvHD and recent or past-PR.</p>
      <p>It might be a bit surprising that some curves for no PR are non-monotone. For instance, the second plot of Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows <italic>P</italic>(failure free at <italic>t</italic>| state AGvHD at <italic>s</italic>) for fixed <italic>t</italic> and varying <italic>s</italic>. A plot of <italic>P</italic>(failure free at <italic>t</italic>| state AGvHD at <italic>s</italic>) for fixed <italic>s</italic> and varying <italic>t</italic> is indeed monotone since Failure is an absorbing state in the multi-state model, but there is no reason why this should be the case for fixed <italic>t</italic> and varying <italic>s</italic>. The fact that the curves are non-monotone in this instance is a consequence of the dynamic nature of PR status. The curve can be interpreted as: the longer you have waited for PR, the more likely that it will never happen and the worse the prognosis. Actually, the non-monotone behavior in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> might be an indication that the multi-state modeling stays closer to the clinical data.</p>

      <title>5 Discussion</title>
      <p>We have chosen to build a landmark prediction model that is valid for the whole first year of follow-up. On retrospect, this is open for debate because the intermediate events mostly occur in the first half year. Although we did not find a statistically signifcant interaction between the (dynamic) predictors and the time-point of landmarking, the picture might slightly change if we restrict the landmarking to the first half year. However, we think that our choice for the first year gives a good insight in the potential of the landmarking methodology and its pros and cons when compared with multi-state modeling.</p>
      <p>The big advantage of using a Markov multi-state model is the availability of the formula of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">Aalen and Johansen (1978)</xref> that converts the transition hazards into transition or state probabilities through repeated multiplication of matrices containing the transition hazard increments. The multiplication is over the event time points; when these multiplications are performed in increasing order of event time points this yields predictions forward in time. In order to obtain our 5-years predicted probabilities of failure, we have instead performed these matrix multiplications backward in time. This makes the prediction of 5-years failure free survival from different points in time quite straightforward once the required transition hazards are obtained. But in the presence of covariates Aalen-Johansen's formula is only valid for Markov models (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">Datta and Satten (2001)</xref> however, who show that the Markov property is not needed in the absence of covariates). The wish to stay within the framework of Markov models is in fact not very well compatible with the nature of the intermediate events found in Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. In particular the distinction between recent and past-PR has forced us to make some arguably unnatural steps. It has led us to introduce two extra states in the multi-state model with some restrictions on the transition intensities. In order to compensate for the large number of additional parameters, we have modeled the transitions P &#x2192; P30, AP &#x2192; AP30, and P &#x2192; AP and P30 &#x2192; AP30, with additional restrictions on equality of the baseline transition intensities and covariate effects. These restrictions appeared to make sense a priori (certainly in clock reset time-scale, perhaps less so in clock forward time-scale) and limited checks have not shown violations of the underlying assumptions. Of course it would have been most natural to use the time-scale of time since entrance in state P (recent-PR) for the transition to P30 (past-PR), and for the similar transitions after AGvHD (the transition AP &#x2192; AP30), but this destroys the Markov property. Models that use time since entrance of the present state as time-scale are called clock reset or semi-Markov or Markov renewal models (under additional Markov-like assumptions). Prediction in this type of multi-state models is far more difficult to do exactly. Instead simulation could be used to approximate the required transition probabilities.</p>
      <p>The multi-state model could be characterized as an indirect way of obtaining a prediction through a complete model for the follow-up of a patient. Such a modeling can be quite useful for a biological understanding of the underlying process, but the predictions derived from these models can be off the mark if the assumptions underlying the model are violated or the fit of the model is not perfect. Actually, the validity of the predictions can be checked in the same data set, but that is hardly ever done in practice. In principle, such a goodness-of-fit check could be combined with the landmark analysis by comparing the observed survival in each landmark data set with the predictions derived from the multi-state, but in practice it would take quite some energy to carry out such an analysis.</p>
      <p>The landmark approach can be seen as a way of direct modeling. One useful approach is the pseudo-value approach developed by Klein and Andersen (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">Andersen et al. (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">Andersen and Klein (2007)</xref>) which is inspired by the wish to have simple regression models for multi-state transition probabilities <italic>P</italic>(in state <italic>S</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>| covariate <italic>X</italic>). An alternative is the direct modeling of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">Scheike and Zhang (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">Scheike et al. (2008)</xref> which directly estimates similar probabilities from the data using logistic regression type models and an ingenious way of handling the censoring during the follow-up. The typical graphical presentation of the results of such an analysis shows how <italic>P</italic>(in state <italic>S</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>| covariate <italic>X</italic>) changes over time.</p>
      <p>The main difference with our landmark approach is that we are interested in the dynamic prediction <italic>P</italic>(in state <italic>S</italic> at time <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub> | covariate <italic>X</italic>, history at time <italic>s</italic>). A generalization that includes both perspectives is to let both <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub> and the landmark time-point <italic>s</italic> vary.</p>
      <p>A technical difference is that we derive the prediction by fitting a simple Cox model on the interval (<italic>s</italic>, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>) to obtain an estimate of the survival up to <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>. This circumvents the censoring problem that inspired the pseudo-values of Andersen and Klein, but could be biased if there is much censoring between <italic>s</italic> and <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>.</p>
      <p>The main limitation of the approach is that it can only handle survival type data, that is data with a single absorbing state. A next step would be to develop a similar approach for competing risk data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">Klein and Andersen (2005)</xref> apply the pseudo-value approach to competing risk data to obtain simple estimates of the cumulative incidence functions, comparable to the estimates coming from the models of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">Fine and Gray (1989)</xref> based on the modeling the sub-distribution hazard. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">Scheike et al. (2008)</xref> give methodology for directly estimating the cumulative incidence functions by binomial models. However it is not quite clear how to define and estimate <italic>dynamic</italic> cumulative incidence functions. Of course it is always possible to define landmark sets and to estimate landmark specific cumulative incidence functions, but it is not yet clear how different landmark models could be combined into one (pseudo) model as used in this paper.</p>
      <p>The big advantage of the landmark approach is that it can easily incorporate any type of information about the patients history. Multi-state models as used in Sect. <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref> can only be used to obtain predictions given the current state in the model. In the ALL example, it could not pool patients with no-PR with patients with past-PR while this was easily done in the landmark model, which can handle any type of time-dependent covariate without modeling the dynamics of the process itself.</p>
      <p>Another advantage of the landmark approach is the sparseness of the model. It only has to estimate a few parameters and a single baseline hazard, while the multi-state model has much more parameters, which could lead to serious over-fitting. The implication is that it has a similar simplicity as the direct models of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">Klein and Andersen (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">Scheike and Zhang (2007)</xref>.</p>
      <p>A final caveat is that one might be tempted to use prediction formula (<xref rid="Equ10" ref-type="">10</xref>) for all <italic>s</italic> &lt; t &#x2264; <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>. Such a prediction might be biased if in the landmark data set the effect of the last observed covariate <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) is time-varying, that is <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>(<italic>t</italic>|<italic>s</italic>) &#x2260; <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) for some <italic>s</italic> &lt; <italic>t</italic> &#x2264; <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>. It would be better to create a new data set with a different horizon. Ultimately, this would lead to data-sets truncated at <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub> = <italic>s</italic> and administratively censored at <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub> that are used to &#x201C;predict from <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub> = <italic>s</italic> to <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>&#x201D;. For each prediction problem we can fit simple PH models with coefficients <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>) and baseline hazard <italic>h</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>|<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>). The challenge would be to develop methodology that allows a smooth dependence of both the coefficients <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>) and the baseline hazard <italic>h</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>|<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>) on the pair (<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>LM</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>hor</italic></sub>).</p>
      <p>The caveat above is especially relevant in case of time-dependent covariates. Since the landmark approach as applied here can only use the current value of the time-dependent covariate <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) it can be expected that its effect will decrease over time. Potential biases in the predictive probabilities can be avoided by using joint models for the time-dependent covariate and the survival hazard. However, any lack of fit of such models could lead to similar biases.</p>
