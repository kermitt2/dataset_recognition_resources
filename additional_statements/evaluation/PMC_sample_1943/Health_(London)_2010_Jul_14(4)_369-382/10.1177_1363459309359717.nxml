        <p>Historically, cultural accounts and descriptions of blood banking in Britain have
                    been associated with notions of altruism, national solidarity and imagined
                    community. While these ideals have continued to be influential, the business of
                    procuring and supplying blood has become increasingly complex. Drawing on
                    interview data with donors in one blood centre in England, this article reports
                    that these donors tend not to acknowledge the complex dynamics of production and
                    exchange in modern blood systems. This, it is argued, is congruent with
                    nostalgic narratives in both popular and official accounts of blood services,
                    which tend to bracket these important changes. A shift to a more open
                    institutional narrative about modern blood services is advocated, as blood
                    services face current and future challenges.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Blood donation has long been viewed as a dramatic symbol of interdependence. In
                Europe, the emergence of formal blood banking systems in the post-war era was
                inextricably associated with notions of altruism and solidarity. The association of
                blood banks with altruism, solidarity and imagined national communities continued
                well beyond the post-war years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459309359717">Rabinow, 1999</xref>). When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459309359717">Richard Titmuss (1997</xref>: 311) wrote his famous analysis of blood donation
                as a &#x2018;gift relationship&#x2019;, based in part on empirical research
                undertaken in Britain in the late 1960s, he could still write in universalist terms
                that blood services represented &#x2018;one practical and concrete demonstration
                of fellowship relationships institutionally based in Britain in the National Health
                Service and the National Blood Transfusion Service&#x2019;. He wrote at a time
                when donated blood was predominantly used whole; the National Blood Service (NHS)
                was held to be a practical symbol of mutual interests between citizens in Britain,
                and trust in the capacity of NHS authorities to supply safe blood was not publicly
                questioned.</p>
      <p>Blood banking was set to change. By the mid-1970s, blood could be stored and
                transported more easily, facilitating the beginning of a more flexible system for
                supplying blood. The development of fractionation techniques allowed for blood to be
                broken down into components and reconfigured, leading to the great majority of
                donated blood being used in the manufacture of blood products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459309359717">Farrugia, 2006</xref>). Blood was to become the
                raw material for an emerging industry that was to expand into markets throughout the
                world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459309359717">Starr, 1998</xref>). The
                flexibility allowed for by these developments had been a goal of pioneer blood
                bankers, to allow for provisioning in mass emergencies. As the blood products
                industry developed further, blood plasma in particular became a commodity that could
                be imported and exported more easily, and the supply chain became more complex to
                manage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459309359717">Starr, 1998</xref>). We
                can see in retrospect that, from the 1970s point onwards, the work of supplying
                blood products would be in some respects at odds with the traditional image of blood
                services, especially with the notion of national blood banking.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding these substantive changes, blood services received relatively little
                public and political scrutiny until the 1980s, when the HIV/AIDS crisis brought the
                problems, risks and hazards inherent in blood banking to wider attention. Some
                officials and organizations were prosecuted for their failure to act to protect the
                recipients of blood after the risks of HIV infection were known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459309359717">Casteret, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459309359717">Rabinow, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459309359717">Starr, 1998</xref>). Although
                others emerged relatively unscathed from the crisis, with it came the dawning
                recognition of the possibility of vested interests in the supply of blood products.</p>
      <p>More recent sociological writing about blood banks is anchored with an awareness of
                the unfolding consequences of the transmission of the HIV virus through blood, and
                of the risks associated with receiving blood products. This in turn opens up
                scrutiny of the impact of ongoing processes of modernization, globalization and
                commercialization in blood systems. Even where blood services are organized by
                national state authorities, the impact that global commerce, disease and travel are
                such that they can no longer be regarded as having national boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459309359717">O'Neill, 2003</xref>).
                These changes may be theorized in terms of the threat they pose to the association
                of blood banking with ideals of solidarity and altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459309359717">Waldby and Mitchell, 2006</xref>). The discussion
                of the apparent erosion of mutuality in this context can be linked to a broader
                consideration of the extent to which social life is becoming
                &#x2018;de-mutualized&#x2019;, and the ways in which there is resistance to
                that process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459309359717">Williams,
                2002</xref>). However, the question of blood safety has long been on the agenda for
                blood bankers, who from the outset had to countenance and manage the risks of
                recipients contracting infections from blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459309359717">Berridge, 1997</xref>).</p>
      <p>While the blood service in the UK is in the process of modernizing to
                &#x2018;create a service fit for the 21st century&#x2019;, this process is
                focused on organizational and technical innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459309359717">NHS Blood and Transplant, 2007</xref>: 8). Blood
                donors are widely described as &#x2018;altruistic&#x2019;, yet little
                research has been undertaken to explore the broader social meanings of donation
                today. This article focuses on blood donors&#x2019; narrative accounts, and
                explores their potential significance for contemporary blood services.</p>

      <title>Cultural accounts of donation: sociological perspectives</title>
      <p>Recent sociological work about blood donation offers some theoretical and
                methodological approaches around which the discussion of the data presented in this
                article can be organized. I begin with Healy's work on cultural accounts
                of &#x2018;procurement&#x2019; of blood and organs. Healy approaches the
                question of blood donation by exploring how the meaning of blood is shaped by
                organizations and the regimes surrounding them. Drawing on large scale quantitative
                data, he began by exploring how donation patterns in state run, red-cross and blood
                banking regimes in Europe differ significantly from one another, developing an
                &#x2018;institutional perspective on altruism&#x2019;, by showing how these
                &#x2018;collection regimes produce their donor populations by providing
                different opportunities for donations&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459309359717">Healy, 2000</xref>: 1633). More recently, looking
                at organizations responsible for &#x2018;procuring&#x2019; organs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459309359717">Healy (2006)</xref> shows how the
                production of a &#x2018;cultural account&#x2019; of donation is an important
                facet of their work. I take from this approach a reminder that cultural accounts of
                blood donation mediate the meanings of such projects; these meanings have practical
                consequences for the procurement and supply of such tissues.</p>
      <p>While civic virtue is often stressed in the public and political accounts of blood
                donation, we can consider this practice as simultaneously a
                &#x2018;private&#x2019; and a &#x2018;public&#x2019; act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459309359717">Valentine, 2005</xref>). Bearing
                in mind the recent history of gay men's exclusion from donating blood,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459309359717">Valentine's
                (2005</xref>: 115) analysis centred on a critique of the construction of blood
                donation as a &#x2018;participatory space of belonging&#x2019;. One element
                of her critique is the consideration of the impact of practices of
                exclusion/inclusion for eligibility as donors. Such practices are central to the
                operation of blood services, and have become progressively so since 1983. Valentine
                makes the point that private experiences and accounts of donating blood &#x2013;
                or not donating &#x2013; may differ from public and more expressly ideological
                narratives.</p>
      <p>Eliciting &#x2018;private&#x2019; accounts about blood donation has its
                methodological difficulties, however. This is partly by virtue of the status of
                venepuncture as a ubiquitous technology in hospitals. In addition, many of the uses
                of blood for diagnosis, research and treatment, are long established and may be seen
                as unproblematic by patients and staff alike. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459309359717">Pfeffer and Laws (2006)</xref> show how people in
                a London teaching hospital tended to &#x2018;turn away from&#x2019; the
                mundane technology of venepuncture, and to take it for granted. The respondents in
                Pfeffer and Laws&#x2019; study &#x2013; who included patients and staff
                &#x2013; often saw submission to venepuncture within hospital as appropriate, or
                expected; this acceptance of the taking and circulating of blood can be seen in
                terms of a &#x2018;law of the place&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459309359717">de Certeau, 1988</xref>: 118, cited in Pfeffer and
                Laws). Their analysis also suggests that patients in their London hospital site had
                expectations surrounding the use of blood: they expected that the blood would remain
                within the hospital, that blood test results would be fed back to patients, and that
                the blood would not be used by commercial bodies. These expectations were
                sufficiently strong and consistent that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459309359717">Pfeffer and Laws (2006</xref>: 3022) describe them
                as an &#x2018;implicit contract&#x2019;. This and other recent work
                underlines the significance of attending to the nuances and complexities of
                donors&#x2019; accounts.</p>

        <title>Background to the larger study</title>
        <p>This article focuses on an analysis of interviews with blood donors to one of the
                    UK's four blood services, the National Blood Service in England and
                    North Wales (NBS), whose primary remit is to supply blood components and other
                    tissue products for use in medical care in the NHS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363459309359717"><sup>1</sup></xref> The aim of these interviews was to revisit and explore some of the
                    frameworks and assumptions of blood donors, given the very limited sociological
                    literature on these. One driver for doing this was that
                    &#x2018;Titmussian&#x2019; ideas about blood donation were being invoked
                    in policy discussions about the development of a new national biobank in the UK
                        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459309359717">Tutton, 2004</xref>).
                    Although the NBS has a remit to conduct research and development on current and
                    novel applications of blood, I did not intend to focus specifically on this
                        here.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363459309359717"><sup>2</sup></xref> Rather, these interviews sought to explore the understandings and
                    expectations of contemporary blood donors, in as open ended a way as possible. A

        <title>Fieldwork and interviews at the blood centre</title>
        <p>The fieldwork for this project included participant observation and discussions
                    with donors and staff of the NBS at the same blood centre, and at several other
                    locations in same UK city. Over the course of four months, many discussions, and
                    conversations took place, and interviews were conducted with NBS donors at one
                    city centre blood centre. In addition, observation, discussion with centre staff
                    and analysis of NBS publications was undertaken. This article draws on data from
                    26 interviews with donors, who numbered approximately equal numbers of men and
                    women, ranging in age from their late teens to late 60s, with most being in
                    their 30s, 40s and 50s. (The identity numbers given refer to the sequence of all

                    with whom longer interviews were held.) Before the fieldwork began, the proposed
                    arrangements for interviews were reviewed by an NHS Research Ethics Committee,
                    which agreed that it may go ahead.</p>
        <p>The aim of this approach being to develop a narrative account of the
                    interviewees&#x2019; experience as donors, and their view on this
                    involvement, these interviews were &#x2018;semi-structured&#x2019;.
                    Interviews often began with a question about when a donor had first donated
                    blood &#x2013; &#x2018;Can you tell me how you first became a blood
                    donor?&#x2019; Instead of the fixed questions which were often expected, a
                    topic guide was used to guide the interviews, covering the following themes:
                    what is done with the blood; views on payment for blood donation; information;
                    concerns or worries about giving blood especially at the outset. Donors were
                    also asked about their views on research, beginning with a question about
                    whether they would see giving blood for research differently from giving blood
                    to help people directly. These issues were not pursued with detailed
                    questioning, if interviewees did not seem comfortable with discussing them.
                    There were two grounds for this reticence on my part, one methodological, the
                    other ethical. The primary aim was to gain an overall narrative account of the
                    donor's perspectives. Too many questions, or questions that were too
                    specific being repeated, seemed to impede the narrative flow of the account. I
                    was constrained too by a concern not to intervene in people's
                    understandings of blood systems. I knew little about the research uses of blood.
                    I was not able to answer questions that people might (and did) put to me in
                    response to my own questions. Given that both I and the NBS considered their
                    blood donations to be important, I did not wish to dwell on research uses, if
                    the donor wished to avoid talking about this. At the end of the interview,
                    people who had been donating blood over some years were invited to talk about
                    how the experience had changed over time.</p>

      <title>Analysis</title>
      <p>The approach to analysis can be described in three stages.</p>
      <p>Grounded theory techniques were used to explore donors&#x2019; accounts in the
                discussions and interviews conducted in the course of the early weeks of the
                fieldwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459309359717">Strauss and Corbin,
                    1990</xref>). Several key phrases emerged from these analyses of preliminary
                discussions with donors: for example, &#x2018;blood bank&#x2019;,
                &#x2018;limits of expertise&#x2019;. These sensitizing themes influenced how
                the work was taken forwards in a number of ways. The first of these themes refers to
                an image of traditional blood banks that anchored accounts of donating blood for the
                NBS, and is explored further in this article. This image of blood banks is
                predicated on a model in which such facilities were organized on a local, regional
                or national basis. It is the idea of &#x2018;self-sufficiency&#x2019; in
                blood supplies within a community, rather than the exact boundaries of the blood
                bank, that is important here.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363459309359717"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
      <p>The second theme refers to donors&#x2019; responses to my many questions about
                blood, and how it is used: interviewees often drew my attention to what they felt
                were the limits of their expertise. A common response to my questions was to
                indicate that donors could not be expected to know about or understand research: in
                asking them I was &#x2018;going beyond&#x2019; their expertise. In the early
                interviews my questions about what kind of information people looked at, and what
                they thought about the uses which were made of blood frequently elicited fairly
                brisk, even dismissive replies: &#x2018;I give my blood and now it's
                gone and I have no views&#x2019; said one man (NBS 17). Another captured the
                spirit of these discussions when she said that she had &#x2018;no
                idea&#x2019; what the blood would be used for (NBS 25). Many commented that they
                trusted the blood service and the relevant authorities to make the best use of their
                blood, and did not feel the detail to be their concern. These recurring comments,
                often couched in terms of &#x2018;trust&#x2019; challenged my assumption
                that I could analyse people's decisions in relation to the information
                they had access to about blood services seemed to have been misplaced. The
                importance of information as a keystone for the consent process for tissue donors
                has been prominent in UK government policy in recent years. Yet it emerged that in
                this particular case, of blood donation, donors did not see information as the basis
                of their consent for their blood to be used. Most donors stressed that the
                    <italic>details</italic> of what happens to blood after it is donated are not of
                pressing concern. One long-term blood donor explained his difficulty with my
                questions to me in this way: &#x2018;The problem is once I've given
                it what they the NBS do is it's up to them. I mean once I walk through
                the door I forget about the NBS&#x2019; (NBS 100). This constitutes a
                methodological problem for the researcher who would like to understand the
                donors&#x2019; point of view about the uses of blood through an interview. As
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459309359717">Hoeyer (2003)</xref> has
                observed of the process of researching with donors, there is a sense in which an
                interviewer constructs a request to the donor to discuss something which is a
                physical <italic>practice</italic> often performed by turning away.</p>
      <p>The second stage of analysis involved the use of a data matrix, to summarize the
                donors&#x2019; circumstances and the context of their interview account
                &#x2013; for example, the length of time they had been a donor, and the
                particular issues which they had raised.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363459309359717"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
      <p>Added to the biographical and contextual summaries for individuals interviewed, notes
                on specific points in the transcribed data were coded and briefly noted. A summary
                note of their views on the uses of blood was made in each case. This matrix was also
                used to include other discussions held in the course of observation at the blood
                centre. Having been coded and written manually, these data were stored on a spread
                sheet, which enabled them to be indexed for subsequent recall and analysis. Each
                interviewee, along with other donors with whom I had brief discussions, was given a
                unique number, which is the number referred to in this text. Where the interviews
                are cited in this article, &#x2018;I&#x2019; stands for the interviewer
                (myself), and R stands for the respondent.</p>
      <p>Once these donors&#x2019; accounts were thus summarized, the final stage of the
                analysis involved relating the particularity of these findings back to wider themes
                in the literature. These wider themes from the literature, elaborated in the section
                on the sociological literature above, include the significance of mutuality in
                tension with the demutualization thesis in this context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459309359717">Healy's (2006)</xref> argument that
                organizations procuring human tissues necessarily organize &#x2018;cultural
                accounts&#x2019; of donation that support their work, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459309359717">Pfeffer and Laws&#x2019; (2006)</xref>
                emphasis on the implicit nature of the agreements that exist between patients
                undergoing venepuncture and hospitals, are used to draw out the significance of
                these donors&#x2019; accounts.</p>

    <sec id="section5-1363459309359717">
      <title>Becoming a blood donor</title>
      <p>Most donors attributed their initial involvement in blood donation to having the
                    <italic>opportunity</italic> to give blood at a local venue, rather than to a
                more active moral rationale in the first instance. Next, they talked about the
                influence of other individual donors who they knew, and sometimes expressed a sense
                of obligation in this context. For example, some of the interviewees talked in terms
                of &#x2018;replacing&#x2019; someone who had been a longstanding blood
                donor, but had become unable to continue due to ill-health, or someone who had died.
                When asked more about their continuing to donate blood, donors&#x2019; responses
                became in a sense more their own stories, with a range of reasons for doing so being
                expressed. For some this sense of responsibility began with awareness of someone in
                their own family who had been ill, so that the blood donation was imagined as being
                &#x2018;to help somebody like my mum&#x2019;. But it had then extended to
                &#x2018;future patients&#x2019;. Reasons for donating blood are intertwined
                and not easily separated.</p>
      <p>The satisfaction which could be gained from giving blood was often mentioned: one
                woman, who first gave blood because her teacher at college suggested that she and
                other students do so, pointed out that &#x2018;there's not much else
                you can do that gives you that kind of buzz&#x2019;. Another talked about blood
                donation as a sociable experience which she looked forward to (NBS 41). She said
                that she enjoyed &#x2018;being part of something&#x2019; as she lay down
                quietly on her own but with others similarly engaged nearby. Although it might be
                sociable, enjoyable, an important element of the experience for some was that it
                offered a refuge from commercialization: part of what makes it special, she
                continued, is &#x2018;the idea that nobody can make any money out of
                &#x2026; it just makes you feel good&#x2019; (NBS 41).</p>
      <p>Being <italic>able</italic> to help was a source of satisfaction for many, when
                contrasted with other situations where they might feel less able to help. Others
                couched their involvement in blood donation more in terms of duty or obligation.
                Blood donation (of course) is something which is done with others in mind. However
                it was not seen as a sacrifice: many pointed out that giving blood did not cost them
                much. For some, the relationship to others was invoked through a dramatic, usually
                traumatic reason for giving blood: a family member being ill in hospital, a friend
                being diagnosed with cancer. For many though the awareness of blood being needed was
                expressed in terms of a growing awareness of the vulnerability of others when they
                encounter accidents, serious illness, unexpected operations &#x2013; and an
                awareness that these unexpected disasters could happen to themselves and to those
                close to them. Thus the interdependence symbolized by the possibility of needing
                donated blood at a time of catastrophic illness or accident featured in virtually
                all of these accounts.</p>
      <p>Among this group, the most common occasion for coming in to make a first blood
                donation was related to people's work, in that they had either attended a
                session with a work group or colleague or at NBS mobile sessions at their place of
                work. The days of mobile visits to large industrial workplaces were fondly
                remembered by some of the older donors, mainly men now in their 60s. Among those
                interviewed were men who had worked in the docks, in large factories, in big Royal
                Mail sorting offices in the city centre or for other companies since disappeared or
                privatized, like BT. One of these explained his experience of being of a blood donor
                over the years as follows:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>A sense of wanting to, a sense of being part of this system which keeps the blood
                    available because it might be me one day who needs it or someone in my family
                    and if it isn't there then that's going to be a problem.
                    So it's just something I think we should all do really. (NBS 10)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>For these donors, there was a sense that the blood centre had become a participatory
                space and one that was no longer available through their work associations.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section6-1363459309359717">
      <title>Blood banking and mutuality &#x2013; limits and expectations</title>
      <p>Many donors (approximately half) specifically used the phrase &#x2018;blood
                bank&#x2019; in the course of these interviews, and others referred indirectly
                to this idea:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>It's really a case of why not &#x2026; I know people who have done
                    it and I have a friend who has leukaemia, or who had leukaemia shall we say and
                    you know you hear about other people who are blood donors because their lives
                    have been saved as a result of being recipients of blood &#x2026; All right
                    I may be doing it the other way round, I hope that I never have to be the
                    recipient but I'm willing to give because if I don't need
                    it others will. (NBS 83)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Here the arrangement of donating blood is envisaged as being equally of use to
                oneself and to others. It is envisaged as an arrangement in which the risk that we
                may need blood is shared with others who may likewise become vulnerable. The
                mutuality of such an arrangement is enhanced by the thought that the health
                screening for blood donation can function as a health check. Often donors said it
                was recognizing the possibility that they might need blood themselves which enabled
                them to accept repeated, detailed and to my mind intrusive screening questions
                before they gave blood. Donors often pointed out that the fact of their being asked
                these detailed questions would be a source of reassurance that the blood was as safe
                as possible if they themselves needed blood in the future. Notwithstanding their
                knowledge of the part played by the blood service in passing on infected blood to
                some recipients before HIV tests were implemented for blood donors, these donors
                entrusted their blood to the blood service. The possibility of
                <italic>anyone</italic> needing a blood transfusion unexpectedly was often present
                in these accounts, and therefore donors also saw themselves or those close to them
                as candidate recipients. Among these donors then, we can say that the notion of
                blood banking as a mutual arrangement, as part of a strategy of pooling resources
                for responding to the risk of catastrophic illness or accident, were prominent. A
                narrative about mutual interests was still possible for these donors. This is so
                despite the risks that have come to be associated with receiving blood, and which
                risks are <italic>emphasized</italic> to donors in the course of lengthy donor
                screening procedures.</p>
      <p>The donors&#x2019; accounts reflected the idealistic ethos that blood should be
                universally available. However, while performing their role as donors in this
                context, some contradictions do occur: first, while no-one seriously suggested that
                certain categories of people should not receive blood, ambivalence about those who
                do not give was sometimes expressed. Comments about those who should not receive
                blood were always expressed laughingly, jokingly: &#x2018;I hope that people who
                won't give blood don't get it (laughs). It sounds awful that
                but I think God you know I give blood, and if I want it it's
                there&#x2019; (NBS 8). Within this system, it was felt that you could not
                reasonably specify exactly who should have the blood, despite the fact that there
                might be some people who you wished could not have it. Likewise, most felt that you
                could not specify what the donated blood could be used for. This was not a case of
                having no views on priorities for medical treatment and research. It was rather that
                the nature of the transaction was one of entrusting the blood to the bank to make
                the best use of.</p>
      <p>Blood services were understood to be part of the NHS &#x2013; as indeed they are
                at a statutory level. Donors felt that their voluntary donation was an intrinsic
                part of that system. Sometimes exceptions to the ideal of entitlement were mentioned
                in this context. There was for example the issue of patients in private hospitals:
                for some this posed a challenge to the ethos of the universal system, and it was
                felt that perhaps they should pay for the blood. Similarly, it was often said that
                blood should be used in this country. However, the case for these candidates
                (private patients, foreigners) to be excluded from receiving blood tended to
                evaporate if it was thought that surplus blood might go unused.</p>
      <p>The extent to which the blood service is embedded in the NHS was emphasized in many
                of the donors&#x2019; accounts. Often this point was made in talking about
                instances in which blood might be required for accidents or serious conditions. It
                was expected that emergencies were dealt with by the NHS. &#x2018;Operations,
                transfusions, babies<sup>&#x2019;</sup> were the examples usually given of
                points of crisis when blood might be needed. None of the examples given by any of
                the interviewed donors made reference to people being treated in the private sector.
                As with Pfeffer and Laws&#x2019; account of patients&#x2019; understandings
                of the circulation of blood in an NHS hospital, this was an implicit understanding,
                that only became clear when exceptions or &#x2018;scandals&#x2019; were
                mentioned.</p>
      <p>Comparisons were made with other countries in which emergency treatments were paid
                for by the patient, whereas here:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>at least one thing at least if you're seriously ill you get to, you
                    don't have to worry about the bill at the end because you know
                    it's there. I mean if you're really seriously ill, a road
                    accident, you're seen to straight away and when you work it out
                    there's blood there. (NBS 100)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>In the more discursive accounts the importance of the relationship with the NHS was
                made explicit, as was the ethos underlying voluntary blood donation. So here in my
                discussion with a female donor in her 30s:</p>

      <p>It was, one respondent replied, a problem of where to draw the line &#x2013; the
                consequences of paying for blood at point of donation would cascade through the
                system altering it substantially:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>People would say oh we've got to pay for this blood, why not pay for
                    organs. And basically you're coming into a private health system or
                    paid for private health system rather than a national health system and
                    unfortunately, I'm being, by social inclination I'd prefer
                    to have a national health service and a national blood transfusion service
                    that's funded by the people without paying. (NBS 57)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Occasionally a scandal was referred to in which blood or organs had been traded in
                this country or abroad. Moral disapproval about these breaches of expectation was
                clear cut in these cases. But the extent to which blood is moved around different
                sites, fractionated, reconstituted as blood products, traded in an internal NHS
                market or imported from outside the national blood service, was barely present in
                these accounts. The importing of plasma products sourced from other countries,
                notably from the USA, was not discussed. These donors primarily characterized the
                use of blood as &#x2018;for emergencies&#x2019;. This is in contrast to the
                reported use of blood by the blood service in England and Wales, according to whom
                approximately 8 per cent of blood is used in emergencies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363459309359717"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
      <p>As we have seen, Healy proposes that organizations responsible for procuring human
                tissues for medical applications necessarily have to mobilize and present a
                narrative that promotes these activities as desirable. In this case, the accounts of
                blood donation produced by the NHS, with politicians and publics, tend to avoid
                acknowledging the complexities of producing and exchanging blood products. This
                information is not secret; it is included in corporate communications &#x2013;
                publicly accessible to someone searching for it online for instance, but nor is it
                given any space in communication targeted at publics, patients or donors. This facet
                of the NBS's work rarely appears in the now many and varied corporate
                communications to donors. Another example of this absence of acknowledgement is to
                be found in the graphs depicting national blood stocks, of fresh donated blood in
                England, on a weekly basis on its website.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363459309359717"><sup>6</sup></xref> The website does not offer analogous graphics on the import and export of
                plasma and blood products that are likewise central to the business of a modern
                blood service.</p>
      <p>When these donors entrusted the NBS with their blood, they did not expect to be
                involved in making decisions or drawing boundaries about the use of the blood: it
                was for the organization to make appropriate decisions about its uses. However, they
                sometimes made it clear that they did not expect it to be used in other contexts.</p>

      <title>&#x2018;Having faith&#x2019; and &#x2018;entrusting&#x2019; blood
                (and forgetting about it)</title>
      <p>Donors&#x2019; understanding of the place of the blood service in the NHS was
                sustaining their commitment in several ways: through it they could imagine
                others&#x2019; need for blood, they could trust the organization to which it was
                given, and they expected, or at least hoped, that the blood would be used within
                this health system. In addition, several people mentioned the role that expert
                scientific and experts committees would play here. It was <italic>not</italic> that
                donors stated categorically that non-nationals should not receive their blood. Nor
                did they often feel sufficiently informed or expert to be certain of the moral
                boundaries around new developments that might involve the use of blood for research.
                However, where discussions arose about the use of blood by commercial companies
                &#x2013; for whatever purpose &#x2013; this kind of use was not seen to be
                within the terms of a national health service. Importantly then, the association of
                the blood service with the NHS played an important part in defining and delimiting
                the imagined uses of blood.</p>
      <p>When asked about the uses to which the blood is put, donors were sometimes puzzled or
                alternatively embarrassed at their lack of detailed knowledge, as in the following
                example.</p>

                                Just for surgeons to carry out operations. I wouldn't

      <p>It seemed that there was a gap between donors&#x2019; formal consent, as
                indicated on their signed declaration, and the uses for the blood which were
                prominent in their explanations to me &#x2013; such as use in operations and
                other such emergencies. One woman explained the uses of blood as follows:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>No I'm very lazy, I mean I know it can be used obviously for donation,
                    for transfusions [yes] or I think they can split it all up and use the different
                    components [yes, yes] for different, either again transfusions or research or
                    whatever. I mean I have read at one time what they did, I mean I will admit, you
                    just sort of, I know it's used and I don't care what
                    it's used for. (NBS, 81)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>This sense of &#x2018;having faith in them&#x2019;, or placing implicit trust
                in the organization, was one of the most consistent findings from these interviews
                with NBS donors. I observed that the detailed and specific information that was
                provided in the blood centre was not accorded much attention by donors during the
                time they spent waiting, and it seemed to play a small part in their interview
                accounts. Before I began interviewing NBS donors I was aware that each time blood
                was given, the donor signed a written consent form. The consent form formally
                indicated their written agreement for their blood to be tested, and then used for
                suitable purposes by the NBS, with research approved by an ethics committee being
                one of the uses set out in the donor information. Yet, when donors spoke about how
                the blood was used, few spontaneously mentioned the possibility that it might be
                used for research.</p>
      <p>There are some resonances with Pfeffer and Laws&#x2019; study of venepuncture
                among hospital patients, in that for these donors, donated blood stored within the
                NBS blood centres, blood banks and NHS hospitals is also seen as &#x2018;matter
                in place&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459309359717">Pfeffer
                    and Laws, 2006</xref>: 3022). The implicit nature of this arrangement,
                underlined by the extent to which donors often disavowed knowledge of or
                responsibility for the uses of their blood makes it difficult to establish
                categorically what donors expect. A common response to questions about the use of
                blood for research was to indicate that donors could not be expected to know about
                or understand research, and to reaffirm principles that had already been stated:</p>

      <p>In this analysis, donors&#x2019; responses to interview questions are taken to
                illuminate some of the dynamics of involvement in blood donation. An important

        <p>Habit, reputation and memory &#x2026; all [are] means of preserving the past
                    experience in order to construct a more predictable, reliable and legible

      </disp-quote>
      <p>Trust is a valuable resource for blood services. However, the gap between the
                nostalgic accounts of blood banking, and the contemporary organization of blood
                services and industries is troubling, both in moral and in practical terms. As new
                challenges face those supplying blood sufficient in quantity and in quality, this
                disjuncture is likely to become more evident. The recent investigations of the
                Archer Inquiry into the impact of contaminated blood on people with haemophilia and
                others affected are testimony both to the complexity of blood services, and to the
                legacy of problems associated with a lack of openness about these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459309359717">Boseley, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Blood services have had major changes to confront, in the interests of risk
                management and patient safety. It is fair to say that questions of narratives or
                cultural accounts have, understandably, not been foremost in the minds of NBS
                leaders and of policy makers. However, a decrease in the number of blood donors is
                of concern. The policy response to this has been primarily orientated towards
                improving &#x2018;customer satisfaction&#x2019; with the convenience of
                donor centres and appointments, and towards advertising for new donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459309359717">NHS Blood and Transplant,
                2007</xref>). Some sociological reflections on the &#x2018;implicit
                contract&#x2019; between donors and the service may flesh out these dynamics
                further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459309359717">Pfeffer and Laws,
                2006</xref>: 3022).</p>
      <p>The business of procuring and supplying blood has become increasingly complex and is
                an international one. For example, the Department of Health has for some years had a
                policy of sourcing plasma from the USA, following recognition of the possible risk
                of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) infectivity posed by plasma from
                UK-based donors. A commercial division of NBS, the Bio Products Laboratory markets
                plasma products both to the NHS and to over 40 countries worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459309359717">Bio Products, 2009</xref>). Thus,
                donated blood can circulate widely, globally. Blood is managed and regulated as a
                commodity &#x2013; a process that arguably contributes to safety for recipients.
                Yet the extent of these transactions and circulations is often elided in NBS
                literature for donors. At a time when there is new emphasis on openness and
                transparency between the wider NHS and its publics, the mismatch of nostalgic
                narratives and modern practices seems problematic.</p>

                emergencies. Modern blood services in the UK on the other hand are characterized by
                the use of blood products, including products from plasma procured in an
                international market. The risks of receiving blood products are explicitly
                recognized and managed under modern formal safety regimes. These developments
                challenge the more literal images of reciprocity and solidarity that have
                historically been associated with collective narratives about blood banking.</p>
      <p>These donors&#x2019; accounts are resonant of an older paradigm of
                &#x2018;blood banking&#x2019;. They may also reflect the very limited public
                discussion about dilemmas in managing, balancing and communicating risk in
                &#x2018;blood systems&#x2019;. While we have seen extensive research and
                public consultation in the area of novel biological products, there has been little
                engagement with patients and publics in the more &#x2018;established&#x2019;
                field of blood products. A shift to a more open institutional narrative about modern
                blood services may be timely, as blood services face current and future
            challenges.</p>

        <p>Previously, blood services in England and Wales were organized on a regional
                    basis by NHS authorities. The transition to a national system began in 1993. In
                    2005, a new NHS umbrella body, NHS Blood and Transplant Authority, was given
                    managerial responsibility for the NBS.</p>

        <p>A second group of interviews was conducted with people who donated blood as a
                    sample for genetic analysis, to a university research project. These interviews,
                    which are reported elsewhere, addressed
                    donors&#x2019;/participants&#x2019; thinking about &#x2018;genetic

        <p>The ideal of self-sufficiency within national communities has been an important
                    theme in blood policies in Britain, as in the rest of Europe, albeit one that is
                    in tension with the reality of trade in blood products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459309359717">Farrell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459309359717">Hagen, 1993</xref>).
