      <abstract>
        <p>&#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>-Adrenergic receptors (&#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs) and E-type prostaglandin receptors (EPRs) both produce compartmentalized cAMP responses in cardiac myocytes. The role of cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts in producing these compartmentalized responses was investigated in adult rat ventricular myocytes. &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs were found in lipid raft and non-lipid raft containing membrane fractions, while EPRs were only found in non-lipid raft fractions. Furthermore, &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR activation enhanced the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, and myocyte shortening, while EPR activation had no effect, consistent with the idea that these functional responses are regulated by cAMP produced by receptors found in lipid raft domains. Using methyl-&#x3B2;-cyclodextrin to disrupt lipid rafts by depleting membrane cholesterol did not eliminate compartmentalized behavior, but it did selectively alter specific receptor-mediated responses. Cholesterol depletion enhanced the sensitivity of functional responses produced by &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs without having any effect on EPR activation. Changes in cAMP activity were also measured in intact cells using two different FRET-based biosensors: a type II PKA-based probe to monitor cAMP in subcellular compartments that include microdomains associated with caveolar lipid rafts and a freely diffusible Epac2-based probe to monitor total cytosolic cAMP. &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR and EPR activation elicited responses detected by both FRET probes. However, cholesterol depletion only affected &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR responses detected by the PKA probe. These results indicate that lipid rafts alone are not sufficient to explain the difference between &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR and EPR responses. They also suggest that &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR regulation of myocyte contraction involves the local production of cAMP by a subpopulation of receptors associated with caveolar lipid rafts.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The diffusible second messenger cAMP plays a central role in regulating many different aspects of cardiac function. This includes the changes in electrical and mechanical properties of the heart produced by &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor (&#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR) activation in response to sympathetic stimulation <xref rid="bb0005 bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. However, a number of different G-protein-coupled receptors are linked to the production of cAMP in cardiac myocytes, yet they do not all produce the same functional responses. The E-type prostaglandin receptors (EPRs) are a classic example. These receptors stimulate cAMP production in ventricular myocytes, but they do not elicit changes in electrical or mechanical activity <xref rid="bb0015 bb0020 bb0025 bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[3&#x2013;6]</xref>. This can be explained by the idea that activation of any given type of receptor does not necessarily produce a uniform increase in cAMP throughout the entire cell and that cAMP signaling can be compartmentalized <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite unequivocal evidence that compartmentation of cAMP signaling occurs, what is responsible for this behavior is not well understood. Differences in phosphodiesterase activity have been shown to be essential for explaining the disparity in cAMP levels that can exist between different subcellular compartments within the cell <xref rid="bb0040 bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>. However, phosphodiesterase activity alone cannot explain why different membrane receptors produce different patterns of cAMP production. Perhaps the simplest explanation for this observation assumes that different cytoplasmic compartments are associated with distinct plasma membrane domains containing unique receptor populations.</p>
      <p>The formation of cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts is hypothesized to be an important means of organizing the plasma membrane into discrete signaling domains <xref rid="bb0050 bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref>. This includes caveolae, which represent a subset of lipid rafts that are defined by the presence of the protein caveolin <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It is believed that some proteins can be concentrated in these cholesterol-rich regions of the plasma membrane through lipid&#x2013;protein or protein&#x2013;protein interactions <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This includes certain types of G-protein-coupled receptors <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis, disrupting lipid rafts and caveolae by depleting the membrane of cholesterol has been shown to alter signaling associated specifically with receptors believed to exist in those domains <xref rid="bb0075 bb0080 bb0085 bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[15&#x2013;18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In adult cardiac myocytes, &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs are found in caveolar and non-caveolar fractions of the plasma membrane <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. On the contrary, studies using other cell types suggest that at least some EPR subtypes are excluded from caveolar membrane fractions <xref rid="bb0100 bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[20,21]</xref>. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs stimulate cAMP production in a localized subcellular compartment that includes caveolae, as well as a bulk cytoplasmic compartment that is believed to exclude caveolae <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Yet, cAMP produced by EPRs could only be detected in the bulk cytoplasmic compartment <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These observations suggest that inclusion or exclusion of receptors from caveolar lipid raft domains may be important for determining the subcellular compartment in which they stimulate cAMP production. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect that cholesterol depletion has on cAMP-dependent responses as well as cAMP production associated with &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR and EPR stimulation in adult ventricular myocytes.</p>

The protocol used was in accordance with the <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> as adopted by National Institutes of Health and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Nevada, Reno. Myocytes used for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging experiments were resuspended and plated in minimum essential medium (MEM) containing insulin&#x2013;transferrin&#x2013;selenium (1&#xD7;), bovine serum albumin (1&#xA0;mg/ml), 2,3-butanedione monoxime (10&#xA0;mM), and penicillin&#x2013;streptomycin. After incubation for 2&#xA0;h, the cells were transduced with adenovirus constructs containing protein kinase A (PKA)- or Epac2-based cAMP biosensors, as described previously <xref rid="bb0020 bb0110 bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[4,22,24]</xref>.

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>It has previously been shown that the &#x3B2;AR agonist isoproterenol (Iso) and the EPR agonist prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) both stimulate cAMP production in adult cardiac myocytes, but only Iso enhances the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub>) <xref rid="bb0020 bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>. The differences in the effects of these agonists on the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> are illustrated in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A and B. To determine whether or not this disparity in functional responses correlates with a difference in where the corresponding receptors are found in the plasma membrane, we conducted membrane fractionation experiments. Membranes prepared from isolated myocytes were subjected to ultracentrifugation using a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. Immunoblotting was then used to identify &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs, as well as EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP4 receptors, the EPR subtypes associated with cAMP production <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The results (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>D) indicate that the &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR can be detected in all fractions, including the caveolar fraction (5), which is identified by its enrichment in the caveolar protein, caveolin-3. The results also demonstrate that EP<sub>2</sub> and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors are expressed in these cells. However, unlike the &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR, the EP receptors are excluded from caveolar membrane fractions.</p>
      <p>In neonatal ventricular myocytes, cholesterol depletion has been shown to have no effect on the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> response to maximal &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, there are significant differences between neonatal and adult ventricular myocytes that can affect compartmentation of cAMP signaling <xref rid="bb0095 bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[19,30]</xref>. Therefore, we examined the effect of cholesterol depletion on the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> response to &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation in adult myocytes. To do this, we measured the effects produced by Iso at sub-maximally (1 nM) and maximally (30 nM) stimulating concentrations. In control cells, 1&#xA0;nM Iso increased the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> by 15&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;5.0% (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;13) over baseline. Subsequent exposure to 30&#xA0;nM Iso increased the current by 69&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;6.6% (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;13) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A and E).</p>
      <p>This experiment was then repeated in cells pretreated with 1&#xA0;mM methyl-&#x3B2;-cyclodextrin (M&#x3B2;CD) for 1&#xA0;h at 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C. This approach has been used previously to deplete membrane cholesterol and disrupt lipid rafts and caveolae in cardiac myocytes <xref rid="bb0115 bb0145 bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[23,29,31]</xref>. Consistent with this, M&#x3B2;CD treatment significantly reduced the membrane cholesterol content as detected by staining with the fluorescent polyene antibiotic filipin (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>F). Furthermore, when M&#x3B2;CD-treated cells were exposed to 1&#xA0;nM Iso, the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> increased to 49&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;8.3% (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;5) over baseline. This represents a 3.2-fold increase in the magnitude of the response to this sub-maximally stimulating concentration of Iso compared with that seen in control cells. Exposure to 30&#xA0;nM Iso increased the current by 79.2&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;7.2% (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;6) over baseline (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B and E), which was not significantly different from the response observed in control cells.</p>
      <p>Rat ventricular myocytes express both &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x3B2;<sub>2</sub>ARs, and both receptor subtypes have been reported to stimulate L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity in these cells <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. To verify that the consequence of M&#x3B2;CD treatment was due to an effect on &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR responses, we repeated the above experiments in the presence of 100&#xA0;nM CGP20712A (CGP), a selective &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR antagonist <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In cells pretreated with 100&#xA0;nM CGP, subsequent exposure to 1&#xA0;nM Iso produced no response (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;4) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;2</xref>E). CGP also blocked the effect of 1&#xA0;nM Iso in M&#x3B2;CD-treated cells (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;5) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C and E). As a positive control, subsequent exposure to the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX was used to elicit a maximal response. These results support the conclusion that cholesterol depletion enhances <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> sensitivity to &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are found in the caveolar membrane fraction of cardiac myocytes <xref rid="bb0145 bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[29,34]</xref>. To determine whether or not the effect of cholesterol depletion was specific for &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR regulation of the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub>, we also examined the effect of M&#x3B2;CD treatment on the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) transient and myocyte contraction (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>). In these experiments, myocytes were exposed to 1&#xA0;nM Iso in the presence of 100&#xA0;nM ICI 118,551 (ICI), a &#x3B2;<sub>2</sub>AR antagonist, to selectively activate &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. As expected, this protocol resulted in a significant increase in the magnitude of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient and myocyte shortening in untreated cells. Following exposure to Iso, the relative degree of cell shortening increased by 63&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;13% and the magnitude of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient increased by 18&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;4.1% (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;17). These effects were also accompanied by a significant increase in the rate with which both parameters returned to baseline.</p>
      <p>The half-time (<italic>t</italic><sub>0.5</sub>) for relaxation of cell shortening decreased by 17&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;3.8% and the <italic>t</italic><sub>0.5</sub> for decay of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient decreased by 18&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;2.6%. When these experiments were repeated in M&#x3B2;CD-treated myocytes, the response to 1&#xA0;nM Iso was significantly enhanced. The relative degree of cell shortening increased by 188&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;19.5% and the magnitude of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient increased by 35&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;4.3% (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;22). There were also significant changes in the rate that both parameters returned to baseline. The <italic>t</italic><sub>0.5</sub> for relaxation of cell shortening decreased by 35&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;4.3% and the <italic>t</italic><sub>0.5</sub> for decay of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient decreased by 30&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;1.7%.</p>
      <p>Next we examined the effect of M&#x3B2;CD treatment on responses to PGE1. If the effect of cholesterol depletion is a non-specific effect altering all receptor-mediated cAMP-dependent responses, then it is conceivable that this treatment might also alter the response to PGE1, revealing functional effects not observed in control cells. Such an effect might be expected if compartmentation of PGE1 responses is due to exclusion of EP receptors from lipid raft domains, given that membrane fractionation studies suggest that cholesterol depletion causes a redistribution of membrane proteins involved in cAMP signaling <xref rid="bb0090 bb0175 bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[18,35,36]</xref>. However, neither of these possibilities appeared to be true. Exposure to PGE1 did not alter the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> in either untreated (see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;1</xref>) or M&#x3B2;CD-treated cells (see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D and E). Consistent with this, PGE1 did not significantly affect the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient or myocyte shortening in either untreated or M&#x3B2;CD-treated cells (see <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;3</xref>). These results suggest that the effect of M&#x3B2;CD treatment and cholesterol depletion was not a non-specific effect, since it selectively altered responses produced by &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation.</p>
      <p>Evidence presented here and elsewhere indicates that in cardiac myocytes, &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs can be found in all membrane fractions, not just those associated with caveolin <xref rid="bb0095 bb0145 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[19,29,35]</xref>. This raises the question of whether or not the change in sensitivity to &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR signaling caused by cholesterol depletion is due to an effect on those receptors specifically associated with caveolar lipid raft domains. To address this question, we examined the effect of cholesterol depletion on &#x3B2;-adrenergic stimulation of cAMP production in intact myocytes using different FRET-based biosensors.</p>
      <p>In the first set of experiments, we used a PKA-based biosensor (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>) <xref rid="bb0020 bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[4,24]</xref>. This particular probe contains the type II regulatory (RII) subunit of PKA <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Because of this, it is targeted to specific subcellular locations through its interactions with A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) <xref rid="bb0020 bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[4,37]</xref>. This includes caveolar fractions of the plasma membrane <xref rid="bb0145 bb0170 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[29,34,35]</xref>. Therefore, it is expected to respond to changes in cAMP that occur in microdomains that include caveolar lipid raft domains <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Consistent with this idea, we have previously demonstrated that it detects cAMP responses that are distinctly different from those occurring in the total cytosolic cAMP compartment <xref rid="bb0020 bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[4,22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In control myocytes expressing the PKA-based biosensor, exposure to 0.3&#xA0;nM Iso produced a 2.7&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;0.7% change in the FRET response (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;7). Subsequent exposure to 30&#xA0;nM Iso increased the FRET response to 11.2&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;2.4% of control (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;7) (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A and C). When these experiments were repeated in M&#x3B2;CD-treated myocytes, 0.3&#xA0;nM Iso produced a 6.3&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;1.4% change in the FRET response (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;6), which increased to 10.8&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;2.0% (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;6) following subsequent exposure to 30&#xA0;nM Iso (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>B and C). These results indicate that cholesterol depletion caused a significant increase in the sensitivity of the response to sub-maximally, but not maximally stimulating concentrations of Iso. Furthermore, these effects were blocked in the presence of CGP, but not ICI (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>D), confirming that the increase in sensitivity of the PKA-based biosensor's response to Iso caused by cholesterol depletion was due to an effect on &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR signaling.</p>
      <p>It is unlikely that the effects of cholesterol depletion are due to disruption of AKAP binding causing the redistribution of type II PKA and the PKA-based biosensor. This is because disrupting AKAP targeting of type II PKA has been shown to diminish &#x3B2;-adrenergic regulation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, which is opposite to the enhanced response we observed following cholesterol depletion. Furthermore, the PKA-based biosensor is expressed in a striated pattern along T tubules in adult ventricular myocytes <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and we previously demonstrated that blocking PKA anchoring to AKAPs disrupts this pattern <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, when we examined the expression pattern in a similar manner following M&#x3B2;CD treatment, we found no change (see Supplementary Fig. S1).</p>
      <p>Because these experiments involved the use of cells maintained in culture for up to 72&#xA0;h, we also examined the effect that this had on their cholesterol content and found that there was a time dependent decrease. After 72&#xA0;h, the cholesterol content, as determined by filipin staining, was reduced by &gt;&#xA0;50% (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Nevertheless, the response observed in M&#x3B2;CD-treated cells was consistent with an effect due to depletion of the remaining cholesterol. This is supported by the fact that treatment with &#x3B1;-cyclodextrin, an analog of M&#x3B2;CD that does not bind cholesterol <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, had no effect on PKA probe response to &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation (see Supplementary Fig. S3).</p>
      <p>In the next set of experiments, we examined the effect of cholesterol depletion on cAMP responses detected using Epac2-camps (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;5</xref>), a biosensor created using one of the cAMP binding domains from the type 2 exchange protein activated by cAMP <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Because it lacks any of the anchoring sequences found in the full-length protein, it is expressed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm of the cell. As a result, it is able to respond to changes in total cellular cAMP <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that the responses detected by this Epac2-based biosensor are distinctly different from those detected by the PKA-based biosensor <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In control myocytes expressing the Epac2 probe, exposure to 1&#xA0;nM Iso produced a 4.1&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;0.8% change in the FRET response. This increased to 10.2&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;1.4 % upon exposure to 30&#xA0;nM Iso (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;6). When this experiment was repeated in M&#x3B2;CD-treated cells, there was no significant change in the response to either concentration of Iso. The FRET responses to 1&#xA0;nM and 30&#xA0;nM Iso were 4.8&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;0.7% and 9.7&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;0.9%, respectively (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;5). These results suggest that the Epac2 probe is more sensitive to cAMP produced by &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs found outside of lipid raft domains.</p>
      <p>In a final set of experiments, we examined the effect of PGE1 on cAMP responses detected by both FRET-based biosensors. We have previously demonstrated that PGE1 is able to elicit a transient increase in cAMP that is detected by the Epac2 probe, but not the PKA probe in adult guinea pig ventricular myocytes <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Consistent with this, we found that exposure to 10&#xA0;&#x3BC;M PGE1 produced a similar transient increase in cAMP that was detected by the Epac2 probe in adult rat ventricular myocytes (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;6</xref>A). This confirms that PGE1 is indeed capable of stimulating cAMP production in these cells. Exposure to PGE1 also produced a transient response that was detected by the Epac2 probe in M&#x3B2;CD-treated cells (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;6</xref>B). However, the magnitude of the response was not significantly different from what was observed in control cells (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;6</xref>C). Surprisingly, when these experiments were repeated in myocytes expressing the PKA probe, PGE1 treatment still elicited a transient change in FRET response (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;6</xref>D). However, the magnitude of the transient response was not significantly different between control and M&#x3B2;CD-treated myocytes (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;6</xref>E and F).</p>
      <p>The ability of PGE1 to stimulate cAMP production, even though it had no effect on functional responses, supports the idea that the cAMP produced by PGE1 is compartmentalized. However, because the cAMP responses were measured in cells maintained in culture, it is possible that changes in their composition or structure could have created this apparent discrepancy. To address this possibility, we looked at the effect of 10&#xA0;&#x3BC;M PGE1 on the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> current in cells kept in primary culture for 72&#xA0;h. Just as in freshly isolated cells, PGE1 had no effect on the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub>, despite the fact that subsequent exposure to 30&#xA0;nM Iso produced a normal response (see Supplementary Fig. S4). These results suggest that compartmentation of cAMP signaling is not altered by any changes that may have occurred with time in culture.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The observation that two agonists can differ in their capacity to elicit PKA-dependent responses, despite the fact that they both stimulate cAMP production, cannot be easily reconciled if it is assumed that the receptors involved are distributed uniformly throughout the plasma membrane. In the present study, we examined the role that differences in the distribution of &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs and EPRs in cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts may play in contributing to the disparities in functional responses they produce. Previous studies have used biochemical methods to demonstrate that caveolar lipid rafts are associated with the segregation of various G-protein-coupled receptors <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, but most studies involving cardiac myocytes have relied on the use of neonatal cells <xref rid="bb0105 bb0145 bb0175 bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[21,29,35,42]</xref>, and none have looked directly at the role that lipid rafts play in explaining differences in functional responses in adult myocytes. Because neonatal myocytes exhibit significant differences in structure and cell signaling responses <xref rid="bb0215 bb0220" ref-type="bibr">[43,44]</xref>, we chose to conduct our studies using adult ventricular myocytes. To gain further insight into the role of lipid rafts in generating compartmentalized responses by both &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs and EPRs, we also used live cell imaging of FRET-based biosensors to measure cAMP responses in different microdomains of intact myocytes.</p>
      <p>The results of the present work indicate that even though both &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs and EPRs were able to stimulate cAMP production, as detected by FRET-based biosensors, only &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs were able to enhance the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient and myocyte shortening. Furthermore, we observed that &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs are found in caveolar as well as extra-caveolar fractions of the plasma membrane, while EPRs were only found in extra-caveolar fractions. When myocytes were then treated with M&#x3B2;CD to deplete cholesterol and disrupt lipid rafts, &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR sensitivity of functional responses was enhanced. Consistent with this observation, M&#x3B2;CD treatment also enhanced &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR sensitivity of the PKA probe response. However, M&#x3B2;CD treatment had no effect on the Epac2 probe response to &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation, and it had no effect on any response to PGE1. These results support the idea that segregation of specific G-protein-coupled receptors within the membrane is an underlying mechanism of separation of function associated with different cAMP signaling pools. They also suggest that &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic regulation of the functional responses described in this study is specific to receptors found in caveolar membrane domains.</p>
      <p>The fact that M&#x3B2;CD treatment did not alter the PKA probe response to PGE1 suggests that the effect of cholesterol depletion was not due to a direct effect on endogenous PKA or the PKA probe. The more likely explanation for our results is that cholesterol depletion increased myocyte sensitivity to &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation of cAMP production. This conclusion is consistent with biochemical studies reporting that cholesterol depletion increases &#x3B2;AR stimulation of cAMP production in various cell types <xref rid="bb0075 bb0175 bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[15,35,36]</xref>. Rybin et al. <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> suggested that this can be explained by a direct interaction between adenylyl cyclase and the inhibitory scaffolding domain of caveolin-3. They concluded that cholesterol depletion disrupts this interaction, relieving its inhibitory effect on cAMP production. Removal of such an inhibitory effect could then explain the shift in sensitivity to &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation that we observed.</p>
      <p>In another study using neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, Ostrom et al. <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> reported that cholesterol depletion actually inhibits &#x3B2;AR stimulation of cAMP production. The reason for the apparent discrepancy is unclear. However, they also found that EPR stimulation of cAMP production was unaltered. Their conclusion was that cholesterol depletion only affects responses associated with receptors found in caveolar lipid rafts, which is consistent with our results in intact adult myocytes. More recently, Balijepalli et al. <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> reported that cholesterol depletion had no affect on &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR regulation of the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> in neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes. Yet, their study only compared responses to maximal receptor activation. Consistent with that, our present work found that cholesterol depletion did not alter responses to maximal &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation, it only increased responses to sub-maximal &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation, indicating that cholesterol depletion was shifting the sensitivity to receptor activation. Our previous work has shown evidence of a trend for cholesterol depletion to enhance &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR responses produced by 5&#xA0;nM Iso, although the effects were not statistically significant <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The greater effect observed in the present study may be explained by our use 1&#xA0;nM Iso, a concentration much further from that which produces maximal responses.</p>
      <p>Our finding that cholesterol depletion increased &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR sensitivity of responses detected by the PKA-based biosensor, but not the Epac2-based biosensor, suggests that the regulation of electrical and mechanical activity involves the production of cAMP in a microdomain associated with type II PKA by receptors found in cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts. It also suggests that &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation of cAMP throughout the rest of the cell may be mediated by receptors that are found primarily outside of lipid rafts. These results, together with the fact that PGE1 still had no effect on functional responses following cholesterol depletion, demonstrate that while receptors in lipid raft and non-lipid raft domains can produce compartmentalized responses, compartmentalized behavior still exists even after lipid rafts have been disrupted. This implies that cholesterol depletion may not be causing significant redistribution of these receptors and that something else must contribute to their association with different cAMP signaling domains. Although this appears to be different from the effect that cholesterol depletion has on &#x3B2;<sub>2</sub>ARs <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, it is consistent with reports that cholesterol depletion has no effect or actually decreases the mobility of many plasma membrane proteins, possibly due to the existence and/or enhancement of other barriers, such as actin cytoskeleton or solid phase phospholipids <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Another important observation made in the present study is that cholesterol depletion not only enhanced the magnitude of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient and myocyte shortening responses to &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation, it also affected the rate of transient decay and the rate of relaxation. While an increase in the magnitude of the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> could conceivably explain the change in the magnitude of those other responses, it is unlikely to explain the change in their kinetics. The faster decay of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient most likely reflects an increase in the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase due to PKA-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Such an effect is also likely to contribute to the faster relaxation of myocyte shortening, although PKA- dependent phosphorylation of troponin I could also play a role. These observations indicate that &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR regulation of myocyte contraction correlates more closely with the local production of cAMP by a subpopulation of receptors associated with lipid rafts and that it is not just L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that are under the local control of cAMP production by &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>ARs.</p>
      <p>The present study also demonstrates some interesting new aspects of the compartmentalized response associated with EP receptor activation. In the original study using isolated adult cardiac myocytes, Buxton and Brunton <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> employed a biochemical approach and found that PGE1 stimulated cAMP production in the soluble fraction, but not the particulate fraction, of homogenized myocytes. Following the development of biosensors capable of measuring cAMP activity in intact cells, Rochais et al. <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> used an exogenously expressed, cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) ion channel, but found that it was unable to detect a cAMP response produced by PGE1 in adult rat ventricular myocytes. However, in our previous study using adult guinea pig ventricular myocytes, we found that PGE1 elicited a transient increase in cAMP detected by the Epac2-based probe, yet it had no effect on the cAMP response detected by the type II PKA-based probe anchored by AKAPs <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Similar results were reported in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, where PGE1 stimulation was found to produce a more significant cAMP response outside of the type II PKA signaling domain <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. This is in contrast to the present study in adult rat ventricular myocytes, where we found that PGE1 produced a transient cAMP response detected by both the Epac2- and type II PKA-based probes. This apparent discrepancy may reflect developmental and/or species-dependent differences in the distribution of type II PKA. Despite the fact that PGE1 produced a response detected by the PKA probe, it had no effect on any of the functional properties studied. This suggests that in rat ventricular myocytes, the type II PKA signaling domain includes one or more subcellular compartments distinctly separate from those involved in regulating electrical or mechanical activity. The observation that EP<sub>2</sub> and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors are found in extra-caveolar fractions of the plasma membrane suggests that PGE1 is producing cAMP in a subset of the PKA signaling domain not associated with caveolar lipid rafts. Consistent with this idea, evidence for type II PKA has been found in both caveolar and extra-caveolar membrane fractions of cardiac ventricular myocytes <xref rid="bb0145 bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[29,35]</xref>. The question remains as to whether or not all or only some of the extra-caveolar PKA sees the cAMP produced by PGE1.</p>

      <title>Potential limitations</title>
      <p>Experiments involving the use of FRET-based biosensors were carried out in myocytes kept in culture for 48&#x2013;72 h, while most functional experiments involved the use of freshly isolated cells. It is possible that changes in the composition or structure of the cultured cells could have altered some of the cAMP responses we measured. For example, we observed that cholesterol content decreased with time. Still, this did not alter the inability of PGE1 to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel function, which confirmed that compartmentation of cAMP signaling occurs in cultured cells. It has also been reported that T tubule density decreases with time in culture <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In adult ventricular myocytes, L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels involved in the regulation of excitation contraction coupling are located in T tubules, and a loss of T tubules has been shown to attenuate the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> response to &#x3B2;AR regulation <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, we found that &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR of the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca-L</sub> current was unaffected in cultured cells. The fact that cholesterol depletion altered the sensitivity of &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation of cAMP detected by the PKA probe is also unlikely to have been due to the fact that those experiments were conducted in cultured cells since cholesterol depletion had a similar effect on cAMP-dependent functional responses in freshly isolated cells. Even so, we cannot rule out a potential contribution of changes occurring in culture to at least some of our observations.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The present results support the idea that cAMP responses produced by receptors found in lipid rafts domains are sensitive to cholesterol depletion, while responses produced by receptors found outside of lipid raft domains are not. Based on this conclusion, the effects of cholesterol depletion suggest that &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub> adrenergic regulation of electrical and mechanical responses in adult ventricular myocytes is mediated by those receptors associated specifically with lipid raft domains. Finally, even though cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts appear to be associated with compartmentalized cAMP responses, they alone are not sufficient to explain what is responsible for the difference between signaling domains associated with &#x3B2;<sub>1</sub> adrenergic and EP receptors.</p>
