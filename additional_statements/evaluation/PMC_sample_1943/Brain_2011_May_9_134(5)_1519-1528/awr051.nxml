      <abstract>
        <p>Falciparum malaria is an important cause of acute symptomatic seizures in children admitted to hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa, and these seizures are associated with neurological disabilities and epilepsy. However, it is difficult to determine the proportion of seizures attributable to malaria in endemic areas since a significant proportion of asymptomatic children have malaria parasitaemia. We studied children aged 0&#x2013;13 years who had been admitted with a history of seizures to a rural Kenyan hospital between 2002 and 2008. We examined the changes in the incidence of seizures with the reduction of malaria. Logistic regression was used to model malaria-attributable fractions for seizures (the proportion of seizures caused by malaria) to determine if the observed decrease in acute symptomatic seizures was a measure of seizures that are attributable to malaria. The overall incidence of acute symptomatic seizures over the period was 651/100&#x2009;000/year (95% confidence interval 632&#x2013;670) and it was 400/100&#x2009;000/year (95% confidence interval 385&#x2013;415) for acute complex symptomatic seizures (convulsive status epilepticus, repetitive or focal) and 163/100&#x2009;000/year (95% confidence interval 154&#x2013;173) for febrile seizures. From 2002 to 2008, the incidence of all acute symptomatic seizures decreased by 809/100&#x2009;000/year (69.2%) with 93.1% of this decrease in malaria-associated seizures. The decrease in the incidence of acute complex symptomatic seizures during the period was 111/100&#x2009;000/year (57.2%) for convulsive status epilepticus, 440/100&#x2009;000/year (73.7%) for repetitive seizures and 153/100&#x2009;000/year (80.5%) for focal seizures. The adjusted malaria-attributable fractions for seizures with parasitaemia were 92.9% (95% confidence interval 90.4&#x2013;95.1%) for all acute symptomatic seizures, 92.9% (95% confidence interval 89.4&#x2013;95.5%) for convulsive status epilepticus, 93.6% (95% confidence interval 90.9&#x2013;95.9%) for repetitive seizures and 91.8% (95% confidence interval 85.6&#x2013;95.5%) for focal seizures. The adjusted malaria-attributable fractions for seizures in children above 6 months of age decreased with age. The observed decrease in all acute symptomatic seizures (809/100&#x2009;000/year) was similar to the predicted decline (794/100&#x2009;000/year) estimated by malaria-attributable fractions at the beginning of the study. In endemic areas, falciparum malaria is the most common cause of seizures and the risk for seizures in malaria decreases with age. The reduction in malaria has decreased the burden of seizures that are attributable to malaria and this could lead to reduced neurological disabilities and epilepsy in the area.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>It is estimated that <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> caused over 500 million episodes of clinical malaria in 2002, and 70% of these were in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Snow <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Falciparum malaria is thought to be the most common cause of acute seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Waruiru <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Idro <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and convulsive status epilepticus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Crawley <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Idro <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Sadarangani <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) in children admitted to hospitals in malaria endemic regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Most of these seizures are likely to be acute symptomatic seizures rather than febrile seizures since the infected erythrocyte adheres to the post-capillaries vessels in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Idro <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) and over half of these seizures occur when the child is afebrile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Waruiru <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). The seizures are often associated with complex features (focal, repetitive or prolonged) and status epilepticus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Waruiru <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Idro <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Sadarangani <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), and these features are associated with subsequent neurocognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Mung'ala-Odera <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Carter <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Idro <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and the development of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Carter <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Ngoungou and Preux, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Birbeck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Through this mechanism, falciparum malaria may be a major cause of neurological disability in these areas.</p>
      <p>Over the past decade, there has been a significant reduction in malaria transmission and admissions on the Kenyan coast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">O'Meara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Since malaria is an important cause of acute seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Waruiru <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Idro <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), the significant decrease in the transmission of malaria provides an opportunity to determine seizures that are attributable to malaria. We hypothesized that the decrease in admissions with acute symptomatic seizures during a period of a reduction in malaria transmission would provide an appropriate measure of seizures that are attributable to malaria. We also hypothesized that most of the decrease in acute symptomatic seizures would occur in admissions with a positive blood-slide for malaria or malaria-associated seizures (MAS) compared with admissions with a negative blood-slide for malaria or non-malaria-associated seizures (non-MAS). The observed decrease in acute symptomatic seizures between 2002 and 2008 can be compared with the proportion of seizures that are attributable to malaria at the beginning of the study to determine if the observed decrease represents the seizures that are attributable to malaria. However, some admissions with MAS at the beginning of the study would not be attributable to malaria since the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitaemia in the community was as high as 30% during the study period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mwangi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The seizures that are attributable to malaria at the beginning of the study, which predicts the decline that should follow the reduction of malaria, can be estimated by multiplying the malaria-attributable fractions for seizures (the proportion of seizures caused by malaria) with the incidence of MAS at the beginning of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">O'Meara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). An observed decrease that is similar to the predicted decline estimated by malaria-attributable fractions for seizures would suggest that the decrease in seizures observed is a measure of seizures that are attributable to malaria.</p>
      <p>The malaria-attributable fractions for seizures is a predictive measure of the proportion of children not admitted with seizures if malaria was completely eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Koram and Molyneux, 2007</xref>). Although malaria-attributable fractions for seizures can be calculated by comparing the parasite prevalence in seizure cases with that of other admissions that did not develop seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cole and MacMahon, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>), this method is imprecise because many children in the community (as high as 30%) have asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia and thus, some children presenting to hospital with MAS may have their seizures caused by other illnesses but the parasitaemia is co-incidental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mwangi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Koram and Molyneux, 2007</xref>). Since there is no one &#x2018;gold standard&#x2019; test to determine &#x2018;true&#x2019; malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bejon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), malaria-attributable fractions for seizures calculated on the basis of a positive blood-slide for malaria alone are biased towards sensitivity but are non-specific. Logistic regression fully uses the detailed information on parasitaemia distributions in both cases and comparison group and therefore has been suggested as a valuable alternative for modelling malaria-attributable fractions in malaria endemic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mwangi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bejon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The logistic regression model can be modified to allow for non-continuity between negative and positive blood-slides for malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Koram and Molyneux, 2007</xref>) and adjusts the lack of monotonicity in the relationship between malaria symptoms and parasitaemia that is reported in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). The model can be extended to allow for inclusion of other variables such as age and period of study, alongside the parasitaemia when modelling the malaria-attributable fractions for seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>).</p>
      <p>The logistic regression model uses parasitaemia from children admitted to hospital with severe symptoms such as acute seizures and from a comparison group to model the relation between parasitaemia and the symptoms of malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mwangi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bejon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The parasitaemia used in the model was assessed with optical microscopy. The logistic regression technique models malaria-attributable fractions for various clinical features at different thresholds of parasitaemia and uses the modelled malaria-attributable fractions (i.e. the proportion of cases within a threshold of parasitaemia) to calculate the sensitivities (defined as a measure of the proportion of seizures with a positive blood-slide that can be positively identified as attributable to malaria) and specificities (defined as a measure of the proportion of seizures with a positive blood-slide that can be negatively identified as attributable to malaria) associated with each threshold of parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mwangi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bejon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The thresholds of parasitaemia used for deriving malaria-attributable fractions depend on the use of the case definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>) and previous studies have observed that malaria-attributable fractions derived at higher parasitaemia levels are likely to be associated with high sensitivities and specificities acceptable for case definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mwangi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bejon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>We examined the changes in the incidence of admissions with seizures over a 7-year period and used the decrease in the incidence of malaria to calculate malaria-attributable fractions for seizures to determine if the observed decrease in seizures was a measure of the childhood admissions with seizures that are attributable to malaria.</p>

        <p>We used an online database of admissions to identify all children aged between 0 and 13 years admitted to Kilifi District Hospital on the Kenyan coast, from 2002 to 2008, with a history of seizures. We reviewed their clinical notes to extract information on malaria status and seizures. Kilifi District Hospital is located in a regularly enumerated demographic surveillance system area and serves a rural community of about 100&#x2009;000 children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Sadarangani <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). There are two annual peaks of malaria related to the two rainy seasons. The prevalence of parasitaemia in children admitted with trauma (as a measure of background prevalence in the non-febrile community) has reduced from &gt;20% in 2002 to &lt;1% in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">O'Meara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The decline in malaria has been attributed to the scaling-up of malaria control interventions such as the distribution of insecticide-treated nets, introduction of effective anti-malarial drugs and health education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Nevill <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Marsh <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Amin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Okiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The relationship with control measures is, however, unclear and there is evidence that transmission was falling before the interventions were introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">O'Meara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In 1998 sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine replaced chloroquine and in 2004 artemether&#x2013;lumefantrine was introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Amin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The introduction of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type B vaccine, introduced into the Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunization in 2001, has helped reduce the incidence of invasive haemophilus disease in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cowgill <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and this may reduce the incidence of seizures, particularly in young infants without parasitaemia.</p>

        <title>Clinical management of patients</title>
        <p>For every child admitted to the hospital, clinical and laboratory data are entered into a standard database. The medical history included the parental description of episodes of seizures, number and duration of seizures. Full blood count, malaria parasitaemia, plasma glucose, venous blood gases and blood culture were done on all children at admission, including the comparison group comprising trauma patients. Severe malaria was defined according to the WHO criteria as a child with asexual malaria parasitaemia and either Blantyre Coma Score &#x2264;2 (i.e. cerebral malaria), respiratory distress and/or haemoglobin &lt;5&#x2009;g/dl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Molyneux <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; World Health Organization, 2000). Severe malaria was treated with parenteral quinine and when the child was able to take treatment orally, it was completed with sulphadoxine&#x2013;pyrimethamine (until September 2006) or artemether&#x2013;lumefantrine thereafter.</p>
        <p>Clinicians and nurses at the hospital provide 24-h clinical cover. Nursing staff were trained to record details of seizures on a standard proforma. These details included data for the time of onset and cessation of seizures, anti-epileptic drugs administered and the level of consciousness at the end of a seizure, as determined by the Blantyre Coma Score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Molyneux <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>). A standard protocol for seizure management was used. A child with a seizure lasting &#x2265;5&#x2009;min was given intravenous diazepam (0.3&#x2009;mg/kg) and if still convulsing 10&#x2009;min later was given intramuscular paraldehyde (0.4&#x2009;mg/kg). Intravenous phenobarbital (15&#x2009;mg/kg) was given for prolonged seizures (20&#x2013;30&#x2009;min). If these seizures did not respond to these two anti-epileptic drugs, they were termed refractory seizures and were treated with intravenous phenytoin (18&#x2009;mg/kg). Children with brief repetitive seizures (&#x2265;3 seizures in 1&#x2009;h lasting &gt;5&#x2009;min) were given phenobarbital (15&#x2009;mg/kg).</p>

        <title>Case definitions for the study</title>
        <p>The definitions for seizures were based on those of the International League against Epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">ILAE, 1989</xref>). Acute symptomatic seizures were defined as seizures in the current illness and within 1 week prior to admission. The three main phenotypes of acute symptomatic seizures studied were convulsive status epilepticus (defined as convulsions lasting &gt;30&#x2009;min, or intermittent convulsions without regaining consciousness for 30&#x2009;min), focal seizures (defined as seizures starting at one part of the body) and repetitive symptomatic seizures (defined as more than one seizure in the same illness). Seizures that were repetitive, focal or fulfilled the definition of convulsive status epilepticus were termed acute complex symptomatic seizures and simple symptomatic seizures as a generalized seizure without any of these features. We further classified convulsive status epilepticus into definite, probable or possible categories based on the information that was available from the history (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Febrile seizures were defined as seizures in children aged between 1 month and 6 years who had a febrile illness without malaria parasitaemia or evidence of bacterial meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Berkley <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) or encephalitis (cerebrospinal fluid white cell count &gt;50/&#xB5;l).

        <p>MAS were defined as admissions to hospital with a history of seizures and malaria parasitaemia detected on thick and thin blood slides stained with 10% Giemsa. Non-MAS were defined as admissions to hospital with a history of seizures and no parasitaemia detected on the blood slides. Parasite density was quantified by count of the number of parasites per 100 white cell counts or 500 red cell counts (if count per 100 white cell count is missing or &gt;100/100 white cell counts) and multiplying these figures by whole white cell counts or red cell counts, respectively. If whole blood cell counts data were missing, parasitaemia was estimated on the basis of a uniform white cell count of 8000/&#xB5;l (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Rogers <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p>

          <title>Deriving malaria-attributable fraction for seizures</title>
          <p>We applied logistic regression methods to model the risk of seizures as a continuous function of malaria parasitaemia by comparing all admissions with seizures (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;4486) and a comparison group (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1411) [children aged 0&#x2013;13 years admitted with heterogeneous non-infectious diagnoses such as trauma (not involving head region), burns and snake bites]. The comparison group had no seizures on admission and the parasitaemia seen in these children is representative of the background prevalence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in asymptomatic children in the community.</p>
          <p>The logistic regression model used was: <italic>log</italic>(<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="awr051i1.jpg"/></inline-formula>)&#x2009;=&#x2009;<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>&#x2009;+&#x2009;<italic>&#x3B2;x<sup>&#x5D6;</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>), where <italic>p</italic> is the probability of admission with seizures (where the admissions with seizures are treated as &#x2018;positive&#x2019; and the comparison group as &#x2018;negative&#x2019;), <italic>x</italic> is the parasite density and <italic>&#x5D6;</italic> is the power function that improves the numerical stability of the maximum likelihood estimation. The coefficient (<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>) in the logistic model can be used to calculate the risk of seizures caused by malaria for each child. The risks of a group are averaged to estimate the proportion of the group whose seizures are caused by &#x2018;true&#x2019; malaria rather than another illness with coincidental parasitaemia. The averaged risks give the positive predictive value or malaria-attributable fractions for seizures for the group analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). Sensitivity and specificity can then be calculated using the malaria-attributable fractions for seizures or the proportion of seizure cases within each level of parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). For this study, malaria-attributable fractions for seizures were reported at levels of parasitaemia &#x2265;2500/&#xB5;l since this threshold of parasitaemia is associated with high sensitivity and specificity for case definitions in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mwangi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bejon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).

          <p>Age and year of study were entered as covariates of parasitaemia in the logistic regression model because the two factors are most likely to influence the malaria-attributable fractions modelled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). The model was repeated in different phenotypes of acute symptomatic seizures and various age groups. Since parasitaemia is uncommon in children younger than 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Idro <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), we did not model malaria-attributable fractions for seizures for this group. Confidence intervals around the malaria-attributable fractions for seizures were estimated by bootstrapping with 1000 iterations.</p>

          <title>Calculating the incidence of seizures</title>
          <p>The incidence analysis considered a child&#x2019;s first hospital admission with seizures and any other subsequent admission was excluded. The incidence of hospital admissions with acute symptomatic seizures was calculated for all children who lived in the demographic surveillance study area. The incidences were calculated using the denominator as the annual population figures for children, which were made at the midpoint of the years of study by fitting a log-linear regression line through the observed population counts. Additionally, the annual incidence of MAS and non-MAS was calculated for all admissions with acute symptomatic seizures. The declining trends in incidence of seizures by year were investigated using linear regression.</p>

          <title>Estimating the decrease in the incidence of seizures</title>
          <p>The predicted decline in acute symptomatic seizures that are attributable to malaria (seizures that should decrease following the reduction of malaria) was the incidence of MAS at 2002 (the beginning of the study) multiplied by the malaria-attributable fractions for seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">O'Meara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The observed decrease in the incidence of acute symptomatic seizures was the difference in the incidence between 2002 and 2008. The percentage decrease in the incidence of seizures was the observed decrease in the incidence of seizures expressed as a percentage of the incidence at 2002. Ethical permission for the study was obtained from the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) National Ethical Review committee.</p>

        <title>General description</title>
        <p>Over the 7-year period, a total of 34&#x2009;057 children aged between 0 and 13 years were admitted to Kilifi District Hospital, of whom 7150 (21%) had asexual <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites detected on admission and 5580 (16%) had a history of seizures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Of the 7150 children admitted with malaria parasitaemia, 4370 (61.1%) did not have a history of seizures during their illness leading to hospitalization. Of the 5580 children with a history of seizures, 1007 (18%) did not live in the study area, and were excluded from the analysis. The analysis data set, therefore, comprised 4573 children. The data for 9% of the 4573 children were not available from the hospital archives and thus we could not obtain full description of the seizures. Malaria parasitaemia was detected in 140 (10%) of the 1411 comparison group and the prevalence of parasitaemia decreased consistently between 2002 and 2008 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).

          <p>The predicted decline estimated by multiplying the incidence of MAS at the beginning of the study by malaria-attributable fractions for seizures indicated that acute symptomatic seizures would decrease by 794/100&#x2009;000/year following the reduction of malaria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). During the same period, acute complex symptomatic seizures were predicted to decline by 129/100&#x2009;000/year for convulsive status epilepticus, 404/100&#x2009;000/year for repetitive seizures and 125/100&#x2009;000/year for focal seizures.</p>

      <p>We found that the overall incidence of acute symptomatic seizures was 651/100&#x2009;000/year (95% CI 632&#x2013;670) and it was 400/100&#x2009;000/year (95% CI 385&#x2013;415) and 163/100&#x2009;000/year (95% CI 154&#x2013;173) for acute complex symptomatic seizures and febrile seizures, respectively. The adjusted malaria-attributable fractions for acute symptomatic seizures in all admissions with parasitaemia were relatively high and decreased with age in children older than 6 months of age. From 2002 to 2008, all acute symptomatic seizures decreased by 809/100&#x2009;000/year (69.2%) with 93.1% of this decrease occurring in MAS. The observed decrease (809/100&#x2009;000/year) in all acute symptomatic seizures was similar to the predicted decline (794/100&#x2009;000/year) that was estimated using malaria-attributable fractions for seizures.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Malaria-attributable fractions for seizures</title>
        <p>We modelled malaria-attributable fractions for seizures to determine the proportion of seizures that would decrease following the reduction of malaria. We calculated malaria-attributable fractions for seizures with logistic regression since the high prevalence of asymptomatic parasitaemia in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mwangi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) can result in some seizures caused by other illnesses with coincidental parasitaemia being incorrectly classified as attributable to malaria if other methods were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). The adjusted malaria-attributable fractions for all acute symptomatic seizures were derived at parasitaemia levels &#x2265;2500/&#xB5;l since this threshold was shown to be associated with malaria illnesses in previous studies in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mwangi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bejon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and is associated with high sensitivities and specificities in this study. Malaria-attributable fractions for seizures were high and similar among the three acute complex symptomatic seizures with only repetitive seizures particularly attributable to malaria.</p>
        <p>We found high malaria-attributable fractions for seizures in children &gt;6 months and these attributable fractions decreased with age, which may reflect the increasing immunity and tolerance to malaria as children grow older. This finding, however, is predictive of what would normally be expected of the risk of seizures in malaria with age when the transmission intensity of malaria is stable. The mean age of children with MAS appeared to increase over the study period compared with that of children with non-MAS and supports the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of seizures in malaria is related to intrinsic factors of host age as well as the transmission intensity and levels of parasitaemia. A decrease in transmission of malaria impairs the development of immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Snow <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>) and thus older children are admitted with severe complications such as cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">O'Meara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), which is strongly associated with seizures.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Changes in the incidence of seizures</title>
        <p>Most of the observed decrease in the incidence of seizures occurred in MAS compared with non-MAS and supports the hypothesis that the decrease observed in seizures is associated with the reduction of malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">O'Meara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The observed decrease in acute symptomatic seizures was similar to the predicted decline that was estimated by malaria-attributable fractions for seizures in 2002 and supports the hypothesis that the decrease in seizures during a period of a reduction in malaria transmission is an approximate measure of seizures that are attributable to malaria. Nevertheless, the observed decrease was larger than the predicted decline by 15/100&#x2009;000/year, which could be attributable to other factors other than the reduction in malaria.</p>
        <p>The observed decrease that was in excess of the predicted decline calculated using malaria-attributable fractions for seizures is probably caused by the improvement in health services rather than the malaria control interventions that led to the reduction of malaria. Such improvements include more widespread use of antimicrobials, the improvement in the treatment of seizures in the peripheral health facilities [although anti-epileptic drugs are not readily available in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Ahmad <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>)] and the reduction in haemophilus meningitis following the introduction of <italic>H. influenzae</italic> type B vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cowgill <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The finding that the decrease caused by the improvement in health services did not occur in convulsive status epilepticus could suggest that another non-malarial cause of status epilepticus, such as epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Sadarangani <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) was still high during the study period.</p>
        <p>Since acute complex symptomatic seizures are important in the pathogenesis of severe malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Crawley <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>) and are associated with neurocognitive impairments and development of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Carter <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Idro <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Sadarangani <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), the decrease in the incidence of these seizures could lead to a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of neurological disabilities and mortality in this area.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>These incidence rates are conservative because almost all of the seizures detected were convulsive seizures and non-convulsive seizures may have been missed. Furthermore, we could not ascertain the proportion of patients whose seizures had been treated with anti-epileptics drugs at the peripheral prior referral since this may have reduced the number of referrals or admissions with seizures. However, very few patients, if any, will have received prior treatment for seizures before admission because anti-epileptic drugs such as diazepam and phenobarbital are not readily available in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Ahmad <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Additionally, some seizure cases may have been missed because traditional healers only refer the severely sick children to Kilifi District Hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Waruiru <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), hospital user fee charges may reduce hospital use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chuma <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>) and some children with short seizures would not be referred to hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Sadarangani <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The malaria-attributable fractions for seizures calculated from a single blood-slide does not account for the parasitaemia that may have been undetected by the less sensitive optical microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Ochola <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the density of parasitaemia can fluctuate significantly within hours and therefore use of parasitaemia from a single blood film complicates the modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Koram and Molyneux, 2007</xref>).</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The high malaria-attributable fractions for seizures modelled in this study confirms that falciparum malaria is the most common cause of acute symptomatic seizures in children admitted to hospital with parasitaemia in a malaria endemic area and that the risk for seizures decreases with age. The observed decrease in the incidence of seizures was similar to the predicted decline that was estimated using the modelled malaria-attributable fractions for seizures and suggests that the decrease observed is an approximate measure of the childhood admissions with seizures that are attributable to malaria. The observed decrease in seizures could lead to reduced neurological disabilities and epilepsy associated with malaria in this area.</p>
