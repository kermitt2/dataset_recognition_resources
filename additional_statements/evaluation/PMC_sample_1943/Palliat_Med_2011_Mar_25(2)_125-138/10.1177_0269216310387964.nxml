        <p>Nursing homes are a common site of death, but older residents receive variable
                    quality of end-of-life care. We used a mixed methods design to identify external
                    influences on the quality of end-of-life care in nursing homes. Two qualitative
                    case studies were conducted and a postal survey of 180 nursing homes surrounding
                    the case study sites. In the case studies, qualitative interviews were held with
                    seven members of nursing home staff and 10 external staff. Problems in accessing
                    support for end-of-life care reported in the survey included variable support by
                    general practitioners (GPs), reluctance among GPs to prescribe appropriate
                    medication, lack of support from other agencies, lack of out of hours support,
                    cost of syringe drivers and lack of access to training. Most care homes were
                    implementing a care pathway. Those that were not rated their end-of-life care as
                    in need of improvement or as average. The case studies suggest that critical
                    factors in improving end-of-life care in nursing homes include developing
                    clinical leadership, developing relationships with GPs, the support of
                    &#x2018;key&#x2019; external advocates and leverage of additional
                    resources by adoption of care pathway tools.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Nursing homes are an increasingly common site of death. In England, 16%
                of all deaths take place in the long-term care sector,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216310387964">1</xref></sup> with most occurring in nursing homes among over 85 year olds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216310387964">2</xref></sup> Predicted socio demographic trends show rapid increases in the numbers of
                people aged over 85 and of single households, with concomitant decreases in the
                availability of informal carers. These trends mean that nursing homes are likely to
                remain as important sites of end-of-life care for the foreseeable future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216310387964">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Older people admitted to nursing homes have been estimated to have a life expectancy
                of 9&#x2013;12 months,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216310387964">4</xref></sup> with those who have dementia having the shortest life expectancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216310387964">5</xref></sup> However, the complexity of chronic and co morbid conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216310387964">6</xref></sup> among residents makes it difficult to recognize and manage the terminal phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216310387964">7</xref></sup> Many residents die after a period of diffuse deterioration marked by
                increasing disability and frailty,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216310387964">8</xref></sup> rather than a clearly identifiable &#x2018;terminal illness&#x2019;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216310387964">9</xref></sup> There is evidence that older people residing in care homes receive variable
                quality in terms of both continuing &#x2018;chronic&#x2019; disease care
                and end-of-life care because of clinical and organizational factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216310387964">10</xref></sup> One study in England<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216310387964">11</xref></sup> has shown that 47% of homes have no provision for chronic disease
                management for care home residents, such as rehabilitation or physiotherapy, and
                others have only minimal levels, even though many residents could benefit from the
                latter. General practitioner (GP) services to care homes are not always organized
                optimally because of poorly defined funding for the provision of medical care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216310387964">12</xref></sup> Similarly, input from clinical nurse specialists or palliative medicine
                clinicians is rare and, where it occurs, is reactive to crisis situations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216310387964">13</xref></sup> Pain and symptom control is often poor as a result,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216310387964">14</xref></sup> and there is some evidence of inappropriate medication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216310387964">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216310387964">15</xref></sup> Surveys of
                bereaved carers show high levels of dissatisfaction with end-of-life care in care
                        homes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216310387964">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216310387964">17</xref></sup></p>
      <p>There has been a proliferation of different care home organizations across England,
                which creates challenges for the commissioning and funding of end-of-life care
                services in care homes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216310387964">18</xref></sup> In addition, residents&#x2019; care is likely to be funded by a mixture
                of National Health Service (NHS), local authority and private monies, which is
                likely to make rapid access to resources difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216310387964">19</xref></sup> Relationships between the range of health and social care agencies that
                intersect with care homes make care planning complex, and can lead to conflict in
                terms of the management of a resident&#x2019;s final illness. This may increase
                the likelihood that some residents are admitted to hospital at the very end of life
                who might otherwise be supported in the care home setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216310387964">20</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In England, a range of developments have occurred over the last 15 years to support
                the provision of end-of-life care in care homes. Specialist palliative care
                provision has been supported through the work of: (i) Clinical Nurse Specialists;
                (ii) the establishment of &#x2018;hospice beds&#x2019; in nursing homes;
                (iii) the provision of palliative care education and training for care home staff;
                and (iv) the development of link nurse schemes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216310387964">20</xref></sup> The promotion of general palliative care for any resident is now the main
                focus of developments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216310387964">21</xref></sup> as reflected in the emphases of the National End of Life Care Programme,
                which has a specific stream of work concerning care homes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216310387964">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216310387964">23</xref></sup> Within this, a number of
                initiatives are being promoted to support the provision of end-of-life care in care
                homes, including the care and service planning tools: the Liverpool Care Pathway
                (LCP) for the Dying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269216310387964">Figure
                1</xref>); the Gold Standards Framework (GSF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269216310387964">Figure 2</xref>); and the Preferred Priorities for
                Care (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269216310387964">Figure 3</xref>). There are
                also a large number of local initiatives and developments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216310387964">23</xref></sup>

      <p>This paper draws from a study commissioned by the National End of Life Care Programme
                in England<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216310387964">24</xref></sup> in the context of the programme&#x2019;s attempt to assess the
                effectiveness of the various initiatives outlined above and to inform
                recommendations for the further development of policy and practice. The aim of the
                study was to identify key factors in the wider health and social care system
                influencing the quality of end-of-life care provided in nursing homes. The study aim
                and method of enquiry was informed by an expert steering group made up of
                representatives from the funders, umbrella organizations for nursing home and care
                providers, regulatory bodies and NHS Trusts.</p>

        <title>Setting and design</title>
        <p>A mixed methods design was employed, consisting of two in-depth qualitative case studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216310387964">25</xref></sup> of nursing homes and a postal survey of the managers of 180 nursing homes
                    surrounding the case study sites. Names and addresses of care homes with nursing
                    care and registered to care for &#x2018;old age&#x2019; (not falling
                    into any other category) were identified from the Commission for Social Care
                    Inspection (CSCI; now the Care Quality Commission) database,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216310387964">26</xref></sup> which is the regulatory body for care homes in England. The survey was
                    developed from a review of previous surveys used in related research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216310387964">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216310387964">28</xref></sup> and
                    piloted in two focus groups with care home staff. The survey included questions
                    about the profile of deaths in the homes, access to external support and
                    barriers to and perceived priorities for improving end-of-life care.</p>
        <p>The case study homes were in Northern England. One was in a rural area and one in
                    a city. They were purposively selected as &#x2018;instrumental&#x2019;
                    case studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216310387964">25</xref></sup> to facilitate understanding of a wider set of issues following
                    consultation with colleagues from the National End of Life Care Programme and
                    local stakeholders in end-of-life care practice and policy. The homes were known
                    to provide a good standard of end-of-life care (we assessed this via reports
                    from stakeholders and from homes inspection reports, which are accessible on the
                    database of the CSCI) and our focus was on how key staff experienced some of the
                    issues found in the survey and to see how the homes had addressed commonly
                    perceived and encountered problems. Qualitative interviews were held with seven
                    members of care home staff and 10 &#x2018;stakeholders&#x2019;
                    nominated by the staff as providing them with external support. Details of

        <p>Survey data were analysed to produce descriptive statistics with the aid of the
                    Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)<sup>&#xA9;</sup>. Free
                    text comments added to the survey document were subject to content analysis. The
                    findings from the survey were used to design an aide memoire and initial coding
                    frame for the qualitative interview data. The framework was then modified to
                    include any new issues within interviewees&#x2019; accounts. In addition to
                    a thematic analysis of the interviews, we sought to understand the narratives
                    recounted about the recent history of the care homes and developed short
                    historical profiles of each home, focusing on understanding how problems
                    associated with external support for end-of-life care had been addressed. One
                    researcher (AK) conducted the initial analysis, which was then checked by JS and
                    KF. Summary reports of the project were sent to each care home that had
                    participated in the study. Case study care homes provided comments on a draft of
                    their case study report, clarifying points of detail and weight of
                    interpretation. This acted as a means of respondent validation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216310387964">29</xref></sup></p>

                        residential and nursing homes; the remaining provided nursing care only.
                        Responding homes ranged in size from 19 to 180 beds and reported a mean of
                        18 deaths per home (range 2&#x2013;90) in 2007. Of the 1182
                        residents&#x2019; deaths reported, 76.5% (904) took place
                        in the home, 23.3% (275) in hospital and 0.25% (3)
                        in a hospice. Seventy-seven percent of deaths were reported to be caused
                        primarily by non-cancer conditions.</p>
          <p>Seventy eight percent of the responding care homes (64) self-rated the
                        quality of their end-of-life care. Of these, one home described it as

                        tools. Most (50) reported use of the LCP, with smaller numbers reporting use
                        of the GSF (21) and/or Preferred Priorities of Care (PPC) (4). Sixteen homes
                        were using both the LCP and the GSF. Eight care homes reported they were
                        using their own care pathway or one that had been locally developed. Of the

                        improving&#x2019; or &#x2018;average&#x2019; reported that

          <p>Care homes were asked to describe the level of support they received from a

                        this question. Of those, 97% (58) reported that they received

                        from GPs; 94% (58) &#x2018;some&#x2019; or
                        &#x2018;a lot&#x2019; of support from family members. The majority
                        reported similarly about specialist nurses (80%; 47), district
                        nurses (51%; 30) and specialist palliative care teams
                        (54%; 32). Less than half of homes reported receiving some or a
                        lot of help from social workers (49%; 29), community matrons
                        (20%; 12), NHS hospitals (31%; 18), staff from the
                        National End of Life Care Programme (32%; 19) or the CSCI
                        (29%; 17). A small minority of homes responding to this question
                        rated voluntary organizations (9%; 5), support groups
                        (13%; 8) or learning disability teams (7%; 4) as
                        providing similar levels of support to them. Reported levels of support were
                        consistent with whether or not homes reported that they requested help from
                        an agency; noteworthy here is that one quarter of homes that responded to
                        this question said that they did not request help from specialist palliative
                        care teams (24%; 14). <table-wrap id="table2-0269216310387964" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Reported levels of support received from external staff and

          <p>Sixty-six percent of responding care homes (53) reported that they accessed

        <title>Case studies</title>
        <p>Both the nursing homes studied as cases had very different contexts and
                    conditions in which they were trying to develop their practice and for both,
                    end-of-life care was only one aspect of their work. However, both were
                    remarkably similar in terms of the ability demonstrated by senior staff to show
                    leadership and to engender aspirations for continual improvement of standards of
                    end-of-life care. Both homes were actively engaged in networking with other
                    homes in their locality, albeit at different stages of development, and both
                    were fully aware of the range of problematic issues in relation to external
                    support: one home had largely resolved many of the problems, while for the
                    second home, this was very much &#x2018;work in progress&#x2019;.
                    Below we provide sketches to show how the two case study care homes had
                    contrasting experiences in terms of external support for end-of-life care
                    provision and were at different stages of progress. These sketches are
                    composites of the analysis of qualitative interview data and we indicate the
                    source of the data using superscript letters as indicated. In addition, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0269216310387964">Table 6</xref> provides a

          <p>The City care home was providing care to 58 residents at the time of the
                        study. It had an integral unit for the delivery of intermediate and
                        continuing care. Between 1 January and 31 December 2007, there were 30
                        residents who died in the home and five residents who died at the local
                            hospital<sup>c</sup>. The CSCI completed an unannounced inspection of
                        the home in December 2006 and found the atmosphere within the home as
                        &#x2018;welcoming and warm&#x2019;. The &#x2018;staff and
                        residents spoken to had a sense of humour and appeared relaxed and
                        comfortable&#x2019;. The report described the
                        &#x2018;communication skills of the staff with individuals [was
                        observed] to be very positive&#x2019;. The report further found
                        &#x2018;residents and visiting relatives said the staff were generally
                        very kind, helpful and friendly&#x2019; and &#x2018;the
                        relationship between residents/relatives and staff appeared positive and the
                        residents were treated with respect&#x2019; (Commission for Social Care
                        Inspection (2006); Inspection report). The current manager came into post in
                        2001, having previously worked as a district nurse for 25 years<sup>a</sup>.
                        She has a very clear vision for the development of palliative care in the
                        home, strengthened by co staffing across the care home and
                        continuing/intermediate care unit. She had encouraged senior staff and
                        others to undertake training and education in this area and was able to
                        access training events in the locality. She had developed a resource room
                        for use by care home staff. Staff morale was high and turnover relatively
                        low.</p>
          <p>The City home was the first within its Primary Care Trust (PCT) to implement
                        the LCP for the Dying and the GSF, securing, in the opinion of a key
                        stakeholder, its role as a leader in end-of-life care practice among its
                        &#x2018;peer&#x2019; care homes<sup>g</sup>. This followed the
                        development of a palliative care strategy across the local PCTs in 1998,
                        which had been followed by some changes in commissioning practice. The
                        subsequent implementation of the GSF in the City home followed intensive
                        mentorship provided to the care home staff by the LCP
                        facilitator<sup>g</sup> and the attendance of care home senior staff at GSF
                        meetings. The care home manager reported that as a result of these regular
                        meetings it had been possible for the City home to build good networks and
                        rapport both with other local care homes and with colleagues in general
                        practice and in specialist palliative care. These in turn enabled them to
                        make timely referrals when they needed help with residents&#x2019;
                        end-of-life care needs<sup>a,b,c</sup>.</p>
          <p>Over time City home staff have been able to build good rapport with local GP
                            practices<sup>a</sup>. They have developed a relationship of trust with
                        one GP in particular from whom they now regularly receive visits. The
                        support given from this and other GPs in providing end-of-life care is now
                        highly esteemed by the senior staff and is complemented by the care
                        home&#x2019;s long-standing relationship with a local pharmacist, which
                        aids access to prescribed medication when requested &#x2018;out of
                            hours&#x2019;<sup>c</sup>. The role of the City home in end-of-life
                        care was supported by an enlightened commissioner for continuing care, who
                        recognized the importance of supporting practice in care homes and aiding
                        access to PCT resources to ensure good end-of-life care for
                        residents<sup>e</sup>. In the view of the commissioner, collaborative work
                        across the Primary Health Care Trust boundary was beginning to break down
                        the isolation of care homes. As a result, discriminatory attitudes and
                        practices, which meant that once individuals were admitted to care homes
                        with nursing they tended to be regarded as no longer entitled to the
                        services commissioned by the PCT, were changing<sup>e</sup>.</p>
          <p>Following a grant from the Big Lottery Fund (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/">http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/</ext-link> (accessed 15 June 2010))
                        in 2007, the LCP facilitator explained how he was able to set up a
                        &#x2018;syringe driver library&#x2019; in the City home, which is
                        for the use of care homes with nursing in the local area<sup>g</sup>. This
                        had immediately resolved some, although not all, of the problems of access
                        to syringe drivers among care homes in the locality. The City home was
                        selected to hold the library because of its recognized expertise in
                        end-of-life care.</p>

          <p>The Rural home was providing care to 44 residents at the time of the study.
                        Between 1 January and 31 December 2007, there were 25 deaths among
                        residents, of whom 23 died in the home and two died in the local
                            hospital<sup>h</sup>. The CSCI was involved in an unannounced inspection
                        the home in April 2007 (Commission for Social Care Inspection (2007);
                        Inspection report) and described the home as &#x2018;domestic in
                        character and well maintained&#x2019;. The report further notes that
                        there was: &#x2018;&#x2009;&#x2026;a warm and welcoming
                        atmosphere was evident on entering the home&#x2019; and
                        &#x2018;there was evidence that staff, service users and relatives have
                        a good relationship and they chatted freely&#x2019;, with service users
                        and visitors having expressed that &#x2018;care was at a good standard
                        and staff were very kind and attentive&#x2019;. The current care home
                        manager has been in post for approximately four years, since 2004, and is a
                        qualified Registered General Nurse (RGN). She had a clear view of the
                        priorities for end-of-life care practice development in the home.</p>
          <p>The Rural home implemented the LCP for the first time in 2006, following a
                        deliberate attempt to seek knowledge about the pathway by the Care Home
                        Manager. Its implementation was perceived to have
                        &#x2018;smoothed&#x2019; standards of end-of-life care, making
                        them less dependent upon the particular skills and knowledge of staff or the
                        attributes of their relationships with residents. However, unlike the City
                        home, the Rural home encountered some significant problems in extending
                        progress further, largely because of factors that lie outside of its control
                        in the locality.</p>
          <p>A key factor was perceived as the cessation of the contract for the
                        end-of-life care facilitator within the PCT in 2008<sup>h,l,m,p</sup>. As a
                        result, there is no longer a dedicated role within the PCT to introduce and
                        provide ongoing training for the LCP. The manager of the Rural home also
                        reported that accessing GP support, prescribed medication and transferring a
                        resident to the hospital during out of hours was very difficult<sup>h</sup>.
                        Some GPs endeavoured to overcome problems by ensuring medication was
                        pre-emptively prescribed for individuals prior to the weekends, but this did
                        not always provide the solution to unexpected problems among
                            residents<sup>h,j,o</sup>. Lack of involvement in PCT meetings meant
                        that staff in the Rural home felt isolated from wider end-of-life care
                        developments in the locality<sup>h,m,n</sup>. This was improving since the
                        appointment of a community matron with a remit for care homes and a
                        community psychiatric nurse who supported the matron&#x2019;s work with
                        care homes.</p>
          <p>The care home manager was keen that staff undertook training to develop their
                        knowledge in end-of-life care issues, but found it difficult to access
                        courses locally, since most of these were only available for NHS
                            staff<sup>h,j,k,m</sup>. Those staff who did attend development events
                        often did so in their own time and using their own funds. In spite of this,
                        staff morale was high and turnover relatively low <sup>h,i,j,k</sup>.</p>
          <p>Accessing syringe drivers when these were needed was also a problem. The care
                        home manager reported that the GP practice would be the first point of call
                        for obtaining a syringe driver<sup>h</sup>. If the GP practice could not
                        provide one then she would telephone the community matron or the local
                        hospice and usually, by this lengthy process, would manage to obtain
                            one<sup>h</sup>. However, gaining assistance with setting up the driver
                        was sometimes problematic. The care home manager related a recent occasion
                        when a driver was needed but she had not used one for over six months and no
                        longer felt confident to set one up. After some difficulty, she managed to
                        get advice and help from a district nurse<sup>h</sup>. Support from district
                        nurses was generally perceived to be much needed but hard to
                            access<sup>h,i,j,o</sup>. At the time of fieldwork, the community matron
                        was trying to arrange for the care home manager to attend syringe driver
                        training on a regular basis (potentially every three months) at the local
                        hospice. It was reported that this was a means of pre-empting difficulties
                        in using and calibrating syringe drivers, of reducing dependence on district
                        nurses, and of strengthening the care home manager&#x2019;s ability to
                        cascade syringe driver training within the home<sup>l,o</sup>. By the end of
                        the fieldwork, the PCT had loaned one syringe driver to the Rural home for
                        them to use and to lend out to other care homes as required<sup>l</sup>.</p>

      <title>Study limitations</title>
      <p>Since the study was small scale and exploratory, a decision was made to focus on
                homes registered to provide nursing care, as opposed to looking more generally at
                homes providing solely personal care (previously known in England as
                &#x2018;residential care homes&#x2019;). It is likely, however, that some
                of the issues reported here are also relevant to the latter. Furthermore, the homes
                we studied as &#x2018;cases&#x2019; were not part of a wider
                &#x2018;chain&#x2019; provider: this needs to be noted in making sense of
                the findings. There are a number of other limitations in the study. In keeping with
                other surveys of care homes, we had a relatively low response rate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216310387964">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216310387964">30</xref></sup> which limits
                the representativeness of the findings. However, our response rate was considerably
                higher than that achieved by a National Audit Office survey of care homes on a
                similar theme and shows some similar findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216310387964">30</xref></sup> In the case studies, we were not able, for resource reasons, to access the
                views of older residents or their family carers about their experiences of care;
                nor, with one exception, were we able to gather the views of front line care
                assistant staff within care homes. Moreover, our purposive sampling of the two care
                homes with nursing that are the key case studies in the project meant that it was
                clearly in their interests to present the care that they provided in a largely
                positive light. However, by conducting a survey of other care homes in the
                localities of the cares home involved in the case studies, we have been able to
                contextualize the case study findings and thus enhance the validity of the
                study&#x2019;s conclusions about the support that care homes need in order to
                provide appropriate end-of-life care. Furthermore, in their interviews with us staff
                were open and candid about the issues they faced in their daily work: they reported
                problems and ongoing challenges, as well as those things that were going well,
                communicating a sense of shared purpose in seeking to improve the capacity of care
                homes and build on the potential of care homes to provide excellent end-of-life

                responded were manifest in two care homes selected as
                &#x2018;instrumental&#x2019; case studies. It was conducted some 10 years
                after a seminal study in England, which showed how external influences are pivotal
                to the quality of palliative and end-of-life care provided in care homes for older people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216310387964">31</xref></sup> and took place at a time when the End of Life Care Strategy in England<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216310387964">32</xref></sup> directed attention towards the need to improve end-of-life care in all
                settings and among all groups of patients in need.</p>
      <p>The majority of nursing homes that took part in the survey reported some access to
                specialist palliative care services, such as the Macmillan nursing service and/or
                local hospice in the form of a 24-hour advice telephone line. This was supported by
                the experiences of the case study care homes both of which had some access to
                specialist palliative care support. However, in neither the case studies nor the
                survey did specialist palliative care support appear to be a regularly occurring
                feature of care provision. Rather, it was apparently dependent upon requests from
                the homes for such help. In the case of the City home, attendance at local
                palliative care and GSF meetings meant that they had developed networks of support
                that they could draw upon for end-of-life care issues. In addition, there is some
                evidence, from the survey data, of a lack of knowledge in nursing homes about
                available resources or about key staff who may be able to assist with end-of-life
                care, particularly for residents with needs arising from conditions other than
                cancer, such as dementia. It seems that external end-of-life care support provided
                to nursing homes, in most cases, is still predicated on a model of palliative care
                provision required for the classic &#x2018;cancer&#x2019; trajectory,
                which is increasingly at odds with the reality of residents&#x2019; needs.
                Similar findings were found in a survey of clinical nurse specialists in palliative
                care, who reported that they tended to work only with cancer patients and in
                response to crisis situations in care homes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216310387964">12</xref></sup> In the Rural home case study, it was clear that a major contribution to the
                ability of the home to cope with the residents&#x2019; needs was the recently
                instigated help they received from a community matron and a colleague with whom she
                worked closely, a community psychiatric nurse, both of whom had special
                responsibility for care homes in that area. The input the home received from these
                individuals was regular, proactive and planned, as opposed to irregular and crisis
                oriented.</p>
      <p>The survey data indicated that most support with end-of-life care is provided to
                nursing homes by GPs and family members, while support from nurses external to the
                home was somewhat less marked. Neither of the case study care homes reported
                accessing district nursing support with any regularity; in the case of the City
                home, the existence of a continuing care unit meant that they could
                &#x2018;cross cover&#x2019; for nursing needs and so perhaps no longer
                needed such support. In contrast, in the Rural home, district nursing support was a
                scare but much needed resource, particularly in relation to the management of
                syringe drivers. Where district nurse help had been received, it was in the
                knowledge that it was not an &#x2018;allowable&#x2019; form of help, since
                no primary health care trust funds were available for the provision of additional
                nursing support to nursing homes. This issue of additional nursing support required
                by residents in nursing homes was highlighted by the Royal Commission on Long Term Care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216310387964">32</xref></sup> and has never subsequently been resolved in the UK.</p>
      <p>Support from GPs was clearly essential but was associated with a number of
                characteristic difficulties. Survey respondents briefly alluded in their qualitative
                comments to problems of communication, &#x2018;out of hours&#x2019;
                coverage and variability in interest, skills and willing attendance to
                residents&#x2019; needs among the GPs they came into contact with: issues also
                reported in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216310387964">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216310387964">34</xref></sup> The case studies provided an opportunity to examine this issue from
                the point of view of two homes that had largely resolved problems with GP care. In
                the case of the City home, we heard how serious problems in the fairly recent past
                had been addressed by the development of collegial relationships nurtured by
                attendance of care home staff at local end-of-life care meetings. In the case of the
                Rural home, problems were still in evidence, but ameliorated by the development of
                mutual trust and understanding between one GP and the care home staff. The
                development of the latter was seen as essential by the two GPs whom we interviewed
                within the case studies; a condition of its development seemed to be in turn care
                home staff reaching a certain level of competence and expertise so that they could
                assess patients&#x2019; needs and appropriately refer patients to GPs.</p>
      <p>The survey showed that nursing homes which implement an end-of-life care tool, such
                as the GSF or LCP, were more likely to describe their end-of-life care as
                &#x2018;excellent&#x2019; and &#x2018;good&#x2019;. Providing
                some insight into how crucial the implementation of pathways was perceived to be
                among care home staff and their stakeholders, the case study data reveal how in each
                home implementation of the LCP, and, in the City home also the GSF, were seen as
                pivotal to end-of-life care improvement. Similar findings were found in a survey of
                care homes in England by the National Audit Office, although the validity of the
                findings from the latter are undermined by a very low response rate of below 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216310387964">30</xref></sup> The relationship between the use of &#x2018;tools&#x2019; and
                quality of end-of-life care has been identified as needing further examination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216310387964">35</xref></sup> in all care settings, including nursing homes. One worrying finding was the
                inconsistent access to education reported by the homes that responded to the survey
                and the case study homes: staff were often attending study days in their own time
                and using their own resources and found they were sometimes excluded from mainstream
                NHS provision. It is likely that the in-house education levered by participation in
                the LCP and GSF is critical, although whether the cost of participating in the GSF
                programme inhibits some homes from participation needs to be ascertained. Gibbs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216310387964">36</xref></sup> in study of knowledge about pain management, noted how nurses in private
                nursing homes feel less skilled, are isolated and lack educational opportunities
                about &#x2018;mainstream&#x2019; practice in palliative care.
                Under-treated pain remains a significant problem in care homes internationally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216310387964">37</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In the case study homes, clinical leadership and a reasonably stable workforce
                (supported by a good CSCI reports) meant that the homes had the capacity to
                successfully implement the tools and to provide some degree of ongoing education to
                staff. The role of clinical leadership in care homes has been identified as critical
                to care quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216310387964">38</xref></sup> The care managers in the case study homes were in turn supported by key
                individuals external to the care homes, such as GSF and LCP facilitators, who often
                were in a position to &#x2018;lever&#x2019; additional resources. The
                importance of resource leverage and the role of nurses in the latter were similarly
                observed in a study of the outcomes of Macmillan Nursing conducted in the UK in the
                1990s, but remains an under-researched issue in palliative and end-of-life care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216310387964">39</xref></sup> In the case of the City home, the influence of a supportive lead commissioner
                for continuing care was also evident. This commissioner had been able to implement
                changes in commissioning practice through a process of participating in strategic
                developments directed at improving the co-ordination of palliative and end-of-life
                care in the wider vicinity. The City home particularly demonstrates the powerful
                synergy that can occur between factors such as small-scale practice innovation,
                personal aspirations, the provision of effective external links for networking and
                support and wider changes in commissioning practice and attitudes. These all
                coalesced in the City home, such that they had begun to overcome some intractable
                problems reported elsewhere. They are now in a position to provide support to other
                care homes in the locality and to be a &#x2018;beacon&#x2019; of good
                practice. Questions need to be asked about those nursing homes that do not have such
                a fortunate set of circumstances: it was clear from the survey data that a minority
                of homes were excluded from the outside support that flows from participation in the
                LCP and GSF implementation process, where the latter become
                &#x2018;enablers&#x2019; of practice development within the care home and
                levers of support outside it. Care must be taken to ensure that such isolation does
                not become a catalyst for the widening of inequalities rather than a factor that
                motivates key stakeholders in end-of-life care to concentrate their efforts in such
                environments.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This study has demonstrated how the delivery of good quality end-of-life care in care
                homes requires an effective balance of external support, such as systems to access
                medication and syringe drivers, with internal resources, such as staff who are well
                trained and who work in a supportive culture in which they are able to make
                residents&#x2019; and their relatives&#x2019; needs and concerns their
                first priority. The mixed methods design has shed light on some critical factors
                that assist homes to manage some characteristic problems of access to external
                support: clinical leadership, clear understanding and vision about the need to
                improve end-of-life care, networking with GPs and other local staff and leverage of
                resources by one or two key external &#x2018;supporters&#x2019; have been
                shown to be particularly important. In addition, the introduction of frameworks or
                pathways of care appears to assist staff to progress in terms of practice
                development and education in palliative and end-of-life care, but this needs further
                study.</p>
      <p>The challenge of improving end-of-life care in care homes is usually described in
                terms of inadequacies in knowledge and training among care home staff. However,
                suggesting that training of care home staff will solve the issue of quality is a
                error of simplistic thinking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216310387964">40</xref></sup> Rather, attention should in addition focus on challenging those
                discriminative attitudes, beliefs and practices in the wider system that contribute
                to the isolation of nursing homes and enhancing the ability of homes to demonstrate
                leadership in practice development. Although this exploratory study has provided
                some insights into the complex social structural network surrounding nursing homes,
                much more work is needed to enable integration of nursing homes into the wider
                systems of end-of-life care and to enable collaboration across organizational,
                institutional and funding boundaries, so that patients receive a better quality of
                end-of-life care regardless of the care setting in which they are located. Moreover,
                end-of-life care management in care homes should be integrated with and seen as an
                extension of chronic disease management and rehabilitation; attention to one will
                improve the other and is likely to result in improved quality of life, pain and
                symptom management for residents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216310387964">11</xref></sup> regardless of any prognostic uncertainty about their status as
                &#x2018;dying&#x2019;.</p>
