      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacterium acts as a molecular sieve that allows the passage of ions and small hydrophilic organic molecules. This property is due to the presence of a major group of proteins, porins, which form diffusion pores (Jap and Walian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>; Koebnik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>; Achouak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2001</xref>; Schulz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2002</xref>; Nikaido <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2003</xref>). The first identified porins were OmpC and OmpF of the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, but at present specific and non-specific pore-forming proteins have been found throughout prokaryotes. The OmpA protein is also one of the major proteins in the outer membrane of <italic>E. coli</italic> (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>). Either a closely related homolog of this protein or a more distantly related relative has now been identified as a major protein in the outer membrane of a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. Although some porins, such as OmpC and OmpF from <italic>E. coli</italic>, exist as oligomers, OmpA is referred to as &#x201C;monomeric or slow porins&#x201D; (Nikaido <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2003</xref>). The resistance of OmpA to complete denaturation in solution containing SDS is reflected in a characteristic heat-modifiable migration of the protein on SDS-PAGE (Heller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1978</xref>). The N-terminal region of OmpA from <italic>E. coli</italic> is shown to cross the membrane eight times in antiparallel &#x3B2;-strands, and forms a small pore. The C-terminal domain is located in the periplasm, and binds to the peptidoglycan. Major physiological functions of the OmpA family proteins include maintenances of the structural integrity and morphology of the cell (Sonntag et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1978</xref>) and porin activity (Sugawara and Nikaido <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1994</xref>), as well as a role in bacterial conjugation or phage binding (Morona et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1984</xref>).</p>
      <p><italic>Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</italic> is a Gram-negative, acidophilic chemolithotrophic bacterium capable of oxidizing ferrous ion and/or reduced inorganic sulfur compounds and is utilized for industrial mining applications (Rawlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>; Rohwerder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>). Because the outer membrane of this bacterium is exposed to strongly acidic environments (pH 2&#x2013;3), a low pH can be observed in the periplasmic space (Guiliani and Jerez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>). Three major outer membrane proteins, having apparent molecular masses of 40, 30, and 20&#xA0;kDa, have been detected in <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> R2 (Rodriguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1986</xref>). The 40- and 20-kDa proteins were suggested to be porins and the 30-kDa protein was thought to be an OmpA family protein. The 40-kDa protein (Omp40) has been characterized in detail (Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1992</xref>; Guiliani and Jerez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>). A cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (Cyc2) has been detected in the outer membrane of iron-grown <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> and was reported to be involved in iron oxidation (Yarz&#xE1;bal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>). Tetrathionate hydrolase induced in the outer membrane of tetrathionate-grown <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> has been purified and characterized (Kanao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Thus, the outer membrane of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> is thought not only to act as a molecular sieve, but also to play important roles in the oxidations of ferrous iron and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds. Therefore, studies of the structure and function of the outer membrane proteins and their association with periplasmic and inner membrane proteins may give insights into the clarification of mechanisms involved in ferrous iron and sulfur oxidation, the two fundamental biological reactions important in the bioleaching.</p>
      <p>We have preliminarily characterized an OmpA-like protein (designated as FopA) detected in the outer membrane of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> NASF-1 (Kamimura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>). Although the N-terminal region of typical OmpA family proteins is shown to cross the membrane eight times in antiparallel &#x3B2;-strands and to be involved in a pore formation (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>), an analysis of the amino acid sequence of FopA has revealed that the N-terminal region was shorter than that of typical OmpA family proteins, such as OmpA and OprF from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;1). Therefore, the porin activity of FopA was not expected. The peptidoglycan-binding domain was conserved in the C-terminal region of FopA. Since the function of OmpA family proteins in <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> was not characterized in detail, FopA was characterized with emphasis on the modification by heat and the association with peptidoglycan, which are characteristics of OmpA family proteins.</p>

        <title>Amplification and cloning of the <italic>fopA</italic> gene</title>
        <p>The gene encoding FopA protein with or without a signal peptide was amplified by PCR using two primer pairs and genomic DNA of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> ATCC 23270 as a template. A forward primer (FopAFNdeI; 5&#x2032;-AGC CCA TATG GAC GGT GGC TAT GTG-3&#x2032;) and a reverse primer (FopARXhoI; 5&#x2032;-TAT TTG GCT CGA GAT TAC TGA ACG GTC TT-3&#x2032;) designed on the basis of the genome sequence data of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> ATCC 23270 were used to amplify <italic>fopA</italic> without the coding sequence for the signal peptide. LA <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (Takara Biotechnol., Shiga, Japan) was used to amplify the DNA fragment. The PCR reaction was as follows: 2&#xA0;min at 95&#xB0;C, followed by 30 cycles at 95&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;s, 56&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;s, and 72&#xB0;C for 90&#xA0;s, and then 6&#xA0;min at 72&#xB0;C. The PCR-amplified DNA fragments purified from agarose gel using a GENECLEAN Kit (Funakoshi Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). The nucleotide sequence of the inserted <italic>fopA</italic> was determined as described previously (Wakai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2004</xref>). After digesting the plasmid with <italic>Nde</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I, the <italic>fopA</italic> fragment was ligated into pET28a vector (Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA). The ligation product (pET-fopA) was used to transform <italic>E. coli</italic> NovaBlue and then <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) competent cells. The recombinant clones were selected on LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (30&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml).</p>
        <p>A primer pair, FopAFNcoI (5&#x2032;-TGA CCA TGG AAC ATA TTA AAG GCA TCA AAG-3&#x2032;) and FopARXhoI, was used to amplify <italic>fopA</italic> with the coding sequence for the signal peptide. The gene was cloned following the same procedure used to clone <italic>fopA</italic> without the coding sequence of the signal peptide, except that the PCR reaction was as follows: 2&#xA0;min at 95&#xB0;C, followed by 30 cycles at 95&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;s, 54&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;s, and 72&#xB0;C for 90&#xA0;s, and then 6&#xA0;min at 72&#xB0;C and that <italic>Nco</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I were used. The plasmid used to transform <italic>E. coli</italic> NovaBlue and then <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) competent cells was designated pET-sfopA.</p>

        <title>Synthesis and purification of recombinant FopA</title>
        <p>Cells transformed with pET-fopA plasmid were grown at 25&#xB0;C on LB medium until the culture reached an optical density at 600&#xA0;nm of 0.6, and the synthesis of His-tagged FopA was induced by adding 0.1&#xA0;mM isopropyl-&#x3B2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were further incubated for 5&#xA0;h and harvested by centrifugation (15,000&#xD7;<italic>g</italic>, 10&#xA0;min). The recombinant FopA was purified using a Ni-charged Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations. After washing the resin with phosphate/NaCl (PN) buffer (20&#xA0;mM phosphate, 0.5&#xA0;M NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 100&#xA0;mM imidazole, the bound protein (His-tagged FopA) was eluted with PN buffer containing 400&#xA0;mM imidazole. The solution was dialyzed in 10&#xA0;mM &#x3B2;-alanine&#x2013;SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup> buffer (pH 3.0) containing 200&#xA0;mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, centrifuged at 105,000&#xD7;<italic>g</italic> for 2&#xA0;h, and used for a preparation of the antibody and for in vitro assay for FopA&#x2013;peptidoglycan binding. The synthesis of FopA protein in cells transformed with the pET-sfopA plasmid was induced following the same procedure as described above.</p>

After identical centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in 10&#xA0;&#x3BC;l of Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE and boiled for 10&#xA0;min and proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with cold acetone. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (15,000&#xD7;<italic>g</italic>, 10&#xA0;min), similarly suspended in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10&#xA0;min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

        <title>Detection of outer membrane proteins having variable electrophoretic mobility</title>
        <p>The mobility of OmpA from <italic>E. coli</italic> decreases in polyacrylamide gel containing SDS when the protein is heated to 100&#xB0;C prior to electrophoresis. Protein showing such mobility is called as &#x201C;heat-modifiable protein&#x201D;. To detect outer membrane proteins having variable electrophoretic mobility, a solubilization of proteins from the outer membrane fraction is required prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Various detergents, such as 1% (w/v) <italic>N</italic>-dodecyl-&#x3B2;-<sc>d</sc>-maltoside, 1% (w/v) octyl-&#x3B2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, 5% (w/v) Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) Triton X-100, were used to solubilize proteins from the outer membrane fraction of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>. FopA was not solubilized by incubating the membrane fraction with the detergents described above at 25&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;h. Although FopA was solubilized by incubating the membrane with 5% SDS at 25&#xB0;C for 15&#xA0;min, a treatment with 2% SDS at 25&#xB0;C for 15&#xA0;min could not solubilize FopA. On the other hand, a treatment with 8% SDS at 25&#xB0;C for 15&#xA0;min dissociated a FopA complex. Therefore, outer membrane proteins of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> were extracted by incubating the membrane fraction in solution containing 5% SDS for 15&#xA0;min at different temperatures. The 40- and 30-kDa bands were not detected in the extracts prepared at a temperature of 40&#xB0;C or less, when the extracts without heating to 100&#xB0;C for 10&#xA0;min were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, lanes 1 and 3). They were detected in all extracts heated to 100&#xB0;C for 10&#xA0;min prior to electrophoresis and in extracts prepared at temperatures of at least 75&#xB0;C (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, lanes 2 and 4&#x2013;8).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins extracted from detergent-insoluble outer membrane fraction of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>.

        <p>The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 40- and 30-kDa proteins revealed that the proteins were a trimeric porin (Omp40) and an OmpA-like protein (FopA), respectively. The molecular mass estimated from the deduced amino acid sequence of FopA was 20,197&#xA0;Da, which was about 10&#xA0;kDa smaller than the apparent molecular mass determined by SDS-PAGE. The electrophoretic mobility of FopA in polyacrylamide gel suggested that it may be a heat-modifiable protein. If FopA was heat-modifiable, a distinct protein band with a molecular mass smaller than 30&#xA0;kDa should have been detected in the non-heat-treated extract and this band should disappear when the extract was heated to 100&#xB0;C prior to electrophoresis. However, the corresponding band was not clearly detected in the samples prepared at a temperature of 40&#xB0;C or less (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, lanes 1&#x2013;4), indicating that FopA is not a heat-modifiable protein.</p>

        <title>Immuno-detection of native FopA in outer membrane</title>
        <p>Since a band corresponding to the native form of FopA was not clearly resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), Western blot analysis using the antibody against the recombinant FopA was carried out. When the outer membrane fraction was incubated in 5% SDS solution at 25&#xB0;C for 15&#xA0;min and analyzed by Western blotting, the antibody reacted to a protein with the apparent molecular mass of about 90&#xA0;kDa. A protein with the apparent molecular mass of about 30&#xA0;kDa, corresponding to the molecular mass of the denatured FopA (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, lane 3), also weakly reacted to the antibody. The 90-kDa band disappeared and the 30-kDa band with a strong signal appeared in the sample heated to 100&#xB0;C (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, lane 4), indicating that FopA formed an oligomeric complex in the outer membrane of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>Western blot analysis of proteins in outer membrane fraction of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>.

        <p>Since syntheses of Cyc2 and tetrathionate hydrolase have been affected by substrates for growth, the amount of FopA in iron-grown or sulfur-grown cells was examined using Western blot analysis.

        <title>Interaction of FopA with peptidoglycan</title>
        <p>Since FopA has a peptidoglycan-binding domain in the C-terminal region, the protein is expected to be recovered in a peptidoglycan&#x2013;protein complex from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>. When 5% SDS was used to prepare the peptidoglycan&#x2013;protein complex, FopA was solubilized from the outer membrane fraction as shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Therefore, the peptidoglycan&#x2013;protein complex was prepared by incubating the membrane fraction (involving inner and outer membranes) in 2% SDS solution at 40&#xB0;C for 15&#xA0;min. Western blot analysis of the sample clearly revealed the involvement of FopA in the complex (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, lane 3). Two major proteins with apparent molecular masses of 50 and 40&#xA0;kDa were also detected in the complex (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, lane 2). The N-terminal sequences were determined to be LPSFARQ for 50-kDa protein and ADTSNADT for 40&#xA0;kDa protein. Blast searches revealed that the 50-kDa protein and the 40-kDa protein were Cyc2 (Yarz&#xE1;bal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2002</xref>) and Omp40 (Guiliani and Jerez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>), respectively.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#xA0;4</label><caption><p>Detection of FopA in peptidoglycan&#x2013;protein complex from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>.

A peptidoglycan (<italic>lane 1</italic>) prepared from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> ATCC 23270 were also analyzed. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue (<italic>lanes 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>) or subjected to Western blot analysis using the polyclonal antibody against the recombinant FopA (<italic>lane 3</italic>).

        <p>The recombinant FopA and the peptidoglycan prepared from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> were used to examine their interaction in vitro. The experiments were carefully carried out under the physiological pH (pH 3.0). When <italic>fopA</italic> without the coding sequence for the signal peptide was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> [BL21(DE3)], the recombinant protein was synthesized in cytoplasm in a soluble form. When the recombinant FopA was incubated with the peptidoglycan from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>, the protein was recovered in the pellet after an ultracentrifugation at 105,000&#xD7;<italic>g</italic> for 2&#xA0;h (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, lane 2). When 10&#xA0;&#x3BC;g of the recombinant FopA was used in the experiment, all the protein interacted with the peptidoglycan in the experimental condition employed. When 30&#xA0;&#x3BC;g of the recombinant FopA was used in the binding experiments, the protein was detected both in the supernatant and in the pellet obtained by the ultracentrifugation at 105,000&#xD7;<italic>g</italic> for 2&#xA0;h. FopA derived from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> ATCC 23270 was not detected in the peptidoglycan used in the experiment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, lane 3). The recombinant FopA was not also detected in the pellet resulting from the ultracentrifugation of the recombinant FopA at 105,000&#xD7;<italic>g</italic> for 2&#xA0;h (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, lane 4). When the recombinant SQR, lacking the peptidoglycan-binding domain, was used to discard a possibility of an unspecific binding of the recombinant FopA to the peptidoglycan, the binding of the SQR to the peptidoglycan was not observed. Therefore, the detection of the FopA protein in the pellet obtained by the ultracentrifugation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, lane 2) indicated a specific binding of the recombinant FopA to the peptidoglycan.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#xA0;5</label><caption><p>Interaction of recombinant FopA with peptidoglycan purified from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Most of the outer membrane proteins appear to be channel-forming proteins, and they are classified as porins and specific channels. Omp40 and FopA were detected as the major membrane proteins in the outer membrane of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>. Omp40 has been assumed to function as a specific channel, because it is a homolog of classical porins, OmpF and OmpC in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Guiliani and Jerez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>). On the other hand, FopA is thought to be an OmpA family protein based on the amino acid sequence.</p>
      <p>The apparent molecular mass of the FopA protein synthesized in <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> and the recombinant FopA protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> both appeared to be approximately 30&#xA0;kDa. This is larger than the molecular mass of approximately 20&#xA0;kDa predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence. The discrepancy between the apparent molecular mass determined by SDS-PAGE and that predicted for the mature protein has been reported in many outer membrane proteins. Some peptidoglycan-associated lipoproteins show this size discrepancy due to posttranslational lipid modification. RmpM from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> is also an OmpA-like protein with a short N-terminal region similar to FopA and does not show a heat-modifiable characteristic (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;1). Although RmpM has no modifiable N-terminal cysteine residue which could accept a lipidic moiety (Grizot and Buchanan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>), it shows the size discrepancy (Klugman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1989</xref>), similar to the FopA protein. This size discrepancy of the RmpM protein has been reported to be due to the unusual and unexplained electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide in the presence of SDS (Klugman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1989</xref>). Recently, a global analysis of gel mobility of proteins of the fission yeast proteome has been reported (Shirai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>). Hydrophilic and acidic proteins (those for which isoelectric points are less than 6.0) are thought to tend to exhibit mobility smaller than calculated. However, FopA is a hydrophobic (content of hydrophobic amino acid is 54.2%) and basic (p<italic>I</italic> is 9.5) protein and is not a lipoprotein. Therefore, we can not now clearly explain the reason for the size discrepancy of the FopA protein.</p>
      <p>Although most of the OmpA homologs have not been thought to exist as an oligomer, the major outer membrane proteins Pgm6 and Pgm7, which have a high degree of similarity to OmpA (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;1), in <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> have been demonstrated to form heterotrimers as a stable structure (Nagano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>). RmpM is also thought to stabilize the oligomeric state of the porins, PorA or PorB, by associating with the N-terminal region of RmpM in the outer membrane (Grizot and Buchanan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>). Since FopA is an OmpA-like protein and one of the major outer membrane proteins, it was expected to show a heat-modifiable characteristic and to function as a major anchor protein connecting outer membrane to peptidoglycan. Contrary to our expectation, FopA did not show a heat-modifiable characteristic (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, as expected, FopA was detected in the peptidoglycan complex (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), and the recombinant FopA showed the binding activity to the peptidoglycan prepared from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Although the two forms of FopA, probably monomeric and oligomeric forms, were detected by Western blot analysis in this study (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), the oligomeric form was thought to be the native and stable structure in the outer membrane of <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>. The detection of Omp40 and Cyc2 in the peptidoglycan&#x2013;protein complex from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> implied an association of FopA with these proteins. In contrast to the native FopA from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic>, the recombinant FopA did not form oligomeric structures in the <italic>E. coli</italic> membrane (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Since OmpA of <italic>E. coli</italic> exists as a monomer in the outer membrane, outer membrane proteins of <italic>E. coli</italic> may not have an ability to interact or associate with OmpA or OmpA-like proteins.</p>
      <p>Recently, an iron-oxidizing/oxygen-reducing supercomplex was isolated from <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> (Castelle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>). The complex contained almost all components necessary for the iron-oxidizing/oxygen-reducing activity and proteins necessary for the energy-consuming reduction of NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>, such as two cytochromes <italic>c</italic> (Cyc2 and Cyc1), a rusticyanin, an <italic>aa</italic><sub>3</sub>-type cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, and proteins in <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex. Besides the proteins, FopA and Omp40 were also detected in the supercomplex. Although Omp40 does not have a peptidoglycan-binding domain, Omp40 was detected in peptidoglycan&#x2013;protein complex in this study (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Since FopA was thought to exist as an oligomeric form in the outer membrane, detections of FopA and Omp40 in iron-oxidizing/oxygen-reducing supercomplex (Castelle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>) and the peptidoglycan&#x2013;protein complex (this study) implied the interaction of FopA with Omp40. Since FopA is one of the major proteins in the <italic>A. ferrooxidans</italic> outer membrane and is not expected for its channel-forming ability due to the short N-terminal region, FopA probably acts as a stabilizer of the iron-oxidizing/oxygen-reducing supercomplex by interacting with components of the supercomplex and with peptidoglycan.</p>
      <p>We have already reported that the synthesis of iron-oxidizing enzymes was repressed in sulfur-grown cells and the synthesis of tetrathionate hydrolase was induced in cells grown elemental sulfur (Wakai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2004</xref>; Kanao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed no significant difference in the amount of FopA in the outer membranes from iron-grown cells and sulfur-grown cells. Although a peptidoglycan&#x2013;protein complex was prepared from iron-grown cells and used in this study, tetrathionate hydrolase may be detected in a peptidoglycan&#x2013;protein complex prepared from sulfur-grown cells. Further studies are needed to make clear the contribution of FopA to stabilization of iron- or sulfur-oxidizing enzyme systems.</p>
