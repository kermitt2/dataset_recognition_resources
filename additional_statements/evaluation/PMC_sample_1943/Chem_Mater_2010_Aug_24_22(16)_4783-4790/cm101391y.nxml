        <p>Click chemistry offers highly selective and orthogonal reactions that proceed rapidly and under a variety of mild conditions with the opportunity to create highly defined and multifunctional materials. This work illustrates a strategy where step-growth networks are formed rapidly via a copper-free, azide&#x2212;alkyne click chemistry between tetrafunctional poly(ethylene glycol) molecules and difunctionalized synthetic polypeptides. The molecular weight of the polymer precursors (10, 15, or 20 kDa PEG) and the stoichiometry of reactive end group functionalities (1.5:1 to 1:1.5) provide control over the material cross-linking density, enabling elastic materials with tunable moduli (<italic>G</italic>&#x2032; = 1000&#x2212;6000 Pa). A sequential photochemically activated thiol-ene chemistry allows subsequent functionalization of the network through reaction with pendant alkene moieties on the peptide. Because the thiol-ene reaction is light-driven, the degree of modification is directly related to the dosage of light delivered to the system (0&#x2212;6 J cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>). We exploit this feature to create complex biochemical gradients of multiple peptides with well-defined magnitude and slope throughout the three-dimensional (3D) network. Since both reactions can occur in the presence of cells, this material ultimately enables independent and <italic>in situ</italic> tuning of biochemical and biomechanical properties of biomaterial networks, suggesting an avenue to direct cell function throughout specific regions within a 3D material.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>There is a growing interest in developing and utilizing peptide-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels for 3D cell culture applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Peptides are readily designed to incorporate integrin-binding epitopes (e.g., the fibronectin-derived RGD sequence),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> enzymatically degradable sequences (e.g., the collagenase-sensitive sequence GPQG&#x2193;ILGQ),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> growth-factor sequestering properties (e.g., the basic fibroblast growth factor-binding KRTGQYKL sequence),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> as well as additional bioactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> into otherwise bioinert hydrogel material formulations. The inclusion of peptides within cell-laden hydrogel matrices enables tailorability of a cell&#x2019;s microenvironment and potential control over the biological fate of encapsulated cells. Their ease of synthesis and purification render peptides as viable options for material functionalization. Additionally, peptides can be systematically engineered and modified with a variety of non-natural amino acids,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) ultimately enabling a greater level of synthetic biological control than their complex biomacromolecular counterparts.</p>
      <p>Taking lead from a variety of reactions originally developed for organic synthesis, many techniques have been utilized to incorporate peptides into hydrogel materials. Most commonly, monoacrylated PEG-<italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) is coupled to the N-terminal &#x3B1;-amino group to yield an acrylated peptide, which can be copolymerized within PEG acrylate-based polymer networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> The photoinitiated solution polymerization of these molecules yields hydrogel systems that are useful for cell encapsulation, but are quite heterogeneous and polydisperse in their cross-linking density.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) Alternatively, the Michael-type addition reaction has been used to generate step-growth networks which exhibit more uniform cross-linking densities, and do not require postsynthetic modification of the peptide sequence. In this reaction, cysteine-containing peptides (which include pendant thiols) are coupled to PEG with electron-poor olefin end groups (such as an acrylate or vinyl sulfone) under slightly basic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> More recently, a photoinitiated thiol-ene hydrogel platform, which combines the advantages of step-growth and photoinitiated polymerization has been used to form enzymatically degradable peptide-functionalized PEG gels, similar in structure to the Michael-addition reaction.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) Further, the spatial and temporal regulation of the photopolymerization affords an additional level of control over network formation. Finally, the mixed-mode polymerization of acrylates in the presence of thiols enables nonstoichiometric amounts of cysteine-containing peptides to be directly incorporated into materials.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>) The combination of chain and step growth mechanisms give rise to networks with unique structure, where polyacrylate kinetic chains are truncated with single peptides, but the amount of peptide functionalization directly influences network structure and resulting gel mechanics. Although the interest in and application of peptide-functionalized PEG gels continues to grow, we sought to use a combination of orthogonal reactions to first form peptide-functionalized hydrogels with defined structures and mechanical properties and then to modify subsequently these materials with user-defined biochemical functionalities without altering the underlying network structure.</p>
      <p>The recent advent of click chemistry, an organic paradigm for robust, highly efficient, highly specific reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> has led to novel means to create peptide-functionalized biomaterials.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) The orthogonal nature of these reactions ultimately allows for peptide introduction into materials both initially, as well as postgelation without altering the initial network structure.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>) The quintessential click reaction, the copper(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar Huisgen cycloaddition between azides and alkynes (CuAAC),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) has been utilized for peptide ligation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> modification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> macrocyclization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> and polymer grafting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Unfortunately, this reaction&#x2019;s catalyst, as with the majority of those reactions commanding &#x201C;click&#x201D; status, is cytotoxic and is unable to be performed in the presence of cells, thereby precluding its usage in the formation of peptide-functionalized materials for cell encapsulation. Recently, a novel cyclooctyne molecule (DIFO3) was developed whose ring strain and electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents give rise to an activated alkyne that reacts quickly with azides in the absence of a catalyst.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>&#x2212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> This strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) has enabled the application of the Huisgen reaction in living organisms to label glycosylation patterns in zebrafish and mice.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>) Similarly, the photoinduced thiol-ene reaction, a radical-mediated addition of a thiol across an olefin, has recently gained attention as an emerging click reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> In addition to being fully bioorthogonal and biocompatible, this reaction is advantageous in that it can be controlled spatially and temporally with the presentation of light.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) The cytocompatible nature of these two click reactions render them particularly well-suited for biomaterial synthesis and functionalization.</p>
      <p>Beyond simply creating peptide-functionalized hydrogels, we are interested in developing and exploiting these constructs to study 3D cell behavior dynamically. Recently, we introduced a two-component hydrogel system that is capable of directing and detecting 3D cell behavior at user-defined locations within the material.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>) This system, comprising a four-arm PEG tetraazide and a bis(cyclooctyne)-peptide, utilizes two orthogonal click reactions; one for hydrogel formation (SPAAC) and another for biochemical patterning (thiol-ene). Ultimately, this formulation leads to an ideal, step growth network that enables control of the material cross-linking density and the ability to introduce pendant biochemical functionalities through the photochemical thiol-ene reaction. Exploiting these chemistries, this manuscript sought to understand how the molecular weight and (non)stoichiometric reaction of the precursor molecules could be used to control the final material mechanical properties. Subsequently, we quantified aspects of the thiol-ene photocoupling reaction and demonstrate the advantages of the photochemical reaction in forming complex chemical gradients of multiple peptides within the same material with precise control over location and concentration. We expect that these unique gels will prove particularly beneficial in elucidating the unique role of mechanotransduction versus biochemical signaling on cell function in a well-defined 3D environment.</p>

          <title>Design of the Base Hydrogel Network</title>
          <p>To illustrate the utility that is afforded by multiple bioorthogonal chemistries, we have developed a two-component system that enables hydrogel formation with tunable mechanics. Here, a four-arm PEG tetraazide is reacted with a bis(DIFO3) difunctional polypeptide cross-linker in an aqueous environment to form a multifunctional hydrogel (Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref>). PEG is chosen because of its biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption. Additionally, the biophysical properties of the gel are readily tuned by altering the length of the PEG arms as well as the stoichiometric ratio of azide:alkyne on the PEG and peptide cross-linker, respectively. Biological functionality is introduced into the matrix backbone via the choice of the synthetic cross-linking peptide sequence. Here, we utilize a functionalized matrix metalloproteinase cleavable sequence (GPQG&#x2193;ILGQ) that is susceptible to secreted enzymes, enabling cell-dictated local network degradation and material reformation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>) Enzymatically degradable hydrogels enable cells to spread and migrate throughout the material and yield a significantly more viable population as compared to their nondegradable counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, by utilizing a synthetic peptide cross-linker with a pendant functional group, we are able to introduce additional chemical moieties into the material at later time points or in spatially defined regions.</p>

          <p>When the PEG tetraazide is mixed with the difunctionalized peptide, an end-linked polymerization occurs spontaneously and yields an idealized network with minimal defects and local heterogeneities. The nearly ideal structure of this system has been previously confirmed with rheological and magic-angle spinning NMR experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>) and agrees with previous work with click-based networks.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>) Though the gel is formed in just a few minutes, the reaction continues for &#x223C;1 h, at which point all previously detectable azide and cyclooctyne functional groups have been consumed. This formulation is fully cytocompatible and has been successfully used for the encapsulation of primary cells, as well as established cell lines, with high viability.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>)</p>

          <title>Effect of PEG Size and Network Connectivity on Mechanical Properties</title>
          <p>We first sought to determine the effects of different PEG molecular weights on the resulting hydrogel network structure and elasticity. For this, we synthesized 10, 15, and 20 kDa 4-arm PEG tetraazide, spanning a 2-fold range of average repeat units per arm (&#x223C;56, 85, and 113 respectively). The functionalized (&gt;95%) PEGs were then combined with a base peptide [AcK(DIFO3)RRGGK(alloc)GGPQGILGQRRK(DIFO3)-NH<sub>2</sub>] in a 13.5 wt % aqueous solution containing a stoichiometrically balanced amount of azide and alkyne moieties. After formation, these gels were allowed to equilibrate overnight in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) upon which rheological frequency sweep experiments were conducted to determine the shear elastic moduli of the constructs (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). In addition, equilibrium swelling ratios (<italic>q</italic>) were calculated as the mass of the swollen network divided by that of the dry system (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).</p>

              <p>Final mechanical properties are dictated by gel formulation. (a) The swollen hydrogel shear elastic moduli are easily tuned by changing the molecular weight of the PEG cross-linker (&#x25FB; = 10&#x2009;000 g/mol, &#x25B2;=15&#x2009;000 g/mol, &#x25CB; = 20&#x2009;000 g/mol). Alternatively, small stoichiometric imbalances between the gel-forming azide and cyclooctyne reactive groups also give rise to materials with a wide range of moduli. (b) Changes in gel formulation result in hydrogels with different equilibrium swelling ratios (in PBS). (c) The swelling ratio (&#x25B2;) and equilibrium shear moduli (&#x25CB;) data collapse onto a single curve for all conditions when normalized to cross-linking density. Data reported as mean &#xB1; std.</p>

          </fig>
          <p>The shear moduli and overall water content varied significantly between formulations and were found to be directly related to the swollen hydrogel cross-linking density (&#x3C1;<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). For these networks, the ideal cross-linking density during network formation (&#x3C1;<sub><italic>x</italic>,0</sub>) is equal to twice the concentration of PEG tetraazide multiplied by <italic>r</italic>, the ratio of azide to alkyne functionalities such that 0 &#x2264; <italic>r</italic> &#x2264; 1, because each arm of the PEG azide is attached to half an infinite chain.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>) The gels containing the lowest molecular weight PEG (10 kDa, &#x3C1;<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> = 0.023 mol/L) resulted in the highest moduli (6200 &#xB1; 280 Pa) and lowest swelling (6.6 &#xB1; 0.7), whereas those with the highest molecular weight PEG (20 kDa, &#x3C1;<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> = 0.0018 mol/L) gave rise to the lowest observed moduli (2500 &#xB1; 220 Pa) and highest swelling (17.9 &#xB1; 0.9).</p>
          <p>Because small stoichiometric imbalances can lead to significant changes in &#x3C1;<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, we quantified the changes in the elastic modulus and <italic>q</italic> for systems of varying ratios of azide to alkyne. Specifically, we created gels for each of the three PEG molecular weights (MWs) and the base peptide, this time varying the overall ratio of azide to alkyne functionality (1.5:1, 1.25:1, 1:1.25, and 1:1.5), and measured the resulting equilibrium swelling ratio (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) and shear moduli (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Here, we find that the overall network stiffness decreases rapidly as the formulation departs from 1:1 stoichiometry with relatively modest deviations from unity resulting in large changes in mechanical properties. With one of the reactive groups in excess, a network containing fewer overall cross-links is formed (as <italic>r</italic> &lt; 1). Again, with a lower &#x3C1;<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> in the system, we observe a lower elastic moduli and a higher swelling ratio (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). This trend is consistent through all chosen MWs of PEG and all stoichiometries.</p>
          <p>By comparing the obtained gel moduli and swelling ratios with that expected for a perfect system with a given &#x3C1;<sub><italic>x</italic>,0</sub>, the degree of network ideality can be estimated.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>) When two azide functional groups on the same PEG molecule react with both cyclooctyne moieties present on a given peptide, a primary cycle is formed. This defect fully removes the ability of the PEG molecule to form cross-links, rendering it to behave like a difunctional linker, and lowers the final moduli. Similarly, when the tetrafunctional PEG contains two primary cycles, it will no longer be connected to the network and becomes part of the sol fraction. For all formulations containing an equal ratio of azide to cyclooctyne functionality, we estimate the degree of network ideality (i.e., extent of cross-linking versus cyclization) to be &gt;90% (derivations and results for all formulations are given in the see the <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref>, Table S1).</p>

          <title>Effect of Peptide Sequence and Charge on Network Properties</title>
          <p>To determine the effect of the cross-linker composition on the hydrogel mechanical properties, we synthesized various peptides and gels were formed with each PEG tetraazide. We first sought to determine whether the order of amino acids in our peptide sequence had a significant effect on the gels&#x2019; resulting properties. We created a scrambled peptide sequence [Ac&#x2212;K(DIFO3)QGK(alloc)RIPGRRLGGRGQGK(DIFO3)-NH<sub>2</sub>], which contained all of the internal amino acids of the original sequence in a randomly rearranged order. We find that the equilibrated shear elastic moduli of these stoichiometrically balanced scrambled systems are statistically indistinguishable from those of the original peptide sequence (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Similarly, we were interested in determining the effect of overall peptide charge on moduli values. For this, we synthesized charge neutral [AcK(DIFO3)R<underline>E</underline>GGK(alloc)GGPQGILGQ<underline>E</underline>RK(DIFO3)-NH<sub>2</sub>] and negatively charged [-4, AcK(DIFO3)<underline>EE</underline>GGK(alloc)GGPQGILGQ<underline>EE</underline>K(DIFO3)-NH<sub>2</sub>] peptide variants to complement our positively charged (+4) base peptide. Here, we find that the resulting equilibrated moduli are not statistically different from one another for the 10 kDa PEG system (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). This is likely due to a charge-shielding effect of the buffered PBS solution that the gel imbibes. Ultimately, this enables the sequence of the peptide cross-linker to be altered without significant changes in gel mechanics under conditions for cell culture.</p>

          <title>Incorporating Biochemical Tunability into Base Hydrogel</title>
          <p>An additional benefit of using a synthetic peptide cross-linker to form our hydrogel network is that we are able to dictate precisely its sequence to include a variety of biological functionalities, as well as to include non-natural amino acids that enable additional modification of the system postgelation independent of the network mechanics. Here, we chose to include a photoreactive allyl ester within the peptide sequence via the commercially available Fmoc-Lys(alloc)&#x2212;OH amino acid, which enables relevant biomolecules to be covalently coupled pendant to the hydrogel backbone via the bioorthogonal thiol-ene click reaction (Scheme <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">2</xref>). Though allyloxycarbonyl (alloc) was originally designed as a selectively removable protecting group for peptide branch creation, it contains a vinyl group capable of undergoing the thiol-ene reaction with any thiol-containing molecule, including cysteine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> This protecting group is fully stable to Fmoc deprotection and trifluoroacetic acid peptide cleavage from resin.

          <title>Controlling Patterning Extent with Light Dosage and Initiator Concentration</title>
          <p>Upon swelling cysteine-containing peptides and photoinitiator into the preformed hydrogel, UV light was used to induce thiol-ene functionalization within the network. By varying the amount of photoinitiator present (1.1, 2.2, 4.4, and 8.8 mM Irgacure 2959, 2-hydroxy-1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]-2-methyl-1-propanone), as well as the total dosage of light imposed on the system (0.6, 1.8, 3.0, and 6.0 J cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>), we control the extent of ene conversion, ultimately dictating the patterning concentrations of peptide within our materials. Here, fluorescently labeled peptides (AF<sub>488</sub>-AhxRGDSC-NH<sub>2</sub> and AF<sub>546</sub>-AhxPHSRNC-NH<sub>2</sub>) are patterned into the network and the system&#x2019;s resulting fluorescence is used to quantify the resulting concentration range. For a given light dosage, we find that the degree of patterning scales roughly linearly with the photoinititiator concentration (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Similarly, for a given amount of photoinitiator, we find that the patterning concentration scales roughly linearly with the light dosage. Interestingly, the patterning concentrations for a given condition remains nearly constant throughout the full &#x223C;1 mm thickness of the gel (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Additionally, network mechanical properties in the form of swelling ratios and moduli remain unchanged throughout the patterning process (see the <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref>, Figure S1).</p>

Because only a small portion of the total ene functionality is consumed (&lt;5%) in any one of our patterning experiments, the [C=C] is taken as a largely unchanging constant, leaving <italic>R</italic><sub>p</sub> only as a function of [S&#xB7;] (i.e., pseudo-first-order reaction).

This result is consistent with our experimental findings. For example, for 4.4 mM I2959 a dosage of 6 J cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> results in 0.57 &#xB1; 0.03 mM patterning. Halving the dosage to 3 J cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> gives half the patterning (0.29 &#xB1; 0.02 mM) with the same I2959 concentration, while halving the amount of initiator to 2.2 mM I2959 with the same light conditions also results in half the patterning amount (0.30 &#xB1; 0.04 mM). Thus, the patterning concentration is observed to be roughly linear with light dosage and initiator concentration.</p>

          <title>Generation of Peptide Gradients Throughout Hydrogel</title>
          <p>Having established a relationship between light dosage and patterning concentration, we were interested in utilizing this information to create well-defined complex biochemical gradients within a hydrogel. Hydrogels were exposed to a linear gradient of light exposure generated by a moving photomask (see the <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref>, Scheme S1),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>) resulting in a linear gradient of AF<sub>488</sub>-AhxRGDSC-NH<sub>2</sub> patterning concentrations (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). By varying the rate of photomask coverage (0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 cm min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), the chemical gradient slope was precisely tuned (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). As only a fraction of the available alkene functionalities are consumed in any given patterning process, the thiol-ene process can be repeated to pattern multiple epitopes within a single sample. This was exploited to introduce sequential and independent gradients of arbitrarily chosen slope of multiple peptides (AF<sub>488</sub>-AhxRGDSC-NH<sub>2</sub> and AF<sub>546</sub>-AhxPHSRNC-NH<sub>2</sub>) within the same material (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). By shuttering the light as it is delivered to the system, stepped gradients are easily created (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). 3D biochemical gradients are of particular note to those interested in studying fundamental biological processes in vitro, including induced cell migration and alignment with RGD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>) and directed neurite extension with nerve growth factor gradients.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>)</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In conclusion, we developed a versatile click-based PEG/peptide hydrogel system whose biomechanical properties are precisely tuned by altering the cross-linking density and network connectivity of the system. This was accomplished by (1) changing the molecular weight of the PEG cross-linker and (2) off-stoichiometric network polymerization. In classic cell culture buffers, the sequence and charge of the peptide were found to have little effect on the mechanical properties of the gel. By incorporating a photoreactive alkene functionality pendant to the hydrogel backbone, we were able to exploit the thiol-ene click reaction for spatially controlled, full-thickness network functionalization of cysteine-containing peptides. We demonstrate that the degree of patterning within the network is directly proportional to the dosage of light imposed on the system as well as to the initiator concentration. Exploiting this finding, we used gradients of light to synthesize well-defined linear chemical gradients of defined slope throughout a gel. This process is fully additive, and gradients of multiple peptides are easily achieved. Though not explicitly demonstrated in this work, both network formation and subsequent patterning reactions are fully cytocompatible. As such, this system can be utilized to elucidate systematically the effects of individual chemical cues in addition to gradients of multiple cues on individual cell behavior, as well as to spatially direct 3D stem cell differentiation.</p>

Patterning concentrations were determined using confocal microscopy by comparing the fluorescence intensity at a point 200 &#x3BC;m below gel surface against a standard curve relating fluorescence intensity to that of gels swollen in known concentrations of the patterning agent (see the <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref>, Figure S11). Light dosage was calculated as the product of the intensity and the exposure time.</p>
