      <abstract>
        <p>Ethylene influences many processes in Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) through the action of five receptor isoforms. We used high-resolution, time-lapse imaging of dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings to better understand the roles of each isoform in the regulation of growth in air, ethylene-stimulated nutations, and growth recovery after ethylene removal. We found that ETHYLENE RECEPTOR1 (ETR1) is both necessary and sufficient for nutations. Transgene constructs in which the <italic>ETR1</italic> promoter was used to drive expression of cDNAs for each of the five receptor isoforms were transferred into <italic>etr1</italic>-<italic>6</italic>;<italic>etr2</italic>-<italic>3</italic>;<italic>ein4</italic>-<italic>4</italic> triple loss-of-function mutants that have constitutive growth inhibition in air, fail to nutate in ethylene, and take longer to recover a normal growth rate when ethylene is removed. The patterns of rescue show that ETR1, ETR2, and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE4 (EIN4) have the prominent roles in rapid growth recovery after removal of ethylene whereas ETR1 was the sole isoform that rescued nutations. ETR1 histidine kinase activity and phosphotransfer through the receiver domain are not required to rescue nutations. However, REVERSION TO SENSITIVITY1 modulates ethylene-stimulated nutations but does not modulate the rate of growth recovery after ethylene removal. Several chimeric receptor transgene constructs where domains of EIN4 were swapped into ETR1 were also introduced into the triple mutant. The pattern of phenotype rescue by the chimeric receptors used in this study supports a model where a receptor with a receiver domain is required for normal growth recovery and that nutations specifically require the full-length ETR1 receptor.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone that influences a number of processes in plants such as seed germination, abscission, senescence, fruit ripening, response to stress, and growth. In etiolated Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) seedlings, ethylene causes a number of changes including reduced growth of the hypocotyl and root, increased radial expansion of the hypocotyl, increased tightening of the apical hook, and an increase in root hair formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeles et al., 1992</xref>). Various studies have identified a number of components in the ethylene signaling pathway and led to increasingly refined models for signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Guo, 2007</xref>).</p>
    <p>Responses to ethylene in Arabidopsis are mediated by a family of five receptors called ETHYLENE RECEPTOR1 (ETR1), ETR2, ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 (ERS1), ERS2, and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE4 (EIN4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hua et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakai et al., 1998</xref>). The receptors are primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grefen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>) and have homology to bacterial two-component receptors that transduce signal via the autophosphorylation of a His residue in the kinase domain, followed by the transfer of phosphate to a conserved Asp residue in the receiver domain of a response regulator protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">West and Stock, 2001</xref>). The ethylene receptors in plants can be divided into two subfamilies. Subfamily I consists of ETR1 and ERS1 that are capable of His kinase activity whereas subfamily II includes ETR2, EIN4, and ERS2 that have Ser/Thr kinase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamble et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moussatche and Klee, 2004</xref>). ERS1 appears to be bifunctional and is capable of both His and Ser/Thr kinase activities depending on the assay conditions used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moussatche and Klee, 2004</xref>). The kinase domain but not receiver domain of ETR1 is required for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qu and Schaller, 2004</xref>). However, while ethylene may inhibit His kinase activity in ETR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voet-van-Vormizeele and Groth, 2008</xref>), His kinase activity is not needed for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qu and Schaller, 2004</xref>) but does have a role in growth recovery after ethylene removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>) and in regulation of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qu and Schaller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho and Yoo, 2007</xref>). The exact output of the receptors is still obscure, but genetic studies show that in the absence of ethylene, the receptors positively regulate CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1). CTR1 acts as a negative regulator of the pathway that in turn inhibits downstream components of the pathway, preventing ethylene responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kieber et al., 1993</xref>). When ethylene is added, the receptors become inactivated, which via an unknown mechanism inactivates CTR1 and releases downstream components from the inhibition by CTR1.</p>
    <p>All five receptor isoforms in Arabidopsis are involved in ethylene signaling and have overlapping roles in regulating various phenotypes such as growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hua et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall and Bleecker, 2003</xref>). However, it is now emerging that the five receptor isoforms are not entirely redundant in their roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall and Bleecker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seifert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O&#x2019;Malley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Plett et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) and in some cases a particular isoform has a unique role in controlling a trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plett et al., 2009b</xref>). This appears to be a general feature of ethylene signaling since certain receptors have a prominent role in controlling fruit ripening in tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) whereas other isoforms have little or no role in this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kevany et al., 2007</xref>). The basis for these nonoverlapping roles is unknown. We have previously used high-resolution, time-lapse imaging of seedlings growing in darkness to examine the role of each receptor isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2006</xref>). Using this system we obtained evidence that ETR1, ETR2, and EIN4 are important for rapid growth recovery after ethylene removal while ERS1 and ERS2 have little or no role in this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>). More recently we showed that ethylene stimulates nutational bending of Arabidopsis hypocotyls and root tips through the known ethylene signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, this phenotype requires the ETR1 receptor, but not the other receptor isoforms. Loss-of-function <italic>etr1</italic> mutations eliminated nutations while single loss-of-function mutants for the other receptor isoforms had no measurable effect on nutations. However, combinatorial loss-of-function mutations in the other receptor isoforms led to constitutive nutations in air. Thus, ETR1 appears to have a role in regulating nutations that is opposite to the other receptor isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>). In this study we characterized the receptor and receptor domain requirements underlying growth in air, ethylene-stimulated nutations, and recovery of growth after removal of ethylene and found that these phenotypes have different receptor and receptor domain requirements.</p>

        <title>ETR1 Is Both Required and Sufficient for Ethylene-Stimulated Nutational Bending</title>
        <p>We have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>) that <italic>etr1</italic> loss-of-function mutants, either alone or in combination with other receptor isoforms, are incapable of ethylene-stimulated nutations. This phenotype was rescued when these mutants were transformed with a full-length genomic <italic>ETR1</italic> transgene. In contrast, single loss-of-function mutations in the other receptor isoforms have no measurable effect on ethylene-stimulated nutations whereas loss of these other isoforms in combination leads to constitutive nutations in air; wild-type seedlings show no measurable nutations in air under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, unlike most phenotypes related to ethylene, a single receptor isoform is required. To determine if ETR1 alone is also sufficient for this phenotype, we examined quadruple <italic>ers1</italic>-<italic>3 etr2</italic>-<italic>3 ein4</italic>-<italic>4 ers2</italic>-<italic>3</italic> loss-of-function mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). These mutants were very stunted in growth and produced very few seeds (data not shown). As predicted from our previous results, we found that the quadruple mutant seedlings nutated constitutively in air (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Additionally, they nutated with slightly larger amplitude oscillations when treated with 1 &#x3BC;L L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> ethylene for 23 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). This indicates that ETR1 is not only necessary, but sufficient for ethylene-stimulated nutational bending in Arabidopsis hypocotyls.</p>

        <title><italic>ETR1</italic> Promoter-Driven Expression of Receptors and the Rescue of Seedling Phenotypes</title>
        <p>Earlier studies support a model where all five receptor isoforms regulate growth, while ETR1, ETR2, and EIN4 play the predominant roles in the rate of growth recovery after ethylene removal and only ETR1 is required for ethylene-stimulated nutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hua et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall and Bleecker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2006</xref>). To further delineate the roles of the various receptor isoforms in ethylene responses, we transformed <italic>etr1</italic>-<italic>6 etr2</italic>-<italic>3 ein4</italic>-<italic>4</italic> mutants with cDNA constructs for each of the receptor isoforms. This triple mutant was chosen because it has reduced growth in air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qu and Schaller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), exhibits very slow growth rate recovery after the removal of ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>), and fails to nutate in the presence of ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>). To investigate the possibility that differences in expression level or pattern could account for the different roles in ethylene signaling, cDNAs of all five receptor genes were placed under the control of the <italic>ETR1</italic> promoter. This approach has previously been used to investigate the roles of subfamily I and II receptors in growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). We quantitated transcript levels for each receptor transgene using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O&#x2019;Malley et al., 2005</xref>). This revealed that all receptor transgenes were measurably expressed with <italic>cETR1</italic> showing the lowest expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>We observed a very different pattern of rescue when we examined hypocotyl nutations. Wild-type (Col) seedlings nutated with an average peak amplitude of approximately 18&#xB0; when treated with 1 &#x3BC;L L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> ethylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The <italic>etr2</italic>-<italic>3 ein4</italic>-<italic>4</italic> double mutants had slightly smaller nutations while the <italic>etr1</italic>-<italic>6 etr2</italic>-<italic>3 ein4</italic>-<italic>4</italic> triple mutants had very small oscillations (less than 2&#xB0;). The triple mutant had similar amplitude oscillations whether ethylene was present (data not shown) and it was difficult to determine whether these small oscillations were true nutational bending, bending due to movement over the agar surface, or due to some other factor. Only the <italic>cETR1</italic> transgene rescued nutations yielding seedlings that nutated with an amplitude approximately 50% that of the wild-type or <italic>etr2</italic>-<italic>3 ein4</italic>-<italic>4</italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). None of the other transgenes rescued nutations and <italic>cETR2</italic> and <italic>cERS2</italic> might have inhibited nutational bending. These results support the idea that ETR1 has a unique role in controlling nutational bending and suggest that differences in expression patterns do not underlie ETR1&#x2019;s unique role.</p>
        <p>Earlier studies on Arabidopsis seedlings uncovered two phases of hypocotyl growth inhibition when 10 &#x3BC;L L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> ethylene was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Binder et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2007</xref>). The first phase of inhibition starts about 10 min after ethylene is added and lasts approximately 15 min when it reaches a new steady state. This new steady state lasts approximately 20 min when the second phase of growth inhibition occurs that further inhibits growth. A new steady-state growth rate is reached after approximately 20 min and lasts for as long as a saturating concentration of ethylene is present. When ethylene is removed, hypocotyl growth recovers to pretreatment rates in approximately 85 min. The time for growth recovery is increased in <italic>etr1</italic>, <italic>etr2</italic>, and <italic>ein4</italic> loss-of-function mutants (either singly or in combination) while <italic>ers1</italic> and <italic>ers2</italic> mutants have wild-type recovery rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>). In this study, none of the receptor loss-of-function mutants or receptor isoform transformants had measurably altered growth inhibition kinetics when ethylene was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C&#x2013;E</xref>). Consistent with our earlier work, the rate of growth recovery in the <italic>etr1</italic>-<italic>6 etr2</italic>-<italic>3 ein4</italic>-<italic>4</italic> triple mutant seedlings after treatment with 1 &#x3BC;L L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> ethylene was very slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The growth rate of these mutants failed to completely recover to pretreatment levels in the 5 h after the removal of ethylene. The <italic>etr2</italic>-<italic>3 ein4</italic>-<italic>4</italic> double mutants recovered approximately 2 h after removal of ethylene whereas wild-type seedlings recovered after approximately 75 to 80 min. Wild-type seedlings recovered slightly faster than recovery observed in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2007</xref>). This likely reflects the lower concentration of ethylene used in this study. Interestingly, the <italic>cETR1</italic>, <italic>cETR2</italic>, and <italic>cEIN4</italic> transgenes rescued rapid growth recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>) while the <italic>cERS1</italic> and <italic>cERS2</italic> transgenes failed to rescue rapid growth recovery or did so very poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
        <p>As noted above, the <italic>cERS1</italic> transgene failed to rescue nutations and rescued growth in air less than the other transgenes. This failure of the <italic>cERS1</italic> transgene to rescue all phenotypes does not appear to be caused by reduced levels of this transgene since it is actually expressed at higher levels than <italic>cETR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). To confirm that <italic>cERS1</italic> cannot rescue nutations, we examined <italic>etr1</italic>-<italic>7 ers1</italic>-<italic>2</italic> double mutants transformed with the <italic>cERS1</italic> transgene. For comparison, we studied double mutants transformed with the <italic>cETR1</italic> transgene. Prior research showed that both transgenes are expressed in this mutant background although <italic>cERS1</italic> is expressed at approximately 5 times the levels of <italic>cETR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). In agreement with this previous study, we found that both <italic>cETR1</italic> and <italic>cERS1</italic> fully rescue growth in air (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Our previous study revealed that <italic>etr1</italic>-<italic>7 ers1</italic>-<italic>2</italic> double mutants fail to nutate in the presence of 10 &#x3BC;L L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>). We obtained similar results in this study using seedlings treated with 1 &#x3BC;L L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> ethylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Transformation of these double mutants with the <italic>cETR1</italic> transgene rescued nutations while transformation with the <italic>cERS1</italic> transgene did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, even though <italic>cERS1</italic> is expressed at higher levels than <italic>cETR1</italic> in these double mutants and can fully rescue growth in air, it fails to rescue nutations. In contrast, <italic>cETR1</italic> rescues both phenotypes, indicating that there is a functional difference between the two receptor isoforms as suggested by a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

        <title>ETR1 His Kinase Activity and Phosphotransfer through the Receiver Domain Are Not Required for Ethylene-Stimulated Nutations</title>
        <p>The basis for this unique role of ETR1 in nutations remains to be determined. One possible mechanism underlying ETR1&#x2019;s unique role in nutations is suggested by the fact that only ETR1 has both a functional His kinase and receiver domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamble et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moussatche and Klee, 2004</xref>). Prior studies showed that ETR1 His kinase activity is not required for growth inhibition in the presence of ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>). Rather, ETR1 His kinase activity appears to have a role in growth recovery after removal of ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>) and in regulation of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qu and Schaller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho and Yoo, 2007</xref>). To determine the role of ETR1 His kinase activity in ethylene-stimulated nutations, we examined <italic>ers1</italic>-<italic>2 etr1</italic>-<italic>7</italic> double mutants and double mutants transformed with either a wild-type genomic <italic>ETR1</italic> transgene (<italic>gETR1</italic>) or a kinase-inactivated <italic>ETR1</italic> genomic clone (<italic>getr1</italic>-[<italic>HGG</italic>]). Col seedlings treated with 10 &#x3BC;L L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> ethylene nutated with an average peak amplitude of approximately 12&#xB0; while Wassileweskija (WS) nutated with an average peak amplitude of approximately 16&#xB0;; the double mutant failed to nutate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Transformation of the double mutant with <italic>gETR1</italic> rescued nutations as previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, transformation of the double mutant with the kinase-inactivated <italic>getr1</italic>-[<italic>HGG</italic>] transgene also rescued nutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). This shows that ETR1 His kinase activity is not required for ethylene-stimulated nutations. It is possible that there is residual His kinase activity present because the <italic>ers1</italic>-<italic>2</italic> allele is a knockdown rather than a knockout mutation. However, the <italic>ers1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> mutant is a knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qu et al., 2007</xref>) that nutates in the presence of ethylene.

        <p>Recently it was found that REVERSION TO SENSITIVITY1 (RTE1) specifically interacts with ETR1 to modulate ethylene responses in Arabidopsis as a positive regulator of ETR1, but does not regulate the other receptor isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Resnick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rivarola et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>rte1</italic> null mutants display phenotypes similar to <italic>etr1</italic> null mutants including reduced growth in air, ethylene hypersensitivity, and enhanced growth inhibition to application of ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Resnick et al., 2006</xref>). Because of this, we examined <italic>rte1</italic> null mutants for alterations in growth kinetics and ethylene-stimulated nutations to determine if RTE1 also modulates these phenotypes. <italic>rte1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> seedlings had growth inhibition kinetics indistinguishable from wild-type seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The rate of growth recovery was also unaltered in <italic>rte1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> seedlings. However, a growth rate overshoot that normally occurs during recovery in wild-type seedlings was absent in <italic>rte1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>).

        <title>ETR1 Domain Requirements for the Rescue of Seedling Phenotypes</title>
        <p>Our results point to a prominent role for ETR1 in both growth recovery and ethylene-stimulated nutations. To better understand the role of ETR1 in these phenotypes we created chimeric receptor cDNA constructs where domains from EIN4 were swapped for comparable domains in ETR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.110.170621/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>). Both single and multiple domains were swapped into ETR1. These constructs were all placed under the promoter control of <italic>ETR1</italic>. Since the receiver domains of ETR1, ETR2, and EIN4 may have a role in regulating certain responses, we also generated a truncated <italic>ETR1</italic> transgene lacking the receiver domain (<italic>cetr1</italic>-&#x394;<italic>R</italic>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows a schematic diagram for each construct used. Each chimeric transgene was transformed into the <italic>etr1</italic>-<italic>6 etr2</italic>-<italic>3 ein4</italic>-<italic>4</italic> triple mutant background. In general, at least three independent transgenic lines were generated and the transcript levels assessed by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). The locations of primers used for each chimera are shown above each diagram and the sequences for these primers listed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.110.170621/DC1">Supplemental Table S1</ext-link>). At least one line for each transgene showed detectable transcript, although, the chimeric construct containing the EIN4 GAF (cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases, adenylyl cyclases, and FhlA) domain (<italic>1411</italic>) had low levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). We examined rescue of growth for all transgenic lines and found that for transgene constructs that were capable of rescuing this phenotype, there was a correlation between transcript level and the amount of growth rescue (data not shown). Therefore, for each construct we chose the line with the highest expression level to examine the rescue of the various seedling phenotypes used in this study.</p>

Only <italic>1141</italic> produced a nonfunctional product (see below). In contrast to the rescue of growth, only two constructs (<italic>1411</italic>, <italic>4111</italic>) rescued nutations in the <italic>etr1</italic>-<italic>6 etr2</italic>-<italic>3 ein4</italic>-<italic>4</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). The level of rescue by <italic>1411</italic> and <italic>4111</italic> was poor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8B</xref>) and was approximately half of that observed with the <italic>cETR1</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Several of the chimeric receptors also rescued the rapid growth recovery rate in the triple mutant. These included <italic>1114</italic>, <italic>4411</italic>, <italic>1144</italic>, and <italic>4414</italic> that rescued the rate of growth recovery to comparable rates seen with the <italic>cETR1</italic> and <italic>cEIN4</italic> transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8C</xref>). Previously we showed that the phosphotransfer-deficient <italic>getr1</italic>-[<italic>D</italic>] transgene only partially rescued the rate of growth recovery of the triple mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>). Similarly, we found in this study that the truncated <italic>cetr1</italic>-&#x394;<italic>R</italic> construct lacking the receiver domain partially rescued rapid growth recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>1411</italic> construct also partially rescued this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). The low level of rescue could be due to the low expression levels of the <italic>1411</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). We examined two other independent transgenic lines containing the <italic>cetr1</italic>-&#x394;<italic>R</italic> or <italic>1411</italic> transgenes and found that they too had partial rescue of rapid growth recovery (data not shown). Three transgenes (<italic>4111</italic>, <italic>1141</italic>, <italic>1444</italic>) failed to rescue the growth recovery phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).</p>

C to E, Growth kinetic profiles for triple mutants transformed with chimeric receptors are shown. Seedlings were allowed to grow for 1 h in air, followed by the addition of 1 &#x3BC;L L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> ethylene (down arrow). Two hours later ethylene was removed (up arrow) and seedlings grown in air for an additional 5 h. Growth rate was normalized to growth rate in the air pretreatment and represents the average &#xB1; <sc>sd</sc> for at least four seedlings in three separate experiments. Lines were fitted by hand.

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Previous studies indicate that the five receptor isoforms have both overlapping and distinct roles in the regulation of growth by ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hua et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall and Bleecker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O&#x2019;Malley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). The basis for these roles is not clear. In this study we examined the receptor requirements that lead to regulation of growth in air, ethylene-stimulated nutations, and recovery of growth after the application of ethylene. We find that these traits have different receptor requirements and different ETR1 domain requirements. Of the three phenotypes examined in this study, the nutation phenotype has the strictest receptor requirements. In contrast, the receptor requirements for growth in air and rapid recovery of growth after removal of ethylene are not as strict. Results from this study also show that the receptors have redundant function during the initial growth inhibition responses to ethylene since none of the receptor mutants or transformants had any obvious alterations in the kinetics of the growth inhibition response upon application of ethylene.</p>
      <p>One interesting observation is that ETR1 is not only necessary, but sufficient to regulate ethylene-stimulated nutations. Two obvious differences between ETR1 and the other receptor isoforms are that ETR1 is specifically regulated by RTE1 and it contains both a functional His kinase domain and a receiver domain. While RTE1 is involved in the regulation of nutations, other mechanisms are also involved since the <italic>rte1</italic> null mutants still nutate in the presence of ethylene. <italic>RTE1</italic> belongs to a small gene family that includes <italic>RTE1</italic>-<italic>HOMOLOG1</italic> (<italic>RTH1</italic>) so it is possible that <italic>RTH1</italic> contributes to the regulation of ethylene-stimulated nutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Resnick et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, His autophosphorylation followed by phosphotransfer to a receiver domain is not involved in nutations even though the ethylene receptors are structurally related to bacterial two-component receptors that function by this mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">West and Stock, 2001</xref>). Thus, ETR1 His kinase activity is involved in rapid growth recovery after ethylene removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>) but not involved in either inhibition of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>) or stimulation of nutations by ethylene (this study).</p>
      <p>Current models of ethylene signaling suggest that the receptors stimulate CTR1 which, in turn, acts as a negative regulator of the response pathway. In these models, ethylene inhibits receptor output releasing the inhibition by CTR1. Hence, loss of ethylene receptors mimics the action of ethylene and causes constitutive ethylene responses in air. The observation that <italic>etr1</italic> loss-of-function mutants fail to nutate is opposite to what is predicted by these models. Paradoxically, combinatorial loss-of-function mutations in the other receptor isoforms leads to constitutive nutations in air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>). We previously proposed two hypotheses to explain this unique role of ETR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>). One hypothesis is that ethylene induces differential expression of ETR1 in the zone of bending. Prior research has shown that eliminating the ETR1 isoform results in lowered growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cancel and Larsen, 2002</xref>) so it is possible that lower expression of ETR1 on one side of the hypocotyl relative to the other side would lead to differential growth rates resulting in bending. Over time, the localized region of altered ETR1 expression moves causing nutational oscillations. A second hypothesis proposes that ETR1 has two functions with one function regulating growth and the other supporting nutations. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.</p>
      <p>To address these hypotheses, we examined the rescue of nutations in the <italic>etr1 etr2 ein4</italic> triple mutant by cDNA transgenes for each of the receptor isoforms. These were all placed under control of the <italic>ETR1</italic> promoter to investigate the possibility that differences in expression level or pattern could account for the different roles in ethylene signaling. Only the <italic>ETR1</italic> transgene rescued nutations, supporting our prior conclusions that ETR1 is required for ethylene-stimulated nutations. The other transgenes were expressed and produced functional receptors since all of them were able to rescue the reduced growth of the triple mutant and two of them also rescued the rapid growth recovery phenotype. The pattern of rescue for the nutation phenotype by the various receptor transgenes makes it unlikely that differential synthesis of ETR1 in the zone of bending plays a major role in regulating nutational bending. This does not rule out that ETR1 undergoes differential proteolysis leading to differential levels of receptor protein in the zone of bending. It is also possible that the spatial and temporal pattern of expression for another molecule that regulates ETR1 changes in the zone of bending upon stimulation with ethylene. One candidate for this is RTE1 (and perhaps RTH1) since it specifically regulates ETR1.</p>
      <p>Four general domains have been identified in ethylene receptors (ethylene binding, GAF, kinase, receiver), although, the specific functions for all of these domains have not been well elucidated. Truncated ETR1 receptors have been used in some studies to uncover roles for these domains. These have shown that the ETR1 kinase domain is likely to be required for signaling leading to growth regulation while the receiver domain is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gamble et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qu and Schaller, 2004</xref>). Even though the receiver domain of ETR1 is not required for growth inhibition caused by ethylene, it may control sensitivity to ethylene at low doses, suggesting subtle roles for this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qu and Schaller, 2004</xref>). However, the use of truncated etr1-1 receptors indicates that the requirement for the kinase domain might not be absolute and other domains are also involved in signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gamble et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2006</xref>). We used chimeric <italic>ETR1</italic>-<italic>EIN4</italic> receptor transgene constructs where various domains of EIN4 were swapped into ETR1 to explore the receptor domain requirements for the regulation of the traits examined in this study. Transforming the <italic>etr1 etr2 ein4</italic> triple mutants with these various constructs revealed differences in their ability to rescue the three phenotypes examined (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). The expression level for each construct was different, which can make interpretation of the results more complicated. However, there was no obvious correlation between the transcript expression level and the patterns of rescue.</p>
      <p>The ethylene-binding and GAF domains generally appear to be interchangeable between ETR1 and EIN4 to support normal growth in air and rapid growth recovery after ethylene is removed. These constructs do not rescue ethylene-stimulated nutations. It is interesting to note that swapping the EIN4 ethylene-binding domain into ETR1 resulted in a minimally functional receptor even though the ethylene-binding domains of EIN4 and ETR1 share a great deal of homology and both are capable of binding ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaller and Bleecker, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O&#x2019;Malley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). This could represent problems with proper protein folding, normal protein-protein interactions, or accelerated proteolysis. When the EIN4 ethylene-binding domain is swapped into ETR1 in combination with other EIN4 domains, a more functional receptor is formed that rescued growth in air and growth recovery, suggesting the EIN4 ethylene-binding domain is functional in these chimeric receptors. In contrast to the chimeric receptors that contained the EIN4 ethylene-binding and GAF domains, chimeric receptors containing the EIN4 kinase domain were minimally or nonfunctional. It is unclear why the constructs containing the EIN4 kinase domain were poor at rescuing phenotypes but this might reflect a structural requirement to have this domain completely in the EIN4 context for proper protein folding or protein-protein interactions. Alternatively, this could reflect a difference in enzymatic output since EIN4 has Ser/Thr kinase activity while ETR1 has His kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamble et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moussatche and Klee, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Most transgenes rescued both growth in air and rapid growth recovery after the removal of ethylene. However, the <italic>cetr1</italic>-&#x394;<italic>R</italic> transgene did not rescue the growth recovery rate very well. This coupled with the observation that the <italic>cERS1</italic> and <italic>cERS2</italic> transgenes also rescue this phenotype poorly and our prior results that <italic>ers1</italic> and <italic>ers2</italic> loss-of-function mutants have normal growth recovery kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>) points to a central role for receptors containing a receiver domain in regulating this phenotype. This is not surprising since our previous work showed that phosphotransfer through the ETR1 receiver domain is involved with normal growth recovery when ethylene is removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2004b</xref>). Downstream targets for phosphotransfer from ETR1 have yet to be determined however Arabidopsis contains response regulator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schaller et al., 2008</xref>) that are likely targets. The <italic>cetr1</italic>-&#x394;<italic>R</italic> transgene also does not rescue nutations, pointing to a central role for the receiver domain in regulating ethylene-stimulated nutations too. Additionally, most constructs containing the ETR1 receiver domain rescued nutations in the triple mutant while none of the constructs containing the EIN4 receiver domain rescued this phenotype. In contrast, most constructs containing a receiver domain from either receptor rescued rapid growth recovery after ethylene removal. Thus, it appears that the receiver domain of EIN4 can substitute for the ETR1 receiver domain for signaling that leads to growth recovery but not for signaling that leads to ethylene-stimulated nutations.</p>
      <p>In the case of the rate of growth recovery, this requirement for the receiver domain involves His kinase activity and phosphotransfer through the conserved Asp on the receiver domain while in the case of nutations, phosphotransfer is not involved. This suggests other functions for the ETR1 receiver domain. The receiver domain of ETR1 has been structurally characterized and has differences from other characterized receiver domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">M&#xFC;ller-Dieckmann et al., 1999</xref>). One such difference was noted in the &#x3B3;-loop that is thought to be important in molecular interactions. This loop could function in coupling between ETR1 and downstream signaling molecules. Thus, this structure might lead to interactions unique to ETR1 that lead to nutations. There is precedence for believing that ETR1 has unique interactions with other molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Urao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cancel and Larsen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2003</xref>). Sequence comparison of the receiver domains from ETR1, EIN4, and ETR2 reveals a number of nonconserved amino acid residues found only in the ETR1 receiver domain that could form the basis for this unique ETR1 function.</p>
      <p>While the ETR1 receiver domain is important for both the rate of growth recovery and nutations, we hypothesize that the entire ETR1 protein is required for normal nutations since most <italic>ETR1</italic>-<italic>EIN4</italic> chimeric transgene constructs fail to rescue this phenotype even though they rescue other phenotypes. The basis for ETR1&#x2019;s role in nutations is unknown. Recent studies showed that the ethylene receptors form complexes between isoforms and with other unidentified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Of particular note is that ETR1 formed complexes in a domain-dependent fashion with all the domains required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests a model where the whole ETR1 receptor is required to form protein-protein interactions that, in part, leads to signaling that stimulates nutations. The output of the receptors remains to be determined. The results presented above show that ETR1 has multiple roles in regulating seedling growth and development. The basis for these multiple roles is unknown but clearly each role has unique receptor and receptor domain requirements. Whether the mechanisms underlying these different roles for ETR1 involves multiple outputs from the receptor, modulation of receptor levels or localization, unique protein-protein interactions, or some combination of these factors remains to be determined.</p>

For the <italic>cETR1</italic> and <italic>cetr1</italic>-&#x394;<italic>R</italic> transgenes, primers were designed so that the wild-type <italic>ETR1</italic> RNA ran as a smaller product than the <italic>etr1</italic>-<italic>6</italic> gene product while the <italic>cEIN4</italic> primers were designed to give less amplification of the <italic>ein4</italic>-<italic>4</italic> gene product.

For the chimeric receptors, primers were designed with one primer within the sequence of <italic>ETR1</italic> and the other within <italic>EIN4</italic> sequence so that no product was detected in plants not expressing the specific transgene.</p>
        <p>RNA was extracted from 10 or more seedlings using the RNA plant extraction kit from Qiagen and DNA cleaned by the turbo DNase kit from Ambion. PCR amplification was carried out on 100 ng of RNAout using the one-step RT-PCR kit from Qiagen.

        <p>Time-lapse imaging of Arabidopsis hypocotyls was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Binder et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2006</xref>). Images of hypocotyls of etiolated seedlings were captured in the dark with Marlin CCD cameras (Allied Vision Technology) using infrared illumination.</p>
        <p>For growth response kinetics measurements, seedlings were treated for 1 h with ethylene-free air followed by 2 h with ethylene to examine the growth inhibition kinetics. This was followed by 5 h ethylene-free air to allow for growth recovery. Images were captured every 5 min for 8 h. To determine growth rate of the hypocotyl, the height in pixels of each seedling in each frame was analyzed using custom software written by Edgar Spalding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parks and Spalding, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Folta and Spalding, 2001</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Binder et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2004b</xref>). Basal growth rate in air was determined from the first hour of measurements prior to the introduction of ethylene. Experiments under all conditions were repeated in at least three separate experiments and at least four seedlings were measured.</p>
        <p>For nutational bending experiments, seedlings were treated with ethylene for 22 to 24 h and electronic images were captured every 15 min. The angles of hypocotyls were measured manually as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binder et al., 2006</xref>). Since nutations represent a sinusoidal oscillation of bending over time, the nutation amplitude was determined by measuring the change in angle from the peak of each oscillation to the midline of the sine wave. For each seedling, the peak nutational amplitude was determined. Experiments under all conditions were repeated in at least three separate experiments and at least six seedlings examined.
