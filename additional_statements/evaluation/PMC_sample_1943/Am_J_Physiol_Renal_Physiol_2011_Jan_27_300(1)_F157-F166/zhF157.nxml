      <abstract>
        <p>The mammalian kidney isoform of the essential chloride-bicarbonate exchanger AE1 differs from its erythrocyte counterpart, being shorter at its N terminus. It has previously been reported that the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH interacts only with erythrocyte AE1, by binding to the portion not found in the kidney isoform. (Chu H, Low PS. <italic>Biochem J</italic> 400:143&#x2013;151, 2006). We have identified GAPDH as a candidate binding partner for the C terminus of both AE1 and AE2. We show that full-length AE1 and GAPDH coimmunoprecipitated from both human and rat kidney as well as from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells stably expressing kidney AE1, while in human liver, AE2 coprecipitated with GAPDH. ELISA and glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) pull-down assays using GST-tagged C-terminal AE1 fusion protein confirmed that the interaction is direct; fluorescence titration revealed saturable binding kinetics with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> 2.3 &#xB1; 0.2 &#x3BC;M. Further GST precipitation assays demonstrated that the D<sup>902</sup>EY residues in the D<sup>902</sup>EYDE motif located within the C terminus of AE1 are important for GAPDH binding. In vitro GAPDH activity was unaffected by C-terminal AE1 binding, unlike in erythrocytes. Also, differently from red cell N-terminal binding, GAPDH-AE1 C-terminal binding was not disrupted by phosphorylation of AE1 in kidney AE1-expressing MDCK cells. Importantly, small interfering RNA knockdown of GAPDH in these cells resulted in significant intracellular retention of AE1, with a concomitant reduction in AE1 at the cell membrane. These results indicate differences between kidney and erythrocyte AE1/GAPDH behavior and show that in the kidney, GAPDH is required for kidney AE1 to achieve stable basolateral residency.</p>

    <p><sc>anion exchanger</sc> 1 (AE1), also known as band 3, is a Na<sup>+</sup>-independent Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>-transporting member of the <italic>SLC4</italic> gene family of anion exchangers. It plays critical roles in the regulation of intracellular and systemic pH, intracellular Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> levels and cell volume (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). AE1 is a polytopic plasma membrane protein that in mammals is expressed in erythrocytes (eAE1) and kidney (kAE1). kAE1 is normally located at the basolateral side of the acid secreting &#x3B1;-intercalated cell (&#x3B1;-IC) of the collecting duct (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Under the control of separate promoters, both AE1 isoforms are encoded by <italic>SLC4A1</italic>. The kAE1 promoter lies in intron 3, with an initiation codon in exon 5, resulting in humans in the absence of the first 65 amino acids that are present in human eAE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Mutations in <italic>SLC4A1</italic> affecting eAE1 and/or kAE1 are associated with hereditary spherocytosis (HS; a dominantly inherited disorder) and distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), respectively (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Notably, however, in most cases single mutations resulting in HS do not also produce dRTA, and vice versa. This suggests that for disease-causing mutations affecting the shared portion of AE1, the mechanisms involved in these two conditions must be different.</p>
    <p>AE1 is composed of a large cytosolic N-terminal domain, a central transmembrane region that is predicted to span the lipid bilayer 12&#x2013;14 times and is responsible for catalyzing one-for-one exchange of Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and a short cytosolic C-terminal tail. In humans, eAE1 is better characterized than kAE1. eAE1's N-terminal domain plays a cytoskeletal scaffolding role through binding to several proteins including ankyrin, protein 4.2, and protein 4.1, thereby contributing to maintenance of red cell shape and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The N terminus of eAE1 has also been reported to interact with various glycolytic enzymes, including GAPDH, aldolase, and phosphofructokinase-1, but the physiological significance of these associations remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Some, including GAPDH, have been shown to bind to eAE1 within the initial N-terminal portion that is missing from kAE1 and are reported not to interact with the N terminus of kAE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p>
    <p>Functions of the C-terminal tail of AE1 (AE1C) are less well understood than those of the other two domains. To date, the only reported binding partner for the AE1C domain is carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), but this remains controversial (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). We have demonstrated that kAE1, lacking the last 11 residues, corresponding to the R901X mutation in dRTA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), loses its normal basolateral targeting in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells without loss of anion exchange function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). This suggests that some basolateral targeting information is contained in the 11 residues at the extreme end of the AE1C domain, and this targeting is known to be dependent on the Y<sup>904</sup> residue within this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p>
    <p>However, the molecular basis of kAE1 targeting remains to be elucidated. To further explore the function of the C-terminal domain, we sought binding partners for AE1C. Parallel yeast two-hybrid assays were conducted using either AE1C wild-type (AE1C-WT) or AE1C lacking the last 11 residues (AE1C-&#x394;11) as bait to screen a human kidney cDNA library. We report here the identification of a new C-terminal binding partner, GAPDH, for kAE1. We demonstrate that this partnership contributes to the stable basolateral residency of kAE1 and that its characteristics differ from those of the N-terminal eAE1/GAPDH interaction.</p>

          <p>To express the C terminus of AE1 in bacterial cells, the coding sequence for the final 36 residues of human AE1 (AE1C-WT) 876LIFRNVELQCLDADDAKATFDEEEGR<underline>DEYDE</underline>VAMPV911 (residues at the start and end of this domain are numbered; underscored amino acids were mutated separately, as detailed below) was cloned into the vector pGEX-4T1. Site-directed mutagenesis of this construct was performed using a QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Base substitutions were separately introduced into codons 902&#x2013;903 (GATGAA&#x2192;GCTGCA), codon 904 (TAC&#x2192;GCC), or codons 905&#x2013;906 (GACGAA&#x2192;GCCGCA), which resulted in the amino acid changes D<sup>902</sup>E&#x2192;AA (AA1), Y<sup>904</sup>&#x2192;A (YA), or D<sup>905</sup>E&#x2192;AA (AA2), respectively. All inserts in constructs were amplified in-house by PCR and sequence-verified before use.</p>
          <p>The resulting glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-tagged AE1C-WT (GST_AE1C-WT) and mutant fusion proteins (GST_AE1C-AA1, GST_AE1C-YA, GST_AE1C-AA2, GST_AE1C-&#x394;11) were separately expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> BL21 cells and purified using glutathione Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). To remove the GST tag from GST_AE1C-WT, purified fusion protein was incubated with thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature for 8 h, and AE1C-WT was then HPLC purified as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p>
          <p>To express intact kAE1 in MDCK cells, cDNA encoding kAE1 was subcloned from pHM6-kAE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) into the vector pEGFP-C2 to create an N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged kAE1 construct. This tag does not affect kAE1 trafficking or activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The construct was subsequently cloned into the &#x394;pMEP vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) containing a metallothionine promoter for stable expression in mammalian cell lines and sequence-verified. MDCK cells were transfected with the &#x394;pMEP-GFP-AE1 vector using a Cell Line Nucleofection Kit L (Amaxa/Lonza) and, following selection in hygromycin B, were FACS sorted for GFP fluorescence. Cell lines expressing eGFP-kAE1 were maintained in media containing 200 &#x3BC;g/ml hygromycin B.</p>

          <p>Positive colonies were selected by blue growth on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/X-&#x3B2;-Gal plates. Library inserts were recovered from yeast by PCR and retransformed into Y187 in the pGADT7 vector (Clontech).

          <title>Coimmunoprecipitation.</title>
          <p>Immunoprecipitation assays, using human or rat kidney or human liver samples obtained from the Cambridge Human Tissue Bank (Protocols 99/078 and 03/279), were carried out essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Briefly, 80&#x2013;120 &#x3BC;g of each membrane sample were prepared and solubilized in buffer containing 10 mM Tris&#xB7;HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1.5% <italic>n</italic>-nonyl-&#x3B2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (n-NDG), and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). All steps were carried out at 4&#xB0;C unless otherwise stated. Twenty microliters of specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the C terminus of AE1 (residues 900&#x2013;911; gift of E. Martinez-Anso, Pamplona, Spain) or 40 &#x3BC;g of purified goat polyclonal &#x3B1;-AE2 antibody (sc-46710) raised against an epitope within the first 50 amino acids of AE2, which is absent from AE1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; personal communication) were added to the recovered kidney and liver supernatants, respectively, before overnight incubation. Fifty microliters of &#x3B1;-rabbit IgG-agarose beads (for &#x3B1;-AE1) or protein G-Sepharose beads (for &#x3B1;-AE2) were added, and incubated for 1&#x2013;4 h. The beads were then washed three times with <italic>buffer A</italic> [20 mM Tris&#xB7;HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>, and 0.3% n-NDG]; three times with <italic>buffer A</italic> containing 500 mM NaCl; and finally three times with <italic>buffer A</italic>. Bound proteins were eluted from beads by incubating in SDS sample buffer [0.175 M Tris&#xB7;HCl (pH 6.8), 5.14% SDS, 18% glycerol, 0.3 M DTT, 0.006% bromophenol blue] for 5 min at 95&#xB0;C (kidney) or 1 h at room temperature (liver), and supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with an &#x3B1;-GAPDH mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam) or the relevant precipitating antibody, according to standard methods.</p>
          <p>Immunoprecipitation assays using MDCK cells stably expressing kAE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) were carried out similarly, except cells were treated with or without 200 &#x3BC;M pervanadate for 30 min to maximize the phosphorylation state of AE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), then lysed in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris&#xB7;HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM PMSF, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail set V (Calbiochem), and 1% Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma). Supernatants were precleared and transferred to either protein G-agarose beads preloaded with the mouse monoclonal &#x3B1;-AE1 N-terminal antibody Bric170 (IBGRL, Bristol) or protein A-agarose beads preloaded with &#x3B1;-rbAE1Ct, a rabbit polyclonal &#x3B1;-AE1 C-terminal antibody raised against residues 881&#x2013;900 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), for 4 h followed by three washes with cell lysis buffer. Proteins immunoprecipitated with Bric170 or &#x3B1;-rbAE1Ct were probed on blots with the &#x3B1;-GAPDH antibody, &#x3B1;-rbAE1Ct, or &#x3B1;&#x2212;AE-PhosY<sup>904</sup> (a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to AE1 pY<sup>904</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p>

          <p>Full-length rabbit muscle-type GAPDH (Sigma), which shares 95% identity with human liver-type GAPDH identified by yeast two-hybrid assay, was first dissolved in 0.05 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>/NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 9.6) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, which was then immobilized onto a 96-well plate at 37&#xB0;C for 1 h. Uncoated GAPDH was removed by three washes with TBST (TBS+0.5% Tween 20), and nonspecific sites were blocked with blocking buffer (TBST+5% BSA) for 1 h at 37&#xB0;C. Recombinant GST_AE1C-WT protein dissolved in blocking buffer (range 0.01&#x2013;2 &#x3BC;g/ml) was applied and incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 1 h. GST replaced the GST fusion protein in parallel wells to evaluate nonspecific binding. After washing the wells six times with TBST, goat polyclonal &#x3B1;-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer was added and incubated for 1 h at 37&#xB0;C followed by six washes with TBST. For detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated &#x3B1;-goat IgG antibody (DAKO) was applied and incubated for 1 h at 37&#xB0;C. Following six washes in TBST, bound proteins were visualized using ABTS (22% mg/vol in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.0) containing 0.05% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. &#xC5;405 values were measured using a microplate reader (Anthos HTII).</p>

          <p>One hundred micrograms purified GST-tagged WT or mutant AE1C fusion protein was first immobilized onto glutathione Sepharose beads, followed by incubation overnight with GAPDH in PBST (PBS+2% Triton X-100) at 4&#xB0;C. GST replaced GST fusion proteins as a negative control. Beads were collected and washed three times with PBST, then three times with PBST containing 500 mM NaCl; and finally three times with PBST. Bound proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 3 min at 95&#xB0;C, and supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using the &#x3B1;-GAPDH antibody, and data obtained from three separate assays were quantified densitometrically using ImageJ software.</p>

Then, 0.5 ml of 2.8 &#x3BC;M GAPDH in PBS was titrated with either HPLC-purified AE1C-WT or synthetic AE1 C-terminal peptides (AE1C-Y<sup>904</sup>or AE1C-pY<sup>904</sup>) over the range 0.16&#x2013;7.28 &#x3BC;M. After each addition, the solution was allowed to equilibrate for 1 min before recording Trp fluorescence emission. Quenching of Trp fluorescence was analyzed using the F-F<sub>0</sub>/F<sub>0</sub> ratio (where F<sub>0</sub> and F are fluorescence intensities at 340 nm in the absence and presence of the AE1 peptides, respectively) plotted against peptide concentration using Origin (OriginLab software).</p>

          <p>Parallel yeast two-hybrid assays using AE1C-WT or AE1C-&#x394;11 as bait to screen a human kidney cDNA library yielded 2 clones of the 40 sequenced, which were both 100% identical to the full coding sequence for the human liver-type glycolytic enzyme GAPDH, with no other matches. Subsequent specific mating tests showed that they interacted with AE1C-WT but not AE1C-&#x394;11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), implicating the final 11 residues of AE1 (RDEY<sup>904</sup>DEVAMPV) as the binding moiety.</p>

          <title>GAPDH coimmunoprecipitates with intact AE1 in both human and rat kidneys and with AE2 in the liver.</title>
          <p>For in vivo verification, we first performed coimmunoprecipitation assays from human kidney membrane, as well as from rat kidney where immunocolocalization of the two proteins has previously been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We initially confirmed that eAE1 was undetectable in kidney membranes by Western blotting, (Supplementary Fig. S1A; all supplementary material for this article is available online at the journal web site) and also ascertained from the supplier that the AE2 epitope sequence is not present in AE1 (see <italic>Coimmunoprecipitation</italic>).</p>
          <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>, &#x3B1;-AE1 antiserum was able to coprecipitate GAPDH and AE1, indicating their potential association in human kidney (<italic>top left</italic>). GAPDH and AE1 similarly coimmunoprecipitated from rat kidney membrane (<italic>top right</italic>). Specificity of these assays was confirmed by the absence of GAPDH when the precipitating antibody was omitted (&#x2212; lanes). In addition, with the use of an &#x3B1;-AE2 antibody, GAPDH coimmunoprecipitated from human liver membrane with AE2 (<italic>bottom</italic>). Probing with the precipitating antibody confirmed the presence of AE1 or AE2 in the precipitated complex (Supplementary Fig. S1, B and C). AE1 is not expressed in the liver, whereas AE2 expression is ubiquitous. Importantly, both kAE1 and AE2 lack the N-terminal D<sup>6</sup>DYED and E<sup>19</sup>EYED motifs found in eAE1 that have been identified as sites for AE1/GAPDH binding in red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Hence, the association between GAPDH and kAE1 or AE2 indicates the presence of previously unrecognized binding site(s). Examination of the protein sequences shows only one similar motif in each of kAE1 and AE2, within their C termini: D<sup>902</sup>EYDE in AE1 and D<sup>1232</sup>EYNE in AE2. The C termini of AE1 and AE2 share 86% sequence similarity, including this motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). In addition, these findings suggest that association between GAPDH and the anion exchange protein family is a more general phenomenon than previously reported.</p>

          <title>Direct binding of GAPDH to AE1C-WT confirmed by GST pull-down analysis, ELISA, and fluorescence titration.</title>
          <p>Since coimmunoprecipitation suggests, but does not prove, a direct interaction between two proteins, we next performed a GST pull-down assay to confirm that GAPDH and AE1C-WT interact directly in vitro. GST-tagged AE1C-WT fusion protein was first expressed and purified (Supplementary Fig. S2, <italic>lane 2</italic>). Fusion protein immobilized on glutathione beads was incubated with GAPDH. Western blot analysis of washed and eluted proteins using &#x3B1;-GAPDH antibody clearly displayed the 36-kDa GAPDH band only in the GST_AE1C-WT sample and not with GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>), demonstrating a specific and direct interaction between GAPDH and AE1C-WT proteins.</p>

The binding affinity of the AE1C-WT/GAPDH interaction was calculated in vitro using fluorescence titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). The GAPDH monomer contains three Trp residues, whereas no Trp residues are present in AE1C-WT. GAPDH fluorescence was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of AE1C-WT when the proteins were excited at 295 nm. The observed fluorescence change was dependent upon the amount of AE1C-WT, as there was no change detectable when buffer alone was added (data not shown).

          <title>The D<sup>902</sup>EYDE motif in the AE1C domain is dominant in GAPDH binding.</title>
          <p>By analogy with the N-terminal motif in human eAE1 described above, D<sup>902</sup>EYDE (which is missing from AE1C-&#x394;11) is the likeliest candidate motif for kAE1's GAPDH binding. To investigate this, we expressed, purified, and confirmed the purity and specificity of various GST-tagged AE1C variants: AE1C-&#x394;11 to mimic the known disease-causing truncation; AE1C-AA1, AE1C-YA, and AE1C-AA2 mutants to disrupt the putative acidic motif, where AA1 and AA2 represent D<sup>902</sup>E&#x2192;AA and D<sup>905</sup>E&#x2192;AA, respectively, and AE1C-YA is Y<sup>904</sup>&#x2192;A (Supplementary Fig. S2, <italic>lanes 3&#x2013;6</italic>). We performed parallel GST pull-down analyses using each of the purified fusion proteins incubated with GAPDH. GST_AE1C-WT and GST alone replaced the mutant AE1C fusion proteins as positive and negative controls, respectively.</p>
          <p>Supernatants eluted from beads were analyzed by Western blotting using &#x3B1;-GAPDH antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>, representative of 3 replicate experiments). Blotting for GST confirmed equivalent protein loading in all lanes. Densitometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>), correcting for GST band intensity, demonstrated that the DEYDE motif is indeed important for GAPDH binding, with a major reduction in the amount of GAPDH pulled down by AE1C-&#x394;11 compared with WT (67 &#xB1; 8% reduction, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001 vs. WT). A small amount of binding was preserved by the proximal portion of the C terminus, probably reflecting the presence of a second acidic patch (LDADD). Looking at the DEYDE motif in more detail, we found the first DE pair plus the Y in the D<sup>902</sup>EYDE motif to be more important than the second, since the amount of GAPDH associated with AE1-AA2 was comparable to WT levels, whereas AE1C-AA1 or AE1C-YA both reduced binding by similar amounts as the truncation (72 &#xB1; 2.3 and 60 &#xB1; 5.3% reductions, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for either vs. WT).</p>

          <title>Phosphorylation of Y<sup>904</sup> of AE1 does not affect GAPDH binding.</title>
          <p>The C-terminal Y<sup>904</sup> within the DEYDE motif can be phosphorylated in both eAE1 and kAE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), and phosphorylation of the C terminus has been implicated in acute internalization of kAE1 in an in vivo cell culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). In red cell studies, Campanella et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) have shown that phosphorylation of Y<sup>8</sup> and Y<sup>21</sup>, located within the two binding motifs at the N terminus of eAE1 and not found in kAE1, displaced GAPDH from erythrocyte membranes. We therefore asked whether phosphorylation of Y<sup>904</sup> would affect the GAPDH/kAE1 interaction. MDCK cells stably expressing kAE1 and treated with pervanadate were used as the model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). After pervanadate treatment, very little kAE1 was immunoprecipitated using Bric155 (which only recognizes the unphosphorylated C terminus) compared with untreated cells or when the N-terminal antibody Bric170 was used (recognizing both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated C terminus; Supplementary Fig. S3). This confirmed that the majority of kAE1 is phosphorylated under these conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4<italic>A</italic></xref> shows that Y<sup>904</sup>-phosphorylated AE1 was immunoprecipitable using Bric170, as detected by pY<sup>904</sup>-specific antibody (&#x3B1;AE1PhosY<sup>904</sup>; <italic>middle</italic>), compared with the phosphorylation-independent &#x3B1;-C-terminal AE1 antibody (&#x3B1;-rbAE1Ct; <italic>top</italic>). Second, at steady state (i.e., without pervanadate), the &#x3B1;AE1PhosY<sup>904</sup> antibody immunoblot revealed that no immunoprecipitable AE1 detected by &#x3B1;-rbAE1Ct (<italic>top</italic>, &#x2212; lane) was phosphorylated at Y<sup>904</sup> (<italic>middle</italic>, &#x2212; lane). Third, GAPDH coimmunoprecipitated with kAE1 regardless of whether Y<sup>904</sup> was phosphorylated (<italic>bottom</italic>). These experiments were repeated using &#x3B1;-rbAE1Ct as the immunoprecipitating antibody and then probed with a monoclonal GAPDH antibody, and results were similar (data not shown).</p>
          <p>In addition, repeating the in vitro fluorescence titration assays using synthetic AE1 C-terminal peptide with or without Y<sup>904</sup> phosphorylation (AE1C-pY<sup>904</sup> and AE1C-Y<sup>904</sup>) displayed very similar binding kinetics to GAPDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), indicating maintenance of the interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of Y<sup>904</sup> does not diminish the capacity of GAPDH to bind to the AE1C domain. This implies a major difference between the GAPDH/AE1 interactions in red blood cells and the kidney.</p>

          <p>As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 <italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>, polarized MDCK cells stably expressing eGFP-tagged WT kAE1 demonstrate normal basolateral localization of the fusion protein, consistent with the GFP tag having no effect on kAE1 trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Using a specific canine siRNA, &#x223C;90% knockdown of GAPDH expression was achieved in these stable cells, whereas use of a decoy oligo bearing no homology to the canine genome had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). All media in these experiments were supplemented with pyruvate, as is routinely used to avoid energy losses following GAPDH depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). No significant viability difference was observed between control and knockdown cells. Amounts of ATP were the same in knockdown and control cells, respectively: 2.74 &#xB1; 0.38 and 2.64 &#xB1; 0.13 nmol/mg protein (<italic>P</italic> = 0.76), similar to those reported for cultured proximal renal tubular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p>

          <p>Total levels of kAE1 were similar in knockdown and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Immunolocalization demonstrated that following GAPDH knockdown, overall polarization was preserved in cell monolayers, as evidenced by preserved junctional ZO-1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). However, marked intracellular retention of kAE1 was observed in the knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>top</italic>), which we confirmed by surface biotinylation: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref> shows that minimal AE1 remained in the biotinylated (surface membrane) fraction of GAPDH-depleted cells compared with control cells. As a nonradioactive alternative to pulse-chase analysis, we performed a time course series at 4, 8, and 16 h after induction of AE1 expression, which in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref> also demonstrates that surface AE1 was low in knockdown cells at all time points. Since our preliminary studies indicated that plasma membrane expression of eGFP-kAE1 reaches steady state at 12&#x2013;16 h (Supplementary Fig. S4), these data imply that GAPDH is more likely to be involved in AE1 translocation to the membrane rather than simply in its retention, since in the latter case, levels of AE1 in knockdown and control cells would have been more similar to each other at the early time points. Taken together, these data indicate a requirement of GAPDH for kAE1 to achieve normal membrane residency in renal epithelial cells.</p>
          <p>To exclude the possibility that GAPDH knockdown exerted general effects on membrane targeting or cytoskeletal integrity, we also stained cells with &#x3B1;-E-cadherin, &#x3B1;-tubulin, and phalloidin. All three showed normal appearances in the GAPDH-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). The former indicates that more than one basolateral targeting pathway is present, and the latter two confirm preservation of actin filament and microtubule structures in these cells.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Although earlier work has shown that the distal portion of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of AE1 contains targeting information for both delivery of the protein to its proper functional location in polarized renal epithelia (which in health is chiefly on the basolateral membrane of &#x3B1;-IC) and for regulation of this localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), little has to date been reported concerning interacting proteins for this domain of the molecule. Our data introduce GAPDH not only as a novel binding partner for the C-terminal tail of AE1 but as a component of AE1's ability to achieve basolateral residency in polarized cells.</p>
      <p>In erythrocytes, the potential for an association of GAPDH with AE1 was in fact first proposed over 40 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Only recently, however, were molecular studies employed that suggested docking motifs for GAPDH on human eAE1, involving tyrosine-containing sequences D<sup>6</sup>DYED and E<sup>19</sup>EYED located separately in two tandem binding regions within the first 23 residues in the N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, this presents challenges for three reasons. First, although in murine studies, colocalization and association of GAPDH with AE1 have been observed in both rat and mouse erythrocyte membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and in vitro evidence also suggests association of GAPDH with rat erythrocyte membrane preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), neither of the two putative N-terminal GAPDH-binding motifs is conserved in the N terminus of either rat or mouse eAE1. Indeed, the absence of sequence conservation in this region of eAE1 is a common feature of many of the mammalian AE1 polypeptides. Second, a potential interaction between GAPDH and AE1 in the kidney was suggested by Ercolani et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) through observation that GAPDH colocalizes with kAE1 at the rat kidney &#x3B1;-IC surface in a manner very similar to that observed in erythrocytes, which is supported by our successful coimmunoprecipitation of the two proteins from rat as well as human kidney despite the absence of the N-terminal region and earlier experimental evidence that the isolated N terminus of kAE1 did not interact with GAPDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Third, Tsai et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) reported that peptides composed of varying numbers of N-terminal residues of human eAE1, and therefore containing both D<sup>6</sup>DYED and E<sup>19</sup>EYED motifs, showed only 1&#x2013;3% of the binding affinity for GAPDH displayed by whole erythrocyte ghosts containing intact eAE1. These observations, taken together with the several methods to confirm specificity that we report here, indicate that additional docking site(s) for GAPDH must exist within the AE1 polypeptide. The D<sup>902</sup>EYDE motif located in the last 11 residues forms an ideal candidate and is highly conserved across many mammalian AE1 orthologs and paralogs including those of the mouse and rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>), with complete conservation of the D<sup>902</sup>EY residues that we have shown to be important. In contrast, the eAE1 D<sup>6</sup>DYED and E<sup>19</sup>EYED motifs are not found outside human eAE1.</p>
      <p>A further suggestion of the biological importance of the C-terminal interaction between GAPDH and anion exchanger is provided by the ability of AE2 and GAPDH also to coimmunoprecipitate. AE2, which shares a C-terminal DEYNE motif highly similar to that in AE1C, is also a polarized epithelial membrane resident with a much more widespread tissue expression pattern. Thus the link between the anion exchanger and GAPDH, previously attributed to a part of the AE1 protein known not to be present outside the red blood cell, is also true for other tissues.</p>
      <p>In erythrocytes, which are end-differentiated, the functional significance of the AE1/GAPDH interaction is not clear. One hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) is that linkage of glycolytic enzymes to the erythrocyte membrane, partly through AE1, might function to assist in efficient deposition of ATP synthesized by glycolysis in a &#x201C;membrane pool.&#x201D; This compartmentalized energy could then be used to fuel neighboring ion pumps. Although this could also be happening in the kidney and in AE2-expressing epithelia, our demonstrations that the kAE1/GAPDH interaction neither regulates GAPDH glycolytic activity (unlike in red blood cells where in fact, binding actually diminishes GAPDH's glycolytic activity), nor is it altered by phosphorylation, imply a different role for the AE1/GAPDH interaction in the kidney. This is logical given that kAE1 membrane residency can be altered by endocytic recycling, whereas mature erythrocytes lack cellular machinery for endocytosis such that eAE1 remains in the membrane once inserted.</p>
      <p>Defective trafficking of kAE1 has been observed in in vitro investigation of a variety of C-terminal mutants including both naturally occurring dRTA-causing mutations and specifically engineered ones. These abnormalities include nonpolarized and/or apical membrane localization or intracellular retention, depending on the sequence alteration and the degree of polarization of the cellular system under study, and reveal that more than one targeting motif is present, even within the final 11 residues. For example, the kAE1&#x394;11 mutant was shown to either locate to both apical and basolateral membranes or accumulate uniquely in the apical membrane, depending on whether transfection of AE1 was transient or stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), while replacement of Y<sup>904</sup> by phenylalanine or alanine demonstrated prominent intracellular retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), as did deletion of the last four amino acids of kAE1 (our unpublished observations). All these studies confirm that the C terminus of kAE1 is critical for correct movement to its final destination, whereas the marked intracellular retention of WT kAE1 at all time points that we observed following reduction in GAPDH levels in this study delineates the first functional protein interaction described to date.</p>
      <p>While phosphorylation of AE1 and GAPDH binding can be seen as a means of spatial-temporal regulation of activity in red blood cells, our results suggest that in the kidney, movement of the whole complex presents an alternative mechanism. Indeed, since GAPDH remains bound to the kAE1 C terminus in the presence of phosphorylated Y<sup>904</sup>, there is potential for GAPDH localization to be regulated in tandem with kAE1 upon phosphorylation of kAE1. In support of this, similar kAE1:GAPDH band intensity ratios pre- and post-pervanadate treatment were observed on blots in all coimmunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and data not shown).</p>
      <p>Our finding of the involvement of GAPDH in the normal cellular behavior of kAE1 adds to the expanding repertoire of possible functions for GAPDH emerging from other mammalian studies, in addition to its essential role in the glucose metabolic pathway. These include participation in intracellular membrane transport, and fusion, microtubule bundling, and kinase activity (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In the renal epithelial cell system we have employed, we have not found evidence of the latter two properties. First, cellular morphology was well preserved following GAPDH knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>), and second, since kAE1 phosphorylation leads to its internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), the GAPDH knockdown would have been predicted to lead to membrane retention of kAE1, the opposite of our observation.</p>
      <p>There is, however, other supportive evidence for GAPDH's involvement in cargo transport, in vertebrate photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and in nuclear translocation in conjunction with Siah, an ubiquitin-E3-ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In addition, GAPDH has been implicated in the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport through direct interaction with both Rab-2 and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), although the latter is not borne out by our or others' studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Our results support a role for GAPDH in forward cargo transport, since knockdown of GAPDH resulted in less surface appearance of kAE1. However, since E-cadherin was normally located in knockdown cells, distinct pathways are required for basolateral membrane targeting of different membrane residents.</p>
      <p>The specific pull-down assays employing the R901X (AE1C-&#x394;11) tail construct suggested preservation of some GAPDH binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), whereas the original specific yeast two-hybrid test was positive only for the full-length construct. This difference could possibly result from differing detection limits between the very disparate techniques and systems. Although we cannot rule out the existence of an additional, low-affinity binding site in the C terminus of kAE1 or elsewhere on the molecule, it should be noted that the C-terminal tail of human AE1 contains a high percentage of acidic amino acids, with a pI value of &#x223C;3.8. The residual in vitro binding of R901X may therefore be explained by the presence of more proximal acidic residues, with the main binding being acid/tyrosine dependent, as shown by the results with DE902&#x2013;3AA and Y904A substitutions. To minimize possible nonspecific electrostatic interactions as pointed out previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), we have as described been careful to perform our assays with high-ionic-strength buffers incorporating detergents.</p>
      <p>Our data concerning direct binding of the C terminus of AE1 to GAPDH do disagree to some degree with those of Chu and Low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), who reported, as we have here, that the C terminus of AE1 did not inhibit GAPDH activity, but they did not achieve GST pull-down. We cannot address the difference between our findings and theirs as, unfortunately, supporting data and experimental methods for this latter point were not included in their report.</p>
      <p>In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that nonerythrocytic anion exchange and GAPDH are partnered, and in the kidney at least, that this is functionally important via AE1's C terminus.</p>
