          <title>Background</title>
          <p>A-kinase-anchoring proteins, AKAPs, constitute a family of scaffolds that play an essential role in catalyzing the spatial-temporal, dynamic interactions of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, tyrosine kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. We studied AKAP5 (AKAP79; MW ~47 kDa) and AKAP12 (gravin, SSECKS; MW ~191 kDa) to probe if these AKAP scaffolds oligomerize.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>In gel analysis and sodium-dodecyl sulfate denaturation, AKAP12 behaved with a MW of a homo-dimer. Only in the presence of the chaotropic agent 8 M urea did gel analysis reveal a monomeric form of AKAP12. By separation by steric-exclusion chromatography, AKAP12 migrates with MW of ~840 kDa, suggestive of higher-order complexes such as a tetramer. Interestingly, the N-(1-840) and C-(840-1782) terminal regions of AKAP12 themselves retained the ability to form dimers, suggesting that the structural basis for the dimerization is not restricted to a single "domain" found within the molecule. In either sodium dodecyl sulfate or urea, AKAP5 displayed a relative mobility of a monomer, but by co-immunoprecipitation in native state was shown to oligomerize. When subjected to steric-exclusion chromatography, AKAP5 forms higher-order complexes with MW ~220 kDa, suggestive of tetrameric assemblies.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Both AKAP5 and AKAP12 display the capacity to form supermolecular homo-oligomeric structures that likely influence the localization and function of these molecular scaffolds.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Discovery of a docking site for the regulatory subunits (<italic>i.e</italic>., RI/RII) of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA, A-kinase) was seminal in our understanding of the roles of A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) scaffolds in cellular signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. AKAPs not only dock PKA, but act as molecular "tool boxes" that are multivalent and capable of docking other protein kinases (protein kinase C and the tyrosine kinase Src), phosphoprotein phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases (PDE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], adaptor molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Two AKAPs, AKAP5 and AKAP12, that associate with the prototypic GPCR, the &#x3B2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (&#x3B2;<sub>2</sub>-AR), have been the focus of intense research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Herein, we examine these two members of the class of GPCR-associated AKAPs and explore the extent to which these proteins, whose structure is predicted to be natively unordered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], are capable of forming oligomers. The current work is the first to report that both AKAP5 and AKAP12 are not only capable of forming homodimers, but also of forming higher-order supermolecular homo-oligomeric complexes. Thus AKAP oligomerization adds a new dimension on how members of this class of scaffold molecules operate in cell signaling.</p>

        <title>Oligomerization of AKAP12</title>
        <p>We first sought to interrogate if oligomerization of AKAP12 could be detected using purified human AKAP12. Consequently, His-tagged human AKAP12 was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified by gel filtration chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Analysis of the expressed, purified AKAP12 in the presence of the denaturant SDS revealed a <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>of ~500 kDa, slightly more than twice the mass of that calculated (hAKAP12, MW = 191.5 kDa) based upon primary sequence alone (see protein staining, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The nature of the 500 kDa-<italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>species was made clear by performing the same analysis, but with prior sample treatment and SDS-PAGE separation performed in the presence of the chaotropic agent 8 M urea (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In the presence of 8 M urea, the apparent <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>of purified AKAP12 declined from ~500 kDa to ~250 kDa, emblematic of a monomeric form of this large AKAP. The results obtained of fixed gels, stained for protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>) were further tested using immunoblotting to detect the protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). Immunoblots of the resolved, transferred protein that were stained with antibodies to the His-tag confirmed the results of the protein staining (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). AKAP12 forms oligomers that are SDS-resistant. Homodimeric AKAP12 can only be disassembled by treatment and separation in 8 M urea, a strong chaotropic agent.</p>

        <p>Since we established the existence of AKAP12 oligomers using SDS-PAGE, we probed the upper limit size of AKAP12 oligomers. AKAP12 purified from <italic>E. coli </italic>was subjected to steric-exclusion chromatography on a high-resolution, wide-bore matrix operated by an AKTA FPLC system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A spark symmetrical peak of protein (A280) and of AKAP12 immunoreactivity (see blot inset) was resolved. Using a set of marker proteins of known <italic>M<sub>r</sub></italic>, we were able to size the AKAP12 supermolecular complexes with precision. The <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>of the AKAP12 was 830-850 kDa. AKAP12 appears to form oligomers greater than dimers, minimally trimeric or even tetrameric. This higher order assembly of AKAPs into supermolecular complexes is a novel observation.</p>

His-tagged AKAP12 was purified and then resolved by steric-exclusion chromatography performed on an AKTA FPLC fitted with HiPrep Sephacryl-S400 (16/60) column. The presence of supermolecular oligomers of AKAP12 was established by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of samples from the chromatography. The resolved, transferred proteins were stained with anti-AKAP12 antibodies.

        <p>We probed the same queries for AKAP12 expressed in mammalian cells. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells transfected with an expression vector harboring the human AKAP12 were collected, lysed, and the mobility of AKAP12 established by SDS-PAGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Homodimers of HA-tagged AKAP12 exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells were found to be resistant to SDS denaturation. By SDS-PAGE analysis, a ~500 kDa-<italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>immunoreactive band was obvious, whether the immunoblots were stained with anti-AKAP12 or anti-HA antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). When the samples were treated with and subjected to SDS-PAGE in the presence of 8 M urea, the <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>of the immunoreactive band of AKAP12 declined from ~500 kDa to ~250 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This ~250 kDa mobility is consistent with the MW calculated for the monomeric form of the scaffold protein from primary sequence.</p>

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected with an empty expression vector or one harboring either full-length AKAP12, AKAP12 N-terminal (1-938) or C-terminal (840-1782) regions. Whole-cell lysates of cells expressing either AKAP12 or one of the fragments were subjected to SDS-PAGE in the absence (A) or presence of 8 M urea (B). The resolved proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and subjected to immunoblotting, stained for AKAP12 or the HA-tag. The results displayed are representative of at least three separate experiments performed on as many separate cell cultures.</p>

          <graphic xlink:href="1750-2187-6-3-3"/>
        </fig>
        <p>We investigated if N-terminal (1-840) and C-terminal (840-1782) fragments of AKAP12 would retain the ability to form dimers, as observed with the full-length AKAP12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). Expression vectors harboring either the His-tagged N-terminal or the C-terminal region of AKAP12 were constructed, the protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and each of the two large fragments was purified by affinity chromatography. Protein staining of the N- and C-terminal fragments resolved by gel analysis in the presence of SDS reveals, remarkably, the homodimerization of both the N-terminal as well as the C-terminal fragments of AKAP12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In the presence of 8 M urea, however, the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of AKAP12 now can be resolved as monomeric forms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Immunoblotting of the His-tagged fragments resolved in SDS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>) confirms the identity of the species made visible by protein staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>), <italic>i.e</italic>., both AKAP12 fragments behave as dimers in SDS-PAGE. In the presence of 8 M urea, the N- and C-terminal fragments made visible by protein staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) likewise resolve as the monomeric forms, as made visible by immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>).</p>
        <p>The electrophoretic behavior of full-length human AKAP12, as well as the N- and the C-fragments was probed when these fragments were expressed in mammalian (HEK293) cells, rather than in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The expressed HA-tagged versions of the full-length AKAP12 (1-1782), the N-terminal fragment (1-938), and a C-terminal (840-1782) fragment of AKAP12 were subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting of the resolved proteins, and made visible by staining with anti-HA antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). In the presence of SDS, HA-tagged AKAP12 displays a <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>of a dimer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Immunostaining of the HEK cell extracts with anti-AKAP12 antibody likewise displays the same homodimeric character. When treated and resolved on gels in the presence of 8 M urea, either exogenously (probed with anti-HA immunostaining) or endogenously (probed with anti-AKAP12 antibody) expressed AKAP12 migrated with a <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>of a monomer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Both the N-terminal as well as the C-terminal fragments of AKAP12 expressed in mammalian cells displayed dimers in the presence of SDS (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and monomers in the presence of 8 M urea (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Thus we establish that the dimeric character of AKAP12 and these two large AKAP fragments reflects neither the presence/absence of tags nor whether the proteins are exogenously expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>or endogenously in mammalian cells, i.e., native AKAP12 oligomerizes.</p>
        <p>Since AKAP12 mediates recycling and resensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which mediate elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP, we sought to interrogate the effects of modulating cyclic AMP signaling pathway on the oligomerization of AKAP12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation in HEK293 cells by stimulation of the cells with beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, for 5 or 30 min had little effect on the mobility of AKAP12 on SDS-PAGE, ~500 kDa-<italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To test this possibility further, we examined the effect of mutating the three sites of protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of AKAP12 on the ability of the AKAP12 to form oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. AKAP12 mutated by alanine substitution of protein kinase A phosphorylation sites (Ser627Ala, Ser696-698Ala, Ser772Ala, labeled "AKAP12M3") was expressed in HEK293 cells, the cells treated without or with isoproterenol, and the <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>of AKAP12 established by SDS-PAGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). AKAP12M3 displayed the same <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>(~500 kDa) as native AKAP12, i.e., no change in dimer formation in response to stimulation of the cells with isoproterenol. Cells were then challenged with inhibitors to protein kinase A (KT5720), but also to cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4, Rolipram), and to MEK1/2 (PD98059). The first two inhibitors test cyclic AMP signaling by blocking protein kinase A and PDE4, respectively, The third inhibits MEK1/2, the enzyme through which the mitogen-activated kinase cascade (i.e., Erk1/2 activation) can be stimulated by beta-adrenergic activation, an AKAP-sensitive response (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Treating the cells with any one of these specific enzyme inhibitors did not noticeably alter AKAP12 oligomerization, i.e., the <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>(~500 kDa) of AKAP12 on SDS-PAGE was unaffected. Finally, we tested if the overexpression of either the N-terminal (1-938) or the C-terminal (840-1782) fragments in HEK293 cells would affect the formation of the SDS-resistant dimers of full-length endogenous AKAP12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The presence of neither fragment influenced the formation of the SDS-resistant dimers (<italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>~500 kDa) of AKAP12. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of AKAP12 expressed well in the HEK293 cells, although the expression of the later was more robust (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Oligomerization of AKAP5</title>
        <p>We sought to examine if the oligomeric behavior observed for AKAP12 would be observed in a second, much smaller, AKAP that docks to GPCRs, the AKAP5 (a.k.a., AKAP79; MW = 47.1 kDa versus 191.5 kDa for AKAP12, based upon primary sequence). His-tagged human AKAP5 was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified by affinity chromatography, and subjected to to SDS-PAGE in the absence or presence of 8 M urea (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In the presence of either denaturant, AKAP5 behaves as a monomer, although often as a doublet with <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>~75 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>). The microheterogenity of AKAP5 reflects, perhaps, differences in some post-translational modifications, particularly protein phosphorylation. The results of the protein staining were tested by immunoblotting of the AKAP with anti-AKAP5 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C, D</xref>). The immunoblotting and protein staining data for AKAP5 mobility on gels are in good agreement. Formation of SDS-resistant AKAP5 oligomers, as we had observed for AKAP12, was not observed.</p>

        <p>We sought to explore further the possible existence of AKAP5 dimers using somewhat less harsh conditions. HA-tagged AKAP5 was expressed transiently in HEK293 clones stably expressing GFP-tagged AKAP5 also. Pull-downs of HA-tagged AKAP5 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). In lysates of cells expressing two forms of exogenous AKAP5 (HA-tagged and GFP-tagged AKAP5), pull-downs of HA-tagged AKAP5 revealed the presence of the GFP-tagged AKAP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This observation clearly suggests that AKAP5, like AKAP12, oligomerizes. The possibility of dimerization/oligomerization of AKAP5 was interrogated also by <italic>in vitro </italic>analysis of AKAP5-AKAP5 binding making use of c-Myc tagged AKAP5 (expressed and purified from yeast) in combination with His-tagged AKAP5 expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. A c-Myc-tagged AKAP5/anti-Myc antibody that was coupled to protein G-agarose beads was prepared. As a control, protein G-agarose beads were similarly coupled with mouse IgG. The purified His-tagged AKAP5 was incubated with both types of derivatized protein G-agarose beads. Following incubation, the agarose beads were collected, washed, and analyzed for His-tagged AKAP5 bound to the c-Myc-tagged AKAP5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). AKAP5 forms oligomers. The ability of His-tagged AKAP5 to bind immobilized AKAP5 resolves the key issue. By making use of two different approaches with conditions less harsh that those tolerated by AKAP12, we were able to establish that AKAP5 oligomerized. Pre-treating cells for 45 min with enzyme inhibitors for MEK1/2 (PD98059) and PDE4 (Rolipram) had no effect on the ability of HA-tagged AKAP5 to bind GFP-tagged AKAP5 in pull-downs of the HA-tagged version (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>), as shown by the presence of the higher <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>GFP-tagged AKAP5 in the precipitate.</p>

        <p>We employed again steric-exclusion chromatography on a high-resolution, wide-bore matrix operated by an AKTA FPLC to probe for AKAP5 oligomers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

Immunoblotting revealed a peak displaying a <italic>M<sub>r </sub></italic>of ~220 kDa and a smaller second peak displaying a <italic>M<sub>r</sub></italic>. of ~44kDa, the monomeric form of AKAP5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Much like the supermolecular complex of AKAP12, the size of the oligomer of AKAP5 was consistent with that of an AKAP5 tetramer.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The current work reports on new and important properties of AKAP. First, AKAP5 and AKAP12 are shown by several analytical methods to form homodimers. The homodimers of AKAP12 are so avidly bound that only in the presence of the strong chaotropic agent 8 M urea are the dimers dissociated.</p>
      <p>Oligomers of AKAP5, less avidly bound to each other, were revealed through co-immunoprecipitation. AKAP5 is one-fourth the mass of AKAP12. Establishing the structural basis for the oligomerization of each scaffold will require additional studies. Second, AKAP5 and AKAP12 appear to form higher-order oligomers. Based upon steric-exclusion chromatography, the Mr of the AKAP5 oligomers is ~220 kDa, whereas that of the AKAP12 supermolecular complexes is ~840 kDa. The presence of higher-order oligomers for two GPCR-associating AKAPs suggests new and exciting possibilities for AKAP biology. Higher order protein-protein interactions, in which oligomers of AKAPs interact with other signaling molecules <italic>e.g</italic>., including GPCRs, serine/threonine protein kinases, tyrosine kinases, phosphoprotein phosphatases, cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase(s), <italic>et al</italic>., opens new possibilities for a fuller understanding of AKAP function. Not known is whether oligomerization of AKAPs (i.e., AKAP5 and AKAP12) precludes or includes the possibility of heterodimers/heterooligomers being formed between two different AKAPs. The presence of higher-order supermolecular complexes involving more than one AKAP would constitute a new and important dimension to AKAP biology.</p>
      <p>The nature of the interaction that promotes the formation of oligomers of AKAPs, remains to be established. The primary sequences of AKAP5 and AKAP12 have been examined in detail with a least one startling conclusion, i.e., the structures of these molecules are predicted to be largely "natively-unordered." FOLDindex<sup>&#xA9; </sup>predicts intrinsic unfolding based upon the average residue hydrophobicity and net charge in the protein sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Analysis using the FOLDIndex<sup>&#xA9; </sup>predicts human AKAP12 to be &gt;90% natively unordered primary sequence. By the same analysis, AKAP5 displays &gt;80% natively unordered sequence. This level of unordered structure is remarkable when one considers the number of proteins suspected to dock to AKAP12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Other members of the AKAP family, <italic>e.g</italic>., MAP2, also display major regions of natively unordered sequence. AKAP1, in contrast, displays much more ordered structure than AKAP12, AKAP5, or MAP2. By comparison, the Dishevelled scaffold proteins (3 isoforms in vertebrates) that operates in Wnt signaling display &gt;85% ordered and little natively unordered structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Dishevelleds displays DIX, PDZ, and DEP domains and many docking partners also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, the "natively unordered" primary sequence of AKAPs, like AKAP5 and AKAP12, must display docking sites quite unlike those found in DIX, PDZ, and DEP domains. The scaffolds are largely natively unordered, but yet must contribute to the ability of the scaffold to dock a myriad of signaling partners. Detailed studies of AKAP12 reveal the presence of the Receptor-Binding Domain for GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], docking sites for protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and for PDE4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] in regions that are largely considered to be "natively unordered". Reconciliation of these seemingly paradoxical observations regarding the unordered structure of AKAPs versus highly ordered structure of scaffolds like Dishevelled family members must awaited detailed structural analysis.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The current study demonstrates for the first time that both AKAP5 and AKAP12 display the capacity to form supermolecular homo-oligomeric structures that likely influence the localization and function of these molecular scaffolds. Thus AKAP oligomerization adds a new dimension on how members of this class of scaffold molecules operate in cell signaling.</p>
