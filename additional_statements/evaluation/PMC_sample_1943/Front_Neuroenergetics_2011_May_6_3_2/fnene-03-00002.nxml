        <p>Although numerous experimental data indicate that lactate is efficiently used for energy by the mature brain, the direct measurements of energy metabolism parameters during neuronal network activity in early postnatal development have not been performed. Therefore, the role of lactate in the energy metabolism of neurons at this age remains unclear. In this study, we monitored field potentials and contents of oxygen and NAD(P)H in correlation with oxidative metabolism during intense network activity in the CA1 hippocampal region of neonatal brain slices. We show that in the presence of glucose, lactate is effectively utilized as an energy substrate, causing an augmentation of oxidative metabolism. Moreover, in the absence of glucose lactate is fully capable of maintaining synaptic function. Therefore, during network activity in neonatal slices, lactate can be an efficient energy substrate capable of sustaining and enhancing aerobic energy metabolism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The mammalian brain is capable of utilizing various substrates and their combinations to cover energy demands. Many <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have demonstrated that besides glucose a number of compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, acetate, glutamate, glutamine, and others can also be oxidized by neurons (for review, Mangia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2009</xref>; Zielke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2009</xref>). Growing body of evidence indicate that lactate is effectively utilized as an energy substrate by activated brain neurons despite the presence of glucose (Schurr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>; Pellerin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2007</xref>; Barros and Deitmer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2010</xref>; Mangia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2009</xref>; Zielke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2009</xref>). The concept known as the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis postulates that during brain activation, a major part of the increase in glucose utilization is due to the astrocytic glycolysis triggered by a massive release of glutamate from synapses, whereas neurons mostly utilize lactate released from glial cells (Pellerin and Magistretti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1994</xref>; Pellerin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2007</xref>). While this hypothesis is still disputable (Mangia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2009</xref>), the overall idea of lactate utilization by activated neurons is progressively supported by the experimental results both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (Schurr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>; Pellerin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2007</xref>; Schousboe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2007</xref>; Barros and Deitmer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2010</xref>; Magistretti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2009</xref>; Mangia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2009</xref>; Zielke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2009</xref>). Importantly, it was recently directly demonstrated (Gallagher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2009</xref>) that the human brain is able to aerobically utilize lactate as an energy source (see also Mangia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2003</xref>; Maddock et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2006</xref>) and that plasma lactate is used by neurons and glia at a proportion similar to that of plasma glucose (Boumezbeur et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>Notably, measurements in the living brain have shown that extracellular concentrations of glucose and lactate in the cortex do not correspond to those of blood plasma and the extracellular levels of lactate may be comparable to or even higher than those of glucose (Langemann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2001</xref>; Abi-Saab et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2002</xref>; McNay and Sherwin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2004</xref>; Cavus et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2005</xref>; Zilberter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2010</xref>), suggesting that lactate is readily available to neurons. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies on adult animals have shown that lactate could be efficiently involved in energy metabolism during network activity in hippocampal slices (Galeffi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2007</xref>) and that lactate as the only energy substrate in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) could fully support synaptic function (Schurr et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1999</xref>). It has also been noted that traditionally high concentrations of glucose (10&#x2009;mM or more) in ACSF are not necessary and lowering glucose to 2.5&#x2009;mM, a level closer to physiological conditions, does not affect the robustness of evoked neuronal response (Schurr and Payne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2007</xref>). However, to support aerobic metabolism, the lower glucose concentration required sufficient oxygenation of slices. If this requirement was met, lactate as an energy substrate was more efficient than glucose because under aerobic conditions glucose is less capable of increasing mitochondrial respiration than lactate (Levasseur et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2006</xref>; Schurr and Payne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Lactate is commonly recognized as an important metabolic substrate during early development (Erecinska et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2004</xref>; Medina and Tabernero, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2005</xref>; Ward Platt and Deshpande, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2005</xref>). However, a very limited number of studies investigated the effects of lactate or other energy substrates (e.g., ketone bodies, pyruvate) on neuronal excitability. For instance, it was demonstrated that lactate and &#x3B2;-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) could maintain neuronal activity and the levels of high-energy phosphates in hippocampal slices of P4 and P7 rats, although these energy substrates could not support neuronal activity in older animals (Wada et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">1997</xref>). We have shown recently that supplementing glucose in ACSF with lactate, pyruvate, or BHB considerably hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential and reversal potential of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced currents (Holmgren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2010</xref>) in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal cells. These supplementary energy substrates significantly affected GABAergic synaptic transmission and spontaneous network oscillations, as well (Holmgren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2010</xref>). We suggested that additional energy substrates normalized energy metabolism deficiency caused by the use of traditional glucose-based ACSF.</p>
      <p>Other studies, however, argue that glucose alone can fully cover energy needs of neonatal neurons. Recent publications (Ruusuvuori et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>; Tyzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2011</xref>) claimed that the effects of energy substrates on neuronal activity were induced by the intracellular acidification, since energy substrates are weak acids. However, our study on the pH effects suggests that small acidification induced by additional energy substrates (about 0.05 pH units) should not cause strong changes in spontaneous network activity (Mukhtarov et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2011</xref>). The papers by Ruusuvuori et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>) and Tyzio et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2011</xref>) also asserted that none of the energy substrates are able to augment energy metabolism when added to the glucose-based ACSF, making glucose fully sufficient for neuronal metabolic function <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, the role of lactate in energy metabolism of neonatal neurons during network activity is unclear and this important issue requires further analysis and clarification.</p>
      <p>In the present study, to explore whether lactate added to glucose actively participates in energy metabolism in neonatal neurons, and whether lactate <italic>per se</italic> can maintain synaptic function, we evoked intensive network activity in hippocampal slices of the neonatal mice. Metabolic responses were evaluated by simultaneously measuring the intrinsic NAD(P)H fluorescence and tissue oxygen consumption. We find that during neuronal activity lactate is actively utilized and that lactate considerably elevates oxidative metabolic rate and maintains synaptic efficacy in neuronal networks.</p>

        <title>Tissue slice preparation</title>
        <p>Brain slices were prepared from P4&#x2013;P7 Swiss mice of both sexes. All animal protocols conformed to the French Public Health Service policy and the INSERM guidelines on the use of laboratory animals. The mouse was rapidly decapitated and the brain was removed from the skull and placed in the ice-cold ACSF oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The ACSF solution consisted of (in mmol/l): NaCl 124, KCl 2.50, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.00, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.30, and dextrose 10, pH 7.4. Saggital slices (400&#x2009;&#x3BC;m) were cut using a tissue slicer (Leica VT 1200s, Leica Microsystem Vertrieb GmbH, Germany). During cutting slices were submerged in an ice-cold (&lt;6&#xB0;C) cutting solution consisted of (in mmol/l): K-gluconate 140, HEPES 10, Na-gluconate 15, EGTA 0.2, NaCl 4, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Slices were transferred immediately to an oxygenated holding chamber maintained at 22&#xB0;C, and allowed to recover for 2&#x2009;h. Slices were then transferred to a standard round 1.5&#x2009;ml recording chamber and submerged (&#x223C;2&#x2009;mm) in ACSF buffer which was continuously superfused (15&#x2009;ml/min) and oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The temperature in the chamber was kept at 33&#x2013;34&#xB0;C for all experimental conditions.</p>

        <p>Shaffer collateral/commissural pathway was stimulated using the DS2A isolated stimulator (Digitimer Ltd, UK) with a bipolar tungsten electrode situated in the stratum radiatum of CA1 hippocampal region. Stimulus current was adjusted using single pulses (170&#x2013;240&#x2009;&#x3BC;A, 200&#x2009;&#x3BC;s, 0.15&#x2009;Hz) to produce a local field potential (LFP) of nearly 50% of maximal amplitude. LFPs were recorded using glass microelectrodes filled with ASCF, placed in stratum pyramidale, and connected to the DAM-80 amplifier (WPI, FL, USA). An extended synaptic stimulation consisted of a 10- or 30-s stimulus train (200&#x2009;&#x3BC;s pulses at 10&#x2009;Hz) was used to generate autofluorescence reduced pyridine nucleotide response.</p>

        <title>NAD(P)H fluorescence imaging</title>
        <p>Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) have very similar optical properties, and therefore it is expected that NADPH also contributes to some extent to total autofluorescence signals (Klaidman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">1995</xref>; Shuttleworth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2010</xref>). Changes in NAD(P)H fluorescence in hippocampal slices were monitored using a 290- to 370-nm excitation filter and a 420-nm long pass filter for the emission (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT, USA). The light source was the Intensiligh C-HGFI illuminator (Nikon Instruments Europe B.V., UK) equipped with a mercury arc lamp. Slices were epiilluminated and imaged through a Nikon upright microscope (FN1, Eclipse) with 4&#xD7;/0.10 Nikon Plan objective. Images were acquired using a linear, cooled 12-bit CCD camera (Sensicam, PCO AG, Germany) with a 640&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;480 digital spatial resolution. Because of a low level of fluorescence emission for this fluorophore, NAD(P)H images were acquired every 600&#x2013;800&#x2009;ms as 8&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;8 binned images (effective spatial resolution of 80&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;60 pixels). The exposure time was adjusted to obtain fluorescence intensity between 2000 and 3000 optical intensity levels. The images were stored on a computer as 12-bit files (0&#x2013;4096 dynamic range). Fluorescence intensity changes in stratum radiatum near sites of LFP and O<sub>2</sub> recordings were measured in three to five regions of interest using ImageJ software (developed by Wayne Rasband, NIH, USA). Data were expressed as the percentage changes in fluorescence over a baseline [(&#x394;<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>)&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;100]. Signal analysis was performed using IgorPro software (WaveMetrics, Inc, OR, USA).</p>

        <p>A Clark-style oxygen microelectrode (OX-10, tip diameter 10&#x2009;&#x3BC;m; Unisense Ltd, Denmark) was used to measure slice tissue PO<sub>2</sub>. The electrode was connected to a picoammeter (PA2000, Unisense Ltd, Denmark) and the cathode was polarized at 800&#x2009;mV in normal saline at 22&#xB0;C for up to 12&#x2009;h before the first use. A two-point calibration (in pA) was performed following polarization by inserting the electrode in normal saline solution (at 33&#xB0;C) equilibrated with either 95% O<sub>2</sub>&#x2013;5% CO<sub>2</sub> or ambient air. Calibrations were repeated after each experiment to determine the PO<sub>2</sub> values. The oxygen electrode was positioned using motorized micromanipulator (Scientifica Ltd, UK) in the proximity to the field potential recording electrode.</p>

        <title>Fluorescence pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> measurements</title>
        <p>Prior to measurements, brain slices were incubated for 15&#x2009;min in 10&#x2009;&#x3BC;M 2&#x2032;,7&#x2032;-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester form (BCECF-AM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) dissolved in standard ACSF solution at 32&#x2013;34&#xB0;C. Fluorescence images were acquired using a customized digital imaging microscope. Excitation of cells at 440 and 490&#x2009;nm wavelengths was achieved using a 1-nm bandwidth polychromatic light selector equipped with a 100-W xenon lamp (Polychrome II; Till Photonics, Germany). Light intensity was attenuated using neutral density filters. A dichroic mirror (495&#x2009;nm; Omega Optics, USA) was used to deflect light onto the samples. Fluorescence was visualized using an upright microscope (Axioskop; Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an infinity-corrected 60&#xD7; water-immersion objective (n.a.&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.9; LumPlanFL; Olympus, USA). Fluorescent-emitted light passed to a 16-bit electron multiplying charge-coupled device digital camera system (Andor iXon EM+; Andor Technology PLC, Northern Ireland). Fluorescence signals from the BCECF loaded CA3 pyramidal cells were acquired using Andor iQ software (Andor Technology PLC, Northern Ireland). The average fluorescence intensity of each region of interest was measured (usually five to seven BCECF loaded cells for each recording). Mean background fluorescence (measured from a non-fluorescent area) was subtracted and the ratio intensities (<italic>F</italic><sub>490</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>440</sub>) were determined. The duration of excitation was 10&#x2013;50&#x2009;ms at 30-s sampling interval. The real pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values were obtained from the previously published calibration curve (Holmgren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2010</xref>).</p>

        <title>Synaptic function of neonatal neurons in CA1 depends on oxidative metabolism</title>
        <p>It is commonly accepted that neonatal neurons, compared to the mature cells, are much more tolerant to hypoxic conditions (Cherubini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">1989</xref>; Haddad and Donnelly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1990</xref>), in part due to smaller energy needs (Kass and Lipton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1989</xref>; Nabetani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1995</xref>). In slices of mature animals, it has been shown that the efficacy of synaptic functioning (Garcia III et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2010</xref>) and network activity (Hajos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2009</xref>) correlates strongly with the level of tissue oxygenation. Whether synaptic function in the neonatal network depends significantly on oxidative metabolism or whether its energy needs can be covered by glycolysis alone is unclear.</p>
        <p>We used variable rates of ACSF perfusion to modify oxygen availability profile in 400&#x2009;&#x3BC;m thick slices of P6 mice (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;5) and measured simultaneously LFPs, induced by a single stimulation of Schaffer collaterals, and tissue oxygen levels. Firstly, we estimated the level of oxygen at different depths in the slice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). At a 3.25-ml/min perfusion rate, oxygen concentration strongly decreased (by about 50%) already at the slice surface. Following deeper penetration into the tissue, the oxygen level continuously declined and the slice was completely anoxic at the depth of about 200&#x2009;&#x3BC;m. An increase of perfusion rate up to 15&#x2009;ml/min allowed to maintain normoxic conditions at this depth and even deeper (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A).</p>

        <p>Importantly, the LFP values revealed a strong dependence upon the rate of perfusion, i.e., on the oxygen levels (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B,C). Indeed, a decrease in the perfusion rate from 15 to 3.25&#x2009;ml/min resulted in an about two-fold reduction of the LFP amplitude. Therefore, as in more mature neurons (Schurr and Payne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2007</xref>; Hajos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2009</xref>; Garcia III et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2010</xref>), the synaptic function of neonatal neurons during network activity profoundly depends on oxidative metabolism.</p>

        <title>During neonatal network activation, lactate modifies NAD(P)H profile, increases oxygen consumption, and maintains synaptic efficacy</title>
        <p>Here and in the experiments described below, the main experimental procedure included simultaneous measurements of field potentials, oxygen levels, and NAD(P)H fluorescence. These values were recorded both during periodic (every 7&#x2009;s) single stimulations of Schaffer collaterals and following a stimulation train (10&#x2009;Hz, 10-s or 30-s duration). Recordings started after stabilization of LFPs (normally about 20&#x2009;min) and in most cases two trials separated by about 20&#x2009;min were performed first in standard ACSF and then following a solution exchange (about a 30-min wash-in period). Importantly, in each experimental series, parameters measured in these dual trials did not differ significantly between each other, verifying that the parameters had been stabilized in control/test and the effects observed were not induced by some time-dependent variations.</p>
        <p>If glucose alone is sufficient to cover neuronal energy requirements during network activation (Ruusuvuori et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>; Tyzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2011</xref>), the addition of lactate to the extracellular solution should not be expected to modify the process of energy metabolism and synaptic functioning. We stimulated Schaffer collaterals (10&#x2009;Hz, 10-s train) and measured LFPs along with corresponding changes in the oxygen and NAD(P)H levels in the CA1 region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A shows original recordings of these parameters in a P5 mouse slice initially superfused with standard ACSF (10&#x2009;mM glucose) and then for 30&#x2009;min with a modified ACSF (5&#x2009;mM glucose&#x2009;+&#x2009;5&#x2009;mM L-lactate). Addition of lactate to ACSF increased the oxygen consumption during the train stimulation and radically modified the NAD(P)H signaling: the oxidation phase was strongly increased while the overshoot practically disappeared. Note that the decrease of glucose concentration in ACSF from 10 to 5&#x2009;mM alone did not induce a change in NAD(P)H signaling (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;3, data not shown). Interestingly, although responses to a single-pulse periodic stimulation (1/7&#x2009;s) and the first LFPs in response to a stimulation train were close in amplitude and had a similar slope (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B), the subsequent LFPs in the train displayed different dynamics and values, with those in the presence of lactate being significantly larger. This is confirmed by Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C which shows the integrals of each LFP in the train (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Materials and Methods</xref>) and indicates that postsynaptic responses during a stimulus train are notably larger in the lactate-containing ACSF.</p>

        <p>In five similar experiments, LFPs induced by a single stimulus in 10&#x2009;mM glucose or in 5&#x2009;mM glucose&#x2009;+&#x2009;5&#x2009;mM L-lactate did not differ in their integrals (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.5). Meanwhile, the average LFP integrals during the stimulus train (10&#x2009;Hz, 10&#x2009;s) were significantly larger (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) in the presence of lactate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). The average total LFP integral (summation of all LFP integrals during the train) was larger by 48&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;14% (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.02). The oxygen consumption (evaluated as an integral of a change in the oxygen level during 200&#x2009;s after the train onset) increased by 31&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;10% (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.04) with the amplitude of oxygen transient increased by 17&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;8% (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.04; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). NAD(P)H signaling in the presence of lactate revealed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C) an about sixfold increase in the oxidation phase area and about threefold decrease in the overshoot area. From these results we conclude that lactate, even in the presence of glucose, is substantially involved in the process of oxidative metabolism, increases its efficacy, and modifies synaptic function.</p>

        <p>One important question is whether in the neonatal slices, lactate can support energy metabolism and maintain synaptic function in the absence of glucose. Indeed, it has been shown in slices of mature rats that in aerobic conditions lactate is an efficient energy substrate capable for exchanging glucose (Schurr et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">1988</xref>). Therefore, we substituted 10&#x2009;mM glucose for 10&#x2009;mM L-lactate in the extracellular solution and compared the effects of this solution with those of standard ACSF. In addition, for testing the efficacy of lactate comparing to glucose, we extended the duration of stimulation train to 30&#x2009;s. This duration of the train was long enough to induce a progressive decay in LFP response at the end of stimulation.</p>
        <p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows an example recording from one of such experiments (P5 mouse). The integrals of LFPs for a single stimulation did not change significantly in either solution (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.4; <italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;10). However, the remarkable effect of lactate was revealed during the 30-s train stimulation. In the glucose-free lactate-containing solution, oxygen consumption considerably increased and the NAD(P)H profile thoroughly changed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A), as in the case of glucose&#x2009;+&#x2009;lactate-containing solution (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). LFPs in the train (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B) decayed faster and population spikes disappeared earlier in the glucose-containing solution. In both solutions, LFPs stabilized on the level that was significantly larger in the lactate-containing solution. This is also evident in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C showing the LFP integrals during such a stimulus train.</p>

We started the experiment with the lactate-containing solution (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;2, data not shown) and observed a reversed modification of NAD(P)H signaling following a solution exchange to standard glucose-containing ACSF &#x2013; namely, the decrease in oxidation phase and the appearance of the overshoot.</p>

        <title>&#x3B2;-Hydroxybutyrate as an oxidative energy substrate</title>
        <p>Another endogenous energy substrate, BHB, one representative of ketone bodies, is also a very important metabolic substance during the early development of postnatal brain (Erecinska et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2004</xref>; Nehlig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2004</xref>; Prins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2008</xref>). BHB, similar to lactate, can be involved in the oxidative energy metabolism (Fukao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2004</xref>) and, therefore, being added to glucose, could also modify the energy metabolism parameters during neuronal network activity.</p>
        <p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> demonstrates experiments in which we compared the effects of standard and modified ACSF (5&#x2009;mM glucose&#x2009;+&#x2009;10&#x2009;mM DL-BHB). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A shows the original recordings from a typical experiment (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;6). In the BHB-containing solution, the oxygen consumption was enhanced considerably and the NAD(P)H overshoot practically disappeared while the NAD(P)H oxidation phase strongly increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>Aa). However, opposite to the results seen in lactate, LFPs during the stimulus train did not change significantly (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>Ab,c). In six experiments, in the presence of BHB, the oxygen consumption (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C) increased by 28&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;12% (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.03) with the amplitude of oxygen transient increased by 12&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;7% (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.04). NAD(P)H signaling in the presence of lactate revealed an about threefold larger oxidation phase area and the absence of overshoot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>D). Meanwhile, neither the LFPs in response to a single stimulus nor the average total LFP integral in the train (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B, right) changed significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.2 and <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.15, respectively). The absence of a noticeable BHB effect on LFPs in spite of the obvious enhancement of oxidative metabolism may be explained by a recently reported BHB-induced inhibition of presynaptic vesicular glutamate transport (Juge et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2010</xref>, see Discussion). However, profound changes in NAD(P)H profile and oxygen consumption strongly suggest that despite the presence of glucose, BHB, as well as lactate, can be effectively involved in oxidative metabolism in neonatal neurons.</p>

        <title>Pyruvate effects confirm that glycolysis is not sufficient to support neuron energy requirements during intense synaptic activity</title>
        <p>Increase in the efficacy of synaptic function observed in the lactate-based ACSF suggests that this effect of lactate is caused by the enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation. If this is correct then pyruvate, which is believed to be the end product of neuronal aerobic glycolysis (see, however, Schurr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>; Schurr and Payne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2007</xref>), should induce similar effect. Therefore, we supplemented glucose with 5&#x2009;mM pyruvate in ACSF. The effects of pyruvate were similar to those of lactate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Pyruvate induced a strong increase in the NAD(P)H oxidation phase and almost completely eliminated the overshoot (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>Aa,D). Oxygen consumption during a 30-s stimulation train was significantly increased and LFPs were considerably larger especially during the second part of the train (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>Ab).</p>

        <title>Intracellular acidification cannot explain the effects of lactate and BHB</title>
        <p>As we reported previously (Mukhtarov et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2011</xref>), the addition of lactate to the extracellular solution induced a small acidification of the intracellular pH, in average by about &#x2212;0.05 pH units. Similar observations were obtained in the other recent study (Ruusuvuori et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>), where authors suggested that such small changes in pH underlie the lactate&#x2019;s effects on neuronal electrical activity (Ruusuvuori et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>; Tyzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2011</xref>). However, our results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> are difficult to reconcile with that suggestion. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A,B show the distribution of pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in the same CA3 pyramidal cells measured initially in standard ACSF and then either after addition of lactate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A; P4&#x2013;P6, seven slices, 48 cells) or replacement of glucose with lactate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>B; six slices, 33 cells). The values of pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> differed considerably between pyramidal cells, within the range from 6.8 to 7.8. Such a wide distribution of pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in the immature CA1 pyramidal cells has also been reported previously (Schwiening and Boron, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">1994</xref>; Bevensee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1996</xref>). Meanwhile, when compared with the overall range of pH values, a shift in the average pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values resulting from the exchange of solutions is relatively small, as depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A by vertical dashed lines. Clearly, in both solutions, a majority of neurons are exposed to the same range of pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values.</p>

        <p>Similar measurements have been performed with 5&#x2009;mM pyruvate supplemented to 5&#x2009;mM glucose in ACSF (data not shown; eight slices, 54 cells). Compared to standard glucose-based ACSF, the pyruvate-supplemented ACSF induced a shift in the average pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values of &#x2212;0.07 units while the values of pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> differed between pyramidal cells within the range of 6.8&#x2013;7.8.</p>
        <p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>C demonstrates similar pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> distributions measured in standard ACSF and after the addition of BHB to the external solution (six slices, 38 cells). As in the case of lactate, the distributions are wide with a relatively small shift in the pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> average values following the exchange. We, therefore, conclude as previously (Mukhtarov et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2011</xref>) that a small shift in the average pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> alone is unlikely to contribute significantly to the energy substrates effects.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The main finding of this study is that lactate is an efficient energy substrate in the neonatal hippocampus, especially during the intense neuronal network activity. In neonatal slices under sound aerobic conditions, whether combined with glucose or alone, lactate significantly enhances oxidative metabolism and efficiently supports synaptic function.</p>

        <title>Lactate as the energy substrate</title>
        <p>The role of lactate as an energy substrate in the mature brain is well established. Although the hypothesis of astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (Pellerin and Magistretti, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1994</xref>; Pellerin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2007</xref>) is still debated (for review, Mangia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2009</xref>), utilization of lactate by neuronal networks during their activation is strongly supported by experimental data from both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (Mangia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2009</xref>; Maddock et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2006</xref>; Schurr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>; Pellerin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2007</xref>; Barros and Deitmer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2010</xref>; Zielke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2009</xref>; Boumezbeur et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>Multiple biochemical studies in the immature brain indicated that high levels of both lactate and ketone bodies utilization are characteristic for early postnatal development (for review, Erecinska et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2004</xref>). However, attempts of the direct evaluation of correlation between energy metabolism and neuronal network activity in neonatal slices have been undertaken only in a few physiological <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Nabetani et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1995</xref>) has shown that population spikes in CA3 neurons of P4&#x2013;P7 rats were very tolerant to oxygen deprivation but sensitive to the lack of glucose &#x2013; population spikes disappeared within 15&#x2013;20&#x2009;min of glucose deprivation onset. Wada et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">1997</xref>) demonstrated that population spikes in slices and concentrations of ATP and creatine phosphate in slice&#x2019;s homogenate could be maintained after substitution of glucose with lactate and BHB.</p>
        <p>Recently, Ruusuvuori et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>) have concluded that lactate, being added to glucose, does not modify energy metabolism, is inefficient in oxidative phosphorylation and therefore glucose alone is able to completely satisfy neuronal energy demands. These authors confirmed the inhibitory effect of lactate on spontaneous network activity (giant depolarizing potentials, GDP; Ben-Ari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2007</xref>) in neonatal slices reported previously (Holmgren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2010</xref>). However, they suggested that the lactate-induced inhibition of GDPs resulted from a hypersensitivity of neuronal network activity to a small (average &#x2212;0.05 pH units) lactate-induced shift in the intracellular pH. In our recent study (Mukhtarov et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2011</xref>), we have shown that this explanation is unlikely to be valid since GDPs remained active even after a much stronger intracellular acidification (about &#x2212;0.3 pH units), with only a transient changes in GDPs frequency observed. In the present report, we substantiated our previous conclusion by demonstrating a large variation of pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values in different pyramidal cells of the same slice region (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>): these variations exceeded by 10-fold the average shift in pH<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> induced by lactate or BHB.</p>
        <p>In this study, concurrent recordings of field potentials and dynamic parameters of oxidative metabolism allowed us to analyze the correlation of neuronal electrical activity with changes in energy metabolism. Our results prove that lactate is readily utilized by neonatal neurons and that its efficiency as the aerobic energy substrate is superior to glucose. This conclusion is supported by the experiments with pyruvate supplemented to glucose in ACSF (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Indeed, experiments with a long-lasting periodic axon stimulation demonstrate that in both the lactate-based ACSF and pyruvate-containing ACSF, field responses significantly exceed those seen in the glucose-based ACSF and that the synaptic function is sustained for a longer time (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This data substantiates the point that neonatal neurons are flexible in utilization of various energy substrates in order to optimize the efficacy of overall network function. It is safe to suppose that <italic>in vivo</italic>, not only the mature but also the neonatal brain utilizes the optimal combinations of substrates, depending on the activity status.</p>

        <title>&#x3B2;-Hydroxybutyrate as the energy substrate in neonatal slices</title>
        <p>Similarly to lactate, BHB is a very important metabolic compound during postnatal development (Erecinska et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2004</xref>; Nehlig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2004</xref>; Prins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2008</xref>). In our experiments, supplementing ACSF&#x2019;s glucose with BHB significantly increased local oxygen consumption during network activity and strongly modified the NAD(P)H signaling profile (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). Therefore, in spite of the presence of glucose, BHB evidently operates as an oxidative substrate, significantly affecting energy metabolism.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to note the apparent absence of BHB effect on the population electrical activity. In the recent paper of Juge et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2010</xref>), the authors found that ketone bodies can effectively compete with chloride for a binding site on the vesicular glutamate transporters in excitatory presynaptic terminals, thus inhibiting glutamate uptake to synaptic vesicles. This unexpected finding can well explain why BHB, while showing similar to lactate modifications of energy metabolism parameters, does not affect synaptic function during the train stimulation. Indeed, a relatively high concentration of the substrate (10&#x2009;mM DL-BHB) could induce a partial inhibition of glutamatergic transmission that would oppose the metabolic boosting effect of BHB on transmission and apparently compensate for it. This interesting issue is outside the frame of the present study, although it well deserves further investigation.</p>

        <title>NAD(P)H transients during synaptic activity</title>
        <p>In neonatal slices exposed to standard ACSF, the profile of NAD(P)H signaling induced by synaptic stimulation was similar to that previously reported for more mature tissue (Turner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2007</xref>; Shuttleworth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2010</xref>): the oxidation phase followed by a pronounced overshoot. The origin of overshoot phase is still a matter of debate. The overshoot has been observed in the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies on anesthetized animals (Lewis and Schuette, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">1976</xref>; Dora et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1984</xref>) although in a smaller extent compared to slices (see, e.g., Rosenthal and Jobsis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">1971</xref>; Lothman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">1975</xref>; Mayevsky and Chance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2007</xref>). In the reports on <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, it has been suggested that the overshoot represents either rise in the cytosolic NAD(P)H associated with glycolysis (Lipton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1973</xref>; Kasischke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2004</xref>; Galeffi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2011</xref>) or has a mitochondrial origin (Brennan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2007</xref>). In the latter studies, however, a low solution superfusion rate was used (2&#x2009;ml/min) and the oxygen consumption that could affect the results obtained (see below) was not monitored. Our data are supportive of the cytosolic/glycolitic origin of the overshoot phase of NAD(P)H signaling since the overshoot was strongly reduced following the addition of energy substrates in ACSF. Another disputable matter is the contribution of glial glycolysis to the NAD(P)H signaling (Kasischke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2004</xref>; Shuttleworth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2010</xref>). That particular issue, however, is outside the frame of this discussion.</p>

        <title>Some methodological considerations on network activity measurements in slices</title>
        <p>In acute brain slices, the neurons&#x2019; distance to the slice surface varies and their respective extracellular environments can, therefore, diverge significantly. Here, we specifically focus on the oxygen delivery to neurons since energy substrates and oxidative phosphorylation (the principal ATP provider) cannot function properly under hypoxic conditions. The importance of sufficient oxygenation and the corresponding methodological approaches have been addressed periodically in studies utilizing brain slices of adult animals. For instance, in a submerged chamber allowing precise control of oxygenation, simultaneous measurements of population responses and oxygen tension in rat&#x2019;s CA1 slices (P27&#x2013;P40), which were superfused from both upper and bottom sides, revealed a strong dependence of population spike amplitude on oxygen levels (Garcia III et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2010</xref>). Schurr et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">1988</xref>) showed that at adequate oxygenation conditions, lactate maintained synaptic function in CA1 in the absence of glucose. The authors also lowered the concentration of glucose in ACSF down to 2.5&#x2009;mM without any noticeable changes in population response (Schurr and Payne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2007</xref>). Hajos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2009</xref>) showed in slices from P14&#x2013;P20 rat and mice that at the solution flow rate providing for adequate slice oxygenation (double-side perfusion), spontaneous sharp wave&#x2013;ripple oscillations as well as cholinergically induced fast oscillations occurred, resembling those in the <italic>in vivo</italic> hippocampus. These oscillations disappeared at lower rates of perfusion (about 2&#x2009;ml/min). Without a doubt, the oxygen level profile in a slice depends on the experimental design, e.g., the chamber construction, perfusion rate and slice fixation in the chamber, and should be verified especially in studies of multi-cellular activities to ensure the adequate conditions for energy metabolism are met.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this issue has not been typically taken into account as a methodical rule and has been practically ignored in studies on neonatal tissue. In part, this could be explained by a well-established fact of higher resistance of neonatal neurons to anoxic conditions. However, the concept of survival and the term &#x201C;normal functioning&#x201D; should not be considered interchangeable. Indeed, due to relatively small energy demands of neonatal neurons in a quiescent state, neuronal survival may be supported for a while solely by glycolysis, which provides two molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose, without any requirement in oxygen. This presence of anaerobic metabolism, however, does not necessarily mean that the energy-dependent processes during demanding neuronal activity would function normally without (or with reduced) aerobic metabolism that normally provides 32 molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose (Lehninger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2005</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our measurements show that at the depth of 150&#x2009;&#x3BC;m and with the flow rate of 3.25&#x2009;ml/min, the oxygen level is close to zero in the neonatal submerged slices under standard experimental design conditions (1.5&#x2009;ml round chamber, one-side perfusion). The oxygenation profile improved at the flow rate of 15&#x2009;ml/min that we subsequently used in our experiments. Importantly, the LFPs in response to a single stimulus depend rather strongly on the real-time oxygen levels, indicating that oxidative metabolism is indeed essential for the synaptic function in neonatal neurons. Evidently, the energy substrates such as lactate and BHB, for utilization of which sufficient oxygen delivery is mandatory, can reveal their metabolic effects on slices only under adequate experimental conditions. The variability or lack of energy substrates&#x2019; effects as reported in recent papers (Kirmse et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2010</xref>; Ruusuvuori et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>; Tyzio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2011</xref>), in which low ACSF superfusion rates (1.5&#x2013;3&#x2009;ml/min) during multi-cellular activity measurements have been used, is likely to be attributed to the inadequate oxygen supply.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The brain&#x2019;s energy pool is comprised of multiple energy substrates neither of which can be designated as being more or less important than the other. The rates of utilization of a specific substrate depend on the brain&#x2019;s ongoing needs as well as on substrate availability, both parameters varying within rather broad limits. The brain slice preparation is an undeniably artificial system that only roughly approximates the <italic>in vivo</italic> processes. We believe, therefore, that for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies it is imperative to overcome the disregard of the fundamental brain properties. Specifically, basic properties such as parameters of energy metabolism underlying neuronal excitability must be taken into account. Our present results demonstrate that lactate and BHB considerably affect energy metabolism in neonatal slices. Therefore, glucose is not and cannot be the only player in the complicated neuronal metabolic machinery. Underestimation of the role of lactate in energy metabolism of neonatal neurons can lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the fundamental properties of the developing brain. There should be careful consideration of this fact in further <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments as well as a more diligent approach to the metabolic aspect of <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.</p>
