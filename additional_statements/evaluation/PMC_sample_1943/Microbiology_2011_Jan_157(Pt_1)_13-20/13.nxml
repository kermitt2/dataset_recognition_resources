        <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), an important substance produced by many members of the genus <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, plays important roles in virulence and antagonism within a microbial community such as oral biofilms. The <italic>spxB</italic> gene, which encodes pyruvate oxidase, is involved in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in many streptococcal species. However, knowledge about its regulation and relation with other genes putatively involved in the same pathway is limited. In this study, three genes &#x2013; <italic>ackA, spxR</italic> and <italic>tpk</italic> &#x2013; were identified as contributing to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> by screening mutants for opaque colony appearance. Mutations in all three genes resulted in significant decreases in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, with 16&#x2013;31&#x200A;% of that of the wild-type. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was restored in the complemented strains. Antagonism against <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> by these three <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> mutants was reduced, both on plates and in liquid cultures, indicating the critical roles of these three genes for conferring the competitive advantage of <italic>S. sanguinis.</italic> Analysis by qPCR indicated that the expression of <italic>spxB</italic> was decreased in the <italic>ackA</italic> and <italic>spxR</italic> mutants and significantly increased in the <italic>tpk</italic> mutant.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is produced by many members of the genus <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Garc&#xED;a-Mendoza <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">Kreth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and is important in three aspects. First, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is reported to correlate with virulence in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">Auzat <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">Weiser <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> undergoes spontaneous phase variation resulting in opaque and transparent colony forms, and the differences in colony opacity correlate with virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">Weiser <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Recent research indicates that transparent variants are more proficient in colonization, with more production of teichoic acid and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but with less production of capsule than opaque variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Studies also suggest that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> acts as a potential virulence factor by exerting direct damage to host tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">Ginsburg &amp; Sadovnic, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">Ginsburg &amp; Varani, 1993</xref>). Second, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is related to competition and co-existence within microbial communities such as oral biofilms. Many streptococci are able to produce inhibitory substances such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to reduce the growth of co-resident micro-organisms. For example, <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> can produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that will inhibit growth of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">Uehara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic> demonstrate antagonistic activity against <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">Kreth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Other studies also investigated the inhibitory capacity of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by various species of oral streptococci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Garc&#xED;a-Mendoza <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">Kreth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">2008</xref>). Recently, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was also shown to contribute to the release of DNA from <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> and <italic>S. gordonii</italic>, which appears to support oral biofilm formation and facilitate exchange of genetic material among competent strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">Kreth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Third, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is a by-product of aerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">Jakubovics <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Many streptococci produce relatively large amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during aerobic growth by the action of oxidase enzymes such as pyruvate oxidase and NADH oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">Auzat <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">Tittmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p><italic>S. sanguinis</italic> is a member of the human indigenous oral microflora and one of the major microbes colonizing teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">Kuramitsu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">Rosan &amp; Lamont, 2000</xref>). It is also one of the most common causative agents of infective endocarditis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">Douglas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">Mylonakis &amp; Calderwood, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">Tleyjeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> is considered an antagonistic bacterium against <italic>S. mutans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">Becker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">Caufield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Relatively high proportions of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> are generally found in dental plaque with lower levels of <italic>S. mutans.</italic> High levels of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in the oral cavity correlate with low levels of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">Caufield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">Ge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008b</xref>).</p>
      <p>In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, the function of pyruvate oxidase (SpxB) in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production has been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">Weiser <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Pyruvate oxidase plays several critical roles in pneumococcal metabolism and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), including phase variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">Overweg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">Pericone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">2002</xref>). Though the genetic mechanism behind the phase variation has remained unclear, this morphological change has been successfully used in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to identify SpxR, a regulator of <italic>spxB</italic> required for <italic>spxB</italic> transcription and for full virulence in a murine model of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is involved in important metabolic pathways, potential pathogenic virulence, and interspecies competition, knowledge of its metabolic basis and regulation remains limited in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>. The <italic>spxB</italic> gene is involved in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">Weiser <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), but its regulation and relation with other genes putatively involved in the same pathway are still unclear. SpxB is a decarboxylase that catalyses the conversion of pyruvate, inorganic phosphate (Pi) and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and acetyl phosphate, which acts as a high-energy phosphoryl group donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>):<disp-formula id="e001"><inline-graphic xlink:href="13equ1.jpg"/></disp-formula>During a study of gene deletion mutants of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> SK36, we noticed that some mutants showed opaque colonies, suggesting a possible deficiency in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. To identify novel genes relevant to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and their relationship with <italic>spxB</italic>, we screened the single-gene mutant library being constructed in our lab to find H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production-defective mutants. Here, we describe three genes that are involved in pyruvate oxidase-related H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and antagonism against <italic>S. mutans</italic>, together with their functional relationship with pyruvate oxidase in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>.</p>

        <title>Bacterial strains and growth media.</title>
        <p>The strains used are described in Table&#x2005;<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">1</xref>. <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> strain SK36 (obtained from Dr Mogens Kilian,&#x200A;&#xC5;rhus University, Denmark) was isolated from human dental plaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">Kilian &amp; Holmgren, 1981</xref>). This strain and its derivatives were routinely grown in brain heart infusion broth (BHI; Difco) supplemented with 1.5&#x200A;% (w/v) agar under microaerobic conditions (7.2&#x200A;% H<sub>2</sub>, 7.2&#x200A;% CO<sub>2</sub>, 79.6&#x200A;% N<sub>2</sub> and 6&#x200A;% O<sub>2</sub>) in an Anoxomat jar (Spiral Biotech) at 37&#x2005;&#xB0;C as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Ge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">Paik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). <italic>S. mutans</italic> UA159 or its derivative was also routinely grown in BHI under microaerobic conditions as for <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>. When needed, medium was supplemented with kanamycin (500&#x2005;&#x3BC;g ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), chloramphenicol (5&#x2005;&#x3BC;g ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) or erythromycin (10&#x2005;&#x3BC;g ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The mutants were named by using &#x201C;<italic>ssx</italic>&#x201D; to refer the corresponding <italic>ssa</italic> gene in the NCBI database.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Mutant construction and complementation.</title>
        <p>For the construction of precise single gene deletion mutants in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> SK36, we developed a PCR-based recombinant method employing linear DNA for deletion construction <italic>in vitro</italic> (P. Xu and others, unpublished data). Briefly, for each targeted gene, three sets of primers were designed to amplify a linear DNA fragment containing the kanamycin resistance cassette (<italic>aphA-3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Turner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) with two flanking arms of DNA upstream and downstream of the targeted gene. The linear recombinant PCR amplicon was directly transformed into <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> competent cells as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Ge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>). A 96-well high-throughput format was used to generate a genome-wide mutant library. The mutants were confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR analyses.</p>
        <p>To construct the complemented strain, a DNA fragment containing the targeted gene followed by a selectable marker (either chloramphenicol or erythromycin resistance cassette) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Turner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) was integrated via double homologous recombination into the corresponding mutant (Table&#x2005;<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">1</xref>) to replace the kanamycin resistance cassette. Chloramphenicol- or erythromycin-resistant and kanamycin-sensitive transformants were selected and confirmed by PCR analysis.</p>

        <title>Screening for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production-defective mutants by opaque colony morphology.</title>
        <p>For opaque colony observation, 5&#x2005;&#x3BC;l overnight culture of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> SK36 or different mutants was spotted on the surface of BHI plates and incubated at 37&#x2005;&#xB0;C under microaerobic conditions. For catalase-containing plates, 100&#x2005;&#x3BC;l catalase from bovine liver (Sigma) was spread on the BHI plate surface (&#x223C;880&#x2005;U cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>). The plates were air-dried for 10&#x2005;min in a hood before bacterial inoculation. Bacterial suspension (5&#x2005;&#x3BC;l) was spotted on the catalase-containing plate and incubated at 37&#x2005;&#xB0;C under microaerobic conditions for 2&#x2005;days. The opaque colonies on the plate were recorded and photographed using a BioDoc-It imaging system. After obtaining the opaque mutants in the assays, the integrity of the mutations was confirmed by using PCR amplification and sequencing.</p>

        <title>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> release assays.</title>
        <p>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was quantified using the Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer, with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Briefly, 100&#x2005;&#x3BC;l reaction mixture (50&#x2005;mM Amplex Red reagent, 0.1&#x2005;U horseradish peroxidase ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> in 0.05&#x2005;M sodium phosphate buffer, pH&#x2005;7.4) was dispensed into wells of a 96-well microtitre plate and warmed to 37&#x2005;&#xB0;C for 10&#x2005;min. Exponential cultures of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> strains were grown in BHI to OD<sub>450</sub> 0.15&#x2013;0.2, centrifuged and then resuspended in fresh BHI to OD<sub>450</sub> approximately 0.06. An aliquot of freshly resuspended cells (20&#x2005;&#x3BC;l) was added in triplicate to the 100&#x2005;&#x3BC;l pre-warmed reaction mixture. A series of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration standards diluted in BHI together with BHI as the blank control were also included in the plate. The microtitre plate was incubated at 37&#x2005;&#xB0;C in a FLUOstar plate reader under aerobic conditions and absorbance was read at 563&#x2005;nm every 5&#x2005;min for 20&#x2005;min. Rates of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production were calculated and normalized to the OD<sub>450</sub> of the cell suspensions. Final values are shown relative to that of the wild-type strain, SK36. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used for statistical analysis.</p>

        <title>Competition assays on plates.</title>
        <p>To determine the inhibitory effect of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> against <italic>S. mutans</italic>, a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">Kreth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">2008</xref>) was employed with the following modifications. Briefly, 5&#x2005;&#x3BC;l of an overnight culture of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> SK36 or its derivative in BHI medium was inoculated onto a BHI agar plate. After incubation overnight (16&#x2005;h), 5&#x2005;&#x3BC;l of <italic>S. mutans</italic> UA159 was inoculated next to an <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> colony. Colonies were inoculated so that they were just touching each other. The plate was incubated again for another night. Growth inhibition was evaluated based on the distance of the inhibition zone from the edges of both colonies.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Competition assays in liquid media.</title>
        <p>This was performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">Kreth <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref>. Cells of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> mutants and <italic>S. mutans smx_42</italic>, a chloramphenicol-resistant derivative of <italic>S. mutans</italic>, were grown in BHI medium overnight and adjusted to the same OD<sub>660</sub> value. <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> or its mutants (3&#x2005;&#x3BC;l of each) and <italic>S. mutans smx_42</italic> (3&#x2005;&#x3BC;l) were mixed with 200&#x2005;&#x3BC;l fresh BHI medium in 96-well microtitre plates in triplicate. The cells were incubated overnight in static culture under microaerobic conditions. Cells were dispersed by vigorous pipetting and serial dilutions were plated on BHI agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol in triplicate and the c.f.u. was determined.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>RNA extraction and qPCR analyses.</title>
        <p>Total RNA was prepared from the cells growing in late exponential phase in BHI medium under microaerobic conditions to OD<sub>450</sub> 0.6&#x2013;1.0. Cells were lysed after lysozyme treatment and mechanical disruption using FastPrep lysing matrix B (Qbiogene). RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). DNA was removed from the RNeasy mini kit column by DNase I treatment. Total RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed in a 20&#x2005;&#x3BC;l reaction mixture containing 100&#x2005;ng RNA, 0.5&#x2005;&#x3BC;l random primers (3&#x2005;&#x3BC;g&#x200A;&#x3BC;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), 1.0&#x2005;&#x3BC;l dNTP mix (10&#x2005;mM each dNTP), 1.0&#x2005;&#x3BC;l 100&#x2005;mM DTT, 1.0&#x2005;&#x3BC;l RNAout (40&#x2005;U; Invitrogen) and 0.5&#x2005;&#x3BC;l SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (200&#x2005;U&#x200A;&#x3BC;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) in first-strand buffer (Invitrogen).

        <title>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production determines colony morphology in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> SK36</title>
        <p>During the process of creating a genome-wide single gene deletion mutant library of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> SK36, it was found that some mutants showed different colony morphologies. In comparison with the semi-transparent colony of the wild-type strain SK36, certain mutants presented an opaque colony when grown on BHI agar plates under microaerobic conditions. It was reported previously that the colony morphology variation between transparent and opaque colonies in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is related to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and can be detected on tryptic soy agar plates by the addition of catalase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">Weiser <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Such an opaque colony marker has been used to identify genes involved in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). To investigate the existence of similar morphological variation in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> and to establish a condition to screen genes involved in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> SK36 was cultured on BHI plates with and without the addition of excess catalase to hydrolyse peroxides. The colony opacity was compared to examine the effect of catalase. We found that SK36 colonies changed from semi-transparent to opaque after incubation for 2&#x2005;days when catalase was added (data not shown). This showed that in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, the opaque colony variations were related to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. The result also suggested that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production-defective mutants of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> SK36 might be identified by colony morphology in our system. We hypothesized that the mutants with opaque colonies had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production.</p>
        <p>Next, to identify the potential genes involved in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, we screened over 1000 available single gene deletion mutants for variation in colony morphology to identify potential H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-production-defective mutants, as described above. Four mutants showing obvious opaque colonies were identified. The morphological variations of the four mutants were further confirmed by comparison with the wild-type strain SK36 on BHI plates, including a control strain <italic>ssx_0169</italic> with kanamycin resistance (data not shown) to determine that the kanamycin resistance gene did not interfere with the phenotypes being investigated. This control strain was selected because it was demonstrated that the <italic>ssa_0169</italic> gene did not affect important cellular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Turner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The deletion locus of each mutant was confirmed to have the expected structure by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing. One of the mutants (<italic>ssx_0391</italic>) had a deletion in the <italic>spxB</italic> gene, whose product, pyruvate oxidase, is known to catalyse the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The other three genes identified were <italic>ackA</italic>, encoding acetate kinase, <italic>spxR</italic>, encoding a conserved hypothetical protein, and <italic>tpk</italic>, encoding thiamine pyrophosphokinase (Table&#x2005;<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">1</xref>). The four opaque mutants (including <italic>ssx_0391</italic>) were further characterized.</p>

        <title>Opaque mutants have reduced rates of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production</title>
        <p>Since H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is proposed to relate to the opaque morphology, we next quantified H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the four mutants identified above, and compared it with that of the wild-type strain SK36. The control strain <italic>ssx_0169</italic> was also included in this analysis. All four opaque mutants displayed significantly reduced rates of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production compared with the semi-transparent parent strain SK36 (Fig.&#x2005;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rates of the mutants were only 16&#x2013;31&#x200A;% of that of SK36. Similar H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production to the wild-type strain SK36 was found in the kanamycin-resistant control strain (<italic>ssx_0169</italic>). Though each of the four opaque mutants displayed decreased rates of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, none of them lost the capacity of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production completely, including the <italic>spxB</italic> mutant. It should be noted that the intact ORF of each mutant was precisely deleted in each of our mutants, so it was impossible that any partial gene function remained. This suggested that the pyruvate oxidase activity might not be the only oxidase activity responsible for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production.</p>
        <p>Next, to ensure that these identified genes function in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, we checked the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the relative single gene mutants of their upstream and downstream genes (i.e. <italic>ssx_0190</italic>, <italic>ssx_0191</italic>, <italic>ssx_0193</italic> and <italic>ssx_0195</italic>; <italic>ssx_1494</italic>, <italic>ssx_1493</italic>, <italic>ssx_1490</italic> and <italic>ssx_1489</italic>; <italic>ssx_2120</italic>, <italic>ssx_2119</italic>, <italic>ssx_2117</italic> and <italic>ssx_2116.</italic> The mutant for <italic>ssa_1491</italic> is not available because the gene was found to be essential). There was no statistically significant defect in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production by any of these mutants compared with that of the wild-type. This result supports the hypothesis that the defects in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the identified mutants are not related to the neighbouring genes. To ensure this, we introduced the genes back to the mutants. A chloramphenicol resistance cassette was placed downstream of each gene for selection. After obtaining the complemented strains, their morphology and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production were examined. The results showed that the morphology of three strains, <italic>ssx_0391C</italic>, <italic>ssx_1492C</italic> and <italic>ssx_2118C</italic> (Table&#x2005;<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">1</xref>), was restored to semi-transparent and the rates of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production were restored to the wild-type level (Fig.&#x2005;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1</xref>). In the first attempt to complement <italic>ssx_0192</italic> gene function, we failed to fully restore the phenotype. We then examined the mRNA level of downstream genes <italic>ssa_0193</italic>, <italic>ssa_0195</italic> and <italic>ssa_0197</italic> in the mutant <italic>ssx_0192</italic>, which did not show significant changes compared with that of the wild-type. Given these data, we deduced that there might be some errors with the complemented strain. We therefore performed this complementation again employing an erythromycin resistance cassette (<italic>pSerm</italic>). The resulting strain <italic>ssx_0192C</italic> was successfully restored for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production (Fig.&#x2005;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1</xref>). All of the data indicated that the identified genes are involved in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production.</p>

        <title>Opaque mutants demonstrate reduced antagonistic activity against <italic>S. mutans</italic> UA159 both on plates and in liquid media</title>
        <p>Because the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> plays an important role in interspecies interactions within the oral microflora, we performed competition assays to examine whether the four H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-defective mutants showed any difference from the parent strain, SK36, in their capacity for antagonism against a primary dental cariogen, <italic>S. mutans</italic>. We first examined the antagonistic activity on agar plates. <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> and <italic>S. mutans</italic> cells were spotted next to one another on agar plates. The inhibition zones of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> and the mutants against <italic>S. mutans</italic> were determined (Fig.&#x2005;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref>). The results showed that all four mutants lost the ability to inhibit <italic>S. mutans</italic> UA159 on BHI plates under microaerobic conditions (Fig.&#x2005;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further quantify the antagonism of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-defective mutants against <italic>S. mutans</italic>, we performed competition assays in liquid culture using mixed species. We first constructed a chloramphenicol-resistant control strain of <italic>S. mutans</italic> by integrating the chloramphenicol resistance gene <italic>magellan2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Turner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) into the <italic>S. mutans</italic> UA159 chromosome. The <italic>smu.42</italic> gene encoding a hypothetical protein (SMU.42) which did not affect its sensitivity to antagonism by <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> (data not shown) was selected as the target location for integration in the <italic>S. mutans</italic> genome. Because the <italic>S. mutans</italic> derivative can be distinguished from <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> on chloramphenicol selection agar plates, the inhibition effect of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> on <italic>S. mutans</italic> could be determined by bacterial colony numbers on agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol. We mixed the same amount of each <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> mutant, as assessed by OD<sub>660</sub>, with <italic>S. mutans</italic> and co-cultured the two species mixture. <italic>S. mutans</italic> cells were counted on BHI plates supplemented with chloramphenicol after 48&#x2005;h. This indicated that all four mutants were less able to inhibit <italic>S. mutans</italic> in liquid culture compared with the wild-type strain, SK36, and the control strain <italic>ssx_0169</italic> (Fig.&#x2005;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Transcriptional level of <italic>spxB</italic> in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production-defective mutants</title>
        <p>To examine whether <italic>spxB</italic> expression changes in the mutants with decreased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, we determined the transcriptional level of <italic>spxB</italic> by real-time qPCR (Fig.&#x2005;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). The results showed that the expression of <italic>spxB</italic> in <italic>ssx_0192</italic> and <italic>ssx_1492</italic> decreased significantly compared with SK36. The significant decrease in <italic>spxB</italic> transcription suggested that the effects of the deleted gene products in <italic>ssx_0192</italic> and <italic>ssx_1492</italic> on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production might occur via SpxB. In contrast, the <italic>ssx_2118</italic> mutant demonstrated increased expression of <italic>spxB</italic>, indicating that SSA_2118 affects H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production by a mechanism other than affecting <italic>spxB</italic> expression (Fig.&#x2005;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this study, we describe three genes involved in the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the preliminary study of their effects on <italic>spxB</italic> expression in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>. We also show that all the genes involved in the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> identified here were also critical for the antagonism of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> against <italic>S. mutans</italic>.</p>
      <p>The three non-<italic>spxB</italic> mutants identified in this study demonstrated defects in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production similar to that in the <italic>spxB</italic> mutant. SSA_0192 is annotated as acetate kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), which converts acetyl phosphate, the other product derived from the decarboxylation of pyruvate besides CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, to acetate. Our results indicated that <italic>spxB</italic> expression was reduced in the deletion mutant <italic>ssx_0192</italic>. A possible mechanism of this regulation might be that the gene deletion in <italic>ssx_0192</italic> caused acetyl phosphate accumulation, which caused feedback suppression of <italic>spxB</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). We tried to determine the acetyl phosphate concentration using the hydroxamate assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">Gorrell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) in <italic>ssx_0192</italic> and the wild-type strain to examine this hypothesis. However, the acetyl phosphate concentrations in both strains were too low to give a reliable result. The gene product in <italic>ssx_1492</italic> (SSA_1492) showed high identity (76&#x200A;% identity in amino acid sequence) to SpxR in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, which was identified as a regulator of <italic>spxB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The conserved domain analysis of SSA_1492 showed that the protein contains a putative helix&#x2013;turn&#x2013;helix domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) located at the amino terminus, followed by a DRTGG-CBS domain, which are hypothesized to bind to DNA and adenosyl compounds (such as AMP and ATP), respectively. Combined with the significantly decreased expression of <italic>spxB</italic> observed in the <italic>ssx_1492</italic> mutant, our data suggest that SSA_1492 might act as a positive regulator of <italic>spxB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">Kemp, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">Rigali <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). It was hypothesized that SpxR in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> regulates <italic>spxB</italic> transcription in response to energy and metabolic state, and the SpxR regulon includes comparatively few genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). As some other species of streptococci, including <italic>S. mutans</italic>, <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> (group B Streptococcus), lack <italic>spxB</italic> but contain homologues of SpxR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), presumably the regulatory targets of the SpxR homologues are species-specific. Our study suggests that the role of SpxR in regulating <italic>spxB</italic> is not confined to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, because it seems to have the same function in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>. The thiamine pyrophosphokinase encoded by <italic>ssa_2118</italic> catalyses the transfer of a pyrophosphate moiety from ATP to thiamine and produces thiamine pyrophosphate. Thiamine pyrophosphate has been reported to be an important cofactor for pyruvate oxidase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">Carlsson &amp; Kujala, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">Muller <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">Tittmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">2005</xref>). The deletion of <italic>ssa_2118</italic>, therefore, presumably decreases the rate of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation by decreasing the activity of pyruvate oxidase (Fig.&#x2005;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1</xref>). Our results indicated that SSA_2118 was required for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. This is also consistent with the finding that a site-specific mutation of an amino acid in SpxB that is required for thiamine pyrophosphate binding reduces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production significantly in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). At the same time, it is possible that SSA_2118 involves H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production by affecting not only SpxB but also other enzymes that require thiamine pyrophosphate. It was interesting that <italic>spxB</italic> expression in mutant <italic>ssx_2118</italic> showed a significant increase. All three non-<italic>spxB</italic> mutants exhibited decreased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production but the expression levels of <italic>spxB</italic> were distinct. We hypothesize that SSA_0192 and SSA_1492 were required for the normal expression of <italic>spxB</italic>, while SSA_2118 was required for the thiamine pyrophosphate, which is the cofactor for SpxB. Both SpxB and SSA_2118 were necessary for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production.</p>
      <p>Our study suggests that it is practical to identify H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production-defective mutants in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> by their colony morphology variation. In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, the proposed roles of <italic>spxB</italic> function and regulation in pneumococcal phase variation have been somewhat contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Some research suggested that <italic>spxB</italic> expression level was unlikely to directly determine colony morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">Overweg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) since the <italic>spxB</italic> mutant still varied in colony morphology, while another study indicated that some opaque variants were later found to be defective in SpxB function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">Pericone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). It has been suggested recently that SpxB does determine colony morphology and might play a role in phase variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">Belanger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The contradiction may be related to other components contributing to the phenotype, such as a capsule. In <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, our results indicated that it was not the expression of <italic>spxB</italic> that is responsible for the morphological variation, but the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> the strain produces, because all of the four H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production-defective mutants had an opaque appearance, and this appearance was not dependent on the expression of <italic>spxB</italic>. For example, the expression of <italic>spxB</italic> in mutant <italic>ssx_2118</italic> was significantly increased compared with that in the wild-type strain SK36 (Fig.&#x2005;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>), but the mutant <italic>ssx_2118</italic> still presented an opaque morphology, which is presumably due to the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production deficiency of the mutant.</p>
      <p>In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, a similar screening study was performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref>. From screening &#x223C;232&#x200A;000 colonies, seven spontaneous mutants were identified that showed opaque appearance; six of them were found to produce less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than the wild-type strain. All were related to <italic>spxB</italic> and one of the genes, <italic>spxR</italic>, was found to regulate <italic>spxB</italic> expression. In our study, in addition to <italic>spxB</italic> and <italic>spxR</italic>, we identified two other mutants, <italic>ssx_0192</italic> and <italic>ssx_2118</italic>, that had an opaque appearance and produced less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It is interesting that these genes were not identified in the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> study, even though we would expect that identical mutants in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> would have the same phenotype. This could be because their spontaneous screen carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Ramos-Monta&#xF1;ez <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> was not saturating. It would be interesting to determine whether mutations in the <italic>ssa_0192</italic> and <italic>ssa_2118</italic> orthologues in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<italic>spd_1853</italic> and <italic>spd_1779</italic>) would have also demonstrated this phenotype. If so, they will be potential virulence factors in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p>
      <p>The competition between pioneer colonizing oral streptococci in the oral community is of continued interest. Our studies show that the four genes identified are critical for conferring a competition advantage to <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>. This might contribute to a better understanding of interspecies interactions within oral microbial communities and serve as a foundation on which the molecular mechanisms of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and its regulation by oral streptococci could be elucidated.</p>
