      <abstract>
        <p>We report procedures to allow incorporation and detection of 5-ethynyl-2&#x2032;-deoxyuridine (EdU) in fission yeast, a thymidine analogue which has some technical advantages over use of bromodeoxyuridine. Low concentrations of EdU (1&#x2009;&#xB5;M) are sufficient to allow detection of incorporation in cells expressing thymidine kinase and human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1). However EdU is toxic and activates the <italic>rad3</italic>-dependent checkpoint, resulting in cell cycle arrest, potentially limiting its applications for procedures which require labelling over more than one cell cycle. Limited DNA synthesis, when elongation is largely blocked by hydroxyurea, can be readily detected by EdU incorporation using fluorescence microscopy. Thus EdU should be useful for detecting early stages of S phase, or DNA synthesis associated with DNA repair and recombination.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Detection of DNA replication by incorporation of halogenated nucleotides is of considerable use in monitoring S phase, cell proliferation, DNA repair and DNA recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6">1&#x2013;6</xref>). In combination with DNA combing, newly replicated regions of chromosomes can be directly observed, allowing single molecule analyses of origin firing and rate of fork movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Use of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and related nucleosides presents some technical difficulties however, in that antibodies are used to detect incorporation, which requires DNA to be converted to a single-stranded form and permeabilization of fixed cells is needed. Recently, the use of 5-ethynyl-2&#x2032;-deoxyuridine (EdU) has been described to detect DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This thymidine analogue contains an alkyne group which can be conjugated to a fluorescently labelled azide in a Cu(I)-catalyzed &#x2018;click&#x2019; reaction. One advantage of this method is that incorporation can be detected in double-stranded DNA, and the fluorescent label is a small permeable molecule, thus access to the DNA is less of a problem than when using antibodies.</p>
      <p>Here, we report simple procedures to enable labelling of fission yeast DNA with EdU and detection by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. At levels which allow detection, EdU incorporation is toxic and activates the <italic>rad3</italic>-dependent checkpoint, which is a limitation for some experimental designs. Use of EdU in fission yeast has also been reported by the Forsburg lab in the Invitrogen Bioprobes series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com/etc/medialib/en/filelibrary/Support/BioProbes/BioProbes-61.Par.38879.File.dat/BioProbes-61-click-it-edu.pdf">http://www.invitrogen.com/etc/medialib/en/filelibrary/Support/BioProbes/BioProbes-61.Par.38879.File.dat/BioProbes-61-click-it-edu.pdf</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>Strain construction and maintenance were as described previously, following standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Cells were grown in YE3S rich medium (Yeast Extract, supplemented with 250&#x2009;mg/l adenine, uracil and leucine) or Edinburgh Minimal Medium (EMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Cells were arrested in G1 by growth in EMM lacking NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (EMM-N). Plasmids padh1prom-TK-kanMX6/pFS255, expressing herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) from the <italic>adh1</italic> promoter, and padh1prom-hENT1-leu1/pFS181, expressing human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) from the <italic>adh</italic>1 promoter, were obtained from Addgene Inc (plasmids 12&#x2009;382 and 12&#x2009;536, respectively). <italic>adh1-TK</italic> was integrated into the <italic>adh1</italic> locus by linearizing with MfeI; integration of the plasmid at <italic>adh1</italic> was confirmed by colony PCR using the primers: 5&#x2032;-CTACGACAAAAGAAGGCTAAAGGAATAGG-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GCGGTCGAAGATGAGGGTGAGG-3&#x2032;. <italic>adh1-hENT1</italic> was integrated into the <italic>leu1-32</italic> locus by linearizing with NruI; integration at <italic>leu1</italic> was confirmed by colony PCR using the primers 5&#x2032;-CAGACAAGCCCGTCAGGGCGCG-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-CAAAATACTTGCGAACCATCAAAGTGGAAAGG-3&#x2032;.</p>

        <p>Cells were grown in YE3S or EMM medium containing EdU at the indicated concentration; EdU was added from a 10&#x2009;mM stock in water. Following incorporation, cells were fixed by resuspending in 70% ethanol and washed in TBS (50&#x2009;mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150&#x2009;mM NaCl) twice. Approximately 2&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>6</sup> cells were resuspended in a freshly prepared cocktail containing 50&#x2009;mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150&#x2009;mM NaCl, 2&#x2009;mM CuSO<sub>4,</sub> 10&#x2009;&#xB5;M Alexa Fluor 488 azide (added from 2&#x2009;mM stock in DMSO; A10266, Invitrogen), 10&#x2009;mM sodium ascorbate (added last from 0.1&#x2009;M stock) and incubated in the dark for 30&#x2009;min. Cells were washed in TBS twice, finally resuspending in 0.5&#x2009;ml TBS. For detection of fluorescence by flow cytometry, cells were transferred to 1.5&#x2009;ml Eppendorf tubes and sonicated for 20&#x2009;s in a water bath (Diagenode Biorupter, power setting set to low/130&#x2009;W) to break up the cell doublets before analysis using a Coulter Epics XL-MCL.</p>
        <p>For analysis by fluorescence microscopy, cells were concentrated and mounted by mixing with an equal volume of 1.2% low melting temperature agarose, containing 50&#x2009;ng/ml DAPI. Images were collected using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope, coupled to a Hamamatsu ORCA ER camera; open source&#x2009;&#xB5;Manager software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) was used to control the camera and microscope.</p>

        <title>Strain modifications necessary for EdU incorporation</title>
        <p>Efficient incorporation of BrdU into fission yeast requires expression of both TK and a nucleoside transporter (hENT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), although moderately high levels of BrdU incorporation can be achieved by expression of TK alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). With medium containing 10&#x2009;&#xB5;M EdU, incorporation is readily detectable by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy with an <italic>adh1-TK adh1-hENT1</italic> strain, whereas no incorporation was detectable when TK was expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and C). Only when EdU was used at a considerably higher concentration (100&#x2013;300&#x2009;&#xB5;M) was incorporation detectable with a <italic>adh1-TK</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C). Using the <italic>adh1-TK adh1-hENT1</italic> strain, higher concentrations of EdU did not result in an increased fluorescence signal by flow cytometry, and the concentration could be lowered to 1&#x2009;&#xB5;M with little reduction in sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).

        <title>Effects of EdU incorporation on checkpoint activation and viability</title>
        <p>To determine whether growth in EdU has an effect on viability, dilutions of cells were spotted onto plates containing different concentrations of the nucleoside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A); for comparison, strains were also spotted onto plates containing BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Wild-type cells, or cells expressing <italic>adh1-TK</italic> alone were not sensitive to EdU up to 25&#x2009;&#xB5;M, while cells expressing <italic>adh1-TK adh1-hENT1</italic> showed reduced growth at 1&#x2009;&#xB5;M EdU. The sensitivity of <italic>adh1-TK adh1-hENT1</italic> cells was exacerbated in a <italic>rad3&#x394;</italic> background, as growth was severely affected at a concentration of just 0.1&#x2009;&#xB5;M. This suggests that EdU incorporation leads to DNA damage and a functional <italic>rad3</italic>-dependent checkpoint mechanism is required for viability. In contrast to EdU, the <italic>rad3&#x394;</italic> strain is not particularly sensitive to BrdU at 0.1&#x2009;&#xB5;M, although at 1&#x2009;&#xB5;M there is a slight difference in growth compared to the <italic>rad3<sup>+</sup></italic> strain and higher concentrations are similarly toxic to both <italic>rad3&#x394;</italic> and <italic>rad3<sup>+</sup></italic> incorporating strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B). Sivakumar <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) have noted that high concentrations of BrdU are toxic without causing cell elongation, which they speculate is due to disturbance of major groove&#x2013;protein interactions. High concentrations of thymidine are also toxic to incorporating strains, presumably due to disturbance of cellular nucleotide pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).

The effect of EdU on cell division of <italic>rad3&#x394;</italic> cells is shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr063/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>.

        <p>Consistent with these observations, <italic>adh1-TK adh1-hENT1 rad3<sup>+</sup></italic> cells became elongated when grown in 1&#x2009;&#xB5;M EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr063/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). Cells released from a G1 block into medium containing EdU failed to carry out mitosis and cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D and E) but the block to mitotic entry was relieved in a <italic>rad3&#x394;</italic> mutant and most cells arrested in a binucleate, septated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr063/DC1">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</ext-link>). Cells also lost viability when grown in EdU and this was exacerbated in the <italic>rad3&#x394;</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). Toxicity effects of EdU on mammalian cells have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), suggesting that EdU may not be suitable for continuous labelling studies.</p>
        <p>To determine whether incorporation of EdU affects the kinetics of DNA replication, cells were arrested in G1 by nitrogen starvation and released from the block in the presence or absence of the nucleoside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Cells from both cultures were stained with SYTOX Green without coupling EdU to fluorescent azide and analysed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and D). Both cultures started S phase at the same time (&#x223C;2&#x2009;h after release) and bulk replication was largely complete at 4&#x2009;h, indicating that the duration of S phase was similar. For cells grown in EdU, the SYTOX Green histogram peaks showing DNA content for cells 4&#x2013;5&#x2009;h after release from the G1 block are shifted slightly to the left of the peaks for the minus EdU culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and D, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr063/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>). Cells from the EdU containing culture were also conjugated to fluorescent azide and analysis of these cells by flow cytometry showed commencement of DNA replication at around 2&#x2009;h in agreement with the SYTOX Green histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). On prolonged incubation, the peak of Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence associated with EdU incorporation does not shift to the right of the peak shown at 5&#x2009;h (data not shown), indicating that EdU is only incorporated into a single strand of DNA and that cells are arrested in the first cycle after release.

This peak is shifted to the left of the 2C position defined by the &#x2018;G2 minus-nitrogen population&#x2019;, probably due to some effect of EdU incorporation on SYTOX Green fluorescence (see text for further discussion). A longer time course shows disappearance of the shoulder at 6&#x2013;7&#x2009;h (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr063/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>) consistent with an earlier study showing that cells in the &#x2018;G2 minus-nitrogen population&#x2019; replicate their DNA around this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), (<bold>E</bold>) Analysis of chromosomes by PFGE.

        <p>The leftward shift of the SYTOX Green histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D could, in principle, be due to incomplete DNA replication in the presence of EdU. However, we think this is unlikely as a similar shift was seen when BrdU, rather than EdU, was incorporated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr063/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>) and BrdU does not inhibit S phase completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). To investigate further whether EdU affects the completion of DNA replication, we analysed DNA from cells grown in EdU (10&#x2009;&#x3BC;M) by PFGE, since incompletely replicated chromosomes fail to enter these gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Cells were released from a G1 block in the presence or absence of EdU and samples were taken up to 5&#x2009;h for analysis by PFGE and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E and F). As a control for incomplete replication, chromosomes were analysed from cells grown in the presence of hydroxyurea (HU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E, lanes 6 and 7). Chromosomes are resolved from cells grown in EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E, compare lanes 5 and 1) indicating completion of chromosome replication. However chromosome bands are fainter in the +EdU time points compared to the &#x2212;EdU samples, and there is a smear of smaller DNA fragments. This may reflect the generation of double-strand breaks following EdU incorporation. Taken together, these results suggest that EdU does not inhibit completion of DNA replication. The reduction in SYTOX Green fluorescence seen with DNA containing EdU requires further investigation, but could be due to quenching or reduced binding of the dye.</p>

        <title>Using EdU to detect limited DNA synthesis</title>
        <p>To investigate whether EdU incorporation provides a sensitive method for detecting DNA synthesis where only limited elongation has occurred, G1 arrested cells were released from the block into medium containing both EdU and HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by HU prevents bulk DNA replication although some fork progression from origins takes place [&#x223C; 4&#x2013;5&#x2009;kb in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>)]. In control cells, flow cytometric analysis of SYTOX Green-stained cells showed that S phase occurred around 2&#x2013;4&#x2009;h after release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B) while in the presence of HU, no DNA replication was detected as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr063/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>). Following conjugation to azide, some EdU incorporation could be detected in the +HU+EdU culture by flow cytometry from 2&#x2009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C) but the clearest result was obtained by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E and F). Here, EdU incorporation could be detected as early as 2&#x2009;h after release, around the time that S phase was commencing in the culture lacking HU.

        <p>Taken together, these results indicate that EdU is a useful thymidine analogue for detecting DNA synthesis in experiments involving short labelling periods and a single cell cycle, although evidence for DNA damage induced by EdU in fission yeast is a concern. The sensitivity and ease of detection of EdU incorporation even when the elongation step of DNA synthesis is largely inhibited should be of value for detecting early replicating parts of the genome, and the limited replication associated with DNA repair and recombination.</p>
