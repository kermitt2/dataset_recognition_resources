          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Abnormal lower limb biomechanics is speculated to be a risk factor for Achilles tendinopathy. This study systematically reviewed the existing literature to identify, critique and summarise lower limb biomechanical factors associated with Achilles tendinopathy.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We searched electronic bibliographic databases (Medline, EMBASE, Current contents, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus) in November 2010. All prospective cohort and case-control studies that evaluated biomechanical factors (temporospatial parameters, lower limb kinematics, dynamic plantar pressures, kinetics [ground reaction forces and joint moments] and muscle activity) associated with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy were included. Quality of included studies was evaluated using the Quality Index. The magnitude of differences (effect sizes) between cases and controls was calculated using Cohen's d (with 95% CIs).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Nine studies were identified; two were prospective and the remaining seven case-control study designs. The quality of 9 identified studies was varied, with Quality Index scores ranging from 4 to 15 out of 17. All studies analysed running biomechanics. Cases displayed increased eversion range of motion of the rearfoot (d = 0.92 and 0.67 in two studies), reduced maximum lower leg abduction (d = -1.16), reduced ankle joint dorsiflexion velocity (d = -0.62) and reduced knee flexion during gait (d = -0.90). Cases also demonstrated a number of differences in dynamic plantar pressures (primarily the distribution of the centre of force), ground reaction forces (large effects for timing variables) and also showed reduced peak tibial external rotation moment (d = -1.29). Cases also displayed differences in the timing and amplitude of a number of lower limb muscles but many differences were equivocal.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>There are differences in lower limb biomechanics between those with and without Achilles tendinopathy that may have implications for the prevention and management of the condition. However, the findings need to be interpreted with caution due to the limited quality of a number of the included studies. Future well-designed prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Achilles tendinopathy is a common musculoskeletal disorder that can impair physical function in daily living, occupation and sporting environments. The prevalence of Achilles tendinopathy has been reported to be greater in males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The condition accounts for between 8 and 15% of all injuries in recreational runners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and has a cumulative lifetime incidence of approximately 24% in athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although Achilles tendinopathy is common in athletes, one-third of patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy are not physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In some settings, approximately 30% of patients who present with this condition undergo surgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Achilles tendinopathy is considered a multifactorial condition, with both extrinsic and intrinsic factors thought to contribute to its development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Proposed extrinsic risk factors include altered weightbearing surfaces (excessively hard, slippery or uneven) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], inappropriate footwear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], training errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], use of specific medications such as fluoroquinolones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the type of exercise activity (e.g., sports involving the stretch-shorten cycle such as running or jumping) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Proposed intrinsic risk factors include previous injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], increased age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], presence of specific genetic variations such as polymorphisms occurring within the COL5A1 and tenascin-C genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], male gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], increased adiposity and/or metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], pre-existing tendon abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], triceps surae inflexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], hormonal status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and abnormal lower limb biomechanics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>Alterations in lower limb biomechanical characteristics including temporospatial parameters, lower limb kinematics, dynamic plantar pressures, kinetics (ground reaction forces and joint moments) and muscle activity are frequently associated with Achilles tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. One biomechanical factor commonly considered to be associated with Achilles tendinopathy is the presence of excessive foot pronation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Clement et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] originally proposed that excessive pronation of the foot may lead to Achilles tendinopathy through two mechanisms. First, excessive pronation of the foot is speculated to create greater hindfoot eversion motion, resulting in excessive forces on the medial aspect of the tendon and subsequent microtears. Second, abnormal pronation of the foot is thought to lead to asynchronous movement between the foot and ankle during the stance phase of gait, resulting in a subsequent 'wringing' effect within the Achilles tendon. This 'wringing' effect is theorised to cause vascular impairment within the tendon and peritendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and elevated tensile stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] leading to subsequent degenerative changes in the Achilles tendon. In addition to kinematic theories, altered lower limb muscle function (timing, amplitude or co-ordination of contractions of the triceps surae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and altered lower limb kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] have also been speculated to be risk factors for Achilles tendinopathy by increasing tendon loading.</p>
      <p>Several studies have been performed to investigate the association between abnormal lower limb biomechanics and Achilles tendinopathy. Critiquing and summarising results from these studies is now required to assist in the development of; (i) preventative strategies, and; (ii) specific and effective management strategies for the condition. However, at present, the aetiology of Achilles tendinopathy is not clearly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of the existing literature (prospective cohort and retrospective case-control studies) to identify, critique and summarise lower limb biomechanical factors associated with Achilles tendinopathy.</p>

        <title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title>
        <p>Prospective cohort and case-control studies evaluating biomechanical factors associated with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (i.e., 2-6 cm proximal to its insertion) were considered for inclusion. The inclusion criteria required participants to be described as having: <italic>midsubstance tendinopathy of the Achilles, Achilles tendinitis, tenosynovitis or tendinosis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Additional terms such as <italic>Achilles tendinopathy, tenopathy, tendinosis, partial rupture, paratenonitis, tendovaginitis, peritendinitis and achillodynia </italic>have also been used to describe the problems of non-insertional pain associated with the Achilles tendon so were also used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Measures of interest were gait characteristics including temporospatial parameters, lower limb kinematics, dynamic plantar pressures, kinetics (ground reaction forces and joint moments) and muscle activity.</p>
        <p>Unpublished studies, case-series studies, non-peer-reviewed publications, intervention studies, studies not involving humans, reviews, letters, opinion articles, non-English articles and abstracts were excluded. Studies which included participants with concomitant injury or pain from structures other than the mid-portion of the Achilles tendon (e.g., insertional Achilles tendon pathology) or that failed to localise the pathology in the tendon were excluded.</p>

        <title>Search Strategy</title>
        <p>MEDLINE (OVID) (1950-), EMBASE (1988-), CINAHL (1981-), SPORTDiscus and Current Contents (1993 week 27-) electronic databases were searched in November 2010 (week 3). A generic search strategy was formulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and the results are reported in Additional Data File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Review process</title>
        <p>All titles and abstracts found were downloaded into Endnote version XI (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA) giving a set of 2701 citations. The set was cross-referenced and any duplicates were deleted, leaving a total of 1575 citations. Each title and abstract was evaluated for potential inclusion by two independent reviewers (SEM and CJB) using a checklist developed from the inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined above (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). If insufficient information was contained in the title and abstract to make a decision on a study, it was retained until the full text could be obtained for evaluation. Any disagreements regarding studies were resolved by a consensus meeting between the two reviewers.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Methodological quality assessment</title>
        <p>The methodological quality of each included study was assessed using 16 items (maximum score of 17) of the 'Quality Index' considered relevant for assessing prospective cohort and case-control study designs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The original Quality Index scale consisting of 26 items was shown to have high internal consistency (KR-20 = 0.89), test-retest (r = 0.88) and inter-rater (r = 0.75) reliability and high criterion validity (r &#x2265; 0.85) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Two reviewers (SEM and CJB) applied the quality index to each included study independently, and any scoring discrepancies were resolved through a consensus meeting.</p>

        <p>Inter-rater reliability of each item of the Quality Index was evaluated using unweighted kappa and percentage agreement statistics, and the overall score was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC<sub>3,1</sub>) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p>
        <p>Means and standard deviations for all continuous data were extracted and effect sizes (Cohen's d) (with 95% CIs) calculated to allow comparison between each study's results. To allow visual comparison, effect sizes were entered into forest plots. Categorical data (e.g. frequency of foot type) was compared between groups using odds ratios (with 95% CIs) transformed to effect sizes (with 95% CIs) as described by Chinn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] Calculated effect sizes were considered statistically significant if their 95% CI did not cross zero. If inadequate data were available from original studies to complete effect size calculations, attempts were made via email to contact the study's corresponding author for additional data.</p>
        <p>Sample sizes (limbs analysed), the presence or absence of symptoms, participant demographics (gender, age, BMI, mass, height, duration of symptoms and sporting experience) and biomechanical analysis details were also extracted to assist in interpretation of findings.</p>

There were no disagreements amongst reviewers. One study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] did not contain appropriate data to complete effect size calculations, meaning data extraction (effect size calculations) was performed on a total of eight studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p>

Several studies did not clearly describe participant characteristics (Item 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or discuss whether participants invited (Item 11) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] or recruited were representative of entire population (Item 12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This limits the ability of any findings to be applied to a broader population. None of the case-control studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] blinded their outcome assessors (Item 15) making it possible that some of the associated results may have been biased. Several included studies did not clearly describe confounding variables (Item 5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] or adjust for these in their analyses (Item 25) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Additionally, the validity and reliability of outcome measurements used was not reported by any of the studies (Item 20) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. One study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] analysed both limbs of each participant, and pooled data for both limbs within the case group, despite participants in the case group having unilateral symptoms. Two case-control studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] excluded participants that displayed a rigid foot type in the Achilles tendinopathy but not in the control group. This introduces significant recruitment bias into their studies.</p>

        <title>Lower limb kinematics</title>
        <p>Abnormal alignment and function of the lower limb, particularly in the frontal plane at the foot and distal leg, is frequently cited as a risk factor for Achilles tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] evaluating frontal plane kinematics of the rearfoot and/or distal leg were identified in this review. The majority of these comparisons were not found to be different between groups (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, separate studies showed greater eversion range of motion of the ankle in those with Achilles tendinopathy in both shod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and barefoot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] conditions. Further, one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] showed reduced maximum lower leg abduction (barefoot) in those with Achilles tendinopathy. These findings suggest that Achilles tendinopathy may be associated with greater movement excursion of the rearfoot during gait and support the original proposition by Clement et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] who hypothesised that greater movement excursion of the rearfoot may create increased tensile stress and subsequent degeneration along the medial aspect of the Achilles tendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, these differences need to be considered in light of this review's results showing no significant effects for the majority of frontal plane rearfoot kinematic variables which includes maximum eversion/pronation. Contrary to the tensile stress theory, no evidence was found to support that torsional stress or 'wringing' of the Achilles tendon was associated with Achilles tendinopathy. Two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] investigating transverse plane kinematics of the tibia at the ankle and/or knee joints in those with and without Achilles tendinopathy showed no differences between groups. Prospective rearfoot and lower leg motion evaluation is now needed to further understand its possible link to Achilles tendinopathy development.</p>
        <p>Three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] investigated sagittal plane kinematics of the hip, knee and/or ankle joints at a range of instants during stance phase of the gait cycle. Generally comparisons indicated no differences in these parameters between those with and without Achilles tendinopathy, with the exception of reduced maximum ankle dorsiflexion velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and knee flexion range between heel strike and midstance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in those with Achilles tendinopathy. The link between reduced ankle dorsiflexion velocity and Achilles tendinopathy is unclear but it may indicate a compensation strategy to minimise internal loading of the Achilles tendon in those with Achilles tendinopathy. Reduced knee flexion between heel strike and midstance in those with Achilles tendinopathy has been speculated to be a compensation for weakness of proximal hip muscles (e.g., rectus femoris) during eccentric actions, and the reduced impact absorbing motion has been speculated to cause an increase in load within the Achilles tendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, future studies are required to determine if there is a relationship between these kinematic changes and increased internal load within the Achilles tendon.</p>

        <title>Ground reaction forces and joint moments</title>
        <p>Three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] performed a large number of comparisons of ground reaction force variables (direction, magnitude and timing) between those with and without Achilles tendinopathy. Overall, there were few differences in the magnitude of the vertical, antero-posterior and medio-lateral components of the ground reaction force variables between those with and without Achilles tendinopathy. However, there were a number of relatively large effects for variables related to the timing of the ground reaction force. Those with Achilles tendinopathy had a greater (delayed) time to the first vertical peak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], time to minimum peak force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and time to maximum medial force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] but reduced (earlier) time to maximum braking force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and time to maximum lateral force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, the analysed study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] was a case-control design and participants were symptomatic during testing. It is therefore possible that injured participants may have altered their gait to minimise stress within their Achilles tendons. Future studies are required to determine if these timing differences can cause changes in Achilles tendon loading.</p>
        <p>Only one study evaluating joint moments in those with Achilles tendinopathy was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Peak external tibial rotation moment was significantly reduced in those with Achilles tendinopathy, suggesting those with Achilles tendinopathy may have reduced torsional stresses within the Achilles tendon. Interestingly, this is contrary to traditional theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, it is possible that reduced tibial external rotation moments may be a compensation to reduce stress within the Achilles tendon. Prospective evaluation is now needed in order to adequately understand the association of external tibial rotation moments with Achilles tendinopathy.</p>

        <title>Plantar pressure parameters</title>
        <p>Three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] evaluated the association of a large number of dynamic plantar loading variables with Achilles tendinopathy. Findings showed those with Achilles tendinopathy demonstrated a significantly more laterally directed force distribution beneath the forefoot at forefoot flat (reduced time to peak force at medial heel and medio-lateral force distribution underneath the metatarsal heads at forefoot flat) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], a significantly more medially directed force distribution during midstance (reduced lateral deviation of the centre of pressure in the rear-and mid-foot) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and a significantly reduced total forward progression of the centre of force beneath the foot (reduced displacement of the posterior-anterior component of the centre of force at last foot contact, reduced posterior-anterior displacement of the centre of force during forefoot push-off phase, and reduced total posterior-anterior displacement of the centre of force) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Van Ginckel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] hypothesised that these findings may explain the development of Achilles tendinopathy as follows. First, the lateral foot roll-over pattern during the contact period of gait in those with Achilles tendinopathy may create diminished shock absorption and exert more stress on the lateral side of the Achilles tendon. Second, the more medially directed force distribution during the midstance phase may represent increased midfoot pronation, unlocking the midtarsal joint. This would increase forefoot mobility and impede the ability of the foot to act as a rigid lever during propulsion. Therefore, higher active tensile forces may be transferred through the Achilles tendon during propulsion, leading to tendon strains. This explanation is reflected in findings showing decreased forward transfer of the centre of force in those who developed Achilles tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p>

        <title>Lower limb muscle function</title>
        <p>Two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] compared EMG amplitude and onset timing of a number of lower limb muscles in those with and without Achilles tendinopathy. One study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] reported a number of differences in the onset timing of lower limb muscles between those with and without Achilles tendinopathy. Notably, the onset of tibialis anterior activity was significantly delayed, and the duration of soleus and lateral gastrocnemius activity was increased in those with Achilles tendinopathy. It is possible that this timing imbalance, particularly the increased duration of activity of the ankle plantarflexors may create prolonged loading of the Achilles tendon and contribute to tendinopathy development. Alternatively, reduced function of tibialis anterior has been theorised to reduce stiffness of the tendon-muscular system in the lower limb and impede its ability to tolerate and absorb impact forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This could create increased Achilles tendon loading and lead to tendinopathy.</p>
        <p>In regards to the amplitude of function of proximal lower limb muscles, one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] showed significant reductions in the amplitude of gluteus medius and rectus femoris but not biceps femoris shortly (100 ms) before or after heel strike in those with Achilles tendinopathy. As eccentric contraction of gluteus medius and rectus femoris is important to dissipate forces at the hip and knee respectively during early stance, reduced activity of these muscles may place greater stress at the foot and ankle causing increased Achilles tendon loading. However, conflicting results were reported for the amplitude of the muscles of the distal lower limb, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus and lateral gastrocnemius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The inconsistencies in findings may have resulted from differences in study design between the two studies (participants, gait analysed, electrode placement, parameters assessed and processing of data) as well as questionable reliability of lower limb EMG assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Based on the often conflicting results of these two studies, it is difficult to make inferences concerning the function of lower limb muscles in those with Achilles tendinopathy. Future well-designed prospective studies using reliable and valid assessments of lower limb muscle function are needed.</p>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>In addition to the limitations caused by the quality of the included studies described previously, there are several other limitations of this review. All of the included studies analysed running gait only. Given that one third of participants with Achilles tendinopathy are not physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the findings of this review may not be applicable to these people. There was a predominance of males across included studies, meaning findings from this review may have limited applicability to females. There are a number of biomechanical factors which were not included in this review, either because they have not been previously evaluated (e.g. joint moments at the foot and ankle) or data did not allow effect size calculations. Interestingly, results from the study of Donoghue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] which was excluded from data analysis (effect size calculations) in this review showed that individuals with Achilles tendinopathy displayed significantly less variation in lower limb kinematics than healthy controls. Only two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] included in this systematic review contained a prospective research design, with both investigating plantar pressures. Therefore, with the exception of a number of plantar pressure variables, the ability to distinguish between cause and effect in this review is limited. Sample sizes of included studies were generally small, meaning 95% CIs for effect size calculation were frequently large. This may have erroneously lead to non-significant effect size calculations, even if a true difference between groups existed. Future well-designed and adequately powered prospective studies are required to overcome these limitations.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Taken together, the findings from this systematic review suggest that those with Achilles tendinopathy have increased eversion range of motion of the rearfoot, reduced maximum lower leg abduction, reduced ankle joint dorsiflexion velocity and reduced knee flexion during gait. Those with Achilles tendinopathy also displayed altered plantar pressures and ground reaction forces and showed a reduced peak tibial external rotation moment. Further, those with Achilles tendinopathy displayed differences in the timing and amplitude of a number of lower limb muscles. Notably, the onset of tibialis anterior activity was significantly delayed, and the duration of soleus and lateral gastrocnemius activity was increased in those with Achilles tendinopathy. In addition, those with Achilles tendinopathy displayed reductions in the amplitude of gluteus medius and rectus femoris shortly before or after heel strike. The findings in regards to plantar loading of the foot and rearfoot eversion range of motion suggest that there are differences in foot function between those with and without Achilles tendinopathy. However, the findings of this review need to be interpreted with caution due to the limited quality of a number of the included studies. Future well-designed prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.</p>
      <p>Although the findings of this review need to be interpreted with caution, they may have implications regarding the management of Achilles tendinopathy. They suggest that normalising specific rearfoot kinematic variables, ground reaction force and plantar pressure variables, transverse plane tibial moments and function of specific lower limb muscles may reduce the risk of an individual developing Achilles tendinopathy and/or improve the effectiveness of interventions to manage this disorder. Future well-designed studies are required to determine if interventions such as foot orthoses and/or physical therapy targeting identified differences in those with Achilles tendinopathy are effective at preventing and/or treating the condition.</p>
