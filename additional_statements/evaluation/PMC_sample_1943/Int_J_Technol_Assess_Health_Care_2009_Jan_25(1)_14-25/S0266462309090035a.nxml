        <p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
          Magnetic Resonance Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) compared with alternative treatments
          for uterine fibroids in the United States.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used techniques of decision analysis and data from secondary
          sources to develop and estimate an economic model of the management of uterine fibroids
          among premenopausal women. Patients in the model receive treatment with MRgFUS, uterine
          artery embolization (UAE), abdominal myomectomy, hysterectomy, or pharmacotherapy. The
          model predicts total costs (including subsequent procedures) and quality-adjusted
          life-years (QALYs) for each treatment strategy over a lifetime horizon, discounted at 3
          percent, from a societal perspective. Data on treatment efficacy and safety were obtained
          from published and unpublished studies. Costs (2005 US$) were obtained from an analysis of
          a large administrative database and other secondary sources. Lost productivity costs were
          included in the base-case analysis, but excluded in a sensitivity analysis.</p>
        <p><bold>Results:</bold> UAE was associated with the most QALYs (17.39), followed by MRgFUS
          (17.36), myomectomy (17.31), hysterectomy (17.18), and pharmacotherapy (16.70).
          Pharmacotherapy was the least costly strategy ($9,200 per patient), followed by
          hysterectomy ($19,800), MRgFUS ($27,300), UAE ($28,900), and myomectomy ($35,100).
          Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per QALY gained) were $21,800 for
          hysterectomy, $41,400 for MRgFUS, and $54,200 for UAE; myomectomy was more costly and less
          effective than both MRgFUS and UAE. Results were sensitive to MRgFUS recurrence rates,
          MRgFUS procedure costs, and assumptions about quality of life following hysterectomy.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings suggest that MRgFUS is in the range of currently
          accepted criteria for cost-effectiveness, along with hysterectomy and UAE.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are the most common benign tumors in women of childbearing
        age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). Approximately 25 percent of women with
        fibroids experience symptoms such as heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, and pregnancy
        complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). In addition to the clinical
        burden, the economic burden of fibroids is also substantial; the total direct cost of
        uterine fibroids in the United States was recently estimated to be $2.2 billion annually
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).</p>
    <p>Although medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or hormonal
        therapy may be used to manage fibroid symptoms, some women require more aggressive forms of
        treatment. Historically, the most common treatment for fibroids has been hysterectomy;
        alternative options include myomectomy or uterine artery embolization (UAE). Each of these
        options has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, while hysterectomy eliminates
        symptoms permanently, it is associated with risks of surgical complications, lengthy
        recovery times, missed work, and potentially negative quality-of-life outcomes associated
        with the loss of the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Hysterectomy is
        also not appropriate for women who desire future childbearing. Myomectomy is often the
        treatment of choice for women who want to preserve fertility, but it is not completely
        effective in eliminating symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>) and is associated with surgical risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). UAE has a lower rate of major complications than
        hysterectomy or myomectomy, but a higher rate of minor complications, and is associated with
        more urgent visits and rehospitalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), and
        is not approved for women who desire future fertility.</p>
    <p>Magnetic Resonance Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a minimally invasive procedure
        that uses ultrasound as the treatment modality and magnetic resonance to provide guidance
        and real time feedback. MRgFUS has received FDA approval for the treatment of uterine
        fibroids for women who no longer desired fertility, and authors of published studies report
        that MRgFUS is a safe and effective treatment for fibroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">14</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>).</p>
    <p>Treatment choice depends not only on the fibroids' size and location, but also on patient
        preference, quality of life implications, and cost. Several economic studies of uterine
        fibroid treatments have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>), but no study to date has examined the
        cost-effectiveness of MRgFUS relative to each of the other treatment options available in
        the United States. Accordingly, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of MRgFUS
        relative to hysterectomy, myomectomy, UAE, and pharmacotherapy in the treatment of uterine
        fibroids among premenopausal women in the United States.</p>

      <title>METHODS</title>
      <sec id="sec2-1">
        <title>Model Overview</title>
        <p>We developed a Markov model to estimate the long-term outcomes and costs among a cohort
          of premenopausal women receiving treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids. The model
          assumes that women are offered first-line treatment with hysterectomy, myomectomy, UAE,
          MRgFUS, or pain management with pharmacotherapy only. The model is comprised of health
          states defined by presence/absence of symptoms and treatment received, with transitions
          across health states occurring at 6-month intervals. Each health state is associated with
          a utility and an economic cost. Estimation of the model involves tracking patients'
          transitions across health states over time and tabulating their quality-adjusted
          life-years (QALYs) and costs until death.</p>
        <p>With the exception of the pharmacotherapy arm, all patients entering the model undergo
          routine diagnostic tests before the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure
          1a</xref>). Women initiated with UAE or MRgFUS are assumed to undergo additional imaging
          tests to assess eligibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), as a proportion
          of women in each group will not be eligible due to the size and location of fibroids.
          Those who are determined to be ineligible for UAE or MRgFUS receive an alternative
          procedure. All women are assumed to be eligible for hysterectomy and myomectomy. <fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1a</label><caption><p>Screening and eligibility for treatments for uterine fibroids.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S0266462309090035_fig1"/></fig></p>
        <p>Patients in the model are at risk for procedure-related complications or death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 1b</xref>). Those who survive will either experience
          symptom relief or have treatment failure; those who fail are assumed a priori to receive
          second-line treatment with an alternative procedure. Women who are successfully treated
          are at risk of symptom recurrence until they reach menopause. In the model, women can
          receive a maximum of three rounds of treatment due to treatment failure or symptom
          recurrence. Third-line treatment is assumed to be hysterectomy in all cases, which
          completely eliminates the fibroids. <fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 1b</label><caption><p>Outcomes associated with treatments for uterine fibroids.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S0266462309090035_fig2"/></fig></p>
        <p>Patients initiated in the model are assumed to be premenopausal women (mean age, 40
          years) with previously untreated symptomatic fibroids. In base-case analyses, we estimated
          total costs (in 2005 dollars), QALYs, and cost-per-QALY gained from a societal
          perspective, including lost productivity costs and effects on quality of life. We
          evaluated an alternative scenario in which productivity costs were omitted, according to
          the Reference Case recommendations of the U.S. Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and
          Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="sec2-2">
        <title>Treatment of Uterine Fibroids</title>
        <p>With the exception of hysterectomy, no treatment completely eliminates uterine fibroids.
          Consequently, many women require follow-up treatment to achieve symptom resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>).
          Unfortunately, we are unaware of any published data on retreatment patterns (e.g., the
          distribution of second-line treatments received among women who fail first-line
          treatment). Furthermore, there are no published data on treatment patterns among women who
          are clinically ineligible for UAE or MRgFUS.</p>
        <p>Given the absence of published data, we made several assumptions regarding treatment
          patterns among women with uterine fibroids. First, we assumed that nearly all women who
          are determined to be ineligible for either MRgFUS or UAE would prefer the least invasive
          of the remaining treatment options (excluding pharmacotherapy). Second, based on the
          premise that women seeking treatment desire complete elimination of symptoms, we assumed
          that once a patient undergoes a procedure, she continues to be treated until her symptoms
          have resolved. If a patient fails first-line treatment, it is assumed that she receives
          second-line treatment with one of the more invasive strategies (based on treatment
          patterns estimated from a large administrative database). Patients who experience symptom
          recurrence are assumed to be retreated with the first-line strategy. All patients
          requiring a third-line strategy&#x2014;whether for second-line failure or symptom
          recurrence&#x2014;are assumed to receive hysterectomy. Finally, we assumed that
          pharmacotherapy was used only in instances in which the patient did not want to undergo an
          invasive procedure; consequently no further treatment was modeled for this strategy.</p>

          <title>Treatment Eligibility</title>
          <p>The proportion of women eligible for MRgFUS was estimated based on data from InSightec
            (Tirat Carmel, Isreal). Eligibility for UAE was estimated based on expert opinion
            (E.A.S.). It was assumed that all women are eligible for treatment with hysterectomy,
            myomectomy, or pharmacotherapy.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec2-3-2">
          <title>Treatment Efficacy</title>
          <p>We estimated the proportions of women experiencing symptom relief and recurrence with
            hysterectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), myomectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>), and UAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>) from Technology Assessment Reports and published studies. The
            efficacy of MRgFUS was estimated from unpublished clinical trial data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). We used data from a subgroup of patients
            treated according to a set of &#x201C;expanded&#x201D; guidelines, as these
            guidelines closely resemble the commercial guidelines approved for MRgFUS in 2004.</p>
          <p>Due to a scarcity of data on recurrence rates following treatment of uterine fibroids,
            we used retreatment rates to proxy for recurrence. We reviewed studies of various
            follow-up times and standardized all retreatment rates to 6-month risks using an
            exponential failure time model. In the model, we assumed a constant risk of recurrence
            in every cycle until menopause.</p>
          <p>The likelihood of recurrence with hysterectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), myomectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>), and UAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) were estimated from published studies.
            Recurrence with MRgFUS was based on retreatment rates from the same trial from which
            efficacy data were obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Probabilities
            of symptom relief and recurrence with each strategy were assumed to be the same
            regardless of whether the procedure served as a first-, second-, or third-line
          strategy.</p>

          <p>Consistent with Beinfeld et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), we
            obtained the rates of major complications and procedure-related death with hysterectomy
            from a large prospective study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Rates of
            major complications and procedure-related death for myomectomy were assumed to be equal

            complete blood count and urine pregnancy test). In addition, screening for UAE and
            MRgFUS was assumed to require an MRI (CPT code 72196).</p>
          <p>Procedure costs for hysterectomy, myomectomy, and UAE were derived from a large,
            retrospective study of commercially insured women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Costs included payments from all inpatient, outpatient, and prescription
            drug claims on the day(s) spent in hospital for the procedure. Costs for inpatient
            procedures included those for all services rendered during the hospital stay, and,
            therefore, included costs for treating procedure-related complications. The cost for
            MRgFUS was obtained from InSightec, and includes costs of the following: the ExAblate
            2000&#xAE; device used to perform MRgFUS (assuming a 60-month lease and routine
            maintenance); MRI time; physician (radiologist and surgeon), nursing, and technician
            time (including hourly wage plus fringe benefits); patient sedation; and recovery room.</p>
          <p>Women who are managed with pharmacotherapy alone are assumed to require four office
            visits, two ultrasounds, and two complete blood tests annually. Medication costs for
            analgesics and hormone therapy were obtained from a review of the economic burden of
            uterine fibroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>) and weighted by the
            distribution of women who are managed with each strategy as reported in the Thomson
            Medstat database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p>
          <p>We assumed that a proportion of women (20 percent) who receive a hysterectomy also
            receive estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy following surgery. Drug acquisition
            costs for these therapies were estimated based on average wholesale prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Finally, women who are successfully treated
            for their fibroids were assumed to receive one physician visit and one ultrasound

            alternative analyses in which we varied one or more parameters according to less
            conservative estimates than those used in the base case. As rates of complications with
            hysterectomy, myomectomy, and UAE vary widely in the literature, in the first
            alternative analysis we assumed that the rates of complications after hysterectomy,
            myomectomy, and UAE are equal to those used in a UK cost-effectiveness study of MRgFUS
              (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>) (i.e, 6.2 percent for hysterectomy and
            myomectomy and 4 percent for UAE). In addition, in the same analysis we assumed that
            there exist complication costs for these procedures that are not included in our
            base-case procedure cost (i.e., assuming that the complications occur after discharge).
            As costs of complications associated with these procedures are scarce in the literature,
            for the purposes of this alternative analysis we assumed that the costs of complications

        <title>Base-Case Results</title>
        <p>Lifetime discounted total costs (including lost productivity) per patient were lowest for
          the pharmacotherapy strategy at $9,200. Among the procedures, hysterectomy was the least
          costly ($19,800), followed by MRgFUS ($27,300), UAE ($28,900), and myomectomy ($35,100).
          The proportions of total costs attributable to screening, the procedure, lost
          productivity, and other costs varied by treatment strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 2</xref>). For example, procedure costs were highest for UAE,
          comprising over 68 percent of the total costs for that strategy, while hysterectomy and
          myomectomy had the largest proportions of total costs attributable to lost productivity
          (37 percent and 41 percent, respectively). Productivity costs for myomectomy are higher
          than those for hysterectomy because it results in the most follow-up procedures. In the
          model, myomectomy patients who failed initial treatment were assumed to undergo a
          hysterectomy, thus these patients incurred productivity losses due to myomectomy as well
          as hysterectomy. In contrast, hysterectomy is assumed to be 100 percent effective, so none
          of the hysterectomy patients required subsequent treatment. <fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Total costs by component per patient receiving alternative uterine fibroid

        <p>Under base-case assumptions, treatment with UAE was associated with the most discounted
          QALYs (17.39), followed by MRgFUS (17.36), myomectomy (17.31), hysterectomy (17.18), and
          pharmacotherapy (16.70). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, or costs-per-QALY

          (relative to hysterectomy), and $54,200 for UAE (relative to MRgFUS) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). Myomectomy was strongly dominated, meaning
          that it was more costly than at least one more effective strategy. <table-wrap id="tab2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Cost-effectiveness of treatments for uterine fibroids.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S0266462309090035_tab2"/><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tab2-tfn001"><p>*per patient, discounted at 3.0%</p></fn><fn id="tab2-tfn002"><p><sup>&#x2020;</sup>&#x2018;Strongly dominated&#x2019; meaning the

        <p>Results of the one-way sensitivity analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>. Model parameters were varied across plausible ranges and the
          strategies that would be cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and
          $100,000 per QALY gained, alternatively, were identified. Note that the strategy that is
          most cost-effective at a specified threshold is not necessarily the one with the lowest
          ratio, but rather the one with a ratio that comes closest to the threshold without
          exceeding it. For example, in the base case, if a payer's willingness to pay is $50,000
          per QALY gained, the cost-effective strategy would not be hysterectomy ($21,800 per QALY
          gained), but MRgFUS ($41,400 per QALY gained), as this is the alternative that would
          provide the greatest benefit at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio not exceeding the
          specified criterion of $50,000 per QALY gained. As UAE ($54,200 per QALY gained) has an
          incremental cost-effectiveness ratio relative to MRgFUS that comes closest to a $100,000
          threshold without going over it, it would be the treatment of choice for a payer with a
          threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. <table-wrap id="tab3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>The impact of variation in model parameters on the incremental cost-effectiveness

        <p>The cost-effectiveness ratios and the most cost-effective treatment choices at the
          specified thresholds were most sensitive to the probability of symptom relief, the
          probability of symptom recurrence, and procedure costs for UAE and MRgFUS. For example,
          when the probability of recurrence with UAE is varied from its low (2 percent) to its high
          (5 percent) value (base case = 3 percent), its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranges
          from $26,100 to $317,300 per QALY gained relative to MRgFUS. Therefore, at a cost-per-QALY
          threshold of $50,000 per QALY, UAE would be cost-effective if its recurrence rate was at
          the low end of the range, whereas MRgFUS was cost-effective based on this threshold in the
          base case. At the high end of the range of UAE recurrence rates, hysterectomy becomes
          cost-effective; because UAE is the second-line treatment for MRgFUS, factors that make UAE
          less attractive also adversely affect the MRgFUS strategy. If MRgFUS had a recurrence rate
          as low as 3 percent (base case = 6 percent), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for
          MRgFUS (vs. hysterectomy) and UAE (vs. MRgFUS) would be $28,700 and $603,000 per QALY
          gained respectively. Alternatively, at a threshold of 7 percent recurrence, MRgFUS becomes
          dominated by UAE. The lifetime utility decrement associated with hysterectomy also has a
          substantial impact on the cost-effectiveness ratios. When the decrement is varied from 0.0
          to 0.025 (base case = 0.015), MRgFUS ranges from being dominated by hysterectomy to having
          an incremental cost-per-QALY gained of $30,100. Results were fairly insensitive to

          analysis are similar to base case. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are $6,700

        <p>Due to the wide-ranging estimates of rates and costs of complications associated with

          assumed that the rates of complications with hysterectomy and myomectomy are each 6.2
          percent, and the complication rate with UAE is equal 4 percent. In addition, we assumed
          additional costs of these complications equal to 50 percent of the procedure cost. Under
          these assumptions, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for hysterectomy relative to
          pharmacotherapy is $32,500 per QALY gained, the ratio for MRgFUS relative to hysterectomy
          is $55,800 per QALY gained, and the ratio for UAE relative to MRgFUS is $133,600 per QALY
          gained. As in the base case, myomectomy is dominated due to the fact that it is more
          costly and less effective than at least one other alternative.</p>
        <p>If the 6-month recurrence rate with MRgFUS is assumed to be 3.6 percent, the incremental

        <p>In the third alternative analysis, we vary the eligibility rate for MRgFUS to 50 percent
          and 90 percent. Should the eligibility rate with MRgFUS increase to 50 percent (from a
          base case of 35 percent), the cost per QALY gained for hysterectomy relative to
          pharmacotherapy is $21,800, the cost per QALY gained for MRgFUS relative to hysterectomy
          is $38,700, and the cost per QALY gained for UAE relative to MRgFUS is $64,300.
          Corresponding figures under the 90 percent eligibility assumption are $21,800, $30,100,

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Our results suggest that MRgFUS is in the range of currently accepted criteria for
        cost-effectiveness, along with hysterectomy and UAE. Myomectomy was both more costly and
        less effective than MRgFUS and UAE. In the base-case analysis, incremental
        cost-effectiveness ratios were $21,800 per QALY gained for hysterectomy, $41,400 for MRgFUS,
        and $54,200 for UAE. Results are sensitive to changes in rates of fibroid recurrence with
        the different treatments, procedure costs, eligibility rate with MRgFUS, and assumptions
        regarding quality-of-life following hysterectomy.</p>
      <p>Very few studies of the cost-effectiveness of uterine fibroids treatment exist, likely due
        in part to the scarcity of data on efficacy and safety of these procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). Beinfeld and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) compared the cost-effectiveness of UAE with hysterectomy and reported
        that UAE is cheaper and more effective than hysterectomy. In contrast, our results indicate
        that UAE is more costly and more effective (as measured by QALYs gained) relative to
        hysterectomy. Unlike Beinfeld et al., we included screening costs, treatment eligibility
        criteria, and multiple rounds of follow-up treatment for failure or recurrence. These
        components likely caused the average cost of UAE to be higher than hysterectomy in our
        analysis relative to Beinfeld.</p>
      <p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality compared costs and outcomes of hysterectomy
        and myomectomy, and concluded that hysterectomy results in favorable outcomes for up to 2
        years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). However, researchers concluded that there
        were insufficient data for a head-to-head comparison, and thus gave no recommendations for
        the most appropriate treatment strategy.</p>
      <p>Most recently, Zowall and colleagues estimated the cost-effectiveness analysis of MRgFUS
        versus a &#x201C;current practice&#x201D; strategy (distribution of UAE, myomectomy,
        and hysterectomy) from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). They report that MRgFUS is associated with cost
        savings and a small QALY gain relative to current practice. Our model differs from theirs in
        several major ways. First, while Zowall's model follows women until they reach menopause,
        ours is a lifetime model and includes physician monitoring costs and effects on
        quality-of-life that persist over a woman's lifetime. Notable among these lifelong effects
        in our model is the quality-of-life decrement attributable to having had hysterectomy.
        Second, in contrast to Zowall, we included costs of screening tests to determine eligibility
        (as they vary by treatment strategy); we also accounted for the fact that not everyone who
        is screened for UAE or MRgFUS is eligible to receive the procedure. In fact, many women who
        are initiated with UAE or MRgFUS end up receiving a different procedure altogether. The
        differences in relative prices for the various procedures is a third important factor. For
        example, the cost of hysterectomy in the UK study was estimated at &#xA3;2,727
        (approximately $5,500 at current exchange rates), while we estimated the cost of
        hysterectomy in the United States to be $10,155, and assumed that all women who failed two
        lines of treatment received a hysterectomy. A fourth difference from Zowall et al. is that
        we used recurrence rates for MRgFUS derived from the full clinical trial population, whereas
        they restricted their estimates to the subset of patients for whom the nonperfused fibroid
        volume was 60 percent or more of the total. In an alternative analyses in which we used
        their recurrence assumptions, the qualitative result that MRgFUS was cost-effective at a
        criterion of $50,000 per QALY was unchanged, but MRgFUS also became cost-effective at a
        criterion of $100,000 per QALY (because the incremental ratio for UAE compared to MRgFUS
        rose to $248,000 per QALY.) Finally, Zowall et al. compared MRgFUS to a single strategy that
        assumes 25 percent of women receive UAE, 25 percent receive myomectomy, and 50 percent
        receive hysterectomy. Our model includes a separate comparison with each of these
        strategies, to reflect the different outcomes and costs associated with each. The fact that
        the comparator to MRgFUS in the Zowall study is a composite that includes myomectomy
        (strongly dominated according to our model) is likely a large contributing factor to the
        differences between our results and those of Zowall et al.</p>
      <p>Some important limitations of our study should be noted. Any cost-effectiveness study is
        subject to the limitations surrounding uncertainty in key model parameters. Because one-way
        sensitivity analyses revealed that the cost-effectiveness of three treatment options was
        very sensitive to several parameters and assumptions, we did not conduct a formal
        probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Such an analysis would have reinforced our conclusion
        that the current choice of treatment could easily go any of three different ways.</p>
      <p>We assumed that 35 percent of women who present for treatment with MRgFUS will be
        clinically eligible to receive the procedure. While a recent study reported that 14 percent
        of women inquiring about participating in a trial of MRgFUS were eligible for the procedure,
        the authors acknowledged that their findings are likely to be lower than the reality due to
        restrictions imposed by their institution's Committee for Human Rights and the FDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). They conclude that once the procedure is used in
        clinical practice, eligibility rates will be higher. Our estimate is based on clinical input
        and communication from participating sites. We believe that the eligibility rate will
        increase as physicians become more comfortable with the technology and it is more widely
        assimilated into clinical practice.</p>
      <p>Estimation of the probability of symptom relief with fibroid treatments posed some
        difficulty due to the scarcity of randomized controlled trials on fibroid treatments,
        measurement differences across studies, and varying lengths of follow-up. Estimating
        recurrence rates is also challenging. Recurrence can be defined in terms of symptoms or
        alternatively in terms of re-growth; due to the inconsistency in definitions, we used rates
        of retreatment to proxy for recurrence. We reviewed studies that reported retreatment rates
        regardless of the specific procedure (e.g., hysterectomy, myomectomy) received, standardized
        rates to 6-month risks using an exponential failure time model, and assumed a constant risk
        of recurrence in every 6-month period until menopause in the model. While recurrence is
        unlikely to be constant over time, at present no long-term data are available to contradict
        our assumption.</p>
      <p>Quantitative data on the short- and long-term impact of hysterectomy on quality of life
        also are limited. With respect to short-term effects, we followed Beinfeld et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), and assumed a 0.20 reduction in the utility in the
        cycle in which complications occur as well as a 0.20 reduction during recovery from
        hysterectomy. Regarding long-term effects, while some studies suggest that women experience
        an improvement in their quality of life following hysterectomy due to the fact that the
        condition for which they sought treatment is gone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), other studies cite long-term
        negative effects such as an increase in cardiovascular risk, mental health issues, sexual
        problems, incontinence, and vaginal vault prolapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). We did not account for an increase in cardiovascular disease risk among women
        who had hysterectomy, as this is controversial and the quantitative impact is unclear.
        However, we also excluded the reduction in the risk of uterine cancer, so we believe that
        any bias from excluding long-term risks is small. In our model, the quality of life
        improvement due to elimination of fibroid symptoms following hysterectomy is captured in the
        health-state utility weights; long-term reductions in quality of life is captured by a
        lifetime decrement of 0.015 for women who received a hysterectomy. While we found similar
        estimates for quality of life decrements associated with comparable chronic conditions
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>), data to support the long-term effects of
        hysterectomy on quality of life would strengthen our conclusions.</p>
      <p>Our analysis does not include the impact of treatment on childbearing choices. Myomectomy
        is the only procedure currently recommended for women who desire future fertility. Although
        MRgFUS is the least invasive of the procedures studied here and there exist case studies of
        successful pregnancies among women who have received it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), MRgFUS is currently limited in
        its indication for use among women who do not desire future fertility. As the choice of
        treatment depends not only on cost and effectiveness but also on patient preferences, a
        study of patient preference (particularly with respect to future childbearing) for the
        various treatment strategies for uterine fibroids represents an area for future research.</p>
      <p>Our study represents the first cost-effectiveness analysis to compare all of the major
        treatment options for women with uterine fibroids in the United States. Our findings suggest
        that along with UAE and hysterectomy, use of MRgFUS among premenopausal women with uterine
        fibroids is within the range of currently accepted criteria for cost-effectiveness. Until
        more data on the long-term efficacy of treatment options become available, any of the three
        could be the cost-effective choice, depending on patient preferences and resource
        availability. Although myomectomy was not found to be cost-effective in our analysis, it
        will remain an option for women planning future pregnancy until additional safety data on
        other uterine-sparing treatment strategies become available. Future cost-effectiveness
        studies would benefit from long-term studies that assess rates of recurrence and retreatment
        over time, as well as preferences for and quality-of-life impacts of the various treatments
        for uterine fibroids.</p>
