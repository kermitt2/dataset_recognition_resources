        <p>Snail2 is a marker of malignancy in epithelial tumours; however, in sarcomas, it is not known if this protein is present. Here we examine the expression of Snail2 in one type of sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and explore its relationship to tumour grade, subtype and anatomical location in cases of long bone and cranial bone osteosarcoma. Long bone osteosarcomas typically have a much greater metastatic capability and a poorer prognosis. We find that Snail2 is expressed in the three main subtypes of long bone osteosarcoma&#x2014;osteoblastic, chondroblastic and fibroblastic. Regression analysis showed that Snail&#x2009;2 expression was statistically correlated with tumour grade (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014) in all of these subtypes. Snail2 was only expressed in high-grade cranial bone osteosarcomas, suggesting a link between Snail2 expression and metastasis. This is the first time Snail2 has been associated with any sarcoma, and this study shows that Snail2 may be a useful prognostic marker for this disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Snail family of transcription factors, of which there are at least three members, are zinc finger proteins that function as transcriptional repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Target genes are recognised by a conserved carboxy-terminal domain that binds a hexanucleotide DNA motif (5&#x2032;-CACCTG-3&#x2032;) known as the E-box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The functions of Snail1 and Snail2, which was originally named Slug, have been best characterised in the developing embryo where they have been shown to regulate epithelial&#x2013;mesenchymal transitions (EMT).</p>
      <p>This function of Snail family members has been most studied in neural crest cells, where Snail2 was originally defined as a marker of pre-migratory and migratory neural crest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is now known that it plays a key role in the process of EMT by downregulating E-cadherin, a cell&#x2013;cell adhesion molecule, therefore allowing the cells to break their cell&#x2013;cell contacts and become mesenchymal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, during embryonic development, Snail2 is also expressed in some mesenchymal tissues. For example, during long bone development in the mouse, Snail2 is present in proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes and also perichondrial/periosteal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since these tissues are originally derived from mesenchyme, they do not undergo EMT; therefore, it is likely that Snail2 also regulates other processes. Indeed, it has recently been suggested that Snail2 promotes differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is well-known that developmental mechanisms are recapitulated in many types of cancer. This is particularly true for Snail2 signalling which contributes to progression in a range of epithelial tumour types (e.g., breast, lung and ovarian cancers) by regulating the motility and plasticity of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In this context, Snail2 is presumed to be a part of the mechanism that switches the tumour cell phenotype from epithelial to mesenchymal in the process of cell invasion with disease progression. There is, however, a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cancers, the sarcomas, which originate from numerous cell types including fibroblasts, chondroblasts and osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since Snail2 is known to be expressed in many of these mesenchymal tissues in the developing embryo, it is possible that its expression may be reactivated in the process of tumourigenesis; however, to the best of our knowledge, there are currently no reports describing its expression or function in mesenchymal tumours.</p>
      <p>Osteosarcoma is one type of mesenchymal tumour and is the most prevalent primary bone tumour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], occurring predominantly in the metaphyseal region of long bones in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is a malignant tumour that often metastasizes to other organs, with a predilection for the lung. Although relatively rare in humans, with one to three cases per million annually in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it is much more common in larger breeds of middle-aged dogs with about 8,000 cases diagnosed each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Clinically canine and human osteosarcomas are indistinguishable with regard to histology and gene expression, and in both cases, the primary tumour tends to develop in the appendicular skeleton and is associated with a high risk of metastasis to the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has therefore been proposed that these naturally occurring canine osteosarcomas could be used as an appropriate model for the human disease due to these similarities in tumour biology and metastatic behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] coupled with the easier access to clinical material.</p>
      <p>We therefore undertook a study using archived canine material to determine whether Snail2 is re-expressed in osteosarcomas, of various histological grades and subtypes, from different anatomical locations. Furthermore, to determine whether Snail2 expression is common to tumours from other species, we also characterised Snail2 expression in feline appendicular osteosarcomas. Our finding that expression of Snail2 protein is common to both canine and feline osteosarcomas and the very high genetic similarity between canine and human osteosarcomas raises the potential that Snail2 may also be present in human cases.</p>

        <p>The tissues used in this study were archived material from a commercial veterinary diagnostic laboratory.

        <title>Tumour grading</title>
        <p>Osteosarcomas were classified as described by the World Health Organisation (WHO; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]), being divided into osteoblastic, fibroblastic and chondroblastic types on the basis of the extracellular matrix produced by the neoplastic cells. Tumours were then graded as well-differentiated, intermediate grade and poorly differentiated using standard WHO criteria relating to nuclear pleomorphism, cellular atypia and mitotic index.</p>

        <p>Sections were de-waxed in xylene, rehydrated in a graded series of ethanols and then washed in distilled water (dH<sub>2</sub>O) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30&#xA0;min. Sections were then pre-blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 10% calf serum (PBS/TX-100/CS) for 45&#xA0;min and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4&#xB0;C. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-Snail2 (4&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml; Santa Cruz, Inc., USA), rabbit anti-Snail1 (4&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml; Santa Cruz, Inc., USA) and goat anti-Runx2 (4&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml; Santa Cruz). For negative controls, either rabbit or goat IgG was substituted for the primary antibody. The sections were then incubated with either rabbit or goat biotin conjugated secondary antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 45&#xA0;min. Detection was carried out using the Vector ABC method with 3.3&#x2032;-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride as substrate (Vector Labs, Peterborough, UK). After staining, sections were counterstained with 1% haematoxylin solution for 1&#xA0;min, dehydrated in a series of graded ethanols, cleared with xylene and mounted using VectaMount (Vector Labs). Sections were viewed using a Leica DM4000B light microscope and photographed with a DC 500 Leica digital camera (Leica, Solms, Germany).</p>

        <p>The specificity of Snail2 antibody was verified using Western blotting in various human, rodent and canine osteosarcoma cell lines and in Snail2 overexpressing HEK293 cells. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Briefly, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in denaturing lysis buffer. Genomic DNA was sheared by passage through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen) and proteins and DNA denatured by boiling for 5&#xA0;min. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Perbio, Chester, UK). Ten micrograms of protein was resolved using SDA-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schliecher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Membranes were blocked for 1&#xA0;h in 5% BSA before being incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare, Amersham Biosciences). Refer to Supplemental Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MO8" ref-type="">1</xref>.</p>

        <title>Grades of canine osteosarcoma, histological features and Snail2 expression</title>
        <p>Osteosarcoma cases in this study were graded from high grade (poorly differentiated) to low grade (well differentiated; Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> A&#x2013;C), where high grade is associated with a more aggressive phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Of the 20 cases of long bone osteosarcoma examined, 11 were high-grade, five were intermediate-grade and four were low-grade osteosarcomas (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Histological examination of high-grade osteosarcoma tissue revealed a highly cellular tumour mass with pleomorphic neoplastic cells surrounded by sparse areas of bony matrix (osteoid; Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> A). In contrast, low-grade osteosarcomas had a more uniform cellular morphology with more organised osteoid and tumour bone (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> C). In high-grade tumours, Snail2 expression was prominent and largely nuclear (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> D), compared with intermediate- and low-grade cases where expression decreased progressively (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> E, F). In contrast, Snail1 had a very limited expression that did not correlate with tumour grade (Supp. Fig&#xA0;<xref rid="MO9" ref-type="">2</xref>).

        <p>Classically, canine osteosarcoma is characterised by the presence of spindle-shaped cells producing osteoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> B). However, several histological subtypes are identifiable depending on the cellular differentiation and type of matrix produced (osteoid, cartilage or fibrous tissue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In humans, osteoblastic osteosarcomas account for approximately 70% of cases, while chondroblastic and fibroblastic tumours occur at roughly 10% each [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The remaining 10% include telangiectatic (vascular) and giant cell osteosarcoma. In this study, histological examination of 20 canine appendicular skeleton osteosarcomas revealed that osteoblastic (15 cases, 75%) were most prominent, followed by chondroblastic (three cases, 15%) and fibroblastic (two cases, 10%; Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> A, D, G; Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In all histopathological subtypes of high-grade osteosarcoma, Snail2 protein was present (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> C, F, I). The initial observation that low-grade tumours had less Snail2 protein also holds true for all three subtypes.

        <title>Canine osteoblastic subtype osteosarcomas express the preosteoblast marker Runx2</title>
        <p>Osteoblastic osteosarcomas are the most common histological subtype, and they display characteristics of undifferentiated osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore to further demonstrate that the canine osteosarcomas in this study had osteoblastic characteristics, we looked for expression of Runx2, a transcriptional regulator necessary for the commitment of mesenchymal cells into the osteoblastic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This analysis showed nuclear Runx2 immunoreactivity in the osteoblastic subtypes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> B), but not in either the fibroblastic or chondroblastic subtypes that we examined (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> E, F, H, I). Thus, Runx2 staining shows that high-grade osteoblastic osteosarcomas contain large numbers of preosteoblast-like cells.

        <title>Snail2 and Runx2 co-localise in high-grade tibial canine osteosarcomas</title>
        <p>Since these canine osteosarcomas expressed both Snail2 and Runx2, we assessed whether these molecules co-localised in cells of 11 high-grade tibial osteosarcomas. Both Snail2 and Runx2 were present in the nuclei of cells in high-grade neoplasm (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;11/11; Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> B&#x2013;D, F&#x2013;H).

        <p>Similar analysis in low-grade tumours showed barely detectable levels of Snail2 and an absence of Runx2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> J, K, L). This result suggests that Snail2 is localised in preosteoblast-like cells in high-grade tumours.</p>

        <title>Localisation of Snail2 and Runx2 in canine osteosarcomas from cranial skeleton</title>
        <p>Osteosarcomas of cranial bones are less common than tumours of appendicular bones, and in canines, there is usually a better clinical outcome with only 10% of tumours undergoing metastasis, in comparison to osteosarcomas of the appendicular skeleton in which 75&#x2013;85% undergo metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Having determined the localisation of Snail2 protein in osteosarcomas of the appendicular skeleton, we went on to characterise Snail2 localisation in ten osteosarcomas from flat bones of the cranial skeleton (see Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We found intense Snail2 staining in high-grade cranial skeletal osteosarcomas (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> B, C), and this co-localised with Runx2 in the nuclei of cells in these tumours (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> D, E).

        <p>In low-grade osteosarcomas, Snail2 was barely detectable and Runx2 was absent (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> G&#x2013;J). Interestingly, Snail2 was detected in lower numbers of osteosarcoma cases of the cranial skeleton (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;4/10) in comparison with long bone tumours (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;20/20). This suggests that Snail2 is expressed in a higher proportion of tumours of the appendicular skeleton than in the cranial counterparts.</p>

        <title>Localisation of Snail2 and Runx2 in feline appendicular osteosarcomas</title>
        <p>Osteosarcomas of the appendicular skeleton behave differently in felines compared to canines where they tend to be metastatically more aggressive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We therefore compared the cellular pattern of immunolocalisation of Snail2 in feline versus canine appendicular osteosarcomas. In feline osteosarcomas (see Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), a similar pattern of immunolocalisation to that seen in canine osteosarcomas was found. Prominent Snail2 immunoreactivity was detected in high-grade tumours (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> B, C) compared to barely detectable staining in the low-grade tumours (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> G, I). Similarly Runx2 protein was also present in the cells of high-grade tumours (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> D) but absent in low-grade tumours. This proves there is a consistent correlation between grade and Snail2 in more than one species. However, it also suggests that nuclear Snail2 is not a good correlate for metastasis in cats at least, as the overall incidence of this complication in this species is low.

        <title>Correlation between expression of Snail2 and tumour grade</title>
        <p>The intensity of Snail2 immunostaining was scored based on four levels: negative (0), weakly (1), moderately (2) or strongly positive (3). A second score was employed for evaluating the extent of Snail2 expression. This was based on a three-point scale for distribution, with slides being scored as 0&#x2013;15% (1), 16&#x2013;30% (2) and &gt;30% (3) of cells stained. For each sample, a cumulative score was also generated by multiplying the intensity and distribution scores for Snail2 staining. This serves to expand the number of possible scores for any given tumour. Data have been summarized in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. To determine whether any of these scores could be used as a prognostic indicator of severity, we tested the correlation between tumour grade and each score. This showed that both increased intensity for Snail2 and cumulative score are associated with severity of tumour (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.39, 95% CI 1.62&#x2013;80.0, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014; OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.57, 95% CI 1.16&#x2013;5.69, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.020, respectively). However, distribution scores for Snail2 showed no statistically significant correlation with different tumour grade categories (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.94, 95% CI 0.85&#x2013;18.2, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.08).

An ordinal logistic regression was fitted for the feline data set; however, the algorithm failed to converge due to quasi-complete separation as a result of the small group sizes (See supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="">3</xref>). When Snail2 intensity increases the tumour grade also increases (Kendall tau-<italic>b</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.757, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; see Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Osteosarcomas are aggressive tumours that show a wide range of histological variants and cellular differentiation states. In canines and also humans, approximately 77% of osteosarcomas occur in the appendicular skeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The site of origin of a tumour is an important factor that largely determines its characteristics. Typically tumours originating in the appendicular skeleton demonstrate a much more aggressive behaviour than those from other sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Advances in clinical management of osteosarcoma have been made; however, our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease is still rather limited. To date, there have been a limited number of prognostic markers identified that could be used in the clinic to identify patients with either a favourable or poor prognosis.</p>
      <p>Two molecules that have been linked to metastasis in osteosarcoma are c-met and ezrin. C-met, the receptor for the hepatocyte growth factor, was found to be upregulated in primary canine osteosarcomas (including metastases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and inhibition of its function was able to limit invasion of canine osteosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Ezrin, a cytoskeletal linker protein of the ERM family, has also been found in both canine and human osteosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and to be correlated with metastasis and poor clinical outcome.</p>
      <p>There are, however, other genes that may be indicative of a more malignant phenotype, for example, pRB, p53 and the proto-oncogene c-fos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] that are expressed in osteosarcoma. To date, mouse models of osteosarcoma have been developed, for example, pRb and p53 inactivation or c-fos activation, to aid in the study of osteosarcoma biology. These models do indeed produce tumours that contain neoplastic bone; however, it is unlikely that any of them truly recapitulates the human disease. They were all derived by a monogenetic event and thus may not sufficiently represent the heterogeneity of osteosarcoma. These models therefore may be inappropriate for studying the biology of these tumours and more importantly for testing therapies designed for human osteosarcoma. The similarity between canine and human osteosarcoma, coupled with the relatively higher number of canine cases, may make this a more apt model for studying osteosarcoma biology and the design and testing of therapies for human osteosarcoma.</p>
      <p>In this study, we describe the expression of the transcription factor Snail2 in spontaneously occurring models of osteosarcoma, the first time this protein has been identified in this type of tumour in any species. Furthermore, we showed by immunohistochemistry that there was a positive correlation between levels of Snail2 expression and grade of tumour, suggesting that Snail2 could be another predictor of clinical outcome in cases of osteosarcoma.</p>
      <p>In epithelial tumours, Snail2 is an established marker of malignancy contributing to both the onset and progression of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The best characterised function of Snail2 in epithelial tumours is its ability to promote EMT, which is achieved in part by directly downregulating the cellular adhesion molecule E-cadherin and thus promoting cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>Since osteosarcomas are tumours of mesenchymal origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], there is no need for cells to undergo EMT; therefore, Snail2 must be regulating other processes in this tumour type. However, the precise role that Snail2 plays in these mesenchymal tumours is yet to be defined. During embryonic development, Snail2 is expressed in some mesenchymally derived cells, for example, in proliferating chondrocytes and osteoblast precursors in endochondral bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Some of the functions of Snail2 in osteoblasts have recently been identified. In this instance, Snail2 has been shown to bind to the promoter of Runx2 and promote transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since Runx2 is a key regulator of the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteoblastic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], Snail2 therefore promotes osteoblastic differentiation. It should be noted this is in marked contrast to the relationship between Snail1 and Runx2, where Snail1 represses Runx2 and there is an inverse correlation in their expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This suggests that Snail2 and Snail1 have opposing roles in osteoblast differentiation. This is a rare departure from the norm, where Snail1 and Snail2 have similar or additive functions, and suggests that Snail transcription factors can have more complex roles than previously thought.</p>
      <p>In our study, both Snail2 and Runx2 were present in osteoblastic osteosarcoma subtypes and in many cases were co-expressed. This therefore suggests that increased Snail2 expression upregulates Runx2 in osteoblastic osteosarcomas. The presence of Runx2 in these tumours shows that they contain cells with the characteristics of osteoblastic progenitor cells. This is in agreement with other studies where osteosarcomas were shown to contain cells that have become trapped in the early stages of differentiation and that they remain refractory to osteogenic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It could therefore be that maintained Snail2 and Runx2 expression results in an inability of these cells to differentiate fully, trapping them in preosteoblastic proliferative phenotype. Alternatively, it may be that Snail2 and Runx2 are expressed purely as a consequence of cells remaining in a preosteoblastic state (see Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). While we did not find an association between Snail2 and Runx2 in chondroblastic or fibroblastic osteosarcomas, we note that the numbers of these tumours examined were low.

The increased levels of Snail2 keep Runx2 expression equally high. This prevents progression of cells to subsequent early and mature osteoblast states</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13277_2010_146_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p>
      <p>It may be possible that Snail2 has other functions in osteosarcoma. One such function could be to decrease cell&#x2013;cell adhesion and therefore promote cellular migration producing a more aggressive tumour. Indeed, in canine appendicular long bone tumours, which we have shown to have high levels of Snail2, metastasis occurs in 80&#x2013;90% of cases. We therefore went on examine Snail2 in canine osteosarcomas of the skull, which are rarer and have a lower frequency of metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In these cases, it was evident that Snail2 expression was present in much lower proportion of cases. This implies that Snail 2 could be involved in regulating cell migration. Alternatively, the different rates of metastasis may be purely due to the different origins of these tumours. It may be that neural crest-derived cells that give rise to cranial tumours are inherently less able to metastasize.</p>
      <p>To further investigate whether Snail2 expression could be linked with metastasis, we analysed a series of feline osteosarcomas from appendicular long bone. In these cases, metastasis is known to occur in approximately 5&#x2013;10% of animals compared with 80&#x2013;90% in canines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We would therefore expect lower levels of Snail2 in these cases if it is a regulator of metastasis. Our data show that in some of the feline cases, high levels of Snail2 were present and therefore Snail2 may not be associated with metastasis in felines. This study is, however, limited by the lack of clinical follow-up information, and we do not know whether the individual feline cases with high levels of Snail2 developed metastases in the future. It could therefore be possible that Snail2 promotes metastasis in felines; however, we currently lack the clinical data to investigate this. Further analysis of the role of Snail2 and Runx2 in cell&#x2013;cell adhesion and in promoting cellular migration of osteosarcoma cells in other species including humans would allow us to confirm association of Snail2 with metastasis. Alternatively, there may be other explanations for why canine osteosarcomas are more metastatic than those in felines. We know that tumour development and metastasis are multifactorial events; therefore, it may be that in canines these tumours are genetically more prone to the events that induce metastasis and expression of Snail2 is a single event along this pathway.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, Snail2 is statistically correlated with tumour severity in appendicular canine osteosarcomas. Since canine and human osteosarcomas are genetically very similar, this raises the possibility that Snail2 could be used as a prognostic marker in cases of human appendicular osteosarcoma.</p>
