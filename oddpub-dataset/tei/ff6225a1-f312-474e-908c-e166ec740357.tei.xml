<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>In this prospective observational study 100 participants of 4 different age groups were recruited from hospital staff and from the routine vascular patient population of the neurosonological lab at the Department of Neurology, Charite ´Campus Mitte, Charite ´-Universita ¨tsmedizin Berlin.</s><s>25 subjects were enrolled in each of 4 pre-specified age groups.</s><s>The main outcome parameters assessed with B-mode ultrasound were PD, PCT and pupillary constriction amplitude.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study participants</head><p><s>Inclusion criteria were age !</s><s>18 and 80 years and a bilateral best corrected visual acuity (VA) !</s><s>0.8 (20/25 in United States customary units).</s><s>Furthermore, clinical examination of pupillary function had to be normal.</s><s>Exclusion criteria were any clinically detectable pupillary dysfunction, visual field defects or oculomotor abnormalities.</s><s>Patients with a history of any ocular disease (e.g.</s><s>glaucoma, cataract, macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy), neurological diseases that can potentially cause optic neuropathy or optic atrophy (e.g.</s><s>multiple sclerosis, clinically isolated syndrome, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuritis or Leber hereditary optic neuropathy), or any autoimmune or systemic diseases that might have an effect on the autonomic nervous system (e.g.</s><s>Guillain-Barre śyndrome, viral and limbic encephalitis, multiple system atrophy, sarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus), patients that had undergone any type of ocular surgery or laser treatment in the past and patients taking topical or systemic medications potentially affecting pupillary function were likewise excluded from the study.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B-mode ultrasound technique</head><p><s>All subjects were studied in supine position under standardized dimmed light conditions (room lighting 30 Lux) of the ultrasound examination room with the examiner sitting at the head side (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>To adapt to the light level, study participants spent at least 10 minutes in the room before testing.</s><s>All insonations were performed by the same investigator (SJS) with the subject's eyes closed using an Esaote Mylab 25 system equipped with a 10 MHz linear array probe.</s><s>Power settings were reduced to minimum, according to the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) insonation approach, and we adhered to current guidelines for orbital insonation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>B-mode settings were adjusted for near-field eye examination.</s><s>Each pupil was visualized with the probe positioned flatly on the lower eyelid, leveraging Bell's phenomenon.</s><s>For assessment of the PLR, subjects had the eyes closed, a penlight was activated by an assisting investigator approximately 2 cm in front of each closed eye and the light reaction of each pupil was digitally documented (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In every examination the same standard penlight was used with a luminous emittance of 70,000 Lux and a stimulus time of 2 seconds to ensure constant wavelength, intensity and duration of the light stimulus as the PLR is dependent on these properties of light.</s><s>Each assessment was performed in exactly the same order starting by measuring the PD of the left eye at rest as well as during ipsilateral and contralateral light stimulus (L stim ) and subsequently performing the same examinations on the right eye.</s><s>The extent of pupillary constriction was then calculated as the difference between PD at rest and during ipsilateral and contralateral L stim .</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We here report the first systematic evaluation of B-mode ultrasound for assessment of pupillary function and provide normal values for ultrasound derived PD and PCT values for 100 subjects in different age groups.</s><s>PLR assessment with ultrasound in our study was well tolerated with a dropout rate of &lt; 3% and was rapidly acquired in five minutes during a routine clinical visit.</s><s>Furthermore, PLR assessment by ultrasound had a good test-retest reliability.</s><s>Infrared video pupillometry (IVP) is an established method for assessment of the PLR that is performed by recording the pupil with an infrared video camera <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>IVP showed superiority compared to other manually performed diagnostic tests for PLR assessment like the swinging flashlight test <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Our present data obtained by pupillary ultrasound are consistent with pupillometry data for PLR specific parameters assessed by IVP published in the literature.</s><s>Prior studies with IVP have reported nearly identical values for PD (mean 5.5 vs. 4.9 mm) and constriction amplitude (mean 1.6 vs. 1.9 mm) compared to our matching age group <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, IVP studies have also reported decreasing PD with age, as found in our cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>However, a comparison of different data sets of the PLR assessed with IVP and ultrasound imposes certain difficulties as the PLR depends on light properties such as irradiance, wavelength and duration.</s><s>Studies that directly compare IVP and B-mode ultrasound for PLR assessment carried out with the same light stimulus and light conditions are currently lacking and should be performed in the future to enable a direct comparison of both methods.</s></p><p><s>There are clear advantages of ocular ultrasound approach for PLR assessment compared to IVP.</s><s>Ultrasound machines with 10MHz linear arrays are more widely available in hospitals and emergency departments than IVP devices, likely due to acquisition costs and a broader range of applications for ultrasound <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>PLR assessment can be performed with the subject's eyes closed, so examinations may still be feasible in cases in which eyelid retraction is impeded by poor cooperation or severe periorbital edema <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, the ultrasound approach currently also poses some limitations compared to IVP.</s><s>IVP allows for a more detailed analysis of the PLR beyond PD and PCT, assessing pupil latency time, velocity, dilation, acceleration and photoreceptor function as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>As the ultrasound examination in our study was performed with the eyes closed, it is difficult to determine the irradiance that reaches the retina and consequently to differentiate between rod, cone and melanopsin function <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore IVP may be less influenced by environmental lighting and requires minimal training, whereas B-mode ultrasound requires certain experience and standardized conditions.</s><s>However in our experience B-mode ultrasound was a suitable tool to assess the most common PLR parameters in clinical routine.</s><s>Spontaneous pupil oscillation is a phenomenon described in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> that was observed in several subjects in our study.</s><s>A single PD measurement obtained by a frozen ultrasound image could lead to false results as pupil size may vary.</s><s>Nevertheless, in our test reproducibility analysis we just detected small differences in PD's (&lt;0.2mm) comparing measurement at different time points, thus we conclude that spontaneous pupil oscillation does not severely bias the PLR assessment with ultrasound.</s></p><p><s>Altogether, we conclude that the assessment of the PLR with B-mode ultrasound is an innovative, widely available, time and cost effective method to document routine clinical pupillary testing.</s><s>B-mode ultrasound of the eye allows for direct measurement of the PLR and its dynamic component, the PCT.</s><s>Further study is needed to confirm the utility of ultrasound in detecting pathologic abnormalities in PLR.</s><s>Development of automated imaging functions, similar to those incorporated into IVP devices, may reduce the technical expertise barrier as well.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
