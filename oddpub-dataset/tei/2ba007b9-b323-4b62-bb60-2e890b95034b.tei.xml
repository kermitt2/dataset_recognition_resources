routes of indigenous pastoralist communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> , as well the migratory patterns of wild ungulate species such as caribou <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66</ref> .</s><s>This may also lead to novel environmental exposures as previous barriers disappear and emerging bottlenecks or range expansions appear.</s><s>Second, warming in semi-arid steppe or shrubland may increase dry conditions that may be favorable to anthrax spore dissemination in the middle and southerly northern latitudes, particularly when summer droughts are punctuated with intermittent precipitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> .</s><s>The current study lends further support to the favorability of relatively dry conditions as anthrax suitability appeared to be optimized in areas with a mild to moderate degree of water stress, which is typical of the grasslands and steppe of eastern Europe, north-central Asia and north-central North America <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> .</s><s>Dry soils may favor mechanical dissemination of spores by intermittent precipitation events <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> .</s><s>Third, hot weather may modify host susceptibility by decreasing immunocompetence <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, warming temperatures and dry conditions may enhance the transmission cycle of B. anthracis by simultaneously opening new chains of transmission, promoting mechanical motility through the environment, or suppressing host immune function.</s><s>While the climatic features in the current study support an infection ecology modulated by warming annual temperatures and moderate soil-water stress, none of the potential mechanisms described above were directly observed in the current study and, as such, definitive pathways describing anthrax epidemiology must await interrogation by field studies of livestock, wildlife, and the environment.</s><s>The distribution of animals was influential to anthrax suitability, with livestock density and wild ungulate species richness accounting for 38.6% combined permutation importance.</s><s>Small herds were associated with greatest risk among cattle, while sheep predicted anthrax suitability in low and high density.</s><s>This may reflect greater adoption of preventive measures (i.e.</s><s>vaccination) in areas supporting large, or industrial, cattle industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> , whereas such prevention may be more lacking in general in sheep husbandry.</s><s>Increasing ungulate species richness decreased suitability for anthrax, which is consistent with the view that high biodiversity has a diluting effect on pathogen transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless, the functional relationship between anthrax suitability and ungulate biodiversity was not particularly strong as depicted in the response curve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), suggesting that the current results are not comprehensive enough to describe how ungulate biodiversity operates with respect to disease risk in northern latitudes.</s></p><p><s>Soil organic carbon and pH have long been recognized as important properties in the infection ecology and transmission cycle of B. anthracis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>High organic carbon, and pH in the range of 6-7, delineate the Mollisol and Chernozem soils of the prairies of North America and the steppe of eastern Europe and central Asia, respectively, which are typically favorable to anthrax sporulation in northern latitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> .</s><s>These soils tend to be rich in calcium, which can further promote spore germination under the right environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, these soil profiles support rich grassland ecosystems and agricultural production <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78</ref> , which is likely reflected in the influence of livestock densities on anthrax suitability.</s><s>Thus, while soil composition was not as influential as climate and livestock density, the current study does reinforce the pedological and edaphological paradigm for B. anthracis across both the western and eastern hemispheres.</s></p><p><s>This study has some important limitations.</s><s>First, the documented anthrax outbreaks included in this study are derived from the OIE and ProMED surveillance systems, which do not necessarily capture all anthrax outbreak occurrences and which may be more responsive in areas with better veterinary services and reporting infrastructure, thus potentially leading to reporting bias in the identified anthrax locations.</s><s>Moreover, such bias is likely to reflect global economic disparity since resource-poor countries or locales are typically those unable to afford the cost of such animal health infrastructure.</s><s>We attempted to correct for such reporting bias by selecting background points weighted by the presence of the human footprint as a proxy for reporting infrastructure.</s><s>Nevertheless, we must concede that these data may not be representative of the total anthrax outbreaks occurring in northern latitudes over the time period under study, but rather reflect geographies wherein a basic level of animal health service and disease reporting has been achieved.</s><s>Second, the scale of the study is coarse.</s><s>While this is unlikely to be of substantial influence to environmental features operating at small (i.e.</s><s>coarse) spatial scale, such as temperature, soil composition, and wildlife species range, it would most certainly be influential to features operating at large (i.e.</s><s>fine) scale, such as subtle changes in topographic slope and water drainage, or the distribution of tabanid flies as mechanical vectors.</s><s>As such, we were not able to investigate the additional influences of hyper-local features such as water pooling, which has been previously identified as an important delimiter of anthrax risk due to spore accumulation through water dispersal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , or the ecological niche of tabanids despite convincing evidence that these may be important to anthrax transmission in some regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> .</s><s>Third, temperature anomaly was assessed over a relatively recent time frame (i.e.</s><s>change between 1950-1980 and 2005-2016), and therefore assumes as its baseline a temperature regime that was already likely undergoing warming trends.</s><s>Nevertheless, we would expect this to dilute the effect of global warming on anthrax suitability.</s><s>However, given the strong influence that was still apparent in the current analysis, it would seem that temperature increase is impactful to the anthrax suitability even in the short term.</s><s>As mentioned previously, it is important to note that future anthrax suitability is based on projected temperature anomaly, while such projected data was not available for the other environmental features.</s><s>As such, the model predictions for future anthrax suitability lack the nuance offered by a fully future-projected environmental space.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this investigation revealed the novel finding that, mean global temperature increases between 1950-1980 and 2005-2016 identified high anthrax suitability in the northern latitudes during the early decades of the twenty-first century.</s><s>Continued warming in northern latitudes predicted expanding anthrax risk.</s><s>In addition, livestock density and wild ungulate species richness were also associated with anthrax suitability.</s><s>These results provide the first evidence that climate change may influence the risk of this impactful zoonotic disease across a large extent of the northern latitudes.</s><s>Additional findings from this study suggest that interventions targeting animal health promotion among small to midsize livestock herds (e.g.</s><s>vaccine promotion among pastoralist communities) may reduce the overall suitability to future outbreaks, possibly mitigating some of the effects of climate change.</s><s>The association between anthrax suitability and ungulate species richness is also intriguing for the potential One Health implications of megafauna biodiversity conservation in grassland ecosystems, however the current results are not yet sufficient to make a claim for specific conservation intervention strategies and will require validation from more localized studies to confirm the possibility of real benefit.</s></p></div><figure
