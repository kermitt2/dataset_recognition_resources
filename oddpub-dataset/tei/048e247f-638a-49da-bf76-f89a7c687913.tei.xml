<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>To our knowledge, this analysis is the first to examine metabolic and glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes treated with typical and atypical antipsychotics.</s><s>Overall, almost 0.5% of subjects with type 1 diabetes up to the age of 25 years were treated with antipsychotics in this survey.</s><s>Population-based data from other European countries, the U.S., and Canada show similar results <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26)</ref>.</s><s>One survey from Canada reported that 0.64% of children and adolescents are treated with antipsychotics in 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(25)</ref>.</s><s>In Germany, the observed numbers seem slightly lower: A recent analysis of data from a German health insurance company disclosed that 0.32% of children and adolescents up to the age of 19 years received prescriptions of antipsychotics in 2012 (26).</s><s>As in our study, risperidone was the drug prescribed most often in this German population-based study (26).</s><s>Moreover, similar to many studies analyzing trends in prescribing antipsychotic medications, more males were treated with antipsychotics in our survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, more subjects with immigrant status were included in the group receiving antipsychotic medication compared with the cohort of patients without antipsychotic medication.</s><s>This finding is also seen in some other studies in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">27)</ref>.</s><s>Because we had no data about socioeconomic status or education level in our survey, we were not able to further analyze why more subjects with immigrant status were included in the group receiving antipsychotic treatment.</s></p><p><s>Similar to many studies of healthy children, adolescents, and adults, we also found that subjects with type 1 diabetes and with antipsychotic medication had increased weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, our survey showed an increased BMI with both typical and atypical antipsychotic treatment.</s><s>Weight gain and changes in lipid concentrations also have been reported with typical (first-generation) antipsychotics, but often to a lesser extent than atypical antipsychotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, there are marked differences between different antipsychotic agents, both typical and atypical, regarding the amount of weight gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">28)</ref>.</s><s>For example, medications with risperidone (an atypical antipsychotic) or haloperidol (a typical antipsychotic) are associated with less weight gain compared with treatment with olanzapine (an atypical agent) or chlorpromazine (a typical agent), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">29)</ref>.</s><s>Different receptor affinities (e.g., 1 H affinity) of the antipsychotic agents may explain some of the different degrees of weight gain through, for instance, increased appetite <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Because numerous antipsychotic drugs are used for treatment in this survey, we are not able to give any detailed information about differences in BMI as they relate the individual Â§Data are expressed as mean (lower 95% confidence limit, upper 95% confidence limit).</s><s>kData are expressed as rate per 1 patient-year (confidence interval range).</s><s>Â¶Poisson model.</s></p><p><s>antipsychotic agents.</s><s>Remarkably, in our survey, BMI SDS among subjects taking antipsychotic medication was not different from BMI SDS when antipsychotic treatment was started.</s><s>This observation also is consistent with other studies: Subjects with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders are per se more likely to be obese and to have a more unhealthy lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr">30)</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, there is only a limited number of studies of untreated patients with schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr">30)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the reported difference in BMI, we also encountered significant abnormalities in lipid concentrations in subjects treated with antipsychotics compared with subjects without antipsychotic medication.</s><s>This finding also is well described in several other studies (31).</s><s>Again, and similar to the influence on weight, different atypical and typical antipsychotic drugs seem to be associated with a lower or higher risk of hyperlipidemia (31).</s><s>Some antipsychotic agents (e.g., haloperidol) even do not seem to influence lipid concentrations significantly (31).</s><s>To date, why antipsychotic agents induce dyslipidemia is not exactly understood.</s><s>Weight gain, a welldescribed adverse effect of antipsychotic medication, as mentioned above, and obesity lead to hyperlipidemia, and this mechanism may play an important role in the pathophysiology of dyslipidemia that occurs with antipsychotic medication (31).</s><s>Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia are known to have a poor diet (e.g., a diet richer in fat) and often exert less or participate in inadequate exercise compared with the general population (31).</s><s>These factors may also contribute to the reported changes in lipid metabolism and serum lipid concentrations.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, we examined glycemic control in subjects treated with antipsychotics.</s><s>Remarkably, glycemic control was worse only in subjects treated with atypical antipsychotics, not in subjects treated with typical antipsychotics.</s><s>There are several possible explanations for this finding.</s><s>Atypical antipsychotic drugs exert direct effects on the b-cells in the pancreas, thereby impairing insulin secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>More important, however, recent evidence points toward insulin resistance rather than insulin secretion as a cause of hyperglycemia.</s><s>Interestingly, in some individuals changes in insulin resistance occur without increases in BMI.</s><s>In vitro studies have shown that some atypical antipsychotic drugs inhibit glucose uptake via interaction with glucose transporter proteins (e.g., olanzapine) or exert intracellular effects (e.g., risperidone).</s><s>This leads to insulin resistance, which consequently worsens glycemic control.</s><s>By contrast, haloperidoldan example of a typical antipsychoticdhas only marginal effects on glucose transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, markedly less insulin resistance is present and, consequently, HbA 1c levels remain unchanged.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, we examined and compared the rates of severe hypoglycemia and DKA, which are important for acute morbidity and mortality in type 1 diabetes.</s><s>We found significantly higher rates of both DKA and severe hypoglycemia in subjects treated with typical antipsychotics.</s><s>Subjects treated with atypical antipsychotics, who had significantly higher HbA 1c levels, had only a higher rate of DKA, not a higher rate of severe hypoglycemia.</s><s>This association between more pronounced hyperglycemia, as reflected by higher HbA 1c levels, and a lower rate of severe hypoglycemia is also seen in several other trials and may indicate that lower HbA 1c levels lead toward an increased risk for severe hypoglycemia (32,33).</s><s>Last, we did not find higher prevalence of diabetes complications such as retinopathy.</s><s>Because diabetes duration of the subjects in our survey was less than 10 years, however, a longer observation time may be needed.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the limitations of our study should be pointed out.</s><s>The number of subjects taking antipsychotic medication in this survey is relatively small because schizophrenia and disorders requiring antipsychotic medications are rare among the general population as well as among youth with type 1 diabetes (34).</s><s>Therefore, weak to moderate associations could possibly not be demonstrated because of limited power.</s><s>Moreover, no sufficient information about the diagnoses for which the antipsychotics were prescribed was available.</s><s>Therefore, we are not able to give any details about the underlying diagnoses and their possible associations with metabolic and glycemic control.</s><s>Last, because of the cross-sectional research design, the results of our analysis are descriptive, and we are not able to demonstrate any causal effects.</s><s>In summary, this analysis of a real-life survey demonstrated that subjects taking antipsychotic medication had worse glycemic control and a higher rate of acute complications compared with those not taking antipsychotic medication.</s><s>This observed adverse metabolic and glycemic control may have a considerate effect on morbidity and long-term prognosis in youth with type 1 diabetes taking antipsychotic medication.</s><s>Health care teams caring for youth with type 1 diabetes on antipsychotic medication need to know about these findings.</s><s>We suggest monitoring metabolic risk factors as well as providing diabetes education about the prevention of acute complications.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>second-generation antipsychotics in
