<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</s><s>Symptoms associated with OC are non-specific, therefore the majority of patients with OC are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, which markedly increases the difficulty of treatment and decreases the survival time <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>Owing to late diagnosis and poor response to treatment, OC is ranked as the eighth most common cause of cancer-associated mortality in women worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>The origin of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the epithelial cells of the ovary, and EOC accounts for ~90% of all ovarian cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>Extensive effort has been made to investigate the pathogenesis of EOC.</s><s>It has been demonstrated that the pathogenesis of EOC is associated with multiple gene mutations (e.g., in genes encoding AT-rich-interacting domain-containing protein 1A or breast cancer 1/2) (6,7), gene overexpression (e.g., in genes encoding cyclin D1 or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref> and dysregulation of signaling pathways (e.g., phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B or Wnt/Î²-catenin) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</s><s>However, limited progress has been achieved in improving the prognosis and treatment of this disease.</s><s>Therefore, comprehensive investigation of the pathogenesis of EOC is required.</s></p><p><s>Go-Ichi-Ni-San (GINS, meaning five, one, two and three in Japanese) complexes, first identified by Takayama et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, consist of partner of Sld five (PSF)1, PSF2, PSF3 and SLD5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>GINS complexes are a type of nucleic acid replication factor and initiate a cyclic structure that serves a significant function in the initiation of DNA replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>GINS2, also known as PSF2, is encoded by the GINS2 gene located in humans at chromosomal locus 16q24 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>It has been demonstrated that GINS2 is the central component of the CMG [cell division cycle 45 (Cdc45)-minichromosome maintenance (MCM)-GINS] complex, and GINS2 is involved in the initiation of DNA replication and cell cycle progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Tumini et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> identified a novel crosstalk between DNA replication and the Fanconi's anemia (FA) signaling pathway, in which GINS and the core complex help to load or stabilize the FA core complex onto chromatin, and GINS2 depletion is insufficient to decrease the monoubiquitylation of FA complementation group D2 or its localization to nuclear foci following DNA damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A previous study identified that GINS2 is associated with the occurrence of genomic DNA damage in untransformed human fibroblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, suggesting that GINS2 may be involved in the process of tumorigenesis.</s><s>A gene expression meta-analysis identified GINS2 at 16q24 as a potential metastasis-promoting genes in breast cancer <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Further studies demonstrated that increased GINS2 expression was associated with advanced stage of tumor, poor relapse-free survival, poor distant metastasis-free survival and poor tamoxifen efficacy in patients with breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20)</ref>.</s><s>An in vitro study identified that GINS2 expression was enriched in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines, and GINS2 silencing decreased cell proliferation, invasive capability and stem-like properties of TNBC cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(21)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, GINS2 has been considered as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in breast cancer.</s><s>On the basis of the analysis of genome-wide gene expression profiles, GINS2 has been identified as a tumor-node-metastasis stage-associated gene in lung adenocarcinoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(22)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, GINS2 serves important functions in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle transition in leukemic cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24)</ref>.</s><s>However, to the best of our knowledge, the functions of GINS2 in EOC have not been investigated.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, the expression of GINS2 was investigated in EOC and normal ovarian tissues using immunohistochemistry and the effects of GINS2 on cell proliferation (using cell counting and MTT assays), cell cycle transition (using propidium iodide staining) and cell apoptosis [using Annexin V-allophycocyanin (APC) staining] were further studied in an EOC cell line, SKOV-3.</s><s>The results of the present study provide evidence for the

in breast cancer.</s><s>However, to the best of our knowledge, the association between GINS2 expression and the progression of EOC remains to be clarified.</s><s>In the present study, high expression of GINS2 was observed in EOC tissues and cell lines.</s><s>Furthermore, stable GINS2 knockdown in SKOV-3 cells was able to significantly inhibit cell proliferation, and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</s></p><p><s>It has been demonstrated that the GINS2 transcript is highly expressed in breast cancer samples, and its level is associated with lung metastasis, histological grade, and acquired endocrine therapy resistance in patients with breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(20)</ref>.</s><s>A study by Liu et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(22)</ref> identified GINS2 as a differentially expressed gene (high expression) in 90 lung adenocarcinoma samples using gene microarray analysis.</s><s>In the present study, GINS2 was identified, for the first time, to be expressed at high levels in EOC samples from 36 patients and in two human EOC cell lines.</s><s>In patients with breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, GINS2 expression was positively associated with the histological grade of tumors, in which high expression of GINS2 was observed in 17.2% of grade 1, 50% of grade 2 and 77.1% of grade 3 breast cancer samples, and in stage II lung adenocarcinomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22)</ref>.</s><s>The EOC samples assessed in the present study were purchased from a commercial company.</s><s>Since the number of patients with EOC was limited and data for the clinicopathological parameters, including lung metastasis, progress-free survival, prognosis, therapy resistance, were not provided by the company, GINS2 protein expression was compared only   between EOC samples and normal ovarian tissues.</s><s>Therefore, in future studies, GINS2 expression should be investigated in a large number of patients with EOC of different histological grades and with complete clinicopathological data in order to assess the association between GINS2 protein expression and other clinicopathological parameters of EOC.</s></p><p><s>Since GINS2 mediates the interaction between MCM complexes and Cdc45 at the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, it is reasonable to hypothesize that GINS2 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and proliferation.</s><s>It has been demonstrated that GINS2 serves important functions in the proliferation of leukemia cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24)</ref>.</s><s>In leukemia cell lines (HL60, K562 and NB4), GINS2 knockdown by siRNA significantly suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at the G 2 phase through activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, whereas overexpression of GINS2 in HL60 cells promoted cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, it was also identified that GINS2 knockdown in SKOV-3 cells significantly suppressed cell proliferation.</s><s>However, GINS2 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase, but not the G 2 phase as demonstrated in leukemia cells.</s><s>Eukaryotic cell cycle progression is tightly regulated by the complexes consisting of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), in which cyclin D-CDK4/6 is required for G 1 progression, cyclin E-CDK2 is required for the G 1 -S transition, cyclin A-CDK2 is required for S phase progression and cyclin A/B-CDC2 is required for the G 2 -M transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the expression of cyclins and CDKs is often used to assess cell proliferation and cell cycle transition.</s><s>Although the effect of GINS2 knockdown on the expression of cyclins and CDKs was not investigated in SKOV-3 cells, previous studies demonstrated that GINS2 knockdown decreases the expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin D1 and CDK1 in leukemia cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24)</ref>.</s><s>These results support the hypothesis that GINS2 knockdown induces cell cycle arrest at the S or G 2 phase.</s><s>Furthermore, aberrant cell cycle regulation is the major cause for over-proliferation of tumor cells.</s><s>The S phase is a critical period during which cells commit to proliferation or growth arrest <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26)</ref>.</s><s>Individual replication origins are activated at the onset of S phase through the assembly of replication factors, including Sld3, GINS, Cut5, Drc1, Cdc45, replication protein A and the DNA polymerase Î±-primase complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(28)</ref>.</s><s>GINS2 regulates the chromosome segregation, probably through its function in centromere replication at the S phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(29)</ref>.</s><s>In eukaryotes, the process of DNA replication occurs at S phase in a highly coordinated manner, in which GINS associates with replication origins and then with neighboring fragments during this period <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(30)</ref>.</s><s>Understanding the regulation of the S phase transition is central to clarifying the pathogenesis of many diseases, particularly cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(31)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Uncontrolled cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis are two major characteristics of the majority of cancer cells.</s><s>In the present study, it was observed that GINS2 knockdown significantly induced apoptosis in SKOV-3 cells.</s><s>Consistent with these results, previous studies also demonstrated that GINS2 knockdown induced apoptosis in leukemia cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, GINS2 knockdown significantly increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein, but decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24)</ref>, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be clarified.</s><s>Since the present study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate GINS2 functions in EOC, the expression pattern of GINS2 was initially investigated in EOC samples and then investigated major functions (cell proliferation and apoptosis) of GINS2 in an EOC cell line.</s><s>The results of the present study provide a solid basis for future studies, in which the functions of GINS2 in EOC and precise underlying molecular mechanisms should be validated in vitro and in vivo.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate that GINS2 was highly expressed in human EOC samples and cell lines.</s><s>The silencing of GINS2 expression in SKOV-3 cells inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at S phase and increased apoptosis.</s><s>Therefore, these results suggest that GINS2 may be involved in the progression and malignancy of EOC, although the functions of GINS2 in the tumorigenesis of human EOC and underlying molecular mechanisms require further investigation.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
