<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating and difficult to treat psychiatric disorder, characterized by a constellation of symptoms related to the experience of a traumatic event <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[Patel et al., 2012]</ref>.</s><s>Adolescent PTSD is of particular concern, as PTSD is more chronic and highly prevalent at this crucial developmental stage, coupled with increased risk for psychopathology later in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Ackerman et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">McLaughlin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Perry and Azad, 1999]</ref>.</s><s>Critically, the perpetuating state of stress and anxiety in PTSD might disrupt neuroplasticity in the developing adolescent brain, thereby hampering normal development of cognitive and emotional functionalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Davidson and McEwen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lupien et al., 2009</ref>].</s><s>Yet, despite these concerns very little is known of how PTSD might affect brain network organization in adolescents.</s><s>Whereas multiple lines of research suggest amygdala subregional defects in the pathophysiology of adult PTSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Brown et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Jovanovic and Ressler, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mahan and Ressler, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Nicholson et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Patel et al., 2012]</ref>, no study has yet examined the functional architecture of amygdala subregional networks in adolescent PTSD.</s><s>Knowledge on how major amygdalar circuits might be compromised in adolescent PTSD is crucial in gaining insight into the underlying pathophysiology, ultimately informing the development of reliable biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.</s></p><p><s>The amygdala is a central component of brain's affective processing system <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[LeDoux, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010]</ref>, and neurocircuitry models of PTSD consistently emphasize its central role in PTSD symptomatology <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[Patel et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Taghva et al., 2013]</ref>.</s><s>Within these models, the amygdala is hyperresponsive to threat-related stimuli and acts as an overactive fear generator, in which its projections to memory circuits drive fear of trauma-related stimuli and context, while its projections to the brainstem, cerebellum, and hypothalamus drive excessive fear responses and hyperarousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Cisler et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Jovanovic and Ressler, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Taghva et al., 2013]</ref>.</s><s>Critically, the amygdala continues to drive excessive fear as medial prefrontal regions fail to downregulate amygdala hyperactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Jovanovic and Ressler, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Taghva et al., 2013]</ref>.</s><s>Within this amygdala-centered circuitry, the basolateral (BLA) and centromedial (CMA) subnuclei of the amygdala play imperative and distinctive roles in fear processing, through their unique connectivity profiles with cortical and subcortical territories (see Supporting Information 1 for schematic overview).</s><s>The BLA receives information from multiple brain systems and is a site of integration with cortical areas, including those that regulate fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Jovanovic and Ressler, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">LeDoux, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sah et al., 2003]</ref>.</s><s>It is heavily involved in the perception, evaluation, and memory formation of emotionally salient stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Davis and Whalen, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">LeDoux, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">McGaugh et al., 1996]</ref>.</s><s>The CMA, in contrast, receives mostly modulatory inputs from the BLA and orbitofrontal cortex, and is less heavily innervated by sensory and associative regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Barbas et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">LeDoux, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sah et al., 2003]</ref>.</s><s>It is the primary output site of the amygdala, and orchestrates fear responses via its projections to the brainstem, cerebellum, and hypothalamus <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Davis and Whalen, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">LeDoux, 2007]</ref>.</s><s>Despite the critical role of the amygdala in PTSD, very little is known of how BLA and CMA connectivity profiles may actually contribute to the pathophysiology of adolescent PTSD.</s></p><p><s>Most of our current knowledge about the distinctive functions and connectivity profiles of amygdala subregions stems from animal studies.</s><s>However, recent advances in human neuroimaging have resulted in cytoarchitechtonic probability maps of the amygdaloid complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Amunts et al., 2005]</ref>, allowing to quantitatively map the unique connectivity profiles of amygdala subregions.</s><s>Intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) analysis, in particular, has proven a powerful method for delineating the functional architecture of intrinsically (i.e.</s><s>spontaneously) coupled brain networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Fox and Raichle, 2007]</ref>.</s><s>As such, dissociable connectivity profiles of the BLA and CMA were recently demonstrated in healthy adults and adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Gabard-Durnam et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Roy et al., 2009]</ref>, consistent with earlier observations in rodents and primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[LeDoux, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sah et al., 2003]</ref>.</s><s>These subregional connectivity profiles have been shown to reliably predict individual variations in anxiety in healthy adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[Li et al., 2012]</ref>, and in typically developing children as young as age nine <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[Qin et al., 2014]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, widespread disruption of both BLA and CMA connectivity profiles has been demonstrated in adult and adolescent generalized anxiety disorder, suggesting impairments in both the experience and regulation of emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Etkin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Roy et al., 2013]</ref>.</s><s>In parallel, disrupted BLA and CMA connectivity with regulatory prefrontal regions has been found in adult PTSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Brown et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Nicholson et al., 2015]</ref>, suggesting a mechanism by which prefrontal regions fail to govern amygdala hyperactivity and reduce excessive fear.</s><s>Of note, new evidence suggests that anxiety-related alterations in amygdala subregional connectivity coincide with structural abnormalities within the BLA and CMA subnuclei <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Etkin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Qin et al., 2014]</ref>.</s><s>A coupling between brain structure and function might indeed be expected, as network communication and information processing depend heavily on structural properties of neurons (e.g., size, configuration, arrangement) <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[Zatorre et al., 2012]</ref>.</s><s>As such, conjoint examination of amygdalar connectivity and morphology seems crucial for a deeper understanding of abnormal anxiety and its underlying pathophysiology.</s></p><p><s>Despite emerging evidence of anxiety-related perturbations in major amygdalar circuits, almost nothing is known about the functional architecture of amygdala subregional networks in adolescent PTSD.</s><s>Although there have been preliminary reports of amygdala-prefrontal underconnectivity due to trauma in healthy and PTSD-diagnosed teenagers <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[Nooner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wolf and Herringa, 2015]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, only two studies have examined amygdala subregional iFC in PTSD, though in adult patient communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Brown et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Nicholson et al., 2015]</ref>, while conjoint examination of amygdalar connectivity and morphology has been lacking with regard to PTSD.</s><s>We addressed this critical gap by uniquely examining BLA and CMA intrinsic functional connectivity in a sample of sexually abused adolescents with PTSD, relative to matched controls.</s><s>Additionally, we employed voxel-based morphometry to examine whether alterations in grey matter volume of amygdala subregions coincide with abnormalities in BLA and CMA connectivity.</s><s>Multimodal imaging of the amygdaloid complex may provide complementary information and novel insights on PTSD pathophysiology, which otherwise would only be partially revealed by each modality separately.</s><s>Based on earlier work implicating amygdala-centered network dysfunction in abnormal fear processing and excessive fear responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Barbas, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Brown et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cisler et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Etkin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Jovanovic and Ressler, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">LeDoux, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Roy et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sah et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Shin and Liberzon, 2010]</ref>, we hypothesized adolescents with PTSD to show diminished BLA connectivity with regulatory prefrontal regions, such as the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices.</s><s>Moreover, we hypothesized adolescents with PTSD to show increased CMA connectivity with regions involved in fear expression.</s><s>These include regions that modulate CMA activity (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex), as well as regions involved in the actual execution of fear responses (e.g., brainstem and hypothalamus).</s><s>Additionally, given that abnormal connectivity and morphology of amygdala subregions tend to accompany each other in anxious individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Etkin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Qin et al., 2014]</ref>, we hypothesized that abnormal BLA and CMA connectivity would coincide with altered grey matter volume of amygdala subregions.</s><s>Finally, we expected that abnormal amygdalar connectivity would relate to more PTSD symptoms of stress and anxiety.</s></p></div>

shows that abnormal stress and anxiety early in life cause greater dendritic arborization and increased synaptogenesis, leading to an initial increase in amygdala growth and activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Davidson and McEwen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tottenham and Sheridan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vyas et al., 2006]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, a prolonged period of stress-induced increase in amygdala growth and activity promotes glucocorticoid receptor hypersensitivity and overexposure to stress hormones (i.e., neurotoxicity), eventually causing neural atrophy and even cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[Hanson et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Teicher et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tottenham and Sheridan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Yehuda, 2001]</ref>.</s><s>Extrapolating from these data, we speculate that similar mechanisms could underlie reduced amygdala volumes observed in our sample of adolescent PTSD patients with a history of chronic exposure to stress.</s><s>Indeed, the number of traumatic events, severity of exposure to trauma, and chronicity of PTSD all relate to smaller amygdala volumes in PTSD patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[Karl et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kuo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mollica et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Rogers et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Veer et al., 2015]</ref>, which further supports our hypothesized trajectory of amygdala atrophy.</s><s>A similar trajectory has also been suggested in other stress-related disorders such as depression, in which an initial increase in amygdala growth is followed by atrophy as depressive episodes become more severe and chronic <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[Lange and Irle, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Sheline et al., 1998</ref>].</s><s>The fact that neither connectivity nor structure of the amygdala related to PTSD chronicity among our patients does not necessarily refute the proposed trajectory, as we lacked data on number of traumatic events and trauma exposure to fully test this assumption.</s><s>Notwithstanding the possibility of low statistical power and/or ceiling effects, we cautiously suggest that amygdalar alterations we documented might be more representative of PTSD vulnerability and diagnosis rather than its duration.</s><s>The findings could thus provide novel clues for how stress-related alterations in the amygdaloid complex may contribute to PTSD pathophysiology in pediatric populations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Limitations and Strengths</head><p><s>The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow for firm conclusions regarding causality.</s><s>Hence, we cannot fully ascertain whether amygdalar abnormalities reported in this study preceded or followed the onset of PTSD.</s><s>Additionally, the small number of adolescent males in our sample may to some extent limit the generalizability of our results.</s><s>Longitudinal research in larger samples with a more balanced male to female ratio could tackle these limitations.</s><s>In line with other PTSD studies, some of our patients had a secondary comorbid depressive disorder, and this may potentially affect the specificity of our results.</s><s>Such comorbidity, however, is deemed a typical element of clinical PTSD, and exclusion of these patients therefore would have resulted in a highly atypical sample lacking external validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[Morey et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Shin and Liberzon, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000]</ref>.</s><s>As such, we performed post-hoc analyses but found no impact of comorbidity on amygdala iFC patterns.</s><s>Most of our patients were treatment-na€ ıve, with only 3 patients taking psychotropic medication.</s><s>While in potential this may marginally affect our findings, post-hoc analyses showed no impact of medication use on amygdala iFC reported here.</s><s>Importantly, leading researchers in the field of PTSD neuroimaging strongly argue against exclusion of medicated patients from studies as this may limit the generalizability of the findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[Lanius et al., 2010]</ref>.</s><s>It should be noted that we did not include control participants with a history of trauma exposure resembling that of the PTSD patients.</s><s>However, sexually abused adolescents without any symptomatology and not in need of any psychological help are often reluctant to participate in such studies, owing to feelings of shame and embarrassment associated with their trauma.</s><s>We are therefore unable to fully ascertain whether trauma exposure itself, regardless of diagnostic status, is associated with amygdalar abnormalities reported here.</s><s>Nonetheless, our findings merit attention as the first evidence for perturbed function and structure of amygdala subregions in traumatized adolescents with PTSD diagnosis.</s><s>The findings provide an interesting focus for future research, which should further explore and validate amygdalar abnormalities reported here.</s><s>Finally, physiological fluctuations (heart rate and respiration) were not recorded during restingstate data acquisition.</s><s>Although we applied temporal filtering and regressed out white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signal to eliminate physiological noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Fox and Raichle, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hallquist et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Windischberger et al., 2002]</ref>, these physiological fluctuations may still have been a source of noise influencing our data.</s></p><p><s>Notwithstanding these limitations, our study has several strengths that increase the reliability of our findings.</s><s>First, to allow more accurate group comparison of amygdalar networks, patients and healthy controls were matched for age, sex, and IQ, while including these variables in the analyses as covariates to account for their possible confounding effects.</s><s>Second, we included a highly selected and homogenous patient group with regard to type of trauma and chronicity of PTSD, which further strengthens the reliability of our findings.</s><s>Third, partitioning the amygdala into BLA and CMA complexes produced dissociable connectivity profiles that were consistent with established models of amygdaloid circuitry.</s><s>As such, we were able to demonstrate anxiety-related perturbations in amygdala subregional connectivity, consistent with what was previously established in rodents and primates.</s><s>Finally, multimodal imaging of the amygdaloid complex in this study produced complementary and novel results, which otherwise would only be partially detected by each modality alone.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>In summary, adolescent PTSD patients showed abnormal amygdala subregional connectivity with regulatory prefrontal regions, coupled with diminished grey matter volume of amygdala subregions.</s><s>These findings provide unique insights into how perturbations in major amygdalar circuits could hamper fear regulation and drive excessive acquisition and expression of fear in PTSD patients.</s><s>As such, they represent an important step toward characterizing the neurocircuitry of adolescent PTSD, thereby informing the development of reliable biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.</s><s>For a deeper understanding of PTSD pathophysiology, it would be important to examine whether functional and structural integrity of amygdala subregions predict susceptibility, chronicity, and treatment response in PTSD.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>r</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Aghajani et al. r r 1124 r grey matter volume coincide with amygdalar network dysfunction in adolescent PTSD.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
