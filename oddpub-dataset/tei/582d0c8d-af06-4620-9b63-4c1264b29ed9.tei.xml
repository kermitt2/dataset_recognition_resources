<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fleck et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fleming et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hebart et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Other areas reported to carry a confidence signal in humans include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fleck et al., 2006)</ref>, the ventral striatum and the right anterior insula <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hebart et al., 2014)</ref> as well as right posterior parietal cortex and bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fleming et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Crucially, the dependence of these neural representations on a particular task remains unclear.</s><s>Previous studies couldn't address this question because they either only looked at one task at a time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fleming et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hebart et al., 2014)</ref>, didn't control for difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fleck et al., 2006)</ref>, or were pure behavioral studies (e.g., De <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gardelle and Mamassian, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The hypothesis we investigate here is, whether there is a task-independent neural representation of subjective certainty.</s><s>We reasoned that in a brain region, to be considered the neural substrate of a task-independent certainty-representation, BOLD signal should vary with the degree of subjective certainty, independent of the kind of task.</s><s>For this study we therefore developed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)design combining two tasks, a color and a motion detection task.</s></p><p><s>Because most researchers in the field are interested in the relationship between performance and confidence (belief in the correctness of a choice; for critical treatments of this approach see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gigerenzer et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Drugowitsch et al., 2014)</ref> the usual approach is to calibrate stimulus intensities to predefined levels of performance.</s><s>In the experimental trials subjects indicate their (binary) decision first and only then rate their confidence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fleming et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fleming et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Crucially, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baranski and Petrusic (2001)</ref> report that in this design confidence processing occurs both parallel to choice and after choice.</s><s>In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pleskac and Busemeyer (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yu et al. (2015)</ref> show that in this design subjects continue to accumulate evidence after choice, so that the confidence ratings are not based on the same evidence as the decision.</s><s>Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Boldt and Yeung (2015)</ref> report evidence supporting the view that shared mechanisms underlie post decisional confidence ratings and post decisional error detection.</s><s>Therefore, because we were interested in the degree of certainty leading to choice (and neither in post decisional confidence nor in error detection) and it's neural correlates we flipped the usual response order and asked for certainty ratings first and let subjects only then indicate their decision.</s><s>Also, because the quantity of interest here is subjective certainty, in contrast to previous studies, we calibrated stimulus intensity to a predefined average level of subjective certainty instead of performance.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task</head><p><s>Subjects saw a cloud of colored moving dots.</s><s>In the beginning of each trial a verbal cue appeared on the screen ('color, ' 'motion') instructing subjects to attend motion and ignore color or attend color and ignore motion.</s><s>Depending on the cue, after stimulus presentation (750 ms) they had to rate their degree of certainty that the net-motion of a dynamic random dot stimulus was to the left or right or that the number of dots in one color was greater than the number of dots in the other color (blue or red).</s><s>After the rating subjects indicated the respective direction or color.</s><s>[See Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, Task modified from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kayser et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>It is an outstanding question to what extent the neural computation of degrees of subjective certainty is task-specific.</s><s>Here, we show that a substantial part of the neural representation of degrees of subjective perceptual certainty is task-invariant.</s><s>We found that in two different tasks changes in BOLD signal increased with subjective certainty in the right lingual, calcarine, and left angular gyrus; BOLD signal decreased with increasing subjective certainty in the left lingual Gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, bilateral DMPFC/SMA, and left postcentral gyrus.</s><s>These changes in BOLD signal were virtually identical in the two tasks.</s><s>Our data therefore support the view, that there is a central module in the brain processing subjective certainty and that, consistent with De Gardelle and Mamassian (2014), degrees of subjective certainty are represented in a task-independent format.</s><s>This supports the notion of a generic neural mechanism underlying the computation of certainty.</s></p><p><s>Similarity to an deviations from other studies' results: The observed conjunction effects in DMPFC (−6, 8, 49, MNI coordinates of peak voxel) were located closely to confidencerelated changes in BOLD signal reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fleck et al. (2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">−11, 15, 49)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hebart et al.

(2014)</ref> who also used a directionof-motion discrimination task.</s><s>Importantly, however, we could not replicate these results in the color task, although we kept everything but the instruction cue constant across the two tasks.</s><s>One possible explanation for this observation is that variability in certainty-ratings may be lower in the color task than in the motion task.</s><s>We performed a pairwise comparison of the standard deviations of the certainty-ratings in the two tasks but found no significant difference.</s><s>This suggests that differences in the activation pattern between the two tasks are genuine.</s><s>Also, we did not find the positive parametric effect of certainty in the striatum reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schwarze et al. (2013)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hebart et al. (2014)</ref>.</s><s>Regarding the role of the ventral striatum in confidence processing there are two noteworthy recent reports: Daniel and Pollmann (2012) found a positive parametric relationship between prediction error on confidence and striatal activation.</s><s>Whenever confidence was higher than could be expected from previous trials, striatal activation was also higher, indicating a role of the striatum in coding changes in confidence (rather than coding confidence itself).</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schwarze et al. (2013)</ref> reported that the striatum contributes to confidence processing when the task at hand is very difficult.</s><s>Using an 'unusually difficult' task characterized by low levels of both confidence and accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schwarze et al. (2013)</ref> observed a positive correlation between confidence and changes in activity in the ventral striatum.</s><s>The authors explain their finding in terms of reward: Humans are typically uncertainty averse <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Camerer and Weber, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hirsh et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>When difficulty is high and in consequence highconfidence trials rare, the subjective value of high confident decisions is expected to be higher than usual, i.e., subjects might experience the infrequent high confidence trials as rewarding.</s><s>Here only correct trials are modeled and the contrast is masked by the significant clusters obtained from the 'main'-conjunction (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>; cluster-defining threshold p &lt; 0.001, uncorrected; reported changes in BOLD signal corrected for multiple comparisons at p &lt; 0.05, small volume corrected).</s></p><p><s>Combining these two findings it appears that the striatum signals when confidence is higher than expected and that this prediction error is experienced as rewarding.</s></p><p><s>As detailed in the next section, possible explanations for differences between the results of our study and those of earlier studies may be found in the details of the respective experimental designs: Relevant factors may be (a) the quantity kept constant, (b) the precise question (performance or stimulusrelated) subjects are asked, (c) the time confidence is rated, and (d) whether feedback or reward were provided.</s></p><p><s>Depending on the goal of a confidence/certainty -study mainly two strategies have been used: either keep the stimulus constant or keep performance constant (e.g., using a staircase procedure).</s><s>Researchers interested in subjects' introspective ability to evaluate their performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lau and Passingham, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fleming et al., 2012)</ref>, usually use staircase-methods to keep performance constant throughout the whole experiment (because they are interested in the relation between confidence and performance).</s><s>This implies that stimulus values vary.</s><s>Others, like us in the present study, are interested in the relation between stimulus and confidence, so we calibrated stimulus intensities to a predefined level of confidence (and not to a level of performance), and keep this stimulus level constant throughout the experiment.</s><s>This implies that performance may vary.</s></p><p><s>Researchers interested in subjects' introspective ability to evaluate their performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lau and Passingham, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fleming et al., 2012)</ref>, usually use performance-related ratings (because they are interested in the relation between confidence and performance).</s><s>That is: subjects rate how confident they are that their decision was correct.</s><s>We asked subjects for their subjective certainty with regard to the stimulus.</s><s>So we asked a different question.</s><s>While the usual performance-related question ("How confident are you that your decision was correct?") is primarily concerned with introspection and metacognition, the stimulus-related question ("How certain are you with regard to the stimulus identity?") is of a more epistemic nature.</s><s>It is concerned with the subject's estimation of the 'here and now' <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Komura et al., 2013)</ref> and importantly in their belief in their percept of the world.</s></p><p><s>In most recent studies subjects are asked to indicate their decision and after a forced delay indicate their degree of certainty that their decision was correct.</s><s>If the primary target of investigation is choice certainty, the degree of subjective certainty associated with (i.e., directly preceding) the actual choice, this is problematic.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pleskac and Busemeyer (2010)</ref> show, that in a perceptual task evidence accumulation continues after choice, so that post-decisional confidence ratings are not based on the same evidence underlying choice.</s><s>Therefore we flipped the responseorder of decision and rating and asked subjects for the rating first, that is before they indicated their decision.</s><s>We reasoned that already during the decision process there should be a graded certainty signal (as recently shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gherman and Philiastides (2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to animal studies most studies of confidence in humans do not give feedback or offer reward.</s><s>However, some give feedback during training (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hebart et al., 2014)</ref> which may still affect neural processes in the main experiment.</s><s>Varying these four factors (quantity kept constant, performance-vs.</s><s>stimulus-related question, time of rating, and feedback/reward) in a systematic and independent fashion could shed light on the origins of the observed differences in experimental results.</s></p><p><s>One possible shortcoming of this study is that variations in certainty might partially be due to fluctuations in attention.</s><s>However, it has been shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Macdonald et al., 2011</ref>) that attention and confidence, although they are both related to performance, are not necessarily correlated.</s><s>In addition, although we held stimulus information constant, there are fluctuations in the momentary evidence, which may partially explain the observed variation in subjective certainty at an otherwise fixed stimulus-level [For effects of the temporal distribution of evidence on confidence see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zylberberg et al. (2012)</ref>].</s><s>However, this doesn't affect that mean-coherence, and therefore average information available to the subject, was constant.</s></p><p><s>In the present study we asked subjects for their perceptual certainty before choice and we observed a parametric modulation of BOLD signal by certainty-ratings already during stimulus presentation.</s><s>Using EEG, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gherman and Philiastides (2015)</ref> showed that a confidence-signal, which could not be explained by stimulus difficulty or performance, emerges as early as the decision process itself.</s><s>Similar results were obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zizlsperger et al. (2014)</ref> showing that a perceptual confidencesignal, which is dissociable from representations of sensory evidence and performance, is present as early as 300 ms after stimulus onset.</s><s>The temporal aspect of these results clearly challenges the generality of the metacognitive account of confidence/certainty.</s><s>According to this account (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nelson, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fleming et al., 2010)</ref>, confidence is modeled as the result of a noisy read-out of a decision variable.</s><s>This model therefore excludes the existence of 'pre-decision-confidence' as observed by us and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gherman and Philiastides (2015)</ref>.</s><s>The existing literature makes it unlikely that confidence is a purely post-decisional process.</s><s>Its processing might either start pre-decisionally or alternatively, pre-and post-decisional certainty processing may serve different purposes and may be based on partially different mechanisms.</s><s>While pre-decision certainty is associated with incoming evidence and the actual decision process, post-decision confidence may be best viewed as an error-detection-signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Boldt and Yeung, 2015)</ref> and, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hebart et al. (2014)</ref>, provide a learning signal in the absence of feedback.</s><s>Whether this signal is metacognitive in nature and the result of a noisy read-out of the decision variable at the time of choice is unclear.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yu et al. (2015)</ref> report compelling evidence for post-decisional processing of confidence.</s><s>Specifically, they show that with longer forced delays between decision and rating the resolution of the confidence-accuracy relationship increases.</s><s>While confidence in correct responses stays relatively stable over different forceddelay durations, confidence in incorrect responses decreases with increasing forced delay durations.</s><s>This is in line with research on the link between decision confidence and error detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Macdonald et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Boldt and Yeung, 2015)</ref> and at the same time challenges the metacognitive account of confidence.</s><s>Further research and a formal comparison of process models are needed to shed light on this issue.</s></p><p><s>In the present study even when in addition to the stimulus, performance was held constant, we still observe parametric effects of certainty (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>).</s><s>This indicates that the processes we observe here are not directly performance-related.</s><s>The observation of stimulus-and performance-independent certainty signals in our study and reported above <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Zizlsperger et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gherman and Philiastides, 2015)</ref> is further supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">McSorley et al.
