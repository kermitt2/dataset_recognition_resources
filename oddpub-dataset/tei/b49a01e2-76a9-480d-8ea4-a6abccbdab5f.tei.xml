target="#b22">[23]</ref> undifferentiated-type EGC was included in the expanded ESD indication in recent guidelines as an investigational treatment.</s><s>Although there have been several studies suggesting ESD as an alternative treatment option in undifferentiated-type EGC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> large scaled long-term data of ESD is still insufficient.</s><s>Furthermore, previous studies have a limitation of having selection bias as we discussed in the premise.</s><s>To minimize the selection bias, we did ESD simulation using a non-selected surgical cohort and analyzed the outcomes according to the histopathological results on the assumption that ESD was done by en bloc resection without technical failure.</s><s>CR rate of ESD simulation was calculated as 42.1%.</s><s>However, CR rate was higher in SRC-type EGC than in PD-type EGC (48.3% vs 31.7%,</s><s>p=0.007).</s><s>In SRCtype EGC, CR rate was increased with smaller size criterion of ESD indication and was similar between 1.0 cm and 0.6 cm criteria while CR rate was below 50% in all of different tumor size criteria (2.0, 1.5, 1.0, and 0.6 cm) in PD-type EGC.</s><s>In addition, no LN metastasis was found when CR was achieved in tumor smaller than 1 cm in size.</s><s>Thus we could suggest that ESD for undifferentiated-type EGC should be considered in more selected patients, such as tumor size smaller than 1 cm with histology of SRC to achieve better outcomes.</s></p><p><s>In the previous studies, long-term outcomes of ESD for undifferentiated-type EGC are good when CR is achieved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>CR rates of ESD simulation in the present study are consistent with that of the previous real ESD studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>In the recent retrospective study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> CR was also achieved more frequently in SRC-type EGC (61.4%) than in PD-type EGC (45.1%) after ESD for undifferentiated-type EGC.</s><s>In our results, common causes of non-CR are tumor size &gt;2 cm in diameter (74.7%) and submucosa or beyond tumor invasion (44.4%).</s><s>To improve CR rate, accurate determination of depth and extent of tumor is thus necessary.</s><s>Unfortunately, however, this can be difficult in undifferentiatedtype EGC.</s><s>The accuracy of depth diagnosis by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in undifferentiated-type EGC has been known to be worse than in differentiated-type EGC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Undifferentiatedtype EGC can extend along the proliferative zone in the middle layer of the mucosa, leaving normal ducts covering the superficial epithelium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>In this case, even magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging was less useful. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>In our results, larger tumor showed a tendency to be more underestimated in size on endoscopy while tumor &lt;1 cm in size was not underestimated (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s>In addition, among ESD candidates prediction of tumor depth was accurate only in 67.8% when tumor is &gt;1 cm and 2 cm in size while 81.0% when 1 cm.</s><s>Taken together, application of ESD for small lesion less than 1 cm and pretreatment circumferential mapping biopsy could be optimal strategy for improving CR rate.</s><s>Furthermore, wide marking beyond estimated lesion during ESD would be necessary to secure enough resection margins.</s></p><p><s>In the previous report, PD-type EGC has pathological features such as submucosal invasion, ulcer, and lymphatic invasion that are less favorable to endoscopic treatment than that of SRC-type EGC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>We thus should take into account separate approach to these two types of EGC, not as a united type of undifferentiated-type histology.</s><s>Indeed, CR rate was constantly below 50% in various size criteria of ESD indication while CR rate was increased beyond 60 % with smaller size criterion of ESD indication (1.0 and 0.6 cm).</s></p><p><s>The most important factor concerning ESD with curative intent is the prediction of LN metastasis.</s><s>However, the reported rate of LN metastasis in undifferentiated-type EGC ranges from 5.7% to 20% which is higher than that of differentiated-type EGC.</s><s>29-33 Although Gotoda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> reported that LN metastasis was not found in the undifferentiated-type EGC smaller than 2 cm, confined to mucosa without ulceration, other studies proposed that expanded ESD indication for undifferentiated-type EGC should be narrowed to the smaller lesion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>These are consistent with our data which show no EGC smaller than 1.0 cm with CR had LN metastases (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Thus, pathologic expanded indications with 2.0 cm size criterion may not be a good endpoint to define the optimal selection criteria for ESD.</s><s>Indeed, the rate of LN metastasis was 2.5% in CR group.</s><s>However, the risk of LN metastasis is 2.9% and 1.6% even in the low risk group by the prediction model for SRC-type and PD-type, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>Therefore, expanded indication could be used to determine the feasible selection criteria for ESD in undifferentiated-type EGC.</s><s>However, although the risk for LNM is very low, it should not be considered negligible in endoscopic resection.</s></p><p><s>Three EGCs (two PD-type and one SRC-type on endoscopic biopsy) with CR and LN metastasis had mixed histology with SRC component on the final pathologic results and were devel-oped in women in their 40s to 60s.</s><s>Previous case reports with LN metastasis from undifferentiated-type mucosal gastric cancer satisfying the expanded criteria showed similar characteristics of middle age women with mixed histology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref></s><s>From these observations we could suggest that middle age woman with mixed histology needs more intense surveilance of recurrence although CR has been achieved.</s></p><p><s>The current study has some limitations.</s><s>Firstly, ESD simulation was done on the assumption that ESD was done by en bloc resection without technical failure.</s><s>Thus CR rate could be lower in real practice considering nonlifting, piecemeal resection, and complications during procedure.</s><s>However, recent two studies reported the en bloc resection rate of 99% in ESD for undifferentiated-type EGC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>In addition, as wide marking of 10 mm beyond estimated lesion is usually applied in ESD for undifferentiated-type EGC difference in CR rate between ESD simulation and real ESD may not be significant.</s><s>Second, preoperative evaluation using EUS was not done and could not be taken into account in our simulation.</s><s>Although the role of EUS in predicting depth and extent of tumor is limited in undifferentiated-type EGC, preoperative EUS might enhance CR rate.</s><s>Third, pathologic result of surgical specimen could underestimate depth of invasion and presence of lymphovascular invasion.</s><s>Lastly, ESD candidates meeting expanded indications were selected from an ESD expert by reviewing endoscopic images.</s><s>This may limit the generalizability of our results.</s><s>Nevertheless, our study has strengths of minimized selection bias and large sample size.</s><s>Because patients with endoscopic biopsy-proven undifferentiatedtype gastric cancer underwent surgery in our institution, we could avoid selection bias from the non-selected surgical cohort.</s><s>Using ESD simulation methods, we could analyze relatively large samples of undifferentiated-type EGC.</s><s>In conclusion, our ESD simulation with a non-selected surgical cohort results suggest that ESD should be considered in more selected patients, such as tumor size smaller than 1 cm with histology of SRC to achieve better outcomes in undifferentiated-type EGC.</s></p></div>
