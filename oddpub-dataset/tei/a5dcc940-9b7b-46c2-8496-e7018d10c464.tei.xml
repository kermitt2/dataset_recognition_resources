<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>In many metazoans, transcription of numerous genes in most cell types occurs in a rhythmic fashion with a period of ~24 hours, also if the organism is held under constant conditions; these rhythms are termed circadian transcriptional rhythms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>They are to a large extent orchestrated by the cellular circadian clock, which consists of connected feedback loops of clock genes that code for clock proteins.</s><s>In turn, clock proteins repress or activate transcription of themselves or other clock genes, in this way generating the rhythms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>When organisms are held under rhythmic conditions, such as 12hr/12hr light-dark cycles, the circadian clocks in their cells become synchronized to these external so-called zeitgebers.</s><s>Strictly, one then speaks of diurnal rhythms in gene expression, although here we use the term circadian rhythms also for this case.</s></p><p><s>The cellular circadian clock becomes manifest in an output of rhythmic mRNA expression of typically hundreds or thousands of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The CCGs are thought to be controlled to a large extent by transcription factors (TFs) or coregulators with rhythmic abundances that are part of the cellular circadian clock.</s><s>In mammals, prominent examples are the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer, which binds to E-boxes in promoters of its target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the nuclear receptors REV-ERB α and β, which bind to ROR elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and DBP and E4BP4, which bind to D-boxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the CLOCK homolog CLK has a similar function, also binding to E-boxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Rhythmic binding of these core circadian clock TFs (CTFs) and their coregulators to promoters are thought to induce rhythms in transcriptional activities, which ultimately lead to rhythms in mRNA and protein abundances.</s></p><p><s>Circadian transcriptional rhythms have been investigated by combined analysis of transcript abundances and CTF binding to corresponding promoters.</s><s>Mouse liver and Drosophila have served as useful model systems for investigating transcriptional rhythms, and by for instance comparing nascent transcript to mature mRNA abundances, the propagation of rhythms from transcriptional activities to transcript abundances can be monitored <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Analysis of such data has revealed a contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to the generation of rhythms in mature mRNA abundances, but transcriptional rhythms remain the dominant determinant of the rhythmic transcriptome <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>Circadian rhythm generation is correlated with rhythmic binding of CTFs to binding sites in the promoters of genes with circadian mRNA expression: for instance, BMAL1 binding phases (peak time), measured at the promoter level in mouse liver, correlate well with phases of the corresponding transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>On the bioinformatics and data analysis side, position weight matrix (PWM) based prediction of TF binding sites at the promoter population level paired with quantitative modeling has led to additional insights into the combinatorial regulation of rhythmic transcription by CTFs and also other circadian TFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>However, the layer of mechanistic rhythm propagation between CTF binding and transcriptional rhythms has not been characterized systematically.</s><s>This layer consists of the core promoter and its chromatin environment, the latter which entails specific nucleosome arrangements and histone tail modifications.</s><s>There are different classes of core promoters, and a question that has not yet been addressed is whether certain types of core promoters are more suitable than others to propagate rhythmic TF binding to rhythmic transcriptional activities.</s></p><p><s>Core promoters often contain specific binding sites (core promoter elements) for general transcription factors (GTFs) such as TFIID and TFIIB <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>GTFs together with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) nucleate the pre-initiation complex (PIC), which assembles at the transcription start site (TSS) before transcription can initiate.</s><s>Different GTFs play different roles in PIC nucleation and initiation of transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The TFIID subunit TATA-binding protein (TBP) binds to the TATA box, a core promoter element conserved from archaea to mammals, situated ~30 bp upstream of the TSS.</s><s>The TFIIB subunit binds to BRE elements, located closely upstream (BREu) or downstream (BREd) of the TATA box, and helps recruiting Pol II.</s><s>Other GTFs help opening DNA at the promoter to form a so-called transcription bubble, and also phosphorylate Pol II at its C-terminal domain and prime it for transcription.</s><s>Various combinations of core promoter elements are thought to modulate the propagation of TF binding to transcriptional activation, in this manner helping to specify developmentally regulated or tissue specific transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Eukaryotic core promoters are often thought to have an inactive ground state, assured by a tendency for nucleosomes to cover promoter DNA.</s><s>In this ground state, the TSS is assumed to be covered by a nucleosome which constitutes a certain barrier for Pol II to penetrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Transcriptional activators recruit various chromatin remodeling factors, which facilitate PIC assembly and transcriptional initiation by loosening the nucleosomal barrier.</s><s>This can happen through e.g.</s><s>histone acetylation and ATP-dependent nucleosomal displacement, as shown for the human IFN-β promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>One mode of circadian regulation of transcription could then be rhythmic binding and unbinding of transcription factors, resulting in rhythmic recruitment of histone modifiers and nucleosome remodelers that in turn free up the TSS for PIC formation and transcription initiation in a rhythmic fashion.</s><s>Such a mode is indeed consistent with several hallmarks of the strongly circadian Dbp transcript, including observed rhythmic CLOCK/ BMAL1 binding, histone H3 Lys4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and Lys9 acetylation modifications, as well as rhythmic gross H3 abundance at the TSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>However, a subset of metazoan promoters appear to have an active ground state, in the sense that they are depleted of nucleosomes and bound by Pol II even when there is no active transcription.</s><s>A signature of such promoters is a high level of Pol II immediately downstream of the TSS (as detected by ChIP-Seq), compared to the Pol II level in the gene body <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>The TSS to gene body Pol II ratio is referred to as pausing index, since Pol II has often already engaged in initial transcription at these promoters but sits paused ~50 bp downstream of the TSS.</s><s>Paused Pol II is specifically detectable by techniques such as global run-on sequencing (GRO-Seq) as sharp peaks of nascent mRNA fragments aligning just downstream of the TSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>There are regulated processes promoting such pausing, which involve pausing factors such as DSIF and NELF.</s><s>Induction of transcription at these TSSs involves pause release factors such as P-TEFb <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are several correlated hallmarks of promoters with active ground state, including nucleosome-depleted regions immediately upstream of the TSSs, absence of TATA box, high levels of Pol II and the H3K4me3 mark immediately downstream of the TSS, as well as high levels of the H2A.Z histone variant at the first nucleosome downstream of the TSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr"

mammalian promoters with active ground state, there is the additionally associated hallmark of high observed to expected ratios of CpG dinucleotides around the TSS (hereafter: CpG ratios).</s><s>The distribution of this ratio computed for promoters is bimodal, motivating a classification of promoters as either having low or high CpG ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref>.</s><s>The causal relationships between these hallmarks are debated and not easily teased apart.</s><s>Probably, causality is cyclical in some cases: for instance, Pol II recruits the H3K4 methylases SET1 and MLL1 at some promoters <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, while H3K4me3 in turn is able to actively recruit the TAF3 subunit of TFIID, a part of the Pol II pre-initiation complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>.</s><s>There are also several other mechanisms that help explain the correlated hallmarks of promoters with active ground state.</s><s>Non-methylated CpG dinucleotides may recruit the protein CFP1, which in turn is associated with SET1, resulting in increased H3K4me3 levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>.</s><s>The H3K4me3 mark may help recruit ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers to influence nucleosome positioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>.</s><s>Certain TF coregulators, nucleosome-depleted regions, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers may elevate levels of the H2A.Z variant at the +1 nucleosome <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48]</ref>.</s><s>Although a debated issue, in vitro and in vivo evidence collected to date suggest CpG dinucleotides help instruct the formation of nucleosome-depleted regions of mammalian promoters <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>.</s><s>Besides this DNA sequence feature, proteins associated with CpG-rich DNA as well as ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers probably help to establish nucleosome-depleted regions in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, TSSbound Pol II, perhaps in a paused state, could contribute to establishing nucleosome-depleted regions by sterically hindering nucleosome formation in a competitive fashion.</s><s>This effect is probably more pronounced at nucleosome-depleted regions at CpG-poor promoters, with their higher propensity for nucleosome coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">53]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Based on these myriad features and mechanisms, two main metazoan promoter classes, type I and type II promoters, have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref>.</s><s>Type I promoters drive regulated, tissue-specific mRNA expression, have an inactive ground state with a less pronounced nucleosome-depleted region, are enriched for TATA boxes, and are depleted of CpG dinucleotides in vertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56]</ref>.</s><s>These promoters are often focused, which means that they have a well defined TSS, as measured with the CAGE assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>.</s><s>Type II promoters drive ubiquitously expressed transcripts, have more pronounced nucleosome-depleted regions, are enriched for the H3K4me3 mark, CpG dinucleotides, and are depleted of TATA boxes.</s><s>These promoters are often dispersed, meaning that they have multiple TSSs scattered over regions of tens or hundreds of bp <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56]</ref>.</s><s>They are also enriched for constitutively transcribed ("housekeeping") genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, presumably because their nucleosome-depleted regions are conducive to constitutive transcription.</s></p><p><s>Both type I and type II promoters may govern inducible transcription, however implemented in different manners, as suggested by two studies of LPS-induced transcription of ~50 genes in mouse macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">59]</ref>.</s><s>Primary response genes, which are quickly induced without requirement for additional protein synthesis, tend to have type II promoters, and induction tends to occur by induced release of paused Pol II.</s><s>Secondary response genes, which are more slowly induced with requirement for additional protein synthesis, tend to have type I promoters, require ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and to have an inactive basal state without bound Pol II with a nucleosome blocking PIC assembly.</s><s>Open questions include whether circadian transcription-a particular mode of inducible expression-preferably employs type I or type II promoters, to which degree these rhythms are accompanied by oscillations on the associated chromatin hallmarks at the core promoters, and which mechanisms might be involved in circadian regulation of transcription at the core promoter.</s></p><p><s>This report describes the core promoters of genes transcribed in a circadian manner (hereafter: circadian promoters) in mouse liver and in Drosophila, by integrating promoter sequence features (CpG ratios and core promoter elements) with a wealth of genome-wide data measuring chromatin state, transcriptional activities, and CTF binding (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>It is shown that the core promoter is of greatest importance for circadian transcription.</s><s>In particular, a core promoter class in mouse combining hallmarks of type I and type II promoters is uncovered.</s><s>This promoter class, here termed strong circadian promoter, drives circadian transcription with both high amplitudes and high average transcriptional rates.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core promoters of circadian genes are CpG-depleted and strongly enriched for TATA boxes</head><p><s>To investigate whether there is a preferred core promoter architecture for circadian promoters in mammals, a collection of mouse transcripts assignable to unique TSSs and promoters was established (RefSeq transcript annotation, Methods).</s><s>The transcriptional activities producing these transcripts were estimated by reanalyzing Nascent-Seq data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>These data were collected from mouse livers sampled every 4 hrs under 12 hr/12 hr light-dark (LD) conditions (time points hereafter referred to as zeitgeber time, ZT).</s><s>To avoid confounding effects from lighting conditions, only data obtained from mice held under LD were used in the present study.</s><s>A group of 1895 promoters with very clear rhythmic transcriptional activities (Methods) were classified as circadian promoters.</s><s>In contrast, a background group of 5829 promoters with significant transcriptional activities yet without any signs of circadian rhythms were classified as constitutive promoters.</s><s>A group of 4892 silent promoters without detectable or with very low transcriptional activities was also identified.</s><s>For rhythmic activities, relative amplitudes (absolute amplitudes divided by means, hereafter: amplitudes) were estimated by harmonic regression (Methods) and used for the further analysis.</s><s>To characterize core promoters, areas in the vicinities of the TSSs were scanned for the presence of TATA boxes, BREu, and BREd motifs (Methods and S1A Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>In addition, CpG ratios were quantified (Methods).</s><s>Furthermore, MNase-Seq data <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref>, which quantify nucleosome occupancies, were reanalyzed.</s><s>A summary statistic for nucleosome occupancy for each promoter was formed by averaging nucleosome coverages between −101 and −1 bp from the TSS.</s><s>Finally, mouse liver CAGE data, which measure precise TSS usage by transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>, were used to classify promoters as focused or dispersed (Methods).</s><s>Focused promoters have a welldefined TSS: Most transcripts start within a narrow range of a few bp.</s><s>Dispersed promoters give rise to transcripts with starting positions varying by tens of bp.</s><s>These three characteristics-core promoter sequence features and motifs, nucleosome occupancy, and TSS variationhave previously been used to characterize different promoter classes, and were used as a starting point for the present study.</s></p><p><s>Circadian promoters turned out to be enriched for TATA boxes when compared to constitutive promoters (Fig 2A, Fisher's exact test, p &lt; 5×10 −7 , odds ratio 1.54), although not as strongly enriched as silent promoters.</s><s>However, circadian promoters driving transcription with high amplitudes and high average activity were exceptionally strongly enriched for TATA boxes, with around 35% TATA box containing promoters (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Circadian promoters had a slightly less pronounced nucleosome-depleted region immediately upstream of the TSS than constitutive promoters (rank sum test, p &lt;
