<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p><s>Objective: In a recent genome-wide association study of subcortical brain volumes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> we have identified common genetic variation at rs945270 as having the strongest effect on putamen volume, a brain measure linked to familial risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</s><s>To determine whether rs945270 is a genetic determinant of ADHD, we now explored it impacts on ADHD-related symptoms and on neural mechanisms of ADHD, such as response inhibition and reward sensitivity.</s></p><p><s>Method: We used a large population sample of 1,834 14-years old adolescents to test the effects of rs945270 on (i) ADHD symptoms accessed through the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and (ii) Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses of putamen activation by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using the Stop Signal (SST) and monetary incentive delay (MID) tasks, assessing response inhibition and rewards sensitivity, respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>We found a significant link between rs945270 and ADHD symptoms scores, the C-allele being associated with lower symptoms scores, most notably hyperactivity.</s></p><p><s>We also observed sex-specific effects of this variant on the brain.</s><s>In boys, the C-allele associated with lower putamen activity during successful response inhibition, a brain response that was not associated with ADHD symptoms.</s><s>In girls, putamen activation during reward anticipation increased with the number of C-alleles, most significantly in the right putamen.</s><s>Remarkably, right putamen activation during reward anticipation tended to negatively correlate with ADHD symptoms.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Abnormalities in subcortical brain structures, notably in the putamen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> have been linked to Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a highly heritable and multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>The age-dependent reductions in putamen volume that normally occur during childhood throughout early adulthood are not observed in ADHD patients and their non-affected siblings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> suggesting that heritable differences in developmental putamen trajectories contribute to the risk for ADHD.</s></p><p><s>Thus, the examination of individual differences in ADHD-related measures including the putamen, in a nonclinical sample of youth may provide valuable insight into the disease.</s></p><p><s>That abnormalities within the putamen contribute to the pathology of ADHD is further supported findings showing that lesions of the putamen tend to associate with ADHD symptomatology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Functional neuroimaging approaches have been helpful in identifying the neural mechanisms underlying ADHD symptoms.</s><s>Task-based fMRI studies have shown that ADHD associates with poor response inhibition (i.e., a deficit in the ability to stop an already planned or initiated action), due to abnormalities in frontal-striatal and frontal-parietal networks in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> which may underlie some of the deficits in impulse control observed in ADHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>On the other hand, several fMRI studies have observed decreased activation of the ventral striatum -an area including the ventromedial putamen <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> B. Xu et al.</s></p><p><s>during anticipation of reward in both adolescents and adults with ADHD, which led to the hypothesis that ADHD is part of a reward deficiency syndrome reflecting the impact of dysregulation of dopamine on the reward system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Despite evidence implicating the putamen in the pathology of ADHD, its distinctive contributions in the neurobiology of ADHD remains understudied, possibly because, small subcortical brain regions like the putamen are relatively difficult to observe in whole brain fMRI.</s></p><p><s>Progress to identify genetic factors contributing to putamen development was made through our recent genome-wide meta-analysis that identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associating with subcortical regions, with the strongest effects observed for rs94527 on the volume of the putamen.</s><s>Genotypes at this SNP appear to have functional consequences as the C-allele at this locus, which associates with increased putamen volume, also associates with increased expression of the nearby KTN1 gene in brain and in blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>This gene is known to play a role in intracellular organelle motility and it is interesting to note that its expression was found to be decreased in patients with Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and in depressed women undergoing antidepressant-treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Results of these analyses also indicated that while rs945270 associated with putamen volume across the lifespan, the effects of this SNP on putamen volume tended to decrease with the mean age of each participating cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>This, and the age-dependent reductions of putamen volume from childhood through early adulthood in controls but not in individuals with ADHD or their unaffected siblings <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , suggested that rs945270's effect on the putamen might predispose to ADHD.</s></p><p><s>To test this, we analyzed the effects of rs945270 on putamen function and its relation to ADHD-related phenotypes in a large healthy cohort of 14-year-old adolescents, using the Stop-Signal (SST) and the Monetary-Incentive-Delay (MID) fMRI tasks that assess motor control and reward processing, respectively.</s></p></div>
