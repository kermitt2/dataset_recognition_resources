<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Involuntary weight loss is a major problem in patients with locally advanced HNSCC.</s><s>The reasons for weight loss include difficulties with oral intake due to tumorrelated symptoms such as mechanical obstruction and pain as well as treatment related toxicities.</s><s>Moreover, weight loss might also cause tumor-associated cachexia, a condition thought to be a multifactorial metabolic disorder.</s><s>In our trial, the proportion of patients having weight loss &gt;5% was 32% before, and 51% during treatment, and the proportion of patients with &gt;10% weight loss was 12% before, and 17% during treatment.</s><s>Here we could show that weight loss &gt;10% before treatment is a major predicting factor of decreased survival outcomes after chemoradiation or RT alone.</s><s>In contrast and interestingly, weight loss during treatment appeared not to be associated with cancer outcome.</s></p><p><s>Obesity has previously been described to be associated with improved OS in HNSCC and esophageal cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>For patients with locally advanced HNSCC it has been further reported that pretreatment weight loss ≥10% was associated with decreased OS after multivariable analysis after chemoradiation in a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 92 patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In this cohort weight loss ≥10% was observed in 49% of patients.</s></p><p><s>Langius et al. reported on 1340 prospectively collected HNSCC patients, two thirds of those underwent primary RT therapy or chemoradiation, the remaining patients underwent surgery and adjuvant RT therapy.</s><s>No weight loss before treatment was observed in 70%, ≤5% in 16%, &gt;5-10% in 9% and &gt;10% weight loss in 5% of patients, respectively.</s><s>During RT weight loss &gt;5% was observed in 57% of patients.</s><s>Weight loss &gt;10% before treatment remained associated with decreased OS after multivariable analysis and weight loss during RT remained to be associated with decreased disease-specific-survival after multivariable analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In a large retrospective cohort of 1562 patients with HNSCC in which two thirds underwent surgery and adjuvant RT and the remaining patients primary chemoradiation Pai et al. could describe that decreased pretreatment body mass index (BMI) was associated with decreased CSS and OS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Overall body weight loss during RT did not influence survival outcomes (39% of patients experienced a body weight loss of ≥5% during RT).</s><s>In the group with higher pretreatment BMI and less weight loss (&lt;5%) during treatment, however CSS, DMFS and OS was better as compared with those patients having greater weight loss (≥5%) during treatment.</s></p><p><s>Cho et al. reported on 226 retrospectively analyzed patients with HNSCC of which 74% underwent surgery and 61% either primary or adjuvant RT <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Weight loss ≥10% during the year after initial treatment was observed in 42% of patients.</s><s>T classification and N classification were significantly associated with the occurrence of weight loss ≥10% in this series.</s><s>After multivariable analyses, weight loss ≥10% was a predictor of decreased diseasefree survival.</s></p><p><s>The proportion of patients observed with significant weight loss in our trial appears to be within the range reported in the literature and we could gather further indications for the importance of pretreatment weight loss as a major prognostic factor.</s><s>Interestingly, however, we could find no indications that weight loss during treatment has any prognostic role.</s><s>This finding might question the Weight loss during treatment

Plots.</s></p><p><s>benefit of a rigorous strategy against weight loss during treatment.</s><s>Taking into account both the significant morbidity and costs associated with both, feeding tubes and/or parenteral nutrition, more evidence is warranted to define the optimal nutritional support during chemoradiation of advanced HNSCC and its impact on treatment outcome.</s><s>We believe that pretreatment weight loss is most probably caused by cancer-associated cachexia and that it is associated with advanced disease factors and decreased performance status.</s><s>It might be that an impaired immune response caused by significant pre-treatment weight loss further contributes to the decreased survival outcomes.</s><s>Interestingly pretreatment weight loss was significantly associated with lower baseline hemoglobin values, a factor which was associated with decreased survival outcomes in a previous analysis of this dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, however, baseline hemoglobin did not remain significant in the multivariable analysis for the different survival endpoints analyzed.</s><s>One limitation of our study is that smoking habits were not collected as there is an association between weight, weight loss and smoking habits and smoking status might be a confounding factor for mortality.</s><s>Another limitation of this work is the fact that the pre-treatment weight was asked by recall, which could potentially be associated with some impreciseness.</s></p><p><s>In a secondary analysis of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 90-03 trial which prospectively collected data on nutritional support delivered before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment data of the 1073 evaluable patients were analyzed against outcome.</s><s>Interestingly, patients receiving pre-treatment nutritional support experienced significantly less weight loss by the  1.4 (0.9-2.1) (0.12) 1.5 (0.9-2.5) (0.08) 1.6 (0.9-2.9) (0.1) 1.1

nutritional support.</s><s>Yet patients receiving pre-treatment nutritional support had a poorer 5-year actuarial locoregional control rate and a poorer 5-year overall survival rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>This finding indicates that the mechanism behind the negative impact of pretreatment weight loss is more complex than just mechanical obstruction and pain caused by the primary tumor.</s><s>It rather points towards biological and metabolic factors associated with the aggressiveness of the primary tumor and/or the tumor load.</s><s>It is therefore questionable whether the prognosis of these patients can simply be improved by correction of the nutritional status.</s></p><p><s>Our study confirms within the frame of a prospective randomized trial that patients with significant pretreatment weight loss are at higher risk for treatment failure.</s><s>So far, no specific intervention has been established to counteract this adverse condition in order to improve patients' survival.</s><s>We propose to stick to a tight follow up schedule for these high-risk patients.</s><s>Moreover, as another consequence of our results, we suggest that future prospective studies in head and neck cancer might benefit from stratification according to pretreatment weight loss.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure
