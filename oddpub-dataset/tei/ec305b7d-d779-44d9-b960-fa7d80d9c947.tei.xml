<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>particular niche component, the extracellular matrix (ECM), has been identified as a particularly important source of cues that direct cell fate decisions.</s><s>Biomaterials have been designed to mimic these niches by presenting specific signaling cues to modulate stem cell expansion, migration and gene expression <ref type="bibr">2 -4 , 9</ref> .</s><s>Biophysical aspects of the ECM, including elasticity, have been linked to a variety of cellular behaviors in vitro and in vivo using hydrogel systems <ref type="bibr">5 , 6 , 10</ref> .</s><s>However, current materials used to manipulate cell fate via matrix elasticity (e.g.</s><s>mechanotransduction) in 3D limit cell motility, proliferation or new tissue formation <ref type="bibr">6 , 11</ref> .</s><s>Materials used to elicit tissue formation via transplanted cells must also degrade to allow space for new tissue formation <ref type="bibr">12 , 13</ref> .</s><s>Unlike materials used to study mechanobiology in vitro, these transplantable, degradable scaffolds typically exhibit mechanical properties that change continuously over time, making it difficult to study relationships between matrix mechanics and cell behavior.</s><s>Slowly degrading macroporous sponges fabricated from polymers such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) exhibit a structure compatible with tissue ingrowth <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , but these protein-fouling materials do not allow precise control of the cell-material interface, making it difficult to control transplanted cell behavior through defined insoluble cues.</s></p><p><s>To address the limitations of current materials, we developed void-forming hydrogels.</s><s>Within these materials, cells are initially encapsulated into a nanoporous hydrogel milieu that subsequently form pores in situ, after injection into host tissues.</s><s>Current techniques used to create macroporous biomaterials rely on extraction of porogen templates by solvents <ref type="bibr">7 , 15 , 16</ref> , in situ degradation of soft materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , phase inversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , cell-mediated degradation of single phase hydrogels <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , or 3D printing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>A significant drawback of scaffold-based methods is that they typically do not allow simple delivery of the material via injection.</s><s>While enzymatically degradable, single-phase hydrogel materials offer elegant control over cellular invasion, cell confinement within these systems remains strongly coupled to matrix elasticity, and enzyme-mediated changes to local mechanical properties may be difficult to control in a pre-determined manner.</s><s>Exogenous mechanical stimulation of cells in 3D culture alters their Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , suggesting it is likely that mechanotransduction pathways triggered by the interaction of cellular contractile forces and matrix elasticity will also alter MMP activity in these hydrogel systems.</s><s>In turn, this may make it difficult to decouple matrix elasticity from micron-scale cellular protrusion into the material.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that the aforementioned drawbacks could be overcome with a system wherein solid-phase porogens could be first encapsulated into a bulk hydrogel, but then degrade via hydrolysis, resulting in the creation of voids within the hydrogels after placement in physiologic conditions (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, the rate of pore formation and subsequent cell release, endogenous cell infiltration and tissue formation would then be controlled by the rate of porogen degradation and cell migration and proliferation within pores.</s><s>This would decouple the elasticity of the slowly degrading, "bulk" component (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, grey) from cell confinement by the gel, with the rate of void-formation and cell release pre-determined via the chemical composition of porogens.</s><s>Furthermore, these composite materials could be introduced into the body in a minimally invasive manner as long as the porogens within were smaller than the diameter of the injection needle.</s></p><p><s>To test the possibility of fabricating void-forming hydrogels, mechanically rigid, but rapidly degrading sacrificial gel porogens of an appropriate size (~150µm diameter; fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>) were formed from oxidized, hydrolytically labile alginate <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , and encapsulated into a "bulk" hydrogel comprised of slowly degrading, high molecular weight alginate (fig 1b,S1).</s><s>To assess the possibility of void formation in situ, we first performed scanning electron microscopy on composite gels that were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen at different timepoints after formation.</s><s>These studies suggested time-dependent void-formation (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), but because of concerns about artifactual pore formation during freezing and lyophilization, we developed a fluorescence assay to directly analyze void-formation within intact hydrogels (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Simultaneous in situ fluorescence analysis of the porogens (green) and bulk component (red) of void-forming hydrogels revealed that porogens were initially intact, but degraded in-situ to form voids (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Quantifying the kinetics of porogen degradation revealed a time-scale of approximately one week for the majority of porogen degradation (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c,d</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with these studies, rheological analysis of the shear modulus G' of these composite materials seven days after formation indicated a porogen-density dependent decrease in G' in void-forming hydrogels, as compared to intact, standard hydrogels (not containing porogen) at day 0 (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>).</s><s>When the density of pores was above 50%, the relationship between pore concentration and the decrease of G' was nearly linear (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>), consistent with theoretical predictions of the mechanical behavior of pore-filled solids <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The effects of pore formation on encapsulated cell morphology and distribution within the void-forming hydrogels were next analyzed.</s><s>Clonally derived mouse mesenchymal stem cells (mMSC; D1, ref. 24 ) were used as a cell model.</s><s>Previous studies involving non-porous hydrogels indicate these cells and human MSC exhibit similar responses to matrix composition, but that D1 demonstrate less spontaneous osteogenic differentiation than primary human MSC 6 . <ref type="bibr"

increased as the density of RGD peptides was raised from 0 to 750µM.</s><s>Based on this finding, it is most likely that modulating bulk matrix elasticity affected cell release by altering cells' ability to mechanically deform the hydrogel surrounding voids, as they migrate through the composite material.</s></p><p><s>Cell deployment from void-forming hydrogels in vivo was analyzed using genetically labeled cells within hydrogels transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice.</s><s>In the first week following cell transplantation, there was a slight (30%) decrease in the fluorescent signal

statistically significant increase in the amount of new bone formation, compared to cells alone (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,b</ref>).</s><s>Histologic analysis revealed that when hMSC were delivered via saline bolus, much of the newly formed bone was near the margin of the original defect, likely reflecting ingrowth of tissue adjacent the defect, rather than new bone formation (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</s><s>Delivery with nanoporous gels led to large masses of hydrogel remaining in the defect site, and the osteogenic tissue that had formed in this condition was often contained within the remaining hydrogel and not in continuity with host tissues (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Compared to standard hydrogels, void-forming gels left a much smaller amount of remaining gel material 12 weeks following transplantation (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S5</ref>), and analysis of trichrome stained sections also revealed the presence of osteoblasts emanating from the small fragments of residual material in void-forming gels near the center of defects, consistent with the assumption that cells that directly interact with the material contributed to new bone formation (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</s><s>To determine the origin of the newly generated bone, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies to detect the primate specific Alu repeat mRNA sequence, on samples obtained after 4 weeks.</s><s>Although mineralization had already occurred at this time point, it was less extensive than at 12 weeks, making FISH analysis feasible.</s><s>At four weeks, although there were clearly detectable human cells remaining within both standard and void-forming hydrogels, the vast majority of cells were non-primate (rodent) in origin (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that transplanted cells either served as a source of osteogenic cytokines, or recruited endogenous rodent cells, which subsequently interacted with the gel to form bone.</s><s>This hypothesis may be testable via implantation of acellular hydrogels, either with or without cytokine loading.</s><s>However, precisely matching cell-mediated cytokine delivery in terms of specific proteins and kinetics may prove challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Finally, studies were performed to test the hypothesis that matrix elasticity regulates bone formation by transplanted stem cells.</s><s>Strikingly, new bone formation exhibited a marked dependence on bulk matrix elasticity, with optimal regeneration occurring within materials with an intermediate elastic modulus (60 kPa; fig.</s><s><ref type="figure"

optimal micro-environment, even if the mechanical cues vary after that time <ref type="bibr">5 , 6</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Moreover, MSC-derived cells that were cultured under these osteo-permissive 3D conditions in vitro were previously shown to elaborate osteogenic cytokines such as osteocalcin <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , and this may have contributed to fate decisions within transplanted hMSC and stimulation of bone formation by endogenous cells.</s><s>µCT analysis of the bone mineral density and trichrome staining of tissue sections also suggested that the quality of newly formed bone was greatest at the intermediate bulk gel stiffness (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e-g</ref>).</s><s>Finally, trichrome staining of sections derived from defects into which hMSC were delivered from hydrogels of optimal elasticity revealed newly formed bone with entrapped cells and osteoblasts on the bone surfaces, suggesting that tissue formation within the defect site mimics hallmarks of endogenous bone formation (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4h-j</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The elastic modulus found in these studies to best induce bone formation and stimulate defect repair is similar to the optimal range found to induce osteogenic gene and protein expression in encapsulated MSC in nanoporous gels in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>This suggests that mechanotransduction pathways that regulate stem cell gene and protein expression in vitro might be directly transferred to complex in vivo processes such as bone formation.</s><s>Because the pore size of hydrogels used in that previous work were not permissive to cell migration or marked expansion, this result further suggests that at least part of the contribution of matrix elasticity to new bone formation is directly related to mechanically-induced osteogenesis, and not simply secondary to cells' ability to egress from gels.</s><s>Furthering this notion that migration was not the sole determinant of mechanically-controlled bone formation in the present study was our in vitro observation that MSC deployment was most pronounced in void-forming gels with a bulk component elasticity near 5 kPa -a range that was not compatible with new bone growth.</s><s>Nevertheless, the bone repair we observed likely required some cell migration and proliferation and the ability of hydrogels with elasticity in the 60 kPa range to support these processes (based on in vitro assays, fig.</s><s><ref type="figure"

gels.</s><s>However, MSCs near a newly formed pore likely experience a slightly diminished modulus compared to the stiffness sensed in nanoporous hydrogels <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , and this may underlie the small discrepancy.</s><s>The finding that bone regeneration was initiated in the absence of exogenous growth factors suggests that these mechanotransduction pathways act synergistically with low basal endogenous levels of osteogenic cytokines <ref type="bibr">37 , 40</ref> .</s><s>Importantly, this suggests that optimally designed materials could be used to obtain highly localized control over transplanted cell fate, preventing deleterious off-target effects that have previously been observed when high levels of locally administered osteogenic cytokines can diffuse out of the intended application area <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Given the promise of harnessing mechanotransduction toward transplanted-cell mediated tissue repair,
