<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of the study</head><p><s>There is an ongoing debate in the field of neuro-oncology about the benefit of BEV therapy for patients with GBM.</s><s>Two large phase III trials investigated the addition of bevacizumab to standard therapy, which did not result in a survival advantage for patients.</s><s>However, the reports about BEV effects on patients' QoL were controversial in both trials.</s><s>In these phase III trials, QoL was only evaluated during primary treatment.</s><s>In contrast, the GLARIUS trial investigated the role of bevacizumab on QoL during the whole course of the disease, including an analysis of QoL during postprogression therapy.</s></p><p><s>time to postprogression deterioration was prolonged in the standard arm receiving crossover second-line BEV in the vast majority of patients at the time of evaluation.</s><s>Conclusions: GLARIUS did not find indications for a BEV-induced detrimental effect on QoL in first-line therapy of MGMT-nonmethylated GBM patients.</s><s>Moreover, GLARIUS provided some indirect corroborative data supporting the notion that BEV may have beneficial effects upon QoL in relapsed GBM.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key words bevacizumab | crossover therapy | glioblastoma | progression | quality of life</head><p><s>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating disease with a particularly short survival in the large subgroup of patients having a tumor with a nonmethylated O <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s>Standard temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy has virtually no benefit in this subgroup.</s><s>In search of new first-line therapies for these patients, the randomized phase II GLARIUS trial explored the value of anti-angiogenic therapy using the vascular endothelial growth factor-A antibody bevacizumab (BEV) in combination with the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan (IRI).</s><s>The GLARIUS trial showed that BEV/IRI is superior to standard TMZ regarding progressionfree survival (PFS) at 6 months. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>Similar to phase III trials exploring TMZ + BEV versus TMZ in an unselected population of newly diagnosed GBM patients (the AVAglio trial, 3 RTOG0825 4 ), GLARIUS showed that median PFS was prolonged from 5.99 months in patients treated with TMZ to 9.7 months with primary BEV/IRI therapy.</s><s>However, overall survival was not prolonged. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>In contrast to the similarity of their survival results, data on quality of life (QoL) and neurocognition in AVAglio and RTOG0825 are somehow controversial.</s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> The GLARIUS trial also included an extensive QoL evaluation program.</s><s>Regarding QoL analysis, 2 aspects were fundamentally different in GLARIUS as opposed to AVAglio and RTOG0825: (i) In contrast to the AVAglio and RTOG0825 trials, the acquisition of QoL data did not stop at tumor progression in the GLARIUS trial, so that the development of QoL parameters throughout the entire course of the disease was monitored, thus also postprogression QoL could be analyzed; (ii) the protocol of GLARIUS included an optional crossover from the standard arm to BEV therapy as second-line therapy-with 82% of all patients treated with second-line therapy receiving BEV therapy after progression, 2 GLARIUS is the first trial that allows analysis of the influence of second-line BEV therapy on postprogression QoL.</s><s>The results of these analyses regarding QoL and other parameters potentially associated with QoL, such as cognitive functioning, performance score, and steroid use, are summarized here.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments and Statistical Evaluation of QoL</head><p><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> These are validated questionnaires provided on paper that are completed by patients without assistance prior to meeting the physician and discussing examination results, treatments, and perspectives.</s><s>Each patient had to complete the questionnaires at baseline and at least every 3 months throughout the course of the disease.</s><s>The results were transformed to a 0-to 100-point scale according to algorithms detailed in a scoring manual supplied by the EORTC, 10 and summarized in 26 dimensions (6 functional, 20 symptom scores).</s><s>Higher functional scores are favorable, while higher symptom scores are unfavorable.</s></p><p><s>The longitudinal development of each dimension compared with baseline was analyzed using a model with generalized estimating equations (GEE) with independence working correlation with weights to account for missing data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref></s><s>Additionally, the time to first deterioration of each patient in each domain was determined and Kaplan-Meier plots (log-rank test for significance) were calculated for each arm.</s><s>No correction for multiple testing was applied due to the explorative nature of the analyses.</s><s>Similar to AVAglio, 5 a 10-point deterioration (as seen from the patient's perspective, ie, higher values on symptom scores, lower values on functional scores) on the 100point scale was regarded as relevant.</s><s>Deterioration was only recorded if the QoL change was not reverted with the next measurement to a value of overall less than 10 points in comparison with the baseline value.</s><s>Death from any cause but not tumor progression was regarded as an event.</s><s>Similar analyses were performed for the time to postprogression deterioration.</s><s>Values of QoL measurement obtained up to day 30 after progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> were taken as baseline.</s><s>Only patients having a second measurement after progression entered analysis.</s><s>Effect sizes were calculated by using the Cox regression analysis.</s><s>Finally, the timepoint of first deterioration of QoL was set in relationship to the timepoint of progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> for each patient.</s><s>Differences between the arms in the rate of patients experiencing QoL deterioration prior to tumor progression versus after tumor progression were analyzed using contingency tables and a chi-square test.</s></p><p><s>For the figure arrangements, we selected a total of 6 domains for preferred presentation.</s><s>The domains of physical functioning, social functioning, global health status, motor dysfunction, and communication deficit were selected to offer an easy comparison with the results of AVAglio, where the preferred presentation of these items was already prespecified in the protocol.</s><s>The sixth item (cognitive functioning) was also selected for preferred presentation, since the question of BEV-induced cognitive changes is one of the main discussion points between AVAglio and RTOG0825.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of KPS, MMSE, and Steroid Use</head><p><s>At the same timepoints that the EORTC QLQ questionnaires had to be completed, further parameters which may be associated with general physical and cognitive functioning were recorded: KPS and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).</s><s>The KPS, which grades performance of activities of daily life on a 100-point scale, was recorded by the treating physician or the study nurse.</s><s>The MMSE is a composite test for different aspects of neurocognitive functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13</ref> ; the results of the MMSE are graded on a 30-point scale.</s><s>As for the QoL dimensions described above, KPS and MMSE were analyzed using a GEE model for changes from baseline, a time to first deterioration, and a time to postprogression deterioration analysis.</s><s>Persisting drops of 20 points or more on the KPS scale and 3 points on the MMSE scale were regarded as significant deterioration and therefore as an event for Kaplan-Meier analysis.</s><s>For both analyses, progressive disease according to Macdonald and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> was not regarded as an event.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, the steroid use which may be associated with QoL was recorded.</s><s>The group of patients not having a significant amount of steroids (&lt;2 mg dexamethasone equivalent within 5 days of baseline examination) at baseline was analyzed for the parameter "time to (re)initiation of steroid medication" using Kaplan-Meier statistics.</s><s>Differences between the treatment arms were analyzed using the log-rank test.</s><s>The analysis was performed irrespective of the detection of progressive disease.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The GLARIUS QoL data show that primary BEV therapy neither impairs nor improves QoL compared with standard TMZ therapy.</s><s>Beyond that, postprogression time to QoL deterioration, however, was prolonged in the standard arm for the motor dysfunction and headache domains, an effect which could be related to a beneficial effect of second-line BEV therapy that most patients received in this arm.</s></p><p><s>The GLARIUS QoL data have to be compared with data of the 2 larger phase III trials, AVAglio 3,5 and RTOG0825. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>omparability is, however, limited, since GLARIUS exclusively recruited patients with MGMT-nonmethylated tumors, while AVAglio and RTOG0825 recruited irrespective of MGMT status and did not perform QoL subgroup analyses according to MGMT status.</s><s>GLARIUS has in common with both larger trials that the examination rates in the first progression-free interval of treatment (ie, in the first 9 mo) were high, beyond 70%.</s><s>Later timepoints cannot be compared, since, in contrast to AVAglio and RTOG0825, GLARIUS also collected QoL data after tumor progression.</s><s>With a median PFS of about 6 months in the standard arm Neuro-Oncology and 9.7 months in the experimental arm, 2 the data from timepoints beyond 9 months after randomization are in the vast majority provided by patients having already experienced tumor progression and receiving second-line therapy.</s><s>The GLARIUS data confirm the AVAglio results that BEV does not have a negative impact on health-related QoL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>However, the observation of the AVAglio trial that the time to deterioration of global health status, communication deficits, and social functioning was prolonged by BEV therapy could not be confirmed by GLARIUS.</s><s>To explain this difference, one has to take into account that AVAglio counted tumor progression itself as an event, while GLARIUS analyzed QoL deterioration irrespective of tumor progression and, most importantly, beyond tumor progression.</s><s>Of note, the majority of the patients in the standard arm experienced deterioration of QoL only after the diagnosis of tumor progression (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, the application of second-line therapy (crossover BEV for  most patients of the standard arm) may have had a strong prolonging influence on the time to deterioration in the standard arm.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to GLARIUS, RTOG0825 observed a BEVdependent decrease of QoL in some domains (cognitive functioning, motor dysfunction, and communication deficit), mainly at timepoint 34 weeks after randomization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> One could argue that GLARIUS failed to detect the negative impact of BEV on QoL domains, since GLARIUS, in contrast to RTOG0825, recorded QoL data irrespective of tumor progression, so that early tumor progression with associated clinical deterioration as a confounder would be partially responsible for early deterioration of QoL in the standard arm, thus underestimating a potentially negative effect of BEV in the experimental arm in arm-to-arm comparisons.</s><s>However, there is a strong argument speaking against this notion and in favor of the interpretation that there was truly no detrimental effect of BEV on these QoL domains: Focusing exclusively on patients without tumor progression (similar to RTOG0825), GLARIUS did not see any BEVassociated unfavorable decline in these QoL domains at week 34 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>) and no indications for a reduced rate of favorable scores for these domains in the BEV arm compared with the standard arm (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The results of neurocognitive testing are not comparable between GLARIUS, AVAglio, and RTOG0825.</s><s>The MMSE results of AVAglio and GLARIUS are similar, with no differences between the treatment arms, but the MMSE is clearly inferior to detect small differences, especially in the most important domains of central executive functions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14</ref></s><s>The test battery applied by RTOG0825 is therefore more sensitive and valid.</s><s>With the RTOG0825 test battery, BEV-treated patients are underperforming in an oral word association test and the Trail Making test. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>However, the constraints mentioned in the previous paragraph regarding the exclusion of patients with tumor progression may also apply to the results of neurocognitive testing.</s></p><p><s>Regarding postprogression QoL, GLARIUS found a clinically relevant increased time to postprogression deterioration of motor dysfunction and headaches in the standard arm.</s><s>Since 82% of patients receiving second-line therapy in the standard arm received BEV/(IRI) therapy, the increase in postprogression time to QoL deterioration may be mainly due to an effective secondline BEV therapy (as opposed to presumably ineffective TMZ second-line therapy in the experimental arm).</s><s>The prolonged time to deterioration of headaches in the (secondarily BEV-treated) standard arm would very well fit in with an antitumoral and/or anti-edematous effect of second-line BEV therapy.</s></p><p><s>It is not fully clear why BEV has a positive impact on QoL only after progression.</s><s>Although it is very difficult to dissect the effects of IRI from the effects of BEV, we believe that IRI is not responsible for the differences seen in first-line versus second-line BEV treatment.</s><s>The main reason for this statement is found in the fact that even in first-line therapy many patients stopped additional IRI therapy early, so that IRI may not have a strong impact on QoL.</s><s>Also, a differential effect of BEV on newly diagnosed versus recurrent GBM is not very likely a main reason for the observed differences.</s><s>The main reason for the more apparent beneficial effect may be found in the fact that the standard arm treated with BEV at the time of rapid progression was treated with an active treatment, while for the patients in the experimental arm no active treatment at all was applicable, despite the rapid progression.</s><s>The lack of an effective treatment in the experimental arm in times of rapid tumor progression may be the driving force for the observed differences.</s><s>In the standard arm, this gives BEV the opportunity to show its impact on tumor progression-associated QoL.</s><s>This impact may be particularly prominent with rapidly progressive tumorous lesions usually seen in the relapsed situation compared with the first-line situation characterized by a high percentage of completely resected patients and radiotherapy as an at least partially effective therapy slowing tumor growth and deterioration of QoL in both arms.</s></p><p><s>Of course, the postprogression results have to be taken with caution, since there is an increasing rate of missing data at timepoints later than 9 months after randomization and the examination rates were higher in the BEV-treated standard arm than in the TMZ-treated experimental arm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> One may speculate whether the reduced rate of examinations in the predominantly TMZ-treated experimental arm could be attributed to the fact that patients with low performance scores are not able to complete the questionnaires.</s><s>If that is true, the differences in QoL between the 2 treatment arms might be even larger than suggested in our analysis.</s></p><p><s>In summary, GLARIUS did not find indications for a detrimental effect of BEV in first-line therapy of MGMTnonmethylated GBM patients.</s><s>Moreover, GLARIUS provided some indirect corroborative data supporting the notion that BEV may have beneficial effects upon QoL in relapsed GBM favoring a place of BEV in treatment of relapsed GBM.</s></p></div><figure
