<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p><s>Concomitant drug use was at the discretion of the treating physician.</s><s>Prespecified co-medications of interest were cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/P-glycoprotein inhibitors/inducers, platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAIs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</s><s>Crude event incidences were compared between rivaroxaban and SOC groups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein inhibitor/inducer use was infrequent, in contrast to PAI (~7%) and NSAID (~52%) use.</s><s>Rivaroxaban was associated with a lower incidence of overall symptomatic thromboembolic events compared with SOC, regardless of co-medication use.</s><s>In both treatment groups, PAI users, with higher age and prevalence of cardiovascular co-morbidities, had similar higher (&gt;7-fold) incidences of symptomatic arterial but not venous thromboembolic events compared with non-users.</s><s>NSAID use had no influence on thromboembolic events.</s><s>However, odds ratios (ORs) for major bleeding events (European Medicines Agency definition) were higher in NSAID users compared with non-users in rivaroxaban [OR = 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06, 2.13] and SOC (OR = 1.70;</s><s>CI 1.16, 2.49) groups.</s><s>In PAI users, ORs for major bleeding events were no different from those of non-users in both the rivaroxaban (OR = 1.49;</s><s>CI 0.84, 2.65) and SOC (OR = 1.46;</s><s>CI 0.82, 2.62) groups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT</head><p><s>• The XAMOS study confirmed the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban seen in the phase III (RECORD) Regulation of Coagulation in Orthopaedic Surgery to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism • Rivaroxaban is metabolized via CYP3A4 and a substrate of P-gp; drugs affecting these pathways can influence the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban.</s><s>• Concomitant use of NSAIDs or PAIs with anticoagulants may increase bleeding risks.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population and treatment</head><p><s>XAMOS was a non-interventional, open-label cohort study conducted in 252 centres in 37 countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Patients aged ≥18 years who were scheduled to undergo elective hip or knee replacement surgery (or fracture surgery in countries in which rivaroxaban was approved for this indication), and in whom a decision on pharmacological thromboprophylaxis had already been made, were eligible for inclusion in XAMOS.</s><s>Exclusion criteria were based on the contraindications listed in the approved local product information for rivaroxaban 10 mg <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and written informed consent was provided where necessary.</s><s>The present study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov</s><s>(NCT00831714), and the study protocol was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and approved by the appropriate independent ethics committee or an independent review board where required.</s></p><p><s>The use of rivaroxaban was recommended according to the approved 10 mg once-daily regimen in each country.</s><s>SOC regimens included, but were not limited to, low molecular weight heparins, unfractionated heparin, fondaparinux, dabigatran etexilate, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and vitamin K antagonists.</s><s>The type, duration and dose of pharmacological agents were determined by the attending physician before a patient was enrolled into the study.</s><s>The use of co-medications was at the discretion of the treating physician.</s><s>Of the 17 701 enrolled patients, 17 413 were included in the safety populationdefined as patients who received at least one dose of a thromboprophylactic drug (rivaroxaban or SOC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prespecified co-medications of interest</head><p><s>Because of their influence on the elimination pathway of rivaroxaban, inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp were selected as one group of co-medications of interest.</s><s>The corresponding drugs were selected in a step-wise approach, which included review of drugs listed in the draft guidance of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for drug interaction studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, drugs listed at http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/</s><s>DDIs/table.asp (as included on 9 December 2009) and selection of additional drugs from published reports.</s><s>CYP3A4 inhibitors were categorized by strength of inhibition according to the available FDA guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary (version updated on 1 June 2009) was used to identify the corresponding Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry Numbers for each compound, and, on the basis of this list, the WHO Drug Dictionary was searched to select the relevant drugs.</s><s>We performed separate analyses for CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors, although several compounds belong to both lists.</s><s>By contrast, we combined the lists for CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers because they were less frequently used and all identified P-gp inducers are also classified as CYP3A4 inducers.</s></p><p><s>PAIs and NSAIDs were selected as additional groups of co-medications because of their potential pharmacodynamic interaction with rivaroxaban and their effects on bleeding risk.</s><s>These drugs were identified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system.</s><s>All drugs listed in the corresponding ATC classes B01AC (PAIs excluding heparin) and M01A (anti-inflammatory/antirheumatic products, nonsteroids) were initially selected and included in the primary analysis.</s><s>Owing to the inevitable misclassification of some compounds following this procedure, a further analysis was performed that utilized the medications selected for the primary analysis but excluded some compounds belonging to ATC class M01AX.</s><s>This was done because some compounds in this class, which were used in a total of 117 patients, lacked the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction with rivaroxaban with an effect on bleeding risk (e.g.</s><s>compounds such as chondroitin or glucosamine).</s><s>The data for the latter analysis are presented in this study, with these 117 patients excluded.</s></p><p><s>Questions regarding the use of the prespecified co-medications (both pretrial use and concomitant use) were included in the Case Report Form and the information was recorded by the attending physician.</s><s>In the present report, pretrial use of the prespecified co-medications was defined as at least one drug dose intake within 7 days before surgery, whereas concomitant use was defined as any use of these co-medications during the study period.</s><s>Although both pretrial use and concomitant use of drugs were documented and are described here, the main objective of the present subanalysis was to assess the influence of concomitant use of the prespecified co-medications on the clinical outcomes during the study in patients receiving rivaroxaban or SOC.</s><s>Therefore, further analyses on clinical outcomes focused on concomitant use of the prespecified co-medications only.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome measures</head><p><s>The XAMOS study collected data on adverse events, including symptomatic thromboembolic events and bleeding events.</s><s>The treating physicians reported events that were coded according to the standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; version 14.0).</s></p><p><s>Symptomatic arterial and venous thromboembolic events occurring within 3 months after surgery were identified and adjudicated.</s><s>Data collected on bleeding events were differentiated as major and nonmajor bleeding events.</s><s>The primary safety outcome was major bleeding as defined in the RECORD studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>: clinically overt bleeding that was fatal, occurred in a critical organ, necessitated reoperation, or was outside of the surgical site and associated with a fall in haemoglobin of ≥2 g dl -1 or required a transfusion of ≥2 units of blood.</s><s>In addition, major bleeding events were defined in accordance with the EMA guidelines, which are similar to the RECORD major bleeding definition but with the inclusion of bleeding warranting treatment cessation and surgical site bleeding events associated with a fall in haemoglobin of ≥2 g dl -1 or leading to a transfusion of ≥2 units of blood or packed cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Bleeding events were defined as treatment-emergent events when they started on or after the day of the first dose and within 48 h after the last dose of thromboprophylactic drug.</s></p></div>
