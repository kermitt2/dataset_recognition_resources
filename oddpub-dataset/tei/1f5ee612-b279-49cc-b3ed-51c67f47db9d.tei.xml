<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intratracheal application of liposome encapsulated CG/NE</head><p><s>Twenty-four hours after M. tuberculosis infection, wild-type mice (129 S2/SvPasCrl) were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and received repetitive applications of liposomally encapsulated CG/NE (100 ml per mouse) or PBS containing liposomes as control.</s><s>For intratracheal instillation of liposomes, the trachea was exposed by surgical resection, and a 26-gauge catheter (Abbocath-T; Abbott Ireland, Sligo, Ireland) was inserted into the trachea under stereomicroscopic control.</s><s>After instillation, wounds were closed with sterile sutures.</s><s>After the mice fully recovered from anesthesia, they were returned to their cages.</s><s>Intratracheal instillation was repeated at day 7 and day 14 postinfection.</s><s>The orotracheal application of liposomes is an alternative method of accessing the lung without direct surgical exposure of the trachea; it permits a higher number of CG/NE-liposome applications at days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 17 after M. tuberculosis infection with 100 CFU or CG/NE-liposome application at days 1, 5, 8, and 12 after M. tuberculosis infection with 2000 CFU.</s><s>For this procedure, anesthetized mice were suspended at an â¼45Ëangle by fixing the two front upper teeth to a metal filament that is attached to a plastic support (Trachealintubation; Fo Â¨hr Medical Instruments, Seeheim Germany).</s><s>A small cylinder was placed under the neck to position the larynx, pharynx, and trachea on a straight line.</s><s>A metal, custom-made laryngoscope and small forceps were used to keep the mouth open and to displace the tongue.</s><s>The trachea was visualized by percutaneous transillumination using a 150-W halogen light source with flexible fiberoptic arms (Schott Lighting and Imaging, Mainz, Germany) positioned at the surface of the skin just below the vocal cords.</s><s>In this manner, the vocal cords and the tracheal lumen are clearly visible, and the tracheal lumen appears as a luminous point.</s><s>During this direct visualization, a 26-gauge catheter was intubated into the trachea to a point at which its proximal end was at level with the upper teeth.</s><s>One hundred microliters of the liposomal suspension were instilled into the catheter with a syringe.</s><s>Proper placement of the tube was verified by surveying the oscillation of the liposomal suspension within the catheter that was in synchrony with the movement of the mouse's thorax when the tube was inserted correctly into the trachea.</s><s>After endotracheal administration, mice were placed on heating pads until they fully recovered from the treatment before being returned to their cages.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decreased survival of CG-and CG/NE-deficient mice postinfection with M. tuberculosis</head><p><s>The observation that CG and NE deficiency in mice was associated with a higher susceptibility to infection with the vaccine strain M. bovis BCG (10) raised the question whether absence of these proteases would also have an effect on long-term survival of mice infected with M. tuberculosis, the causative agent of human tuberculosis.</s><s>Until day 128 postinfection with â¼50 CFU M. tuberculosis, wild-type, CG-KO, and CG/NE-KO mice demonstrated a similar survival rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Thereafter, proteasedeficient mice died at a higher rate than wild-type mice did, resulting in a significantly reduced life span of CG-and CG/NEdeficient mice compared with wild-type mice.</s><s>Half of infected CG-KO mice succumbed to infection at day 187, and 50% of infected CG/NE-KO mice died by day 189, whereas 50% of wild-type mice survived until day 281.</s><s>Thus, also during infection with M. tuberculosis, the absence of the neutrophil serine proteases CG and NE is associated with a higher susceptibility.</s></p><p><s>We also investigated the relevance of lysosomal cysteine proteases such as cathepsin K, cathepsin L, cathepsin B, and cathepsin Z during infection with M. tuberculosis.</s><s>With respect to the survival time, no differences between infected wild-type and infected cathepsin-deficient mice were observed (data not shown), indicating a unique role of the neutrophil serine proteases CG and NE during M. tuberculosis infection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neutrophil serine protease deficiency has only limited effects on M. tuberculosis replication</head><p><s>To investigate whether CG-and CG/NE-deficient mice succumbed earlier to infection because of a higher mycobacterial load, mice were challenged with M. tuberculosis H37Rv via aerosol (â¼100 CFU/lung), and bacterial loads were determined in lungs, livers, and spleens.</s></p><p><s>The neutrophil serine proteases NE and CG are major microbicidal effectors of neutrophils <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Neutrophils together with monocytes represent the prime innate immune cells that enter the pulmonary site of infection in the initial phase of experimental pulmonary tuberculosis in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we first analyzed the mycobacterial burden during the acute phase of infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>In all three mouse strains, the pulmonary replication rate of mycobacteria was of similar magnitude at day 10 and day 20 postinfection.</s><s>As replication proceeded in the lungs, the bacteria disseminated into livers and spleens and multiplied further.</s><s>Regarding both organs, there was no significant difference in dissemination or replication between neutrophil serine proteasedeficient and wild-type mice.</s><s>During the chronic stage of infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), all three mouse strains were capable of restricting bacterial growth in the lungs, livers, and spleens.</s><s>At day 30 postinfection the pulmonary CFU level was reduced in neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice when compared with wild-type mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A, 2B</ref>).</s><s>However, at day 139 postinfection, when neutrophil serine protease deficient mice became moribund, a similar bacterial burden was observed in lungs and livers of all three mouse strains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>In the spleens of CG-and CG/NE-deficient mice, the bacterial burden was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type mice.</s><s>We observed no major differences in the lung bacterial pathogen elimination in M. tuberculosis-infected neutrophil serine protease deficient mice in comparison with wild-type mice.</s><s>Moreover, CG/NE-deficient mice showed decreased pulmonary bacterial replication at day 30 postinfection, and CG and CG/NE deficiency resulted in significantly reduced bacterial loads in spleens of moribund mice, excluding impaired pathogen elimination as a cause for reduced survival rates in these mice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minor histopathologic changes in M. tuberculosis-infected neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice</head><p><s>To assess the formation of granulomas after aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis, lung tissue sections from wild-type and CG-KO or CG/NE-KO mice were histologically examined at days 28, 55, and 139 postinfection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>At day 28 postinfection with 200 CFU of M. tuberculosis, no differences in the overall degree of lung granuloma formation were observed among the three mouse strains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>However, whereas 129 S2 mice developed welldemarcated round granulomas the inflammatory foci of neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice were characterized by a stronger perivascular and peribronchiolar lymphocytic cuffing.</s><s>At day 55 postinfection with 200 CFU of M. tuberculosis wild-type, CGand CG/NE-deficient mice showed loosely organized granulomas with perivascular cuffing and foci of lymphocytes interspersed amid epithelioid macrophages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice demonstrated poorly demarcated granulomatous lesions accompanied by alveolar cell wall thickening and interstitial pneumonia.</s><s>At day 139 postinfection with 100 CFU of M. tuberculosis, all three mouse strains showed a pronounced inflammatory cell infiltration that caused a pulmonary consolidation of â¼60% in neutrophil serine protease-deficient and wild-type mice.</s><s>The degree of necrotic areas was also similar in all three genotypes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The relevance of CG and NE for inflammation was also assessed by monitoring the lung-to-body weight and the spleen-to-body weight ratios (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>At the time when neutrophil serine proteasedeficient mice became moribund, the lung-to-body weight ratio was significantly increased in CG-KO mice compared with the wild-type mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>In addition, CG-and CG/NE-deficient mice developed a splenomegaly with a significantly increased spleen-to-body weight ratio (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>However, histologic examination of the spleen did not reveal any morphologic differences between neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice and wild-type mice with respect to the red and white pulp and the germinal centers (data not shown).</s><s>The higher organ weights in CG-and CG/ NE-deficient mice indicate that neutrophil serine proteases influence the inflammatory response during M. tuberculosis infection.</s></p><p><s>Altered proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine profiles in lungs and plasma from M. tuberculosis-infected neutrophil serine protease deficient mice Following activation, neutrophils release their serine proteases to the extracellular environment, where they have an important role in the modulation of the inflammatory response by modifying chemokine activity and activation or inactivation of cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, the proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine protein patterns were examined in lungs and plasma of mice challenged with M. tuberculosis.</s><s>In uninfected mice, the protein levels were negligible (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>Upon M. tuberculosis infection, pulmonary cytokine and chemokine synthesis increased in wild-type and neutrophil serine protease deficient mice.</s><s>At day 28 postinfection with 200 CFU of M. tuberculosis, wild-type mice expressed significantly higher amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1b, and IL-17A than neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice did.</s><s>In addition, the protein levels of MIP-1a and CCL2 were elevated in lungs from wild-type mice when compared with neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice.</s><s>At day 55 postinfection, wildtype and neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice expressed similar levels of these cytokines and chemokines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>In striking contrast, when neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice became moribund, pulmonary protein levels of the proinflammatory mediators TNF and IL-6 were significantly increased in CG-and CG/NE-KO mice relative to the wild-type mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s><s>A similar pattern was seen for IL-1b.</s><s>Furthermore, the amount of chemokines, such as MIP-1a, CCL2, and CXCL1, were significantly higher in lung homogenates of neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice.</s><s>The protein amounts of IL-12/IL-23p40 and IL-17A were similar in wild-type and CG-or CG/NE-deficient mice at this late

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prolonged bleeding time but similar TFPI concentration in neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice</head><p><s>Blood neutrophils not only provide the first line of defense against pathogens; they also have a role in blood coagulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>To investigate whether neutrophil serine proteases modulate coagulation in experimental tuberculosis, we assessed the tail bleeding time of CG-KO, CG/NE-KO, and wild-type mice before infection, during the chronic stage of infection, and at the time point when neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice became moribund (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>).</s><s>In uninfected mice, the mean bleeding time was prolonged â¼2-fold in neutrophil serine protease deficient mice relative to wild-type mice with a mean bleeding time of 104 s for wild-type mice and 245 s and 240 s for CG-KO or CG/NE-KO mice, respectively.</s><s>At day 77 postinfection, again a significantly 2-fold increased bleeding time (mean bleeding time of 102 s for wild-type mice, 167 s for CG-KO mice, and 234 s for CG/NE-KO mice) was observed in neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice.</s><s>In addition, at the time when neutrophil serine protease deficient mice became moribund, the bleeding time of these mice was again â¼2-fold increased (125 s for wild-type mice, 244 s for CG-KO mice, and 208 s for CG/ NE-KO mice).</s><s>This indicates that during the course of tuberculosis infection, the difference in bleeding time between the mouse strains did not change considerably.</s></p><p><s>In vivo the prime trigger to blood coagulation is the tissue factor (TF), which is constitutively expressed by perivascular cells and hidden in the intact vessel.</s><s>In response to vessel wall injury, TF is exposed to the blood, and it can interact with the blood-based factor VIIa to trigger the coagulation cascade.</s><s>TF-induced coagulation is controlled by the TFPI, which blocks the VIIa/TF complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>It was recently demonstrated that neutrophil serine proteases stimulate TF-dependent coagulation by local proteolytic inactivation of the coagulation suppressor TFPI <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we next investigated whether the prolonged bleeding time of neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice was a result of an increased TFPI level.</s><s>At the time when M. tuberculosis-infected neutrophil serine protease deficient mice became moribund, plasma TFPI levels were analyzed with ELISA.</s><s>The concentrations of plasma TFPI did not differ among the wild-type, CG-KO, and CG/NE-KO mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, although the hemostatic system of neutrophil serine protease-deficient mice is impaired in its ability to prevent blood loss, there is no difference in plasma TFPI concentration between the three mouse strains.</s></p><p><s>Treatment of mice with liposome-encapsulated CG/NE does not confer protection during infection with M. tuberculosis Steinwede et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> demonstrated that therapeutically applied human CG/NE encapsulated in liposomes reduced the mycobacterial loads in lungs of mice infected with the vaccine strain, M. bovis BCG.</s><s>In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of these neutrophil serine proteases during infection with M. tuberculosis, the causative agent of human tuberculosis.</s><s>Human CG/NE was encapsulated into liposomes to prevent nonspecific lung tissue injury or inactivation by endogenous serine protease inhibitors.</s><s>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of lysed liposomal preparations confirmed the enzymatic activity of both enzymes (data not shown).</s><s>Wild-type mice were aerogenically infected with a low dose (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A, 7B</ref>) or a high dose (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>) of M. tuberculosis H37Rv.</s><s>After intratracheal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref>) or orotracheal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B, 7C</ref>) administration of CG/NE-loaded liposomes at defined time points The Journal of Immunology postinfection, their therapeutic potential was evaluated on the basis of pulmonary bacterial replication.</s><s>In a first experiment, wild-type mice were challenged with a low dose of M. tuberculosis followed by intratracheal instillation of PBS or CG/NE liposomes at days 1, 7, and 14 postinfection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref>).</s><s>On days 10 and 21 postinfection, the bacterial burden in the lung tissue was similar irrespective of the treatment.</s></p><p><s>It appeared possible that during infection with virulent M. tuberculosis, additional administrations might be necessary to achieve a therapeutic effect with liposomally encapsulated CG/NE.</s><s>Therefore, in the following experiment, therapeutic treatment was performed at days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 17 after low-dose aerosol infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>).</s><s>At days 13 and 21 postinfection, mice treated with PBS or CG/NE liposomes showed similar bacterial burden in the lung tissue.</s></p><p><s>In the experiments reported by Steinwede et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, intratracheal infection of mice with a relatively high dose of 2 3 10 5 CFU of M. bovis BCG followed by instillation of CG/NE-loaded  liposomes resulted in a colocalization of mycobacteria and liposomes within the same compartment of alveolar macrophages.</s><s>To increase the likelihood of such a colocalization in the next experimental setting, mice were aerogenically infected with a high dose of M. tuberculosis followed by orotracheal instillation of liposomes at days 1, 5, 8, and 12 postinfection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>).</s><s>At day 14 postinfection, the pulmonary bacterial burden was similar in mice treated either with PBS-or CG/NE-loaded liposomes.</s><s>Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that repetitive instillation of liposomally encapsulated CG/NE does not contribute to a reduction of M. tuberculosis replication during the early phase of antimycobacterial response, regardless of the number of instillations applied or the dose of infection used.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Cathepsins have been reasoned to contribute to protection against M. tuberculosis infection in various ways.</s><s>Cathepsin K was initially promoted as a marker of macrophage differentiation and was reported to be highly expressed in epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells during mycobacterial infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>It was shown to be a sensitive immunohistochemical criterion for the detection of microgranulomas in hypersensitivity pneumonitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, cathepsin B accumulates in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions induced by M. tuberculosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>Cathepsin L maturation and activity is impaired in macrophages harboring M. tuberculosis, indicating that M. tuberculosis modulates the cathepsin response to its advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</s><s>A cathepsin Z haplotype was implicated as a genetic marker for tuberculosis susceptibility in a Ugandan household contact study <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>; however, in a casecontrol study in Iran, the cathepsin Z rs34069356 polymorphism (29) was not associated with pulmonary tuberculosis.</s><s>Finally, CG was found to be downregulated in M. tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells, and this was associated with increased intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our own comprehensive survival study using mice deficient for CG, K, L, B, or Z, only mice deficient for serine protease CG succumbed to infection more rapidly than wild-type mice did, whereas mice deficient for the cysteine-type cathepsins did not show such an effect.</s><s>This result indicates that there is a specific requirement for CG in long-term survival of mice that are aerogenically infected with M. tuberculosis.</s><s>CG/NE-double-deficient mice died at a similar rate as CG-single-deficient mice did.</s><s>CG may therefore prove to be a useful marker for overall susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection.</s></p><p><s>However, there was no discernible and consistent adverse effect on the bacterial load in infected organs of CG-or CG/NE-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice.</s><s>Early in infection and shortly before death, bacterial loads in the lungs were identical in all three mouse strains examined.</s><s>This is in contrast to BCG infection experiments performed with these mice, in which a slight  (2-3-fold), yet significant growth enhancement in CG/NE-deficient mice was observed, concomitant with enhanced granulomatous inflammation and increased TNF levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>Although M. bovis BCG is often used as a surrogate infection for tuberculosis, BCG is an attenuated vaccine strain that, because of differences in its cell wall make-up or intracellular localization, may be substantially more susceptible to direct enzymatic attack than M. tuberculosis.</s></p><p><s>There was a slight but significant reduction in the bacterial load in the spleens of infected moribund CG-and CG/NE-deficient mice compared with infected wild-type mice.</s><s>In fact, spleens of CG-and CG/NE-deficient mice were enlarged.</s><s>It is possible that the enhanced and dysregulated inflammatory response-as evidenced in this study by increased concentrations of TNF, IL-6, IL-1b, CXCL1, CCL2, and MIP-1a in the lungs and plasma of infected CG-and CG/NE-deficient mice-may have contributed to increased inflammatory cell influx also into the spleens, resulting in slightly enhanced bacteriocidal activity in this organ.</s></p><p><s>Efforts to uncover the cause of premature death of CG-and CG/ NE-deficient mice revealed a modified chemokine and cytokine profile in the absence of these proteases during tuberculosis infection.</s><s>Levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly reduced in lung homogenates of CG-and CG/NE-KO mice early during infection, whereas the proinflammatory response was significantly increased in lung homogenates and plasma of these mice prior to death.</s><s>This dysregulated profile was most notable for TNF, the key mediator in protection against and pathology of tuberculosis with pleiotropic functions.</s><s>Perturbations of TNF levels severely affect the course of infection.</s><s>Whereas low concentrations are associated with fatal disease, excessive TNF promotes immunopathology and induces a hyperinflammatory milieu <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</s><s>TNF exists as a proform bound to the surface membrane.</s><s>Both CG and NE have been described to process membrane-bound TNF into a soluble and biologically active form in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, CG and NE can degrade TNF, resulting in a loss of activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</s><s>The overall in vivo effect of CG and NE is assumed to depend on the concentration of active enzymes in the microenvironment.</s><s>Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that during the early phase of tuberculosis infection, the shedding activity of CG and NE dominates, resulting in a higher concentration of TNF in wild-type mice.</s><s>During the late phase of murine tuberculosis, the degradation activity of both enzymes may prevail, dampening the TNF concentration in wild-type mice.</s><s>Furthermore, CG and NE have been described to degrade and inactivate IL-6 at sites of inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, proteolytic processing of the chemokine MIP-1a by CG and NE abrogates its chemotactic activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s>In line with these observations, the absence of CG or CG/NE resulted in significantly increased pulmonary IL-6 and MIP-1a levels during the late phase of tuberculosis infection.</s><s>Consequently, our results indicate that neutrophil serine proteases may fine-tune the immune response during murine tuberculosis by proteolytic modification of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.</s><s>Importantly, CG or CG/NE deficiency is associated with an unbalanced systemic hyperinflammatory response prior to death.</s><s>Neutralization experiments using anti-cytokine or antichemokine Abs may be a useful tool to determine the role of individual factors or their combination in precipitating premature death of neutrophil serine protease deficient mice.</s><s>Given the redundant and pleiotropic effects of the chemokines and cytokines putatively involved (i.e., TNF, IL-6 CCL2, MIP-1a, CXCL1), the administration of Abs must be carefully timed and orchestrated over a prolonged period; however, this is beyond the scope of this report.</s></p><p><s>Cytokines and chemokines help to control the formation and integrity of granulomas, the hallmark of tuberculosis infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>Although significant differences in chemokine and cytokine levels between wild-type and serine protease-deficient mice were observed, histopathologic examination revealed only minor differences in the pulmonary granulomatous response between CGor CG/NE-deficient mice and the wild-type mice.</s><s>After infection with M. bovis BCG, Steinwede et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> observed a significantly increased granuloma formation in CG-and CG/NE-deficient mice but, even under these circumstances, no major differences were observed in the numbers and percentages of mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes or in the mobilization of conventional lung dendritic cells toward the lung draining lymph nodes between wild-type and neutrophil serine protease deficient mice.</s><s>We therefore did not perform flow cytometric analyses of lung tissue in our own experiments.</s></p><p><s>There was no measurable effect of the absence of CG or both, CG and NE, on TFPI concentration or M. tuberculosis dissemination in infected mice, although CG and neutrophil elastase have previously been demonstrated to regulate coagulation and intravascular thrombus formation and have been discussed as important for reducing dissemination of systemic bacterial infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, by investigating mice expressing either low or high levels of human TF instead of murine TF during experimental tuberculosis, it was recently shown that TF deficiency affects neither mycobacterial growth and dissemination nor the proinflammatory cytokine response to M. tuberculosis infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the ultimate cause of accelerated death in CG-and CG/NE-deficient mice infected with M. tuberculosis is likely unrelated to a direct antibacterial effect of CG/NE and potentially related to an unspecified dysregulated inflammatory response.</s></p><p><s>In vivo, intratracheal instillation or orotracheal administration of liposome-encapsulated CG and NE had no discernible effect on bacterial growth in the organs of M. tuberculosis-infected mice, even when treatment was prolonged for almost 3 wk with twice weekly applications starting as early as day 1 postinfection.</s><s>This is in contrast to previous observations made with an identical protocol of liposome preparation and application in BCG-infected mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>It is possible that M. tuberculosis, in contrast to BCG, is not in a compartment accessible to liposomal CG/NE applied orotracheally.</s><s>This might be because either a different cellular subset or a different intracellular compartment-compared with BCG-serves as the major habitat for M. tuberculosis during the early phase of infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s>It is also possible that the phagolysosomal arrest induced by M. tuberculosis in the infected macrophage is so efficient that no colocalization of phagocytosed CG/NE-loaded liposome with M. tuberculosis in the same compartment occurs.</s><s>On the other hand, the reduction of BCG bacterial load in vivo was reported to be in the order of 2-3-fold, particularly during later times of infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>Because of the methodology for plating lung homogenates used in this study, this level of difference may have escaped detection or significance by statistical analysis.</s></p><p><s>Our data so far do not support the use of exogenous administration of CG and neutrophil elastase for immune-enhancing supportive treatment for M. tuberculosis infection.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1.
