<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Dynamics of Flexibility.</s><s>How do cognitive systems interact as individuals perform a working-memory task?</s><s>To answer this question, we must understand how network modules form and evolve during task execution.</s><s>These processes can be revealed using a network-based clustering technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> applied to fMRI data acquired during task execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>We first extracted functional networks from overlapping time windows of fMRI data (Methods), and linked networks in consecutive time windows to form a multilayer network (e.g., a network of many time layers), providing important statistical benefits for the estimation of network modules <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>.</s><s>Next, we performed a network-based clustering technique referred to as "dynamic community detection" to extract network modules: each network module corresponded to a set of brain areas that are coherently active in a single time window, forming a putative cognitive system.</s><s>In essence, a region was assigned to a module composed of regions to which it was most densely connected, and not assigned to a module composed of regions to which it was sparsely connected.</s><s>The set of fixed assignments of nodes to modules is referred to as a hard partition, and the goodness of this partition is statistically quantified by a modularity quality function <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>.</s><s>Following module extraction, we quantified module evolution throughout the experiment by computing a timedependent network flexibility: the time-dependent flexibility of a region was defined as the probability that a brain region changed its allegiance to putative functional modules between any two consecutive time windows, and the time-dependent flexibility of a person was defined as the average regional flexibility over all brain areas included in the network.</s><s>Intuitively, flexibility can be thought of as a statistic to quantify the amount of reconfiguration in functional connectivity patterns that a brain region displays over time.</s></p><p><s>We observed that the time-dependent network flexibility oscillates across task execution, reaching clear maxima in time windows dominated by either the 2-back or 0-back (baseline) conditions [Fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>; repeated-measures ANOVA with condition as factor: F (2,343) = 20.75,</s><s>P &lt; 0.001].</s><s>This increase in brain-wide flexibility was not modulated by cognitive load: whole-brain flexibility was not significantly different between the 2-back and 0-back conditions [post hoc paired t test:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">t (343) = 1.31, P = 0.19].</formula><p><s>Dynamic Network Reconfiguration.</s><s>Although the changes in flexibility indicate network reconfiguration dynamics, they do not address the cognitive systems engaged.</s><s>To uncover these systems and isolate their reconfiguration properties, we next identified the modules of the multilayer networks by distilling a consensus partition of brain regions into network modules that was most representative of all subjects and all times for each level of cognitive load separately (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 A and B</ref>).</s><s>Several modules were consistently identified in both the 0-back and 2-back conditions: somatomotor, visual, subcortical, and hippocampal modules.</s><s>However, the two conditions differed markedly in frontalmediated modules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>First, the frontoparietal module was composed of more medial structures in the 0-back condition, and more lateral structures in the 2-back condition; in the 2-back condition, this module also prominently included several regions in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that were missing in the control condition.</s><s>Second, in the 2-back condition a module consisting of nodes in the right prefrontal cortex dissociated from the bilateral frontotemporal module detected during the 0-back condition.</s><s>To quantify these results, we compared the consensus partitions for both conditions and each subject separately for frontal and nonfrontal regions using a z score of the Rand coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>, which quantifies the similarity between two partitions.</s><s>A paired t test on the z score for frontal vs. nonfrontal regions showed a significantly higher similarity for nonfrontal regions [t (343) = −10.32,</s><s>P &lt; 0.001], supporting the visually marked differences between frontal and nonfrontal modules.</s></p><p><s>These findings are conceptually consistent with previous results on the structure of working-memory networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref> involving frontotemporal and frontoparietal systems, and indicate that a reconfiguration between conditions is most prominent in frontal and frontal-related systems.</s></p><p><s>We next asked how individual modules differentially reconfigure within both conditions.</s><s>Each identified cognitive system contributed differently to the observed brain-wide flexibility that dominated This pattern was conserved during the 0-back condition [F (7,343) = 11.75,</s><s>P &lt; 0.001; post hoc paired t test between fronto-related and nonfrontal modules: t (343) = 4.98, P &lt; 0.001].</s><s>However, flexibility was more evenly distributed in the 0-back condition between systems as evidenced by a significant main effect of task and significant interaction in a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with task and frontal vs. nonfrontal as categorical factors [main effect of task: F (1,343) = 6.25,</s><s>P &lt; 0.013; effect of interaction: F (1,343) = 16.5, P &lt; 0.001].</s><s>These finding were robust to variations in the connectivity method (correlation instead of coherence), parameter selection in the community detection algorithm, and changes in the window size (SI Results, Robustness of Results).</s></p><p><s>Flexibility can be driven by transient interactions between modules: the more transient module-module interactions, the more likely regions are to flexibly alter their allegiance to cognitive systems.</s><s>We estimated the transience of module-module interaction by averaging all elements of the module allegiance matrix T that link nodes in two different modules; we refer to this quantity as "integration" (24).</s><s>Consistent with our earlier results, we observed higher integration in frontal systems than nonfrontal systems in the 2-back condition, whereas in the 0-back condition we observed similar integration in both frontal and occipital-parietal systems (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that dynamic network reorganization is taking place predominately in frontal systems and is driven by a constant readaptation and interaction of frontal systems with each other.</s></p><p><s>Role of Frontal Systems in Executive Functioning.</s><s>Based on our finding that whole-brain flexibility is driven by reconfiguration of and between fronto-related systems, we explored the relationship between frontal flexibility and cognitive performance.</s><s>We used an α-level of 0.05 for all statistical tests and report both false-discovery rate (FDR) and Bonferroni-corrected P values.</s><s>We interpret results that do not pass Bonferroni correction as exploratory.</s><s>During the 2-back working-memory condition, frontal flexibility was positively correlated with task accuracy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>; Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.12, P FDR-corrected = 0.04, P Bonferroni = 0.2), supporting the conclusion that higher frontal flexibility is cognitively beneficial for working-memory performance.</s></p><p><s>As noted in the previous section, an important driver of flexibility is the strength of module-module integration, which can be used to  quantify transient interactions between cognitive systems and which is conceptually related to posited drivers of prefrontal function in working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>We hypothesized that executive function stems from the structured interaction between large-scale frontal systems.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we next evaluated the relationship between the reconfiguration of frontal systems (measured by integration) and behavior (measured by task performance and neuropsychological test scores), thereby exploring the link between integration during the 2-back task and working-memory performance.</s><s>During the 2-back condition, frontal integration was positively correlated with task accuracy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>; Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.14, P FDR-corrected = 0.024, P Bonferroni = 0.096), suggesting that the ability to easily switch between modules or brain states is essential for working-memory performance.</s></p><p><s>Our results could support (i) frontal integration is required for 2-back working-memory accuracy alone, or (ii) frontal integration is required for working-memory performance more generally.</s><s>To distinguish these scenarios, we tested the relationship between frontal integration and performance on a digit span backward task, which captures temporary information storage and the active manipulation of stored items.</s><s>The digit span backward task engages the frontal lobe more strongly than the digit span forward task <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, which does not require active information manipulation.</s><s>We examined both digit span measures and observed that frontal integration was positively correlated with backward digit span score (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>; r = 0.14, P FDR-corrected = 0.024, P Bonferroni = 0.072) but not the forward digit span score (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.004, P FDR-corrected = 0.95, P Bonferroni = 1.0).</s><s>This indicates that the dynamic reconfiguration of frontal systems for working-memory function may not be limited to the n-back working-memory paradigm but may be essential for the manipulation of stored information across tasks.</s></p><p><s>The relationship between frontal integration and an external measure of working-memory function that challenges active information manipulation suggests the possibility that reconfiguration of frontal systems could form a critical mechanism for executive function more generally, specifically in its utilization of cognitive flexibility.</s><s>We directly tested the relationship between frontal integration and cognitive flexibility using behavioral scores on the trail-making test B (TMT-B), which measures executive flexibility by capturing the subject's cognitive ability to switch between task demands.</s><s>A large score on the TMT-B task (as measured by the time to complete the task) indicates poor task switching ability, and a small score indicates good task switching ability.</s><s>We observed that frontal integration was negatively correlated with TMT-B performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>; Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = −0.18,</s><s>P FDR-corrected = 0.016, P Bonferroni = 0.016), suggesting that the ability of the frontal cortex to switch between network modules (as a measure of switching between functional states) is a more general feature of cognitive functioning rather than being specific to working-memory function.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our results suggest that working memory requires the active and dynamic reconfiguration of large-scale brain systems driven by frontal networks.</s><s>Interactions between these frontal systems might underlie executive function more generally.</s></p></div>

disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we have provided evidence that the functional connectivity during a working-memory task is dynamically organized into adapting modules and that this adapting modular structure relates to cognitive demands.</s><s>We quantified the amount of this adaption using a previously undefined time-dependent network flexibility measure, an intuitive statistic summarizing reconfiguration within and between brain systems.</s><s>We provide evidence that the amount of reorganization in the modular structure and specifically the amount of interaction between modules is behaviorally relevant to working-memory performance and cognitive flexibility.</s><s>Our results provide support for the emerging paradigm of cognitive functions as a dynamic orchestration of distributed cognitive networks.</s></p><p><s>Task-Based Dynamics of Flexibility.</s><s>Network flexibility has previously been linked to behaviorally advantageous changes in brain network dynamics in response to cognitive demands by predicting individual differences in learning (3) and by offering a network mechanism of cognitive control over many tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</s><s>In the current study, we demonstrate that brain network flexibility and its relationship to cognitive demand can be tracked continuously on the order of minutes and undergoes specific and repetitive changes even within a given task.</s><s>Although prior studies have focused exclusively on task-related (vs.</s><s>task-unrelated) aspects of connectivity using methods such as psychophysiological interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, our work focuses on the temporal dynamics of the networks underlying working-memory performance.</s><s>Using a previously undefined measure of time-dependent network flexibility, we show that the brain reconfigures in an oscillatory manner as participants switch between different task conditions, suggesting that reconfiguration of brain networks tracks brain state transitions, even when both brain states (task conditions) display equivalent flexibility.</s></p><p><s>Despite the conservation of whole-brain flexibility across working-memory load, we did observe a redistribution of flexibility across cognitive systems.</s><s>Flexibility is greater in frontal systems in the 2-back condition as opposed to the 0-back condition, consistent with other recent studies using different tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>, adding evidence for a domain-general role of these systems.</s><s>Moreover, this increase in reconfiguration is accompanied by a reorganization of network modules: frontal-related modules show a different organization between tasks, most noticeably a strong medial module during 0-back, and a dissociation of prefrontal nodes from a frontotemporal network during 2-back.</s><s>The latter dissociation is reminiscent of the altered functional coupling of prefrontal areas commonly observed in n-back studies, which has been shown to be altered in disease states <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>, and which has been argued to be under some genetic control <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Flexibility atop a Conserved Modular Backbone.</s><s>The flexibility of network configurations during the n-back task occur on top of a highly conserved modular backbone.</s><s>We observe that functional connectivity patterns display strong community structure, as evidenced by the block-diagonal structure of the module allegiance matrices represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>.</s><s>The segregation of network modules observed in this data is much more pronounced than that observed in resting-state functional connectivity matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>.</s><s>The identified network modules map well to biologically meaningful systems of intrinsic connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> and specifically systems commonly engaged during working-memory performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref> (see Supporting Information for a quantitative comparison with refs.</s><s>36 and 39).</s><s>Moreover, this modular structure is relatively conserved across task states: in fact, nonfrontal modules including visual and somatomotor modules are identical in node composition in 0-back and 2-back conditions.</s><s>These highly stable modules also display relatively low flexibility across both n-back task conditions (Supporting Information), suggesting that they form a stable task-based core that supports higher order cognitive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, the combination of flexible reconfiguration and a conserved modular backbone is consistent with the taskbased core-periphery structure of the human connectome <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>, which has been posited to enable both the stability necessary for successful task performance and the flexibility necessary for behavioral adaptation.</s></p><p><s>Integration Between Cognitive Modules.</s><s>The simultaneous existence of flexible reconfiguration and a conserved modular structure is made possible by time-dependent integration between cognitive modules.</s><s>As modules become more integrated, regions can change their allegiance to modules more quickly, potentially forming bridges of communication.</s><s>Critically, we observe that network modules differ in their degree of integration with other network modules: stable core-like modules including visual and somatomotor systems show relatively weak integration with other modules, whereas frontal and frontal-mediated modules show relatively strong integration with other modules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>This finding is consistent with prior work from Fornito et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, showing that the frontal network displays extensive cooperation during task execution, and further complements a recent study from Cole et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> demonstrating that the frontoparietal network displays a high variance in connectivity over different tasks (Supporting Information).</s></p><p><s>The large variation in integration across these modules suggests that cognitive systems play different roles in executive function predicated on the degree of interconnectivity with other systems.</s><s>It is intuitively plausible that the strong integration of frontal systems with other network modules forms a physiological basis for cognitive flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>, enabling task switching and cognitive control during demanding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Behavioral Relevance of Flexibility and Integration.</s><s>Using FDR correction methods for multiple-comparisons testing, we observed that frontal flexibility and integration were correlated with working-memory accuracy during the 2-back condition.</s><s>As exploratory findings, some of which did not pass Bonferroni correction, these dynamic network correlates of behavior complement and extend prior observations from static network analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s><s>The specificity of these correlations to the frontal systems suggests that network reconfiguration may form a putative neurophysiological mechanism of cognitive flexibility and executive function more generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, this hypothesis is supported by the fact that frontal integration was associated with both the backward digit span scores (measuring active information manipulation) and TMT-B scores (measuring executive flexibility), further highlighting the critical importance of intersystem connectivity in the successful execution of more cognitively demanding tasks.</s></p><p><s>Methodological Limitations.</s><s>Our findings are subject to several methodological considerations.</s><s>First, we use a dynamic community detection algorithm to cluster brain regions into coherently activated communities.</s><s>However, due to heuristics in the algorithm and challenges inherent to fMRI data, the assignment of nodes to communities on the individual subject level remains a statistical process, accompanied by some degree of uncertainty.</s><s>Second, although we aim at a description of dynamic reconfiguration, we remain limited by the temporal resolution of fMRI data, making it likely that the modular changes and behavioral associations we observed might be further resolved in time if electrophysiological data were used.</s><s>Third, we use a measure of functional connectivity that does not reflect causal interaction.</s><s>Future studies might benefit from using model-based methods for effective connectivity such as dynamic causal modeling or structural equation modeling to estimate causal interactions between a smaller subsets of brain regions.</s><s>Fourth, we study a hard partition of nodes into communities, which has the advantage of providing a parsimonious estimate of the module allegiance matrix that is robust to noisy measurements of functional connectivity between brain regions.</s><s>Should soft partitioning methods be extended to temporal networks, they might provide complementary insights into the nature of changing community assignments.</s><s>Fifth, although the n-back task is a well-studied manipulation of working-memory capacity, the structure of the task makes it difficult to distinguish the cognitive subprocesses of working-memory maintenance and information manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the behavioral correlations we observed are small and some fail to reach statistical significance under Bonferroni correction, and therefore should be interpreted with caution and validated in future studies.</s><s>However, these relationships do explain additional variance in comparison with more traditional approaches, highlighting the importance of small contributions to the highly complex phenotype of brain network dynamics.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Here we characterize the dynamic nature of neural processes during working-memory performance, which stems from the reconfiguration of large-scale distributed neural circuits rather than from the activity of isolated brain areas.</s><s>Starting from a data-driven approach to cluster brain regions into communities, we track changes in network reconfiguration to frontal-related systems and show that the adaptive nature of the frontal cortex is relevant for cognitive functioning.</s><s>Our study demonstrates the power of dynamic network neuroscience approaches to the study of cognition and behavior in humans.</s><s>A better characterization of how dynamic reconfiguration of networks relates to cognition should also advance our understanding of disorders in which prominent cognitive disturbance arises from developmental (e.g., autism or schizophrenia) or degenerative pathologies (e.g., dementia).</s></p></div>

(49)</ref>, we used the Morlet wavelet transform to estimate the functional connectivity between each pair of brain regions in the frequency interval 0.08-0.15</s><s>Hz, as described previously (3).</s><s>For each subject, this procedure yielded 114 weighted adjacency matrices describing the functional connectivity in each time window.</s></p><p><s>Identifying Putative Functional Modules.</s><s>For each subject, the resulting matrices were partitioned into time-respecting modules using a multilayer community detection algorithm introduced in the study by <ref type="bibr">Mucha et al. (6)</ref> and first applied to neuroimaging data in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>. Due to heuristics in the algorithm and near degeneracy of the modularity landscape, individual runs of the algorithms could produce slightly different partitions of nodes into modules.</s><s>As a common approach to dealing with this degeneracy, we repeated the modularity estimation 100 times for each subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>For each repetition, we calculated the flexibility change matrix F, whose binary elements F i,j indicate if node i changes its module between two consecutive time windows.</s><s>Averaging over all repetitions, we obtain the flexibility matrix for each subject, whose elements indicate the probability that a brain region changes its allegiance to putative functional modules between any two consecutive time windows.</s></p><p><s>Consensus Partitions and Integration.</s><s>To find a consensus partition that is most representative of the underlying community structure, we applied a consensus algorithm as described in detail in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref>.</s><s>In short, to find a consensus partition S that is most representative of a number n of given partitions C 1 , C 2 , . .</s><s>., C n , we computed for each partition C 1 , C 2 , . .</s><s>., C n its modular allegiance matrix T whose binary elements T ij indicate if two nodes i and j have been assigned to the same module or not.</s><s>Summing up all modular allegiance matrices, we obtained the consensus matrix T cons , the elements of which indicate how often two nodes have been assignment to the same module.</s><s>To account for noise, only elements whose assignments were higher than in an appropriate random null model were taken into account.</s><s>By running a community detection algorithm on the consensus matrix T cons , we obtained a consensus partition S that is most representative of the underlying structure in the initial partitions.</s></p><p><s>Further details on the methods and materials can be found in Supporting Information.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Network reconfiguration during executive function.</s><s>(A) We use a numerical n-back task consisting of 0-back and 2-back conditions.</s><s>(B) We define 270 cortical and subcortical regions of interest<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, and (C) extract the mean time course from each region.</s><s>(D) A sliding window comprising 15 volumes with no gap was applied to regional mean time courses, and for each window we estimated the functional connectivity between pairs of regions using coherence.</s><s>This procedure resulted in a sequence of 114 timeordered adjacency matrices.</s><s>(E) Using a dynamic community detection algorithm (part 1 in panel), we identified network modules in each time window and tracked their evolution over time.</s><s>(F) By estimating the probability that a brain region changes its allegiance to modules between any two consecutive time windows (part 2 in panel), we observed that wholebrain flexibility oscillated between unitask (2-back or 0-back only) and dualtask (2-back and 0-back in same time window) conditions.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,40.14,52.78,241.53,292.76" type="bitmap" /></figure>
