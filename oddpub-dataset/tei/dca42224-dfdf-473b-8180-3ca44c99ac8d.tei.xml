(2014)</ref> found that bilinguals scored significantly below monolingual children on standardized measures, with bilinguals exposed to SL later lagging behind their peers who were exposed to SL earlier.</s><s>However, when tested in both languages, the difference in cumulative expressive vocabulary size was no longer significant.</s></p><p><s>Yet another, less investigated factor is metalinguistic awareness, which might be mediated by language dominance.</s><s>Metalinguistic awareness builds on earlier linguistic knowledge, which might vary by language dominance, across the two languages of a bilingual child.</s><s>It is the aim of this paper to assess bilingual dominance and metalinguistic awareness as possible factors that may explain the contradictory results in the literature.</s><s>The difference between bilinguals and monolinguals in vocabulary size and the gap between expressive and receptive vocabulary further highlight the importance of testing different dominance groups in order to understand the contribution of the relative proficiency in each language in each modality, expressive or receptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Spaulding et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language Dominance Among Bilinguals</head><p><s>The term "language dominance" is used in the literature either for describing the relative proficiency of a bilingual person in the two languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gathercole and Thomas, 2009)</ref>, or for the language the bilingual speaker has been mostly exposed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Grosjean, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>One of the dilemmas which both researchers and language therapists face is how to define dominance <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Yip and Matthews, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>A most common way is to examine a sample of the child's productions using one or more performance-based measures and to establish in this way the child's relative proficiency in his or her two languages.</s><s>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Unsworth (2015)</ref>, this is the way language dominance is defined in the current study.</s><s>Later age of onset of bilingualism is frequently associated with relative proficiency and more advanced HL outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hammer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Meir et al., 2016</ref>).</s><s>Yet, age of onset of bilingualism is not necessarily an indicator of dominance, as simultaneous and sequential bilinguals may be found in both the HL-dominant and the SL-dominant groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Foroodi Nejad and Paradis, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the bilingual children in the present study will not be divided into simultaneous and sequential bilinguals, but rather into two dominance groups by their relatively more proficient language.</s></p><p><s>Language proficiency of bilinguals is often associated with the extent to which vocabulary size in one or both languages meets the norms set for age matched monolinguals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bialystok et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>However, bilingual children's performance may be more varied than monolingual performance as a result of the diversity in their language learning experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Armon-Lotem et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>This variation in bilinguals' performance, often captured in terms of language dominance, might differ as a function of the language skill assessed, resulting in asymmetric linguistic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Montrul, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>While awareness of the formal structure of language has already been studied among bilinguals <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Reder et al., 2013)</ref>, relatively little is known about the association between metalinguistic awareness and vocabulary size in the context of bilingual dominance.</s><s>It is the aim of this paper to shed light on the relationship between receptive and expressive vocabulary of nouns and verbs in both languages and metalinguistic awareness (morphological and lexical) in the SL among bilinguals, who are dominant in one of their languages.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metalinguistic Awareness</head><p><s>Metalinguistic awareness is defined as the ability to distance oneself from the content of speech in order to reflect upon and manipulate the structure of language <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ramirez et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Metalinguistic awareness requires the speaker to focus on the structure and form of the language and develops in later stages of language acquisition around the age of 5-6, building on earlier linguistic knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Duncan et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Metalinguistic awareness is a set of multiple skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bialystok et al., 2014)</ref> that are related to the formal aspects of language: phonological, morphological, syntactic and lexical awareness.</s></p><p><s>Some studies found a statistically significant difference between monolingual and bilingual children on metalinguistic awareness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bialystok et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Goldstein et al., 2005)</ref>, pointing out that different skills and tasks might yield different results.</s><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Reder et al. (2013)</ref> compared 52 French monolingual and 43 French-German bilingual children in first grade, on different metalinguistic skills.</s><s>While bilingual children outperformed their monolingual peers in morphological compounds and syntactic awareness tasks, no differences were found in morphological affixes and phonological awareness tasks.</s><s>They argued that due to the phonological similarities between the two languages (French and German), the bilingual children were not required to observe and compare the different linguistic aspects of each language <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(McBride-Chang et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Yet, other studies have shown that bilingual speakers outperform monolingual speakers in metalinguistic awareness tasks (for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bialystok, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>In particular, in a meta-analysis of 63 studies consisting of 6,022 participants, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adesope et al. (2010)</ref> examined the cognitive correlates of bilingualism and found that bilingualism is related to enhanced metalinguistic awareness.</s><s>The bilingual enhancement observed in the meta-analysis shows the importance of going beyond single studies, which in themselves do not show this effect.</s><s>However, none of these studies examined the impact of dominance among bilinguals on metalinguistic awareness tasks as the present study intends to do with Russian, the HL, and Hebrew, the SL.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metalinguistic Abilities and Vocabulary Size</head><p><s>Vocabulary size is a major factor in language acquisition and as such, it is closely related to metalinguistic skills.</s><s>On the one hand, vocabulary size is enhanced by metalinguistic abilities and on the other hand, metalinguistic abilities often benefit from a richer vocabulary.</s><s>Yet, research investigating the metalinguistic abilities in bilinguals focus primarily on phonological awareness and its contribution to reading skills (see example: <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Carlisle et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ibrahim et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Some studies have indeed investigated phonological awareness and vocabulary in bilinguals showing a relationship between phonological awareness and vocabulary <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Farnia and Geva, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Children with poorer phonological awareness learned novel and non-novel words less accurately or more slowly <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hu and Schuele, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hu, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Longitudinally, phonological awareness plays a role when words are relearnt <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hu, 2003)</ref> and phonological processing of novel words is based on sublexical representations, which are phonological and unstructured <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Marecka et al., 2018)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In comparison, there are hardly any similar studies for morphological and lexical awareness and their association to vocabulary size <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bowey, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Reder et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Morphological awareness relates to the ability to manipulate and reflect on morphological units within words <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cheung et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>It includes the explicit knowledge of the way in which words are built up by combining smaller meaningful units, such as roots, prefixes and suffixes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Guo et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Studies have shown that morphological awareness can facilitate word recognition, learning of new words and reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kraut, 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The importance of morphological awareness for vocabulary learning is well documented in monolingual children <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Nagy et al. (2003)</ref> found a strong tie between vocabulary knowledge and morphological awareness, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">McBride-Chang et al. (2005)</ref> showed that morphological structure awareness and morpheme identification predicted 10% of the variance in vocabulary size.</s><s>These results underline the importance of examining the impact of different metalinguistic abilities on vocabulary separately in order to understand the variability in vocabulary size <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kuo and Anderson, 2006</ref>).</s><s>Yet, to the best of our knowledge, very little is known about these connections in bilingual contexts in which children acquire vocabulary in two languages and the process might be at a different stage in each language.</s></p><p><s>Another form of metalinguistic awareness is lexical awareness, which includes conscious consideration of and the ability to manipulate different aspects of lexical competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Nation, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aşik et al. (2015)</ref>, lexical competence includes vocabulary size, depth and lexical organization.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nation (2008)</ref> argues that lexical awareness can help language learners increase their understanding of the different ways in which vocabulary is used, thus leading, for example, to growth in vocabulary size.</s></p><p><s>An easy way to measure lexical awareness is fast mapping.</s><s>Fast mapping refers to the ability of a child to identify the meaning of a novel word after a limited number of exposures <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Carey and Bartlett, 1978)</ref>.</s><s>It has been observed that growth in vocabulary size is related to fast mapping skills both in the initial stages of word learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Behrend et al., 2001)</ref> and for later acquisition by older children <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Braisby et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Significant correlations were found between fast mapping performance and vocabulary size scores in early vocabulary acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kan and Kohnert, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gray, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kan et al., 2014)</ref>, and for older children (ages 4;6-7) with expressive vocabulary scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Braisby et al., 2001)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Within the developmental lexical principles framework (DLPF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Golinkoff et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mervis and Bertrand, 1994)</ref>, fast mapping involves six principles that govern vocabulary acquisition and apply to all languages.</s><s>The first three include the understanding that words (a) have a reference in the world, (b) can extend to similar referents, and (c) refer to whole objects rather than their parts.</s><s>These three principles are operative at the onset of lexical acquisition and help in acquiring early vocabulary.</s><s>The principles which are more related to fast mapping are operative beyond early childhood, in older children and adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Golinkoff et al., 1992)</ref>, and are utilized in consciously monitoring the learning of novel words <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ramachandra et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>These three principles require the: (d) awareness of basic categories for generalization, (e) awareness of constraints on mapping novel names to nameless objects to meet mutual exclusivity, and (f) consideration of the use of conventional names for referents.</s><s>Fast mapping is an appropriate measure of lexical awareness because the growth in vocabulary size benefits from the latter three principles that operate together.</s><s>Previous studies have shown the relationship between lexical awareness (measured with this task) and vocabulary size in monolinguals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Behrend et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Braisby et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Bilinguals also need to apply such constraints when they map novel names to nameless objects.</s><s>Yet bilinguals also need to learn two labels for the same object, one in each language.</s><s>In order to abide by the above principles, they should be aware of the differences between the two vocabularies and of translation equivalents.</s><s>Currently, little is known about the possible interaction between fast mapping and vocabulary size in the case of bilingual children.</s><s>Of the very few studies of fast mapping and vocabulary size among bilingual children, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kan and Kohnert (2008)</ref> do not find such an interaction.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kan and Kohnert (2008)</ref> tested lexical awareness (via fast mapping) and vocabulary size in both the HL (Hmong) and the SL (English) of sequential bilingual children with typical language development (TLD), aged 3-5.</s><s>In contrast to previous findings with monolingual children, the researchers found that the bilingual children's fast mapping performance was not related to age or existing vocabulary size in either language.</s><s>On the other hand, there were significant correlations between vocabulary size and fast mapping across the two languages.</s><s>For example, fast mapping in English (SL) was negatively correlated with vocabulary size in Hmong (HL), with lower fast mapping abilities in English for children who had larger vocabulary size in Hmong.</s></p><p><s>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kan and Kohnert (2008)</ref>, this cross-linguistic relation suggests that fast mapping in the SL of bilingual children is not a direct measure of vocabulary size in that language, in contrast to what has been observed in monolingual children.</s><s>There is, however, a cross-linguistic relationship between fast mapping and vocabulary size in sequential bilingualsvocabulary size has a negative impact on fast mapping skills in the other language.</s><s>While the authors made no direct reference to dominance, they suggested that a difference in vocabulary size in either of the languages can perhaps reflect a different stage of language development of sequential bilinguals when compared to monolinguals.</s><s>Since dominance might be important, but was not considered in this study, we want to replicate the design with participants who are grouped by dominance.</s></p><p><s>To conclude, although researchers have examined the individual contributions of different metalinguistic abilities to the bilingual lexicon, very few have examined morphological and lexical metalinguistic awareness simultaneously, and even less so with regard to vocabulary size in both languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(McBride-Chang et al., 2005)</ref> among bilinguals differing in language dominance.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Receptive and Expressive Vocabulary</head><p><s>The results of the LITMUS CLT vocabulary task are in line with previous findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bialystok et al., 2010)</ref>, with dominant HL bilinguals lagging behind their age-matched dominant SL and monolingual peers on all four vocabulary measures in SL (Hebrew), but outperforming their SL-dominant peers on all four vocabulary measures in HL (Russian).</s><s>The lack of differences between monolinguals and SL-dominant bilinguals in vocabulary size is not surprising, considering the relative exposure to SL of the SL-dominant group (M = 54 months), most of whom are simultaneous bilinguals.</s><s>The regression analysis further showed that dominance measured by relative proficiency was the best predictor of receptive vocabulary among bilingual children confirming the first hypothesis.</s><s>Moreover, all children in this study had more difficulty with the expressive tasks than with the receptive tasks, as is consistent with previous literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gibson et al., 2012)</ref>, with a bigger gap between receptive and expressive vocabulary size in SL-Hebrew for the bilingual groups (especially amongst HL-dominant) as opposed to the monolingual group.</s><s>The expected receptive-expressive gap reflects the difference between the two processes.</s><s>Receptive vocabulary that taps into lexical knowledge is less sensitive to language dominance than expressive vocabulary, that taps on lexical knowledge and its retrieval.</s><s>This reflects the impact of dominance on more demanding processes (expression).</s><s>The gap is consistently smaller in the dominant language (Russian in the HL-dominant bilinguals and SL-Hebrew in the SL-dominant bilinguals) than in the weaker language.</s><s>Moreover, SL-dominant bilinguals perform like monolinguals.</s><s>The sensitivity of lexical access to dominance suggests that the competition between the two linguistic representations of each concept is influenced by the relative proficiency in each language.</s><s>While the receptive vocabulary is similar, the smaller gap in the dominant language suggests that linguistic representation in this language is more readily available in lexical access.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metalinguistic-Awareness Abilities</head><p><s>Children demonstrate metalinguistic awareness in later stages of language development, around the age of 5-6, after gradually mastering the structure of the language, accumulating vocabulary, and developing efficient access to words and concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Duncan et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The present study shows no differences between the three groups of 6-year-olds in terms of metalinguistic awareness, except for one instance where monolinguals did significantly better than HL-dominant bilinguals on a morphological awareness task.</s><s>Russian and Hebrew have very distinct morphological features, especially in word formation.</s><s>Russian word formation highly relies on concatenative morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Shevelov, 1957)</ref>, while Hebrew word formation mostly uses non-concatenative morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Berman and Bolozky, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Aronoff, 1994)</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies suggested that morphological awareness requires high proficiency in a given language <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bialystok and Barac, 2012)</ref>; thus, morphological awareness in SL-Hebrew requires high proficiency in SL-Hebrew.</s><s>The finding that monolinguals outperformed the HL-dominant bilinguals on the morphological awareness task is in line with this assumption.</s></p><p><s>As the morphological task in this study depended on knowledge of SL-Hebrew derivational morphology, and knowledge of Hebrew derivational morphology requires, in turn, extensive knowledge of vocabulary, the limited Hebrew vocabulary size of HL-dominant children can be responsible for the gap in morphological metalinguistic awareness.</s><s>A possible support for this explanation comes from the performance of the SL-dominant bilinguals.</s><s>The SL-dominant bilinguals often patterned with the monolinguals showing a significant difference from HL-dominant bilinguals.</s><s>By contrast, for morphological awareness, they showed no significant differences from monolinguals as well as HL-dominant bilinguals, performing in between the two groups.</s></p><p><s>An explanation of the relatively limited morphological awareness abilities of HL-bilinguals could be their relatively low length of exposure to the SL, a variable that has great impact on language proficiency for bilingual children (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chondrogianni and Marinis, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>It is possible that HL-dominant bilinguals, who are often sequential bilinguals, did not have sufficient exposure (12-34 months) to their SL (Hebrew) in order to develop high morphological awareness in this language.</s><s>Yet, the absence of a significant difference from the SL-dominant group that has longer exposure undermines this explanation.</s><s>A definite conclusion on this is hampered by the small sample of children in the SL-dominant bilingual group (N = 15) and the considerable variance in the length of exposure of the group (M = 54, SD = 28.66),</s><s>which might have resulted in the lack of statistical differences between SL-dominant bilinguals and the other two groups.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the lack of difference between the groups in lexical awareness might have to do with the task selected for the present study.</s><s>Lexical awareness was assessed through a fast mapping task.</s><s>Fast mapping requires children of the age tested to consult their vocabulary when encountering a new word in order to meet the requirement of assigning a novel label to a novel object on the one hand and abide by conventionality on the other.</s><s>Fast mapping resembles the situation often encountered in language learning by monolinguals (mapping a novel word form to a novel object).</s><s>In bilingual language learning, the novel word in the SL is mapped onto a known object with a known label in the HL and does not follow mutual exclusivity.</s><s>The lack of difference between the groups suggests that bilingual experience does not impact fast mapping as a measure of lexical metalinguistic awareness.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relation Between Vocabulary Size and Metalinguistic Awareness</head><p><s>Better metalinguistic skills are expected to positively impact the acquisition of the SL.</s><s>Hierarchical regression analyses tested the impact of dominance, measured by relative proficiency, lexical metalinguistic awareness, morphological metalinguistic awareness and the interaction of the two with dominance on the size of receptive and expressive vocabulary in both the HL and the SL.</s><s>These analyses showed that beyond the significant impact of dominance, lexical metalinguistic awareness, but not morphological awareness, influenced vocabulary size.</s><s>Despite the gap between receptive and expressive vocabulary, the impact of metalinguistic awareness was similar in the two modalities.</s><s>The contribution of lexical metalinguistic awareness to vocabulary size among bilingual children suggests that bilinguals, like monolinguals, rely on fast mapping in expanding their vocabulary size.</s><s>More specifically, the principles that are operative beyond early childhood for consciously monitoring the learning of novel words <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ramachandra et al., 2010)</ref> were found to be related to expanding the lexicon in the SL.</s><s>The awareness of constraints on mapping novel names to nameless objects to meet mutual exclusivity, seems to help in mapping novel words in the SL to objects, even if they already have a name in the HL.</s><s>Likewise, the consideration of the use of conventional names for referents, seems to not block the process of mapping a novel name in one language to familiar objects that already have a conventional name in the other.</s><s>This suggests that the utilization of the principles of fast mapping is sensitive to the language that is acquired.</s><s>Having a label for an object in one language does not interfere with acquiring a new label in the other.</s></p><p><s>Our findings even suggest that experience with fast mapping, which is language neutral, helps in increasing the size of the lexicon.</s><s>Morphological awareness, by contrast, was found to make little contribution, especially when the interaction between dominance and metalinguistic awareness was considered in the equation.</s><s>These findings suggest that the language specific nature of morphological awareness tasks makes it impossible to rely on experience in one language in learning new words in the other.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, the significant contribution of lexical metalinguistic awareness to vocabulary size was limited to the SL-Hebrew, and was not observed in the HL-Russian.</s><s>Experience with mapping, which is language neutral, seems to be transferred from the HL to the SL and helps in increasing the vocabulary size in the SL only.</s><s>This asymmetry reflects the different phase each group is in for vocabulary acquisition in the two languages.</s><s>A large number of the bilinguals in this study had a smaller vocabulary size in SL-Hebrew compared to HL-Russian.</s><s>This suggests that they need to learn new vocabulary items at a more rapid speed in SL-Hebrew than in the HL-Russian.</s><s>In such a case, better fast mapping skills can become useful.</s><s>This latter proposal is supported by the findings of the linear regression that lexical awareness was found to influence SL vocabulary size only in the HL-dominant group.</s><s>While higher relative proficiency and greater lexical metalinguistic awareness was related to greater receptive and expressive vocabulary in SL-Hebrew, there was also an interaction between proficiency and lexical awareness.</s><s>This interaction showed that the relationship between lexical awareness and vocabulary size was stronger for participants with lower proficiency.</s><s>This supports the assumption that better lexical awareness, and in particular better fast mapping skills, predicts growth in vocabulary size, in different ways for different relative proficiency levels.</s><s>In particular, this confirmed our second hypothesis that fast mapping which is important to lexical growth will show a stronger relation to vocabulary size at earlier stages in acquisition, that is, in the less dominant language.</s></p><p><s>These results were further confirmed by the linear regression conducted when focusing on each dominance group separately.</s><s>For the different dominance groups, the regression analyses revealed that children rely on this metalinguistic ability if the SL is their less dominant language.</s><s>The task used for lexical awareness predicts success in acquiring a larger vocabulary among the least proficient group, strengthening the above explanation, and showing the importance of introducing relative proficiency into the equation.</s><s>The relationship between Hebrew vocabulary size and lexical awareness ability was found only among HL-dominant bilinguals, but not for the other groups.</s><s>The absence of such a relationship among the SL-dominant bilinguals is reminiscent of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kan and Kohnert's (2008)</ref> findings.</s><s>There, they tested the relationship between lexical awareness (via fast mapping) and vocabulary size in both the HL and the SL (English) of sequential bilingual children with TLD, aged 3-5 and found that there were no significant correlations between vocabulary size and fast mapping across the two languages.</s><s>Our SL-dominant bilingual children seem to be at the same stage of vocabulary acquisition as the children in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kan and Kohnert's (2008)</ref> study were.</s><s>As the HL-dominant bilinguals are at the earlier stage of vocabulary acquisition, they still rely on these abilities, while the SL-dominant bilinguals and monolingual children are beyond this phase and therefore present a different profile.</s><s>In sum, our findings suggest that metalinguistic awareness might have a different effect on vocabulary size at different levels of acquisition, which is consistent with the previous literature that shows different cognitive mechanisms operating at different stages of language acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gathercole et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hu, 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our findings for morphological metalinguistic awareness can also shed light on the question of whether metalinguistic awareness depends on the stage of language acquisition of SL that each group is at.</s><s>Metalinguistic awareness might be limited by restricted formal linguistic knowledge in a particular language <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bialystok et al., 2014)</ref> and the stage in which each group is at in their language acquisition of SL.</s><s>There are reasons to assume that the outcomes of this study, and in particular the negative relation observed among HL-dominant children between morphological awareness and their HL-vocabulary size, are related to their limited exposure to Hebrew morphology used in the relevant metalinguistic tasks.</s><s>A task that will add measures of metalinguistic abilities in the HL will enable more definite conclusions.</s></p><p><s>To conclude, this study highlights the importance of considering dominance when studying language abilities and metalinguistic awareness among bilinguals.</s><s>This is important in order to provide a more accurate account of the impact of bilingualism and better our understanding of the contribution of the relative proficiency in each language in each modality (expressive and receptive) and of metalinguistic awareness to vocabulary growth among bilinguals.</s><s>A strong similarity was found between SL-dominant and monolingual children in SL vocabulary size while HL-dominant bilinguals lagged behind.</s><s>By contrast, HL-dominant bilinguals outperformed SL-dominant bilingual on HL vocabulary size.</s><s>The novelty of this study lies in the finding that the relation between metalinguistic awareness and vocabulary size were different in the two dominance groups.</s><s>The HL-dominant group presented an earlier phase in the acquisition of the SL, in which vocabulary size in the SL is sensitive to lexical awareness, while vocabulary size in the HL hinders the development of morphological awareness in the SL.</s><s>HL-dominant bilinguals relied on lexical metalinguistic awareness, measured by fast mapping abilities in expanding their vocabulary size, whereas SL-dominant, like monolinguals, did not.</s><s>This shows that lexical awareness is important for word learning at more initial stages of vocabulary acquisition.</s><s>While many studies show the relevance of length and amount of exposure to vocabulary size, the present study shows that metalinguistic awareness should also be taken into consideration, and might make different contributions in different dominance groups.</s></p></div>
