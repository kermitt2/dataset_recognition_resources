<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>There is a well-established link between maternal depression and child mental health.</s><s>Similar effects have been found for maternal history of early life maltreatment (ELM).</s><s>However, studies investigating the relationship of children's quality of life and maternal depression are scarce and none have been conducted for the association with maternal ELM.</s><s>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of maternal history of ELM and depression on children's health-related quality of life and to identify mediating factors accounting for these effects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>Our study involved 194 mothers with and without a history of depression and/or ELM and their children between five and 12 years.</s><s>Children's quality of life was assessed as maternal proxy-and child self-ratings using the KIDSCREEN.</s><s>We considered maternal sensitivity and maternal parenting stress as potential mediators.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acute symptoms of depression may affect response patterns in psychometric</head><p><s>instruments and lead to over-reporting of child behavior problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fergusson et al., 1993)</ref>.</s><s>In our study, we examined mothers with depression in remission only in order to prevent this often-neglected problem and to address the question whether maternal depression impacts on child HRQoL even after full remission.</s><s>There are two reasons why children of mothers with fully remitted depression would still exhibit lower HRQoL: (1) even though maternal symptom are remitted, child HRQoL might not recover from impairments caused by maternal acute depressive symptoms in the past; (2) maternal emotional-cognitive deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Joormann and Gotlib, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lange et al., 2012)</ref> and negative parenting behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lovejoy et al., 2000)</ref> might persist after full remission of affective symptoms.</s></p><p><s>An important aim in the research of intergenerational transmission is the identification of underlying mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rutter, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Prior research has identified parenting behavior as a potential pathway of intergenerational transmission of maternal depression and ELM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dixon et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">McCarty et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, previous studies found maternal depression and a maternal history of ELM to be associated with higher levels of parenting stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Milgrom and McCloud, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pereira et al., 2012)</ref> and lower levels of maternal sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Campbell et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Driscoll and Easterbrooks, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kluczniok et al., 2016)</ref>, which is the accurate and timed responsiveness to and perception of the child's signals.</s><s>Furthermore, studies indicate an association of high parenting stress and low maternal sensitivity with low child HRQoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Campbell, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kidwell et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, both maternal sensitivity and parenting stress could function as mediators for the effects of maternal history of ELM and depression on child HRQoL; however, this link has not been examined so far.</s><s>Hence, we aim to fill this gap and investigate whether maternal sensitivity and parenting stress mediate effects of maternal history of ELM and depression on child HRQoL.</s></p><p><s>The present study tested two hypotheses: (1) both, severity of maternal history of ELM and depression predict child HRQoL.</s><s>(2) Maternal sensitivity and perceived parenting stress mediate these associations.</s><s>In addition, in contrast to previous investigations, we did not solely rely on parent-ratings of child HRQoL but also considered the child's individual perspective.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p><s>The current study was performed within the framework of the UBICA (Understanding and Breaking the Intergenerational Cycle of Abuse) multicenter project which investigates the effects of maternal history of ELM on mother-child interaction and child well-being.</s><s>The present study involved 194 mothers and their children between five and 12 years of age who all attended primary school (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for demographic variables).</s><s>As an inclusion criteria mother and child had to live together.</s></p><p><s>Mother-child dyads were recruited by advertisement (e.g.</s><s>gynecologists' and psychiatrists' outpatient clinics) in Berlin and Heidelberg.</s><s>Additionally, we re-contacted mothers from a previous study in Heidelberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Moehler et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>We included mothers who experienced physical and sexual abuse in their childhood before the age of 17 (moderate or severe score in CECA interview; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bifulco et al., 1994)</ref> with or without at least one episode of Major Depression (MD) later in life (M.I.N.I., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sheehan et al., 1998)</ref>, mothers with at least one lifetime MD and no history of childhood maltreatment, and healthy mothers with no history of childhood maltreatment nor lifetime MD.</s><s>Mothers who had experienced an episode of MD had to be currently in full remission as defined by a Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hamilton, 1960)</ref> score of below or equal seven.</s></p><p><s>Exclusion criteria were severe physical or neurological diseases, severe physical or mental disabilities of mother <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schmidt and Metzler, 1992)</ref> or child (CFT 20-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Weiss et al., 2006</ref>; CFT 1-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Weiss and Osterland, 1997)</ref>, and the following psychiatric disorders that would have a negative impact on the participation in the study: substance addictions in the last half year, schizophrenic disorders, bipolar and manic disorders, acute depression, posttraumatic stress disorder as assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sheehan et al., 1998)</ref>, and borderline personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder as assessed by the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Loranger et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>None of the participating mothers included in these analyses suffered from any current psychiatric disorder as assessed by the M.I.N.I. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sheehan et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Psychotropic drug medication did not represent an exclusion criterion; however, dosage had to be stable for at least two weeks before study entrance.</s></p><p><s>Approval for the study was obtained by the ethics committees of the Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the Faculty of Medicine of Heidelberg.</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after the nature of the procedure was explained.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures Maternal Depression.</head><p><s>We implemented the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sheehan et al., 1998)</ref> to assess maternal history of depression (and other diagnoses of DSM-IV axis I disorders).</s><s>The M.I.N.I. is a fully structured diagnostic interview for screening DSM axis I disorders.</s><s>Previous research has shown good interrater reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sheehan et al., 1997)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of maternal history of ELM and depression on child quality of life</head><p><s>Our first hypothesis was partially confirmed as we found an effect of maternal history of depression on child HRQoL.</s><s>However, there was no evidence that maternal experience of ELM alone had an impact on child HRQoL.</s></p><p><s>The present study adds to the existing literature in the following regards: First, the majority of studies investigating the effects of maternal depression on children's well-being have mostly used maternal assessments of child outcomes.</s><s>The present study provides results based on assessments of the child him-or herself.</s><s>Second, previous studies showed evidence for a negative effect of maternal acute depressive symptoms on child HRQoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Wiegand-Grefe et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>We found similar results for mothers who were fully remitted from depression.</s><s>There are two possible factors that could explain this finding: On the one hand, cognitive-emotional and behavioral alterations (including alterations concerning maternal behavior) may persist even after complete remission of affective symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lange et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lovejoy et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, effects of maternal acute depressive episodes on child HRQoL may persist after remission of depression.</s><s>Third, including both maternal depression and maternal ELM in one study allowed us to disentangle the effects of these two factors.</s><s>In our study, we did not find an effect of ELM on child HRQoL while significant results emerged for maternal history of depression.</s><s>We can exclude confounding effects of ELM on the association of maternal history of depression and child HRQoL.</s></p><p><s>Taking a further look into the five dimensions of the KIDSCREEN-27 instrument, certain aspects of children's HRQoL showed to be more affected by maternal depression than others.</s><s>In line with work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wiegand-Grefe et al.
