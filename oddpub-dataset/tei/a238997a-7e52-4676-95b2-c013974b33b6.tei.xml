microRNA expression and effects could be tissue-specific and that plasma microRNA reflects a general condition of a patient.</s></p><p><s>This study linked mir-150-5p with intracellular MAVS protein expression.</s><s>The MAVS protein levels were significantly higher in patients with lupus than in normal controls and were negatively correlated with lupus activity in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The dynamic changes of mir-150-5p relating to lupus activity are worthy of further investigation.</s></p><p><s>Cell catabolism is upregulated in SLE, and

type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>Wang et al. showed that miR221/222 downregulates caspase-10 in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>As seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, we noted that caspase-10 is negatively associated with ΔCT of several plasma microRNAs, including miR-22-3p and miR-21-5p.</s><s>This observation suggests the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic caspase-10-related pathway in SLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> and that caspase-10 is influenced by microRNA, which could be reflected by plasma microRNA levels in this study.</s><s>Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that caspase-10 positively correlates with pIRF7, and caspase-9 and caspase-10 both   positively correlate with each other, pIRF7, and MAVS 70 kD <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, indicating that interferons are links to cellular apoptosis and anti-virus immunity in SLE <ref type="bibr"

target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Our preliminary study adds several microRNAs that were significantly different from normal controls to the list of previously identified microRNAs.</s><s>It is worth mentioning that miR-150-5p levels were positively correlated with clinical inflammatory indicator CRP level and the SLEDAI but were negatively associated with MAVS.</s><s>The idea that interplay between disease activity and infectious disease could be linked by microRNA has been mentioned in other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>.</s><s>This study had several limitations.</s><s>First, this was a cross-sectional observational study.</s><s>More detailed studies are required to determine the real function of plasma microRNA levels in lupus.</s><s>The concentration of plasma microRNA is low and it needs delicate handling during experiment procedure, and six of our patients' plasma microRNAs were either undetectable or with poor quality which prevent further analysis.</s><s>A longitudinal study is also required to detect the trend of plasma microRNA in lupus and could reduce variance and improve our ability to predict the prognoses.</s><s>Second, the case number in this study was small.</s><s>The difference data number between the plasma microRNA and the intracellular protein levels was due to experiment difficulty of the retrieving plasma microRNA.</s><s>Large-scale prospective and longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the prognostic contribution of microRNAs on clinical outcome.</s></p><p><s>Our study confirmed the hypothesis that these microR-NAs were associated with the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in SLE.</s><s>MiR-150-5p ΔCT was positively associated with SLE disease activity and was negatively correlated with MAVS 70 kD.</s><s>The level of microRNA concentration is reversed to the ΔCT, so it is suggesting that this miR-150-5p is positively correlated with MAVS 70 kD and might facilitate anti-viral activity during viral infection and this might be reflected by elevation of CRP levels clinically.</s><s>The miR-150-5p could be one useful marker demonstrating virus related lupus disease flare-up clinically (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, miR-22-3p ΔCT and miR-21-5p ΔCT were negatively correlated with caspase-10 levels, where these microRNAs may associate increased extrinsic apoptosis and decreased cell survival, which could reflect monocyte activation-induced cell death.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the plasma microRNA could be a maker demonstrating complex immune milieu in lupus.</s><s>Some specific microRNA markers could be useful makers for differentiating intracellular immune pathways, such as miR-150-5p in MAVS pathway and miR-22-3p and miR-21-5p in extrinsic apoptosis pathway.</s></p><p><s>All the underlying research materials related to our article can be accessed on demand by email
