<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>As unsatisfactory healing outcomes post tendon surgery remains a severe clinical complication, it is necessary to investigate the application of growth factors as treatment option for improved tendon regeneration.</s><s>The growth factor BMP-7 can be considered a candidate factor as previous studies have shown that it is capable of inducing proliferation and collagen-I synthesis of cells from tendons and ligaments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> .</s><s>It is the aim of this study to further investigate BMP-7 signalling in tenocytes through the analysis of the signalling components in human tenocyte like cells (hTLCs) in the presence of BMP-7.</s></p><p><s>The present study shows for the first time that BMP-7 leads to an increase in phosphorylation of rSmads in hTLCs.</s><s>The phosphorylated rSmad should complex with the co-Smad4, translocate into the nucleus and increase the expression of the transcription of ID1 (a canonical target gene in BMP signalling) and the tendon related transcription factor scleraxis.</s><s>An increase of the gene expression of the rSmad component, Smad8, but no change amongst its Smad1/5 and co-Smad-4 partners is observed.</s><s>Furthermore, the receptors BMPR-Ib and BMPR-II gene expression is strongly increased in hTLCs in the presence of BMP-7.</s><s>Taken together this could be indicative of BMP-7 selecting a pool of signalling components (receptors and intracellular components) that are pro-tenogenic.</s></p><p><s>Different BMP ligands were shown to have different affinities for different BMP receptors.</s><s>While BMP-2 preferentially binds to BMPR-Ia and -Ib and less to BMPR-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , BMP-7 has high affinity for ActR-I, BMPR-Ib, and to a lesser extent BMPR-Ia <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>BMPs have a general lower affinity for type II receptors.</s><s>However, it was shown that BMP-7 also binds to BMPR-II, ActR-IIa, and ActR-IIb <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .</s><s>In COS-1 cells stimulated with BMP-7 BMPR-II has been shown to preferentially complex with ActR-I and to a lesser extent with BMPR-Ia and-Ib <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>As the present study investigated mRNA expression levels of BMP receptors, further research needs to be carried out to investigate the receptor complex preferences of BMP-7 in hTLCs.</s><s>Based on our data, showing a strong increase in BMPR-Ib and BMPR-II expression after BMP-7 stimulation, we speculated that this may increase the presence of these receptors on the cell surface and therefore increases the likelihood of BMP-7 binding a BMPR-Ib and BMPR-II receptor complex on hTLCs.</s></p><p><s>The receptor regulated Smads1/5/8 are phosphorylated through the activation of type I receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , which could possibly be BMPR-Ib in the present study.</s><s>The western blot analysis showed BMP-7 stimulation of hTLCs leads to the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, strongly suggesting BMP-7 induces the Smad signalling cascade.</s><s>The phosphorylation analysis was not able to distinguish between the three receptor-associated Smads, but the expression analysis showed a strong increase of Smad8 expression in the hTLCs, whereas, Smad1 was only slightly increased and Smad5 was not affected.</s><s>This leads us to consider that Smad8 may be a prominent signalling molecule in hTLCs in response to BMP-7 treatment.</s><s>This assumed preference of Smad8 signalling in the hTLC is supported by previous studies showing that Smad8 plays an important role in tenogenic differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>It was demonstrated that Smad8 is able to induce tenogenic differentiation, while suppressing chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation in a murine MSC cell line (C3H10T1/2) and furthermore promoted tendon formation in a rat Achilles tendon model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, Smad1 and 5 were reported to induce osteogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and C3H10T1/2 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>While the Smad1/5/8 are highly conserved: maintaining a three domain structure (MH1.</s><s>MH2 separated by a linker region), the key divergence between Smad1/5 and Smad8 is found within the linker region <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> .</s><s>The linker region plays an important role in post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>A previous study has shown that BMP-2 induces Smad1 and 5 phosphorylation as well as osteogenic differentiation in human tendon cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>However, Smad1 and 5 were only weakly regulated in the present study, we surmise, osteogenic differentiation might not occur after BMP-7 stimulation.</s><s>This is also supported by the unchanged osteocalcin expression in this and previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</s><s>Hoffmann et al. clearly showed that BMPR-Ib strongly increases the phosphorylation of Smad8 as compared with other BMPR type I receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>This would be in line with the present findings of a strongly increased BMPR-Ib expression together with a strongly up-regulated Smad8 expression.</s><s>A recently published study investigated the role of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 in BMP signalling and concluded that Smad8 has a unique action compared to the other two Smads <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>After activation of the BMP signalling, Smad8 expression was increased in C2C12 cell line resulting in a reduced BMP activity.</s><s>This present study also demonstrates an increased Smad8 expression but not a reduction in the BMP-activity after BMP stimulation was seen in the tenocyte-like cells.</s><s>In the present study, the co-Smad4 expression was slightly increased; indicating the possibility of the formation of a Smad complex in hTLCs after BMP-7 stimulation.</s><s>This complex could translocate into the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes.</s><s>One of the target genes is ID1, a helix loop helix protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , which expression was significantly increased by BMP-7 in the present study.</s><s>The strong increase in ID1 expression, which is significantly reduced after inhibition of the Smad-pathway, furthermore underlines the utilisation of Smad signalling in the hTLCs after BMP-7 stimulation.</s></p><p><s>Our examination of the non-Smad signalling components in hTLCs in the presence of BMP-7 has shown: an

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>This present study shows that BMP-7 signalling of hTLCs, isolated from human supraspinatus tendons (donors: male, 62-67 years, Goultallier grade 1-2), operates primarily through the Smad pathway and to less extend through the p38 pathway, leading to the increase of the tendon markers and matrix proteins such as Scleraxis, Collagen I, and aggrecan but not osteogenic and only slightly Sox9 as a chondrogenic marker.</s><s>Considering these points at the cellular perspective, BMP-7 seems to be a promising growth factor for the augmentation of tendon healing in clinics.</s><s>It is interesting to note that BMP-7 induces a selective increase of BMP signalling components: rRNA and the untreated control (reference line) using an efficiency corrected formula (n = 3).</s><s>Inhibitors for the specific pathway were used in two concentrations.</s><s>The inhibition of the Smad-pathway by LDN-193189 (LDN) resulted in a significant reduction of ID1 and scleraxis expression, less reduction was seen after inhibition of the p38 pathway with PD169316 (PD) and no effect after inhibition of the Akt-pathway (Akt), * p &lt; 0.003, # p &lt; 0.04, compared to BMP-7.</s></p><p><s>BMPR-II, BMPR-Ib, and Smad8.</s><s>The detailed analysis of the canonical and non-canonical signalling pathways suggests that BMP-7 supports the tenogenic phenotype, which is mediated primarily through Smad8 and to less extend through p38 associated pathways, without induction of osteogenic or chondrogenic phenotype.</s></p></div>
