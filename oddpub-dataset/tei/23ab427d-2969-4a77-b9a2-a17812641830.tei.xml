<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>The production of biofuels and chemicals using lignocellulosic materials is a feasible strategy to meet future energy and resource needs.</s><s>Xylose is the second most abundant sugar in hydrolysed lignocellulosic materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the utilization of xylose in addition to glucose is a fundamental requirement of microorganisms for the conversion of bio-based fuels and chemicals.</s><s>Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a robust and safe microorganism with a strong metabolism, and it is frequently used as a cell factory in the fermentation industry, particularly for ethanol production.</s><s>Therefore, S. cerevisiae is considered the most promising microorganism that produces ethanol from lignocellulosic materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>However, S. cerevisiae lacks both an efficient xylose metabolic pathway and appropriate regulatory system to respond to xylose <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>To build a xylose metabolic pathway in S. cerevisiae strains, heterologous xylose isomerase or xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase were introduced into the strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The genes for xylulokinase and the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were then overexpressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The resultant strains demonstrated a basic capacity to convert xylose into ethanol via sequential xylulose-5-phosphate, PPP, and glycolysis steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Adaptive evolution was performed to further enhance xylose catabolism.</s><s>The xylose conversion rate of these engineered strains significantly increased after a long cultivation time in medium with xylose as the sole carbon source <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To understand the elusive mechanisms underlying xylose fermentation, reverse metabolic engineering was carried out, and relevant factors were identified.</s><s>Increased activity of the hexose transporter Hxt7 improved the absorption of xylose <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Deficiency of the aldose reductase Gre3 reduced the intracellular production of xylitol, which is an inhibitor of xylose isomerase, therefore enhancing xylose utilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>A stress response regulator, Ask10, improved xylose isomerase activity by upregulating molecular chaperones, thereby enhancing xylose utilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, recently studies have shown that the use of carbon sources exerts substantial control over the metabolic status of S. cerevisiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>This was determined by investigating the glucose-sensing and repression network, which is composed of three signalling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>The Rgt2/Snf3-Rgt1 pathway primarily regulates the transcription of hexose transporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>; the Snf1-Mig1 pathway largely functions in repressing the genes involved in non-fermentable carbon metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>; and the most important pathway, the cAMP-PKA pathway, carries out genome-wide regulation by phosphorylating transcription factors (TFs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>When glucose or another fermentable carbon source is present, cells maintain fermentative metabolism regardless of whether the conditions are aerobic or anaerobic <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>In this case, glycolysis and the PPP are activated in cells, while respiration and gluconeogenesis are repressed.</s><s>Glucose is rapidly consumed and converted to ethanol.</s><s>This phenomenon, which occurs during the fermentative phase of yeast growth, is called glucose repression <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>When glucose becomes limited, the cells transiently arrest their growth and adjust their metabolism from fermentation to respiratory mode (a diauxic shift).</s><s>Glycolysis and the PPP are suppressed, and respiration and gluconeogenesis are de-repressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The cells then restart their growth at a reduced rate by slowly consuming the ethanol that has accumulated in the medium.</s><s>Salusjärvi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> suggested that xylose is a semifermentable carbon source for S. cerevisiae, since the metabolism of yeast growing on xylose corresponds neither to that of fully glucose-repressed cells (fermentative state) nor to that of de-repressed cells (respiratory state), and the glucose signalling system plays an important role in xylose metabolism.</s><s>Our previous work revealed that one of the glucose signalling pathways, Snf1/Mig1-mediated regulation, was reprogrammed in an evolved strain whose xylose consumption was enhanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, the regulator Ira2, which is a negative regulator of Ras and an inhibitor of cAMP-PKA signalling <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, was also shown to affect xylose fermentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, unexpected control factors have been revealed through well-designed comparative transcriptome analysis.</s><s>ISU1 [encoding a scaffolding protein for mitochondrial ironsulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis] deficiency increased aerobic growth and xylose consumption rates, and the absence of HOG1 [encoding a component of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)] in the context of isu1Δ brought further improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the extensive efforts to improve xylose consumption and discover associated mechanisms, relatively little attention has been focused on the differing performances of strains undergoing glucose-xylose cofermentation compare to strains engaging in fermentation using xylose as their sole carbon source <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, engineered S. cerevisiae strains ferment xylose at significantly lower rates during glucose-xylose co-fermentation compared to their good performance when xylose is the sole carbon source (referred to as the X stage in the present work) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, during the xylose consumption phase after glucose is depleted in glucosexylose co-fermentation, which is referred to as the GX stage in the present work, the growth and xylose consumption rates drop sharply rather than only decreasing to the levels observed during the X stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s><s>This phenomenon is referred to as the post-glucose effect on xylose metabolism.</s><s>The post-glucose effect is generally observed in engineered xylose-utilizing S. cerevisiae strains with different genetic backgrounds, including the evolved strains mentioned above <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>Transcriptome engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> has focused on manipulating extant regulatory networks to enforce a state associated with a desired phenotype to improve xylose fermentation during the glucose-xylose co-utilization phase.</s><s>Network models of well-known TFs have been used to guide such transcriptome engineering.</s><s>Remarkably, deletions of CAT8 (encoding a TF that is necessary for the de-repression of a variety of genes under non-fermentative growth conditions) and HAP4 (encoding a transcriptional activator and global regulator of respiratory gene expression) reduced the carbon commitment to biomass during the glucose and xylose co-consumption phase, and the specific rate of ethanol production increased.</s><s>However, no intervention has prevented the transition from fermentative to respiratory metabolism when cells enter the GX stage, and little is known about why cells show differing performances in xylose metabolism when glucose is present or not present in the medium.</s></p><p><s>To describe the mechanism underlying the postglucose effect on xylose metabolism, two engineered xylose-utilizing S. cerevisiae strains, BSGX001 (haploid) and XH7 (diploid), were selected as test strains in the present work.</s><s>BSGX001 was derived from the haploid strain CEN.PK113-5D, which has been widely used in metabolic engineering work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>XH7 was derived from the diploid strain BSIF, which was isolated from a tropical fruit in Thailand <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>Both BSGX001 and XH7 express an exogenous xylose isomerase gene, overexpress XKS1 and genes associated with the nonoxidative phase of the PPP, contain GRE3 and PHO13 deletions, and evolve in medium containing xylose as the sole carbon source.</s><s>Transcriptome differences between the two strains were studied during the GX and X stages.</s><s>The effects of disrupting all 11 TFs with differing levels of expression in the GX and X stages, as well as three metabolic genes, were also investigated.</s><s>Our results revealed that THI2 knockout and NRM1 overexpression alleviated the post-glucose effect.</s><s>Additional transcriptional and physiological work was performed, and the results suggest that these positive effects were related to the enhancement of ribosome synthesis and the cell cycle.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>The present study investigated the mechanisms underlying the post-glucose effect on xylose metabolism, a metabolic phenomenon commonly found in recombinant xylose-utilizing S. cerevisiae.</s><s>Glucose-sensing systems become lethargic during glucose-xylose co-fermentation after glucose depletion; therefore, the cells do not respond to residual xylose and enter the lag phase.</s><s>Knocking out THI2 or overexpressing NRM1 or YHP1 increases xylose metabolism; such methods may be applied to alleviate the post-glucose effect and enhance xylose utilization.</s><s>Their enhancement of xylose utilization is likely attributable to improved ribosome synthesis and alteration of the cell cycle.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Shuttle plasmid for E. coli and S. cerevisiae, Cre gene under control of GAL2 promoterdiploid S. cerevisiae strain isolated from tropical fruit in Thailand, pho13::XI, gre3::PPP, XK, 3δ::XI, AE a<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> BSGX001CEN.PK 113-5D derivative; Ru-XI, XK, gre3::PPP, cox4Δ, -loxp-KanMX4-loxp-TEF1p-RPL7A-ADHt-δ2 This study</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
