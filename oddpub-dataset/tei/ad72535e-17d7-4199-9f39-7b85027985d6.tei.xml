<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">Dietary Pattern and Type 2 Diabetes</head><p><s>Logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the associations between the dietary pattern and type 2 diabetes.</s><s>Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated across the quintiles and per 1 SD of the dietary pattern score.</s><s>The significance of a linear trend across the categories was tested by assigning each control the median of a category and by modeling this value as a continuous variable.</s><s>For type 2 diabetes, as a rare disease with long latency, we applied the proportional odds assumption in logistic regression models and based our adjustments on previous findings.</s><s>Initially we adjusted for age and sex (Model 1).</s><s>Then, we further adjusted for diabetes family history (yes or no), SES sum score, smoking status (never/current or ex-smoker) and energy expenditure (kcal/day) (Model 2), and finally we adjusted for BMI and WHR (Model 3).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4.">Sensitivity Analyses</head><p><s>We tested interactions of the association between the dietary pattern and type 2 diabetes with sex, general obesity (BMI ě 30 kg/m 2 ) or central adiposity (waist circumference ě 102 cm (men), ě88 cm (women)) by performing stratified analyses and we evaluated the significance of cross-product terms.</s><s>We also examined the sensitivity of our results and excluded participants with lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory drug intake.</s><s>We assessed the association between biomarkers of glucose metabolism (FPG and HOMA-IR) and the dietary pattern score across quintiles among the controls.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we simplified our dietary pattern score in the total study population by summing up the unweighted standardized intake of the food items with the ten highest factor loadings.</s><s>To assess the importance of individual food components of the dietary pattern score for type 2 diabetes, we sequentially subtracted each component from the simplified dietary pattern score.</s><s>We calculated the change in estimate (CIE) as the difference between the ORs divided by the OR from the simplified score multiplied by 100.</s></p><p><s>We defined a two-sided p-value of &lt;0.05 as statistical significance.</s><s>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</s></p></div>
