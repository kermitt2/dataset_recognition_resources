target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Light of the (near)-infrared spectrum enters the tissue of the hands, where it stimulates the fluorophore ICG.</s><s>Its fluorescence is then detected by a charge-coupled detector (CCD).</s><s>A locally increased microcirculation, e.g. in inflamed joints, leads to strong signal enhancement, due to higher ICG concentration.</s><s>ICG fluorescence video angiography has also been shown to help in the detection of compromised tissue perfusion as a perioperative tool in microsurgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>ICG is well tolerated and side effects (i.e.</s><s>anaphylactic symptoms) occur rarely (1:42,000) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Shortly after its administration, ICG is hepatically metabolised and hepatobiliarily excreted.</s><s>Already since the 1970s, ICG has safely been used in ophthalmologic angiography and even proved its value in the evaluation of skin perfusion in plastic surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Pfeil et al. introduced FOI in SSc patients.</s><s>Compared to healthy subjects, areas with strong signal enhancement could be observed and were interpreted as tissue inflammation.</s><s>A normalisation occurred after prostacyclin treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>However, these investigations focused on areas of increased perfusion.</s></p><p><s>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) typically suffer from Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) and progressive obliterative vasculopathy.</s><s>Both lead to a decreasing or even completely ceasing circulation in distal body parts, i.e. fingertips or the nose.</s><s>Almost one third of SSc patients consequently develop at least one digital ulcer per year, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> which usually causes pain, loss of function, local and systemic infection and reduced quality of life.</s></p><p><s>So far, several predictive factors for the development of digital ulcers (DU) have been described, i.e. diffuse subtype of SSc, late

target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Various imaging methods have been suggested to measure vasculopathy in patients with systemic sclerosis and to link its extent

assessed by laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) were lower in SSc patients with digital ulcers than in patients without <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The best prospective data exist for nailfold capillaroscopy (NC): the capillaroscopic skin ulcer risk index (CSURI) has a high specificity (81.4%) and

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects' characteristics</head><p><s>Between 2013 and 2015, 89 individuals participated in this study forming two cohorts: the SSc group and the healthy cohort.</s><s>We consecutively included in-and outpatients fulfilling the 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria for systemic sclerosis.</s><s>Healthy subjects were defined as persons without any known diseases, e.g.</s><s>vascular diseases.</s><s>For subjects' characteristics see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Subjects with current DU/PS were summarised in group 1, subjects without DU/PS in group 2. Exclusion criteria were progressive renal dysfunction (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≤15 ml/min), latent and manifest hyperthyroidism, allergies to iodine or contrast agents, pregnancy and being underage.</s><s>2013 ACR/EULAR classification guidelines were applied with seven different criteria each scoring 2, 3, 4 or 9 points (such as present DU/PS, RP or skin induration) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>A maximum of 30 points could be obtained; ≥9 points confirmed the classification as SSc.</s><s>We defined the range of scores between 9 and 30 points as a marker for dissemination of SSc features: a higher individual ACR/EULAR score meant the presence of more SSc characteristics.</s><s>Limited, limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous SSc (lSSc, lcSSc and dcSSc) were distinguished according to LeRoy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Organ involvement was evaluated as follows: manifestations of the lung were either pulmonary hypertension or interstitial lung disease, determined by right heart catheterisation or echocardiogram and high-resolution computed tomography or lung function test, respectively.</s><s>Gastrointestinal involvement was defined as dysphagia and/or radiographic dysmotility and chronic diarrhoea.</s><s>Cardiac involvement comprised arrhythmias, congestive cardiac failure, pericardial effusion, and conduction defects not attributable to other cardiac conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fluorescence optical imaging</head><p><s>The FOI method Xiralite X4 (mivenion GmbH, Berlin, Germany) measures the fluorescence of the fluorophore indocyanine green (ICG, 5% iodine) using light-emitting diodes and a charge-coupled detector (CCD, a highresolution camera).</s><s>Light with defined wavelengths (ca.</s><s>λ = 740 nm) in the (near)-infrared spectrum is emitted and sent through the observed tissue stimulating the fluorophore (if present).</s><s>The fluorophore then emits fluorescence of different wavelengths (max.</s><s>λ = 832 nm) whose photons are detected by CCD.</s><s>Refracted and reflected light is filtered out, so that the resulting image represents a true depiction of ICG distribution in the tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus, the method permits a visualisation of different ICG quantities in the tissue of both hands, e.g. higher quantities of the agent can be found in inflamed tissue due to capillary leakage as well as an increase in blood flow and vessel density on a microvascular level <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Low ICG quantityand therefore low fluorescence signalresults from poor tissue perfusion.</s></p><p><s>All participants in this study received FOI examination following the Xiralite system guidelines (ICG 0.1 mg/kg A peripheral venous catheter, the colouring agent (0.1 mg/kg BW) as well as a syringe with 10 ml NaCl 0.9% solution were prepared.</s><s>The subject's hands were then placed on a mould underneath the camera with a curtain lying on the lower arms in order to diminish disturbance by exterior light.</s><s>The examiner (e.g. a medical assistant) checked for possible disturbances (e.g.</s><s>exterior light, spilled ICG) watching the XiraView® preview, before starting the examination.</s><s>FOI began with ten (reference) images being taken before ICG administration.</s><s>Immediately afterwards, 10 ml NaCl 0.9% solution was applied to introduce the complete amount of ICG into the blood stream, where ICG binds to 98% onto plasma proteins.</s><s>Indocyanine green has a half-life of 3.4 minutes (±0.7) and is hepatically eliminated with a mean decay of 18.5% per minute (±2.1); 20 minutes after applications, studies have shown a mere trace (3.8% ± 1.0 of the original dose) to still be found in the body <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The infrared camera continued taking one picture per second for the next 350 seconds, resulting in a total examination time of 6 minutes.</s><s>With ICG's half-life span and rate of decay one can expect the fluorophore to have passed through the bloodstream and accumulated in the observed tissue in this timespan.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FOI analysis</head><p><s>XiraView® was used to conduct the analysis, especially its 360-second-long clip mode, which depicts ICG distribution in the hands after administration.</s><s>The PrimaVista-Mode, a summation image of the examination, was used for visualisation in this work's figures.</s></p><p><s>The number of photons emitted from the fluorophore is recorded in every pixel.</s><s>After the examination, these are proportioned to the reference images (no ICG) and the pixel with the highest photon emission in the entire examination.</s><s>The percentage of the actual emission in the pixel compared to the maximum emission is used by the software to create a colour scale for optimal visualisation which we used for our analysis: white and red signals indicate a strong enhancement (= strong ICG accumulation in the tissue defined as ≥65% of the individual maximum quantity), yellow and green signals indicate a medium enhancement, light blue signals show lower ICG accumulation in the tissue, dark blue signals show very little ICG accumulation and no ICG accumulation at all is coded in black.</s><s>A dark blue or black signal was considered as an insufficient enhancement due to low ICG accumulation (&lt;27% of the individual maximum quantity) in the region (to see the defined regions please compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) observed.</s><s>The cutoffs of &gt;65% and &lt;27% for strong and insufficient signal respectively were provided by the software as 65% defines the mark between the red and yellow signal and 27% the mark between the light and dark blue signal.</s></p><p><s>Each finger of every subject was separately inspected (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1, 2 and 3</ref>)</s></p><p><s>We evaluated three things in particular:</s></p><p><s>1.</s><s>The region of initial enhancement (IE), which was defined as a finger's first region presenting a strong ICG accumulation (≥65% of the individual maximum quantity; coded as a white or red signal).</s></p><p><s>Ideally, this region would be the fingertip (region 0, compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), designating an unperturbed arterial blood flow.</s><s>A strong signal below the fingertip would depict the last area with (supposedly) unperturbed circulation.</s><s>2. The region of maximum distal distribution (MDD), which was defined as the most distal region that shows sufficient ICG enhancement (≥27% of the individual maximum quantity; coded as a white, red, yellow, green or light blue signal) during the course of the examination.</s><s>Ideally, this region would also be the fingertip (region 0).</s><s>Signals below would mean an insufficient provision of blood to more distal regions due to angiopathy, occlusion etc. 3. Complete disruption: a complete disruption of acral microcirculation was defined as an insufficient ICG accumulation (i.e.</s><s>&lt;27% of maximum signal intensity) in the fingertip of at least one of the subject's finger during the entire examination.</s><s>That implies that the region of MDD is more proximal than the fingertip (i.e.</s><s>regions 1 to 8, compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We assigned eight regions (region 0 to region 7) to each finger (thumbs: five regions) starting with the fingertip (region 0) and ending in the metacarpal region.</s><s>The wrist was considered a common region 8 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, ICG accumulation patterns for typical changes during IE as described by Granzow et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> were scanned.</s><s>The examination and analysis as described were performed in a maximum of 15 minutes per subject.</s></p></div>
