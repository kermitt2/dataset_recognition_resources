<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>Lung samples from 71 patients with COPD (36 male and 35 female; diagnosis by listing for transplantation) who underwent lung transplantation were collected between June 2011 and December 2015.</s><s>31 patients with COPD met the inclusion criteria (clinical parameters and characteristic features of the disease on representative computed tomography (CT) images, as well as measurement of mean PAP by right heart catheterisation within the 6 months prior to lung transplantation) for this study.</s><s>In addition, control lung tissue from donors without tumours (n=8) was obtained.</s><s>Patient information is presented in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>All subjects suffered from severe or very severe COPD and had significant airway obstruction with a marked reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (median (interquartile range (IQR)) 20 (16-28)% predicted) and moderate to severe hypoxaemia.</s><s>Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was greatly reduced to a mean of 25 (19-32)% pred.</s><s>All patients were treated with long-term oxygen therapy.</s><s>22 patients had pulmonary hypertension with a mean PAP of 30 (24-39) mmHg.</s></p><p><s>In COPD patients, p22phox is significantly correlated with haemodynamics, oxygenation ratio and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide To determine whether the p22phox-dependent NADPH oxidases are regulated in COPD in the lung, expression of the NADPH oxidase subunits nox1, nox2, nox4 and p22phox was assessed using real-time PCR.</s><s>As is evident in figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>, in COPD lung tissue, p22phox, nox2 and nox4 expression was decreased as compared with control tissue, while p22phox expression in pulmonary arteries obtained using laser-capture microdissection from COPD lungs was generally lower than in healthy controls (figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In addition, bronchi obtained by the same methods showed a significant downregulation of p22phox (online supplementary figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we performed Spearman analysis between the lung tissue p22phox levels and the clinical parameters (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In COPD patients, there was a significant positive correlation between p22phox expression and mean PAP, between p22phox and the oxygenation index (oxygen tension (PO 2 )/inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO 2 )), the clinical indicator of mismatch, and an inverse correlation between p22phox and DLCO, the clinical indicator of perfused lung area.</s><s>In contrast, emphysema score was not significantly correlated with mean PAP and DLCO (online supplementary figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in p22phox -/mice To identify the role of p22phox in the functional response of the pulmonary circulation to hypoxia, p22phox +/+ and p22phox -/mice were studied.</s><s>The biphasic increase in mean PAP under hypoxic ventilation (1% oxygen) was investigated in isolated, perfused and ventilated lungs of p22phox +/+ and p22phox -/mice and four-point pressure-flow curves were obtained by recording characteristic changes in mean PAP during variations in perfusate flow (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>).</s><s>Lack of p22phox resulted in a skewed HPV response compared to p22phox +/+ littermate controls (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the maximum increase in mean PAP in the acute, transient HPV ( phase I) was comparable in both groups (6.9±0.7 cmH 2 O versus 7.6±0.8</s><s>cmH 2 O for p22phox -/and p22phox +/+ , respectively), whereas the subsequent sustained HPV ( phase II) was blunted in p22phox -/mice.</s><s>This reduced increase in mean PAP became statistically significant at minute 70 and lasted until the end of the measurements.</s><s>Importantly, these findings were not related to changes in basal mean PAP, which was unaltered in p22phox -/mice (9.4±0.3 cmH 2 O versus 9.4±0.3</s><s>cmH 2 O for p22phox +/+ and p22phox -/-, respectively), or to body weight (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c and d</ref>).</s><s>These experiments demonstrate that the lack of p22phox prevented part of the increase in mean PAP during sustained hypoxia and emphasises that the p22phox-dependent NADPH oxidase contributes to the sustained, but not the acute phase I of HPV.</s></p><p><s>Preserved vasoconstrictor responses of p22phox -/pulmonary arteries to potassium chloride and the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 To further evaluate the contractile response, intrapulmonary arteries obtained from p22phox +/+ and p22phox -/mice were exposed to increasing doses of potassium chloride or thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 using a wire myograph.</s><s>During the cumulative application of these agents, there were no differences in the vasoconstrictor responses between the p22phox +/+ and p22phox -/mice (online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3A and B</ref>).</s><s>We also examined the tension changes of U46619-preconstricted intrapulmonary arteries to the addition of the potent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3C</ref>) and found that p22phox deficiency had no effect on the vasodilatory response.</s><s>These data suggest that p22phox specifically affects pulmonary vascular function related to hypoxia.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present study shows for the first time that in patients with very severe COPD the NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox is significantly reduced as compared to controls, but that p22phox is preserved in those COPD patients with increased mean PAP, better oxygenation ratio (PO 2 /FIO 2 ) and lower DLCO.</s><s>This work is the first to functionally characterise NADPH oxidase, showing that p22phox is important for both phase II (sustained) HPV and chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.</s><s>These novel findings suggest that p22phox is a key player in COPD and in hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodelling.</s></p><p><s>Our COPD cohort consisted of a heterogeneous group of patients who underwent lung transplantation due to end-stage disease.</s><s>Their FEV1 ranged between 9% pred and 52% pred, DLCO was between 10% pred and 41% pred and PAP ranged from 14 mmHg to 62 mmHg.</s><s>There was no significant correlation between FEV1 and DLCO.</s><s>In addition, the emphysema score was not significantly correlated with mean PAP or  DLCO; however, this result has to be treated with caution, as the quality of some of the CT scans was limited.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, mean PAP was strongly negatively correlated with DLCO.</s><s>This agrees with CHAOUAT et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> who found that in a large cohort of COPD patients, strongly elevated PAP was associated with severely decreased DLCO.</s><s>This may be due to the fact that DLCO is a measure of the number of perfused and ventilated capillaries and therefore is sensitive to microvascular remodelling, suggesting that pulmonary vascular disease causes both DLCO decrease and PAP increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and is also seen in patients with lung fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The explanted lungs of the COPD patients expressed significantly less p22phox and p22phox-dependent NADPH oxidase as compared to donor lungs.</s><s>To our surprise, this finding was not associated with remodelling of the small pulmonary arteries, as DLCO was strongly negatively correlated with p22phox, i.e. the p22phox loss was only major in those COPD patients with diminished HPV and a low PAP, but p22phox was nearly completely preserved in those with preserved HPV and elevated PAP.</s><s>However, p22phox was significantly positively correlated with mean PAP and oxygenation ratio.</s><s>This may suggest that patients preserving p22phox despite severe COPD will preserve HPV, and may survive until they have reached extremes of lung parenchymal destruction, which is reflected in extremely low DLCO values (figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The expression of p22phox was reduced not only on pulmonary arteries, but also in the whole lung.</s><s>When we compared the p22phox expression in bronchi between COPD patients and controls we found a significant downregulation in the COPD cases.</s><s>This finding may be clinically relevant, because p22phox plays an important role in the anti-infective defence mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and COPD is strongly related to infectious complications.</s></p><p><s>In our study, we provide a comprehensive investigation of a Nox protein in all stages of hypoxia.</s><s>More importantly, we investigate a subunit which is essential for the function of nox1-4 proteins by a direct interaction at the protein level.</s><s>We demonstrate that p22phox is necessary for the hypoxia-induced increase in PAP and PVR during the (sustained) phase II of HPV, but not for the short, (acute) phase I of HPV in the murine model.</s><s>This observation could be explained in part by the reduced ability of p22phox -/mice to generate ROS in order to activate the rho-rho kinase system under hypoxia.</s><s>Here we provide evidence that the loss of p22phox results in a significant reduction of pulmonary hypertension, mirrored in reduced RVSP and decreased vascular remodelling.</s></p><p><s>The role of HPV in matching ventilation and perfusion in the lungs has been recognised for a long time.</s></p><p><s>According to prior investigations, endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the small pulmonary arteries are involved in this process <ref

required for the longitudinal propagation of HPV in the intact lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Proposed mechanisms for oxygen-sensing in HPV include the redox, ROS and energy state/AMP-activated protein kinase hypothesis In all, changing levels of ROS take a central role.</s><s>The two major sources of ROS production, mitochondria and NADPH oxidase, are well described in the pulmonary vasculature.</s><s>For the acute phase of HPV, ROS derived from the complex III of the mitochondria may be involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The role of NADPH

pulmonary hypertension, using the essential protein p22phox responsible for building a functional ROS-producing NADPH oxidase.</s></p><p><s>Phase I of HPV is mediated by the closure of potassium channels and subsequent calcium influx and/or by the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, followed by repletion through store-operated channels

difference in potassium channel function between p22phox +/+ and p22phox -/animals, and the potassium channel inhibition is not reliant on the p22phox-dependent NADPH oxidase activation.</s><s>Collectively, these results indicate that NADPH oxidase is not required for the acute phase I of HPV.</s></p><p><s>The second, sustained phase II of HPV is mainly dependent on

rho-mediated kinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we performed rho kinase activation studies under hypoxia and found that p22phox -/mice failed to generate NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS, and thus were unable to activate rho kinase.</s><s>Our observation is supported by a previous study, describing the lack of the NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative burst in the neutrophils in p22phox -/mice, which leads to susceptibility to bacterial infection in the lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the inability of p22phox -/mice to generate NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS might explain the lack of the hypoxia-mediated activation of rho kinase.</s></p><p><s>The participation of members of the NADPH oxidase family is well documented in pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for pulmonary hypertension, e.g. in human pulmonary hypertension and in different animal models of pulmonary hypertension.</s><s>In particular, the Nox4 isoform is upregulated in the chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension model, as well as in human idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, whereas upregulation of the Nox1 isoform is reported in the monocrotaline model of pulmonary hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Since alveolar hypoxia is considered to be the major contributor resulting in HPV and pulmonary arterial remodelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and in our cohort of COPD patients, p22phox was associated with an elevated mean

limitation of our study is that differences in activated macrophages and neutrophils between p22phox-deficient mice and controls could have influenced lung pathology other than vascular remodelling.</s><s>In addition, mouse HPV may differ from human HPV in several aspects.</s><s>Validation of the results in different knockout species would be valuable, but such models are not available.</s><s>Moreover, our chronic model reflects only the vascular component of the disease under hypoxia and does not cover other aspects such as alveolar destruction and emphysema.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our results delineate an important role of p22phox-dependent NADPH oxidase in regulating pulmonary vascular tone under hypoxia and show that NADPH oxidase is operative under physiological conditions.</s><s>p22phox expression is associated with the vascular COPD phenotype.</s><s>The modification of the p22phox pathway may open important avenues for therapy of pulmonary vascular remodelling on the one hand and oxygenation problems on the other.</s><s>p22phox might also have diagnostic value as a predictor of the vascular COPD phenotype.</s><s>These
