<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Anaemia is common in cancer patients, with treatments including epoetins and blood transfusions.</s><s>Although an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been associated with both therapeutics, studies comparing the risk of VTE between epoetins and transfusions in cancer patients are lacking.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p><s>A nested case-control study investigated this risk using the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database.</s><s>Cohort members were incident cancer patients receiving first time treatment with epoetin or transfusion.</s><s>A subcohort including only patients receiving chemotherapy was created, since the formally approved indication of epoetins is chemotherapy-induced anaemia.</s><s>Cases were defined as patients developing VTE.</s><s>For each case up to 10 gender-and age-matched controls were selected from the cohort.</s><s>Multiple confounder adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for VTE and recent treatment with epoetins or transfusions (last 28 days before index date) compared with past anti-anaemic treatment were calculated by conditional logistic regression.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Among 69 888 patients receiving first time treatment with epoetin or transfusion, 3316 VTE cases were identified.</s><s>The aOR for VTE was 1.31 (95% CI 1.03, 1.65) for epoetins, 2.33 (95% CI 2.03, 2.66) for transfusions, and 2.24 (95% CI 1.34, 3.77) for epoetins and transfusions.</s><s>Sensitivity analyses with a stricter VTE definition or an expanded time window yielded similar results.</s><s>In the chemotherapy only subcohort the risk difference between epoetins and transfusions could not be verified (aOR 1.48, 95% CI  1.10, 1.98 vs. aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.49, 2.19).</s><s>Our study confirmed known VTE risk factors including previous VTE (aOR 14.76, 95%  CI 12.79, 17.03)  or surgery (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.67, 2.01).</s><s>Epoetin-associated risk decreased after a safety warning by the European Medicines Agency setting maximum haemoglobin target values to 12 g dl -1 .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>Transfusions could be associated with a higher VTE risk than epoetins in cancer patients.</s><s>Moreover, current prescribing patterns may have decreased the VTE risk for epoetins.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data source and study design</head><p><s>Data for this nested case-control study were obtained from GePaRD, which is based on data from four statutory health insurance (SHI) providers covering over 17 million insurants throughout Germany.</s><s>GePaRD contains individual demographic characteristics, information on hospitalizations and outpatient physician visits and outpatient dispensation data for each insurance member <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">15]</ref>.</s><s>In Germany, the utilization of health insurance data for scientific research is regulated by the Code of Social Law (SGB X).</s><s>All contributing SHIs and the regulatory authorities approved the use of the data for this study.</s><s>Since it was based on pseudonymous data, informed consent was not required by law.</s><s>The study period was from January 2004 to December 2009.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study cohort</head><p><s>Cohort members had to fulfil all of the following inclusion criteria: (i) at least 12 months of continuous insurance time before the initial outpatient epoetin dispensation or transfusion administration, (ii) no outpatient epoetin dispensation or code indicating transfusion administration within the 12 months before cohort entry, and (iii) at least one outpatient or inpatient diagnosis of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer or a code indicating chemotherapy within 6 months before cohort entry, but no diagnosis of cancer or code indicating chemotherapy between 6 months and 1 year before cohort entry.</s><s>Each study participant entered the cohort on the date of the first epoetin dispensation or first transfusion, whichever came first, within the study period if inclusion criteria were fulfilled.</s><s>Cohort exit was defined as the first of the following dates: (i) end of study period, (ii) death from any cause or (iii) interruption of insurance of more than 3 days or end of insurance.</s><s>Epoetin treatment was assessed via outpatient dispensations and included all epoetins irrespective of the licensed indication.</s><s>Transfusions were assessed via the in-and outpatient operations and procedures coding system (OPS) and outpatient claim codes for outpatient services and procedures (EBM).</s></p></div>

target="#b19">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, our data suggest a higher risk for transfusions than for epoetins, with the trend in aOR being consistent after adjusting for numerous risk factors, expanding the time window, narrowing down the analysis on the formally approved epoetin indication (CIA), applying a more restrictive VTE definition or excluding patients with CKD as a potential alternative reason for epoetin or transfusion use.</s><s>Every tenth patient in our study used epoetins, while in the chemotherapy only subcohort this percentage doubled reflecting their formally approved indication.</s><s>Moreover, we saw an annual decrease of epoetin users after 2006.</s><s>Altogether, our findings illustrate a considerable decline in epoetin utilization compared with the Anaemia Cancer Treatment Study, which was conducted from 2005 to 2007 in several European countries and showed that 62% of CIA patients were treated with epoetins <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref>.</s><s>A similar decline in the last years of the previous decade has also been observed in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref> and is probably associated with safety warnings and revised labellings issued in 2007 and 2008 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The overall VTE incidence in our cohort during the 5 year study period was circa 5%, being in accordance with published data.</s><s>A study using the California Cancer Registry to assess VTE incidence in cancer patients found a 2 year cumulative incidence of 1.6% with the rate decreasing over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the VTE risk between the two anti-anaemic treatments in a cohort exclusively comprising cancer patients.</s><s>It is also one of few studies examining the thromboembolic risk of transfusions in general.</s><s>A retrospective cohort study examining hospitalizations of cancer patients for a period of 9 years found transfusions to be a risk factor for VTE (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.53, 1.67) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24]</ref>.</s><s>However, no information on epoetin use was available, and the time relationship between transfusion administration and development of thromboembolic events could not be determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Transfusions were also shown to be a risk factor for VTE in an analysis of patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection, ranging from an OR of 1.39 for 1-2 units to an OR of 3.19 for ≥6 units <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Epoetin use was not assessed here either.</s><s>A case-crossover study evaluated triggers of hospitalization for VTE showing increased risks for transfusions (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 2.57, 95% CI 1.17, 5.64) and epoetins (aIRR, 9.33, 95% CI 1.19, 73.42).</s><s>However, only 26% of patients had a cancer diagnosis, making a comparison with our data difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18]</ref>.</s><s>A possible biological explanation for the higher VTE risk associated with transfusions could involve cytokine-related inflammation and immunomodulation, since both procedures have been linked to blood transfusions as well as to increased coagulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">29]</ref>.</s><s>The fact that increased inflammation does not seem to be of great importance in epoetin-induced thrombosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30]</ref> further supports this hypothesis.</s></p><p><s>We confirmed further known risk factors for VTE in cancer patients.</s><s>History of VTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref>, obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31]</ref>, metastatic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref>, previous surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref> and specific medications such as immunosuppressants, hormonal therapy or chemotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref> showed increased risks in our analysis.</s><s>The increased risk for antithrombotic medication probably reflects the higher baseline VTE risk of patients receiving such treatment.</s></p><p><s>As tumour type or tumour stage can affect treatment of anaemia and VTE risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref>, we investigated a possible impact of confounding by disease severity on our results.</s><s>For this reason, we created a more homogenous subcohort exclusively consisting of lung cancer patients and we additionally matched between cases and controls for presence of metastatic disease.</s><s>The aOR for
