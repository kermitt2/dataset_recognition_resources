<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>In recent years, the use of complementary medicine has risen <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>; in particular, cancer patients ask for more holistic treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> such as acupuncture for reducing the nausea caused by chemotherapy.</s><s>The broad field of complementary medicine is defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US as "a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices and products that are not generally considered to be a part of conventional medicine.</s><s>Complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine, and alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Patients' high demand for complementary medicine therapy exerts pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> on clinics to adapt appropriately to patients' needs.</s><s>In many places, this adaptation has resulted in a shift from the separation of conventional and complementary medicine to a "merger" of the two medicine fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>New terms have been introduced that aim to capture the increasing integration of complementary medicine in a conventional medicine setting, particularly the term "Integrative Medicine" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>This term was defined by the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine as "the practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing" <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In countries such as Germany, where both complementary and conventional medicine are often provided by conventional medicine physicians, integrative medicine was described as the combination of mainstream with complementary medicine, supposedly leading to synergistic therapeutic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>More patient-centered care might suggest a more integrative medicine approach that combines the best of conventional medicine with the best of complementary medicine.</s><s>However, because of their differing philosophies, historical development, and settings, merging conventional and complementary medicine can be very challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>It is necessary to understand the similarities and differences in both cultures to support a successful and sustainable integration.</s></p><p><s>In the business environment, when organizations merge, understanding cultural similarities and differences in these organizations-in other words, their individual corporate cultures-is a necessity.</s><s>Each organization has its own identity, personality and way of conducting its business, and these specific aspects make an organization unique.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Davenport (1998)</ref> describes corporate culture as "the DNA of an organization, invisible to the naked eye, but critical in shaping the character of the workplace" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Corporate culture is also the "collective programming of the mind" that distinguishes the members of one organization from another <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Cartwright and Cooper define corporate culture simply as "the way in which things get done within an organization" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, in other words: making people speak the same language.</s></p><p><s>With a merger, organizations have the opportunity to adapt quickly to new or changing markets by permitting the more rapid transformation of the organization than organic growth might allow <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>In economics, a merger is defined as "the combining of two or more entities into one, through a purchase acquisition or a pooling of interests" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The careful selection of merger partners is extremely important for success.</s><s>Not only must the acquirer consider the likelihood of success of combining the financial and strategic aspects of both organizations, it must also consider the likelihood of success of combining the corporate cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Corporate culture determines individuals' commitment, satisfaction, productivity and longevity with an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> because individuals tend to select organizations with which their own values are aligned <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>When an individual's values fit well with the corporate culture, a psychological bond is formed and is difficult to break <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is widely recognized that cultural differences between merger partners are one of the most common reasons for failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>Any aspect of disagreement may be a point of failure (e.g., communication problems within the team, high turnover) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A prominent example is the merger of Daimler-Benz with Chrysler.</s><s>This merger seemed to make sense from a business perspective, but the contrasting cultures have impeded the development of positive synergies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Daimler-Benz honors traditional hierarchy and methodical decision-making, whereas Chrysler stands for pragmatic adaptability, creativity and equal empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In general, two merging organizations need not necessarily have similar or the same corporate cultures, but they should be able to act together.</s><s>Therefore, two aspects are important: the degree to which the cultures are different and in which direction the cultural change should proceed <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>If the change proceeds in the direction of increasing individual freedom, the integration may be easier because the new culture might seem to be more appealing than the previous one <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the willingness of an employee to abandon his/her culture depends simultaneously on the consideration of that culture and on the attractiveness of the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Approaches for the degree and depth of combining two companies in a merger can vary.</s><s>The "confederation" approach combines organizations that work in parallel with no integration.</s><s>In the "linking" type, the organizations work together with no real integration.</s><s>The "absorption" type is when the acquired organization is fully absorbed by and becomes a part of the acquirer.</s><s>The acquired organization has to fully adopt the corporate culture of the acquirer; there is no creation of a new corporate culture.</s><s>The first approach, in which the creation of a new corporate culture is needed, combines the advantages of both organizations in the "best of both worlds" method.</s><s>The integration level is high, and therefore, a strong new corporate culture is needed to bind the two groups together <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the framework of corporate culture in business mergers seems to be suitable for applying to the mergers of conventional and complementary medicine into a new entity labeled "integrative medicine."</s><s>The aim of this project was to develop a theoretical model and practical steps that are based on business merger theories to facilitate the implementation of an integrative medicine department.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>We conducted a literature search on cultures in conventional and complementary medicine.</s><s>We searched Pubmed and the internet by combining the terms culture, philosophy, work style, work manner, patient-practitioner relationship, time devoted to the patient with integrative medicine, complementary medicine, alternative medicine and CAM.</s><s>Furthermore, we asked medical anthropologists for additional literature that is not available in Pubmed (e.g., books).</s><s>The literature for the narrative review was analyzed with a focus on extracting information on various aspects of culture, such as the philosophy, work style, and characteristics of the physician/practitioner-patient relationships in conventional and complementary medicine.</s><s>The results of the literature search on culture in conventional and complementary medicine were successively condensed and are summarized in the results section and in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s>We also conducted a literature search on merger and corporate culture theories using the terms role of corporate culture in merger, corporate culture in merger, professional culture, reasons for merger failures, merger of medical traditions, and fusion or merger of conventional and complementary medicine.</s><s>From that search, only the model "15 behavioral dimensions of organizational culture" from the Schweiger-Larkey-Group, known as SLOCI, was identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>We contacted Schweiger as well as Kummer as international well-known experts in the field and invited them to participate in this project.</s><s>According to their knowledge, no other models relevant to our research aim have been published.</s><s>The SLOCI dimensions are targeted Table <ref type="table">1</ref> Major cultural differences in corporate philosophy between conventional and complementary medicine</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Using an innovative and unique approach, we developed a model that can be used to support the development of a successful and sustainable integrative medicine department in a clinic.</s><s>By understanding cultural differences and creating a new, strong corporate culture aligned with the integrative medicine philosophy, teams from different backgrounds can be unified (conventional and complementary medicine).</s><s>This model is accompanied by a checklist that identifies sequential steps and clarifies accountability during the process.</s></p><p><s>With the model and checklist, we together knowledge and experience from different fields, including business and medicine.</s><s>Considering the uniqueness, novelty, and interdisciplinarity of our project, we were not able to draw upon previous results.</s><s>Our project benefitted from the combination of different methodologies, including literature analyses, expert discussions, and case studies, which allowed us to control for the model's validity and feasibility during the development process.</s><s>Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the approach can also be seen as a limitation because there are no comparison models.</s><s>Culture is a very broad and heterogeneous field, and we summarized the literature in a narrative review.</s><s>It is possible that a systematic review would have provided a broader picture.</s><s>Our model reflects this diversity and can be generally applied to different settings, including different countries with different health systems, as well as to different specialties in conventional and complementary medicine.</s><s>Pragmatically, we assumed that the cultural differences between conventional and complementary medicine were fundamental factors in developing an integrative medicine department.</s><s>We must also be aware that in each hospital, different kinds of cultures and subcultures already exist, including national, corporate, or professional cultures.</s><s>These cultures are independent but still related.</s></p><p><s>We have chosen to compare the cultures of both complementary and conventional medicine with the cultures of two different organizations.</s><s>We selected corporate culture as a starting point because it, like conventional and complementary medicine, can be explored as the way of doing things in the workplace regardless of one's hierarchical position or profession.</s><s>The dimensions of the model are not exhaustive, but for simplicity's sake, we focused on the dimensions that in our case studies had posed the greatest challenges during integration.</s><s>In our case studies and model, we focused on Western culture.</s><s>We conducted case studies in two countries, the USA and Germany.</s><s>In the non-Western world, cultural aspects may be different.</s><s>Our aim was to analyze the merger of the corporate cultures in conventional and complementary medicine in order to understand the decisive levers for creating an integrative medicine service in a clinic.</s><s>This kind of merger does not map perfectly to what happens in business when two organizations merge to one.</s><s>Nevertheless, our focus was on the corporate culture aspect within mergers, and this fits also on a theoretical level because, as the literature revealed, differences in both cultures can make combining the two medicines difficult.</s><s>In the present study, the definition of merger serves not only as a metaphor but also as a description of a social process.</s><s>The teamwork between merger partners is decisive for the success of the merger and dependent upon the compatibility of each individual corporate culture with the other.</s><s>Complementary and conventional medicine teams complement each other.</s><s>In the literature, conventional medicine is described as reductionist <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> and disease-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, whereas complementary medicine is described as more holistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> and patient-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and even more extreme views on both conventional medicine and complementary medicine exist.</s><s>In reality, the cultural aspects of both conventional and complementary medicine will vary according to the setting, the country and the profession.</s></p><p><s>Two key points of our model are communication and resources.</s><s>Many different types of communication are implicated: internal (within the integrative medicine team, with the management or integration team) and external (with the patient, with other departments of the clinic, with the public).</s><s>The most difficult communication will center on the merger and integration itself.</s><s>Therefore, we recommend creating an integration team <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> and maintaining continuous communication regarding merger goals with all stakeholders.</s><s>A new shared language should be created through common efforts of both merger partners in order to avoid the Tower of Babel effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In order to empower the integration team to succeed, the staff should be composed of knowledgeable, open-minded, stable, friendly, respected and respectful, committed, motivated, enthusiastic and realistic members.</s><s>Such a team is able to exploit the model and the checklist to their full advantages and create a successful and sustainable combination of conventional and complementary medicine within a clinic.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>We have used an innovative interdisciplinary approach to contribute to more comprehensive and efficient patient care.</s><s>We brought together knowledge and findings from corporate culture in business mergers, literature analyses and two case studies that we developed.</s><s>In doing so, we demonstrated that there are major cultural differences between conventional and complementary medicine.</s><s>To bridge these differences and to suggest strategies for perfectly integrating the best of both medicines, we finalized a theoretical model and a practical checklist.</s><s>These allow for the systematic development of a sustainable integrative medicine service or clinic that combines conventional and complementary medicine at a high-quality level.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Theoretical model of the key aspects of a merger.</s><s>The model is based on four overall aspects: culture, strategy, organizational tools and outcomes, with a primary focus on culture.</s><s>The model should help to foster the integration of conventional and complementary medicine by bridging between the two cultures.</s><s>Source: Schweiger Larkey Group: The SLOCI 15 Dimensions [http://www.sloci.com/sloci/sloci-dimensions.htm]</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,63.84,464.71,467.66,229.78" type="bitmap" /></figure>
