<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The main finding of this study is that the presence of visual feedback likely affected power output in the initial stage of the intermittent AnWT6x6, but did not affect power output when subjects were already fatigued during the final stage.</s><s>The middle stages of the test (i.e., stages 2 through 5, where both groups had visual feedback) resulted in similar power outputs for both conditions, indicating that the greater power output in the 1st stage of CVF did not result in accumulated residual fatigue later during the test.</s><s>Therefore, it may be warranted to include constant visual feedback during the intermittent AnWT6x6 if aiming to determine peak power output in hockey players.</s></p><p><s>Firstly, it cannot be determined whether visual feedback during the initial stage "increased" performance or if the absence of visual feedback "decreased" performance.</s><s>The nature of the experimental design only allows for the conclusion that the presence of visual feedback had a moderate-to-large effect on power output during the initial stage of the AnWT6x6.</s><s>This result is in agreement with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, where visual feedback resulted in greater peak power output compared to no visual feedback.</s><s>In summary, the isokinetic knee flexion and extension <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, leg press <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and AnWT testing should be provided with visual feedback to ensure greatest force or power output.</s><s>This testing consistency might be justified by previously reported association between power output observed between AnWT and isokinetic knee flexion/extension (r = 0.71 to 0.86) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it seems to be appropriate that tests with similar output are sensitive for the same kind of test condition (i.e., presence of visual feedback).</s></p><p><s>Although the data of the present study indicate that visual feedback may play a role in the beginning of the AnWT6x6, power output during the final stage was not different between protocols and effect sizes were negligible to small (compared to the moderate-to-large effect during the initial stage).</s><s>Therefore, it can be concluded that the presence of visual feedback may not play a role in the presence of central and peripheral fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, the purpose of this study was to determine whether visual feedback affects AnWT performance, not to investigate the mechanisms of the effect.</s><s>However, future studies may aim to investigate the relationship between central and peripheral fatigue and the ability of visual feedback to affect performance.</s></p><p><s>The peak power output relative to BM in our participants (PPkg = 15.82 ± 1.45 W•kg −1 ) was from about 15% <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> to roughly 30% greater <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> than those reported in previous studies.</s><s>It is possible that greater relative PP values occurred due to a greater resistance used in the present study (10% of BM compared to 7.5%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, it has been shown that performing the AnWT in a standing position results in greater power outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, indicating that the standing position may have played a role in the greater power outputs of the present study compared to other studies where subjects were not standing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>A final possible explanation for the greater power outputs in the present study may be that PP was calculated using a rolling 1 s window, which may provide greater PP values than methods utilizing longer timeframes such as 5 s <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</s><s>Although absolute and relative PP values were greater in our subjects, the absolute and relative power decrements were similar to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The PPDec, PPkgDec and PPFFMDec of about 45% in our subjects using the AnWT6x6 is similar to the power decrement reported in previous studies using the traditional AnWT 30 s protocol (49%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</s><s>Although the AnWT is often used to determine PP output, such a basic measure can be recorded in as few as 6 s <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>In ice hockey, PP may be important, but the ability to repeatedly perform movements with maximal power and short recovery times (i.e., multiple sprints while on the ice) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> may be of greater importance.</s><s>As this is the first study to our knowledge to use an intermittent AnWT, it can be used as a benchmark for subsequent intermittent AnWT tests, showing that intermittent Wingate testing may have a similar decrease power output compared to a single 30 s bout, but can provide additional information regarding a player's intermittent capacity.</s></p><p><s>Visual feedback might be used to improve exercise technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> in runners or to increase performance in the cycling aerobic test <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> in the untrained population.</s><s>The results of the present study suggest that visual feedback may increase anaerobic performance in well-trained male athletes who are highly familiarized with the test protocol.</s><s>Therefore, the application of visual feedback is recommended for various tests in various populations.</s></p></div>
