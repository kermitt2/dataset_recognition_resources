target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and &lt;50nmol/l in others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, is common among pregnant women and has become a global public health problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>During pregnancy, the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D) concentrations increase by 100% or more <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, it has been shown that production of 20-hydroxyvitamin D (20OHD) was higher than 25OHD in placenta <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>However, these hydroxyvitamin D metabolites are not routinely measured to reflect vitamin D pool of the body.</s><s>Serum 25OHD which is the major circulating form of vitamin D, is currently used as the best determinant of vitamin D status <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Associations have been found between serum 25OHD with various pregnancy outcomes such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hyperglycaemia and caesarean section (S1 Table <ref type="table">)</ref>, but results have been inconclusive.</s></p><p><s>25OHD involves in glucose homeostasis via different mechanisms.</s><s>In its active form, it improves insulin sensitivity of the target cells (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>It also improves β-cell function <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, protects β-cell from immune attacks and reduces insulin resistant through immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Serum 25OHD has been shown to be inversely associated with maternal fasting glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and postprandial glucose concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> during pregnancy, but there are conflicting data with respect to the risk of developing GDM.</s><s>Some studies have suggested that low serum 25OHD was associated with GDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, while other studies found no significant associations with GDM <ref type="bibr"

has been shown that both skeletal and uterine smooth muscle contain vitamin D receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, with more recent data implicating 25OHD and regulation of contractile proteins in human uterine myometrial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The relationship of 25OHD with labour and delivery outcomes can thus be related to both muscle performance and uterine contraction.</s><s>Higher likelihood of caesarean delivery has been observed in pregnant women with low serum 25OHD concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, although this had not been the case in several other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) in United States found that serum 25OHD levels were inversely associated with diabetes risk in white, but not black populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>However, an Australian study reported no association between serum 25OHD and GDM risk in any ethnic subgroups <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>These studies between 25OHD, ethnicity and disease outcomes were mainly conducted in Western setting, but none have been designed to describe the association in a multi-ethnic Asian setting.</s></p><p><s>The Singapore Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study, consisting of mothers from three ethnic groups, namely the Chinese, Malays and Indians, provides a unique opportunity to evaluate pregnancy outcomes associated with 25OHD status across ethnic groups with the absence of seasonal variation in sunlight exposure.</s><s>This study aimed to examine the association of maternal 25OHD status in the second trimester of pregnancy with plasma glucose concentrations, risks of GDM and caesarean section.</s><s>We hypothesized that 25OHD inadequacy was associated with higher fasting glucose (FG) and 2-hour postprandial glucose (2HPPG) concentrations, increased risks of GDM and

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p><s>Women recruited in their first trimester returned to the hospitals at 26-28 weeks' gestation for a follow-up visit.</s><s>Detailed interviews were conducted in the clinics at recruitment and at 26-28 weeks' gestation.</s><s>Data on socioeconomic status, educational attainment, personal health, dietary supplement intake, smoking status and physical activity were collected.</s><s>Smoking exposure was defined as current smoking or exposed to second hand smoke on a daily basis.</s><s>After delivery, data on mode of delivery and complications were retrieved from the hospital case notes by trained health personnel.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical activity assessment</head><p><s>Three types of physical activity were assessed, including light-moderate, moderate and vigorous intensity activities.</s><s>Total level of physical activity was computed from the summation of the duration (in minutes) and frequency (days) of these three types of activity.</s><s>Physical activity was expressed in metabolic equivalents (MET-minutes/week) and classified as not highly active (&lt;3000 MET-minutes/week) and highly active (!3000 MET minutes/week) levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anthropometric measurement</head><p><s>Maternal height was measured with a stadiometer (Seca 206, Hamburg, Germany).</s><s>Maternal weight was based on body weight measured at first antenatal clinic visit during the first trimester of pregnancy.</s><s>Body mass index (BMI) was computed from the formula: weight (kg)/ height (m 2 ).</s><s>Because obesity is a risk factor of low 25OHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, GDM and caesarean section <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, we therefore categorized the continuous values of BMI for analysis.</s><s>The BMI was classified according to World Health Organization ranges: underweight &lt;18.5kgm -2 , normal weight 18.5-24.9kgm -</s><s> , overweight 25-29.9kgm -</s><s> and obese !30.0kgm -2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s></p></div>

their relatively higher rates of 25OHD deficiency (25OHD&lt;50nmol/l) compared to other ethnic groups.</s><s>However, the contrasting lack of any inverse association of 25OHD with FG in Indian women
