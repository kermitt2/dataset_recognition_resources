<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PGBD5 expression is sufficient to confer susceptibility to inhibition of DNA damage repair signaling</head><p><s>Based on the finding that cells expressing PDBD5 are dependent on active NHEJ DNA damage repair and signaling, we hypothesized that PGBD5 expression might render cells susceptible to pharmacological inhibition of DNA damage signaling.</s><s>To test this idea, we used primary human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells immortalized with telomerase that allow the investigation of DNA damage response in genomically stable, nontransformed human cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>We reasoned that specific PGBD5-dependent DNA damage response requirements may be identified by comparative analysis of growth and survival of RPE cells expressing GFP-PGBD5, as compared to GFP control and its catalytically inactive GFP-PGBD5 D168A/D194A/D386A mutant.</s><s>This mutant is expressed equally to wild-type PGBD5, as assessed by Western immunoblotting, and physically associates with chromatin, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), but does not support DNA transposition in reporter assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>To minimize the possible contribution of secondary effects of PGBD5 expression due to its induction of mutagenic DNA rearrangements and cell transformation, we used cells for experiments immediately after transgene transduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus, we screened a panel of commercially available inhibitors of DNA damage signaling in their ability to selectively interfere with the growth and survival of RPE cells expressing GFP-PGBD5 as compared to wild-type or control transgene expressing cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> &amp; S1, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>In particular, we observed that the ATR-and ATM-selective kinase inhibitors AZD6738 and KU60019 exhibited more than 20-fold and 5-fold enhanced activity, respectively, against RPE cells expressing GFP-PGBD5 as compared GFP control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Consistent with the notion that tolerance of PGBD5 DNA nuclease activity requires active DNA repair in cells, mutation of the aspartate catalytic triad (D168A, D194A, D386A) thought to catalyze phosphodiester bond hydrolysis during transposase-induced DNA rearrangements <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, completely abrogated the enhanced susceptibility of RPE cells upon PGBD5 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed that the activity of AZD6738 is at least in part due to its selective inhibition of ATR as compared to ATM <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>, insofar as Atm −/− and Atr S/S MEFs exhibited respectively increased and diminished susceptibilities to AZD6738, in agreement with the known relationship between ATM and ATR kinase signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> (IC 50 = 0.023 and 2.0 μM, respectively, as compared to 0.36 μM for wild-type control; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>Thus, PGBD5-dependent effects may be explained by the selective inhibition of DNA damage signaling by ATR-and ATM-selective AZD6738 and KU60019, respectively.</s><s>Lack of PGBD5-dependent effects of other albeit potent DNA damage signaling inhibitors is presumably related to their respective selectivity profiles, such as for example AZ20 which potently inhibits ATM, ATR and mTOR, and VE-822 (VX-970) which inhibits both ATR and ATM kinases (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Importantly, as with the functional genetic requirements of DNA repair and DNA damage signaling induced by PGBD5 expression in MEFs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we found that active DNA damage signaling blocked by AZD6738 is also required for the growth and survival of PGBD5-expressing human RPE cells (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D-H</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, we found that RPE cells expressing GFP-PGBD5, but not those expressing GFP or inactive mutant GFP-PGBD5, exhibited significantly increased DNA damage upon treatment with AZD6738, as measured γH2AX staining analysis (p = 0.040, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D &amp; G</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, we observed significantly increased TUNEL labeling in RPE cells expressing GFP-PGBD5 upon treatment with AZD6738, whereas cells expressing control GFP or the catalytically inactive GFP-PGBD5 mutant exhibited unperturbed steady-state background TUNEL levels (p = 5.6 x 10 −6 , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E &amp; H</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the notion that wild-type PGBD5 is actively inducing DSBs in cells, we observed significantly increased TUNEL levels even in the absence of AZD6738 treatment, an effect that was completely abolished by the mutation of its putative nuclease catalytic triad (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E &amp; H</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, TUNEL accumulation upon PGBD5 expression and AZD6738 treatment was predominantly observed in G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>In accordance with the accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage upon AZD6738 treatment in PGBD5-expressing cells, we observed significantly increased levels of apoptosis, as measured by caspase 3 cleavage, in cells expressing GFP-PGBD5, as compared to those expressing its inactive mutant or GFP control (p = 3.0e-4, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the lack of apparent effect of AZD6738 on TUNEL levels in S phase cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>), we confirmed that the PGBD5-specific susceptibility to AZD6738 was not immediately associated with DNA replication stress, as assessed by Western immunoblotting of phosphorylated RPA32 T21 and S4/8, as compared to the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin that predominantly induces DSBs during DNA replication in S phase (31) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>In agreement with this, RPE cells expressing GFP-PGBD5 did not show increased cell cycling as compared to cells expressing GFP control, as measured by 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>Lastly, in agreement with site-specific accumulation of DSBs (32), we observed mostly punctate in contrast to pan-nuclear γH2AX accumulation in PGBD5expressing cells treated with AZD6738 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Thus, PGBD5 expression is sufficient to confer specific susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibitors of DNA damage signaling such as AZD6738.</s></p></div>
