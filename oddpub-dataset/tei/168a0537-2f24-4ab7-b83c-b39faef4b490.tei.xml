<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective Health Horizon Questionnaire</head><p><s>The original version of the SHH-Q consisted of 32 items and was administered in the first cognitive session (see online suppl.</s><s>material, section 1; see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000441493</s><s>for all online suppl.</s><s>material).</s><s>After initial statistical analysis, two items were removed because they showed high loadings across factors (see online suppl.</s><s>material, section 2).</s><s>The SHH-Q is designed to measure individual differences in the self-reported future time perspective on engaging with novelty and enriched environments as well as subjective appraisals of bodily health and physical mobility in terms of years left for those activities.</s><s>In its final form, the SHH-Q consists of 30 items capturing four dimensions of subjective future time perspectives: (1) SHH-Q Novelty, which assesses novelty-oriented exploration (9 items); (2) SHH-Q Body, related to expectations regarding bodily fitness (9 items); (3) SHH-Q Work, related to occupational goals (5 items), and (4) SHH-Q Life Goals, asking about goals in life (3 items).</s></p><p><s>In addition, the SHH-Q contains four single items assessing life, independence, health, and disease expectancies, respectively, and one item assessing chronological age.</s><s>A typical item from the SHH-Q Novelty subscale is, 'Up to what age do you think you will be physically and mentally able to meet new people?'</s><s>The SHH-Q items are presented one by one on a computer screen, and are accompanied by a vector representation of the lifespan underneath, ranging from 10 years of age on the left to 110 years of age (see suppl.</s><s>material, section 1).</s><s>Prior to filling out the SHH-Q, a detailed and standardized verbal instruction was given to each participant.</s><s>Participants were asked to respond to each item by shifting the mouse, whose position was set at their current chronological age, towards the maximum future age at which they estimated they would mentally and physically be able to perform the activity in question.</s><s>Responses to items were adjusted by calculating the difference between individuals' actual age and their estimated future ages, and scaling by the ratio of actual age to maximum lifetime (defined as 110 years).</s><s>The goal of this adjustment is to assign higher SHH-Q scores to older individuals reporting a difference between estimated age and chronological age that is identical to the difference reported by younger individuals.</s><s>Specifically, the subjective time horizon is computed as the difference between estimated age and chronological age, multiplied by the ratio of current age over the assumed maximum age of 110 years.</s><s>For instance, for a participant aged 75 years (chronological age) who responded to an item by moving the cursor to age 90 (estimated age), the time perspective would correspond to 15 years and would be scored as: (75/110) × (90-75) = 10.2 age-adjusted years.</s><s>In contrast, for a participant aged 65 years who responded to the same item by moving the cursor to age 80, thus providing the same time difference between estimated and chronological age of 15 years, the score on this item would be 8.86 age-adjusted years.</s><s>The adjustment reflects the assumption that a time perspective of 15 years expressed at age 75 extends expected vitality into an older age than a time perspective of 15 years expressed at age 65.</s><s>All analyses reported in this article are based on age-adjusted scores.</s><s>We see it as a major strength of the SHH-Q that it provides subjective estimates in years rather than in an arbitrary metric (e.g. a Likert scale).</s><s>We acknowledge that the SHH-Q items may serve as a resource for different types of analyses in addition to the age-adjusted scores used here.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Cognitive Functioning</head><p><s>The cognitive battery of BASE-II covers key cognitive abilities measured by 21 tasks (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> ).</s><s>Here, we focus on three main cognitive abilities: episodic memory (EM; Scene Encoding, Verbal Learning and Memory Test, Face-Profession task, Object Location task), working memory (WM; Spatial Updating, Letter Updating, Number-N-Back), and fluid intelligence (Gf; Practical Problems, Figural Analogies, Letter Series).</s><s>Furthermore, for each of the three ability domains, the chosen tasks varied in procedures and content, consisting of items that relate to verbal, numerical, or figural-spatial information (cf.</s><s>online suppl.</s><s>material, section 3).</s></p><p><s>The FTP Scale We used the 10-item scale of the FTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> , which was collected within the psychosocial assessment administered between the two cognitive sessions.</s><s>Participants indicated the degree to which they agreed with an item on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (very untrue for me) to 7 (very true for me).</s><s>The scale composite consists of the unit-weighted mean over all items, and lower scores indicate a limited future time horizon.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective Health Variables</head><p><s>We used two latent constructs indicating objective health, namely, physical fitness and metabolic functioning.</s><s>Physical fitness represents one's state of general muscle strength, musculoskeletal capacity, and general vitality, and has been repeatedly indexed with grip strength and forced expiratory volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> .</s><s>In this study, we used continuous information on grip strength and forced expiratory volume as indicators of physical fitness.</s><s>Grip strength was measured with a dynamometer (Smedley, ranging from 0 to 100 kg).</s><s>Participants started with the dominant followed by the nondominant hand, and were asked 'to grasp with as much force as possible'.</s><s>Three measurements for each hand were taken, with the highest value of each hand being selected for later analysis.</s><s>Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) was used as an overall indicator of lung function.</s><s>We only analyzed spirometric measurements with sufficient measurement quality, fully in line with standard procedures.</s><s>We would like to point out that other studies report around 30-50% data exclusion due to insufficient quality, following the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS; e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>Metabolic health was defined as another construct in the domain of objective health.</s><s>To define this construct, we combined a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which tend to cooccur due to overlapping etiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> .</s><s>Metabolic risk factors have been shown to have implications on health-related, cognitive, neurobiological, social, and subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> .</s><s>Specifically, metabolic status (MetS) was indexed by four continuous indicators, namely trunk fat, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides and glucose serum concentrations, the latter three of which were ascertained by enzymatic assays (cobas HDL-C plus 3rd generation, cobas TG, and cobas GLUC2; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).</s><s>Given that the associations between individual differences in MetS and cognition are not restricted to individuals who have been diagnosed with metabolic dysfunction, we see it as a strength of the present approach that our measure of MetS is dimensional rather than categorical and thus applicable to the entire sample (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>The SHH-Q and the FTP scale (among other psychosocial measures) were assessed in close temporal proximity to the cognitive assessments.</s><s>In contrast, the objective health variables were collected about 1 year prior to cognitive testing (mean time difference in years = 1.2 years; SD = 0.80).</s><s>To control for individual differences in time elapsing between measurements, we included the time interval as a control variable in the analyses.</s><s>Given our interest in individual variations of future time left, individual items on which participants responded below their actual age (resulting in a negative future time perspective) or individual items on which they responded at their actual age (zero future time perspective) were set to missing.</s><s>Including these two types of responses, the proportion of missing responses for each item ranged from 2 to 9%.</s><s>Moreover, when more than 10% of responses of a given individual were missing, suggesting that the participant did not comply with instructions, the case was deleted from the data set, resulting in deletion of 79 cases.</s><s>For all analyses, missing data did not exceed 15.7% for most of the variables, except spirometric measurements where data needed to be excluded due to an insufficient level of quality (see Methods and online suppl.</s><s>table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Thus, when conducting SEM analyses, we used full information maximum likelihood (FIML).</s><s>FIML yields unbiased parameter estimates and standard errors under the assumption that data are missing at random.</s><s>The method minimizes the -2 log likelihood function for each individual based on the variables that are present, and, in this sense, makes optimal use of all available data.</s></p><p><s>(Robust) maximum likelihood estimation was used for parameter estimation, which assumes that data do not deviate substantially from a multivariate normal distribution 1 .</s><s>The measures of trunk fat, triglycerides, and HDL were log-transformed because they were skewed to the left.</s></p><p><s>Factorial Structure of the SHH-Q Using Mplus v6.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> , we performed CFA to test the hypothesized four-factor structure of the SHH-Q.</s><s>The initial model (model A) specified four intercorrelated latent variables, each with unique loadings from the corresponding SHH-Q items ( fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 a</ref>).</s><s>All items loaded reliably on the postulated latent factors (standardized loadings &gt;0.500, p &lt;

(b) MetS models, and (c) physical fitness models.</s><s>To allow unbiased comparisons between SHH-Q scores and FTP scores in this set of analyses, the four SHH-Q components were represented by unit-weighted composite scores, rather than as latent factors.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The purpose of this study was to introduce the SHH-Q as a new self-report measure of future time perspectives pertaining to specific aspects of an active lifestyle.</s><s>We were able to validate that the SHH-Q consists of four correlated but distinct subscales: Novelty, Body, Work, and Life Goals.</s><s>The superior fit of the four-factor model relative to three-factor and one-factor models shows that these four subscales constitute distinct dimensions of future time perspectives.</s></p><p><s>The FTP scale correlated moderately with each of the four dimensions of the SHH-Q.</s><s>However, in contrast to the SHH-Q, the FTP scale did not show any statistically reliable associations with objective measures of cognition or somatic health.</s><s>This finding underscores the superior content validity of the SHH-Q as a novel instrument for assessing individuals' time perspectives on being physically fit and cognitively active in the future.</s></p><p><s>The SHH-Q items related to novelty versus bodily fitness formed two separate subscales, and these subscales showed differential associations with objective measures of memory and health.</s><s>Specifically, SEM regression analyses revealed that higher scores on the SHH-Q Novelty dimension were associated with higher EM performance, whereas higher scores on the SHH-Q Body dimension were associated with better MetS.</s><s>Thus, the self-perceived time perspectives on being cognitively and physically active show domain-specific, selective associations with concurrently assessed markers of cognition and health.</s><s>Clearly, a unidimensional omnibus measure of future time perspective such as the FTP is not well suited to capture these differential associations.</s></p><p><s>The association between the Novelty dimension of future time perspectives and EM functioning is conceptually important, given that EM contributes to exploring novel environments (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> ).</s><s>This association certainly merits further investigation at behavioral and neural levels of analysis.</s><s>In neural terms, the goal-directed and motivated exploration of environments is assumed to depend on brain circuitry that includes medial temporal structures, such as the hippocampus, and also the basal ganglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> .</s><s>Several components of this network show age-related decline in normal aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref> , and we would like to propose that this decline might narrow the subjective experience of future time horizons.</s><s>Obviously, structural and functional brain imaging data are needed to corroborate this claim.</s><s>One prediction emanating from our line of reasoning is that the Novelty dimension of the SHH-Q is related to the functional and structural Unlike SHH-Q Novelty, the SHH-Q Body dimension showed unique associations with metabolic health status.</s><s>This correlational dissociation suggests that imagining oneself exploring novel environments may differ in important ways from imagining oneself as being physically active.</s><s>Physical activity can be carried out in a familiar environment; hence, its future time perspective may be more strongly rooted in current bodily health than in the ability to simulate the future.</s><s>Exploring these differences in neural and somatic correlates in greater detail is an important avenue for future research.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>The present study has a number of limitations.</s><s>First and foremost, its results are based on cross-sectional observations that do not provide direct information about individual differences in change.</s><s>Second, the discriminant validity of the Work and Life Goals subscales remains to be examined more closely in future analyses.</s><s>Specifically, the lack of significant associations of the Work and Life Goals subscales with measures of health and cognition requires further investigation, and the putative associations of these two subscales with socioeconomic and social factors, which were not fully explored in the present study, need to be examined in greater detail.</s></p><p><s>Third, for practical reasons, the health variables included in the present study had all been collected more than a year before the cognitive assessment and administration of the SHH-Q took place.</s><s>It is likely that this time lag reduced the strength of associations between the SHH-Q subscales and the factors of somatic health.</s></p><p><s>Fourth, psychological research has shown that future time perspectives are closely linked to individual differences in motivation and goal pursuit (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref> ).</s><s>These associations, which would help to get a better sense of the psychological mechanisms involved in responding to SHH-Q items, need to be examined more carefully in future work.</s></p><p><s>In the present analyses, responses to SHH-Q items that implied a zero or negative time perspective were set to missing, primarily to avoid a bimodal distribution of response scores at the item level.</s><s>However, such responses may be of interest in their own right, given that the respondent may express the view that the time horizon for the activity in question is about to end right now (i.e. a zero score) or has expired a number of years ago (i.e. a negative score).</s><s>Relating these responses to motivational variables may help to shed light on this issue.</s></p><p><s>Finally, it needs to be kept in mind that BASE-II involves a convenience sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</s><s>As a partial remedy to this limitation, BASE-II has been linked to data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), which uses a far more representative sampling scheme than BASE-II.</s><s>Systematic comparisons of BASE-II data with SOEP data allow for estimates of selection bias, and offer statistical tools for bias correction.</s><s>As research with the SHH-Q unfolds in the context of BASE-II and in other studies, issues of selective sampling, replicability, and generalizability need to be addressed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>The results of the present study indicate that the future time perspectives of older adults are not unidimensional.</s><s>Instead, people differ in the expected temporal extension of activities related to novelty, bodily fitness, occupational goals as well as overall goals in life.</s><s>The SHH-Q captures these four dimensions of individuals' future time perspective in a psychometrically valid manner.</s><s>Future research needs to explore the links of each of these four facets of future time perspective to behavior, specific aspects of brain integrity, and bodily health, and the differential modulation of these links by socioeconomic factors.</s><s>In particular, longitudinal observations and experimental interventions are needed to probe the psychological mechanisms underlying the construction of future time perspectives, and the embedding of these mechanisms into biological and social systems of influence.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1. a A simplified illustration of CFA results (model A).</s><s>Fourfactor solution of the SHH-Q providing best fit.</s><s>Latent factor structure of the SHH-Q.</s><s>Novelty and exploration perspective, Novelty (9 items); fitness perspective, Body (9 items); work-related perspective, Work (4 items); overall life goals and aims, Goals (3 items).</s><s>Numbers next to single-headed arrows represent significant regression coefficients, and numbers next to double-headed arrows represent significant standardized correlations.</s><s>b Model of SHH-Q subscales regressed on cognitive abilities.</s><s>Predictive validity of the SHH-Q for cognition.</s><s>SHH-Q components are represented as unit-weighted composites (squares).</s><s>Cognitive abilities are represented as latent factors (circles), and represent EM, WM, and Gf.</s><s>Numbering of arrows as in a.
