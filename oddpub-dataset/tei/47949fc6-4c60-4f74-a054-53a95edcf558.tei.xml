Since myocardial fibrosis is a key feature of HCM, collagen metabolism and turnover may have an impact on myocardial hemodynamics and remodeling, and ultimately, prognosis.</s><s>Sarcomere-mutation carriers with overt HCM, and importantly, mutation carriers without LVH have higher serum levels of C-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1CP), a marker of collagen synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, relative to controls.</s><s>This pro-fibrotic state may represent an important risk marker.</s><s>Moreover, sarcomere mutations may render the cardiomyocyte more susceptible to injury, including through ischemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, measures of myocardial injury and wall stress may be important markers of risk for SCD and HF.</s></p><p><s>HCMR was designed as the first prospective multinational registry to identify novel prognostic markers in HCM including CMR markers of fibrosis, genetic markers, and biomarkers.</s><s>In this way, risk stratification including decisions on ICD implantation and/or HF prevention or treatment may be substantially improved and potential targets for diseasemodifying therapeutic intervention using existing or novel drug therapy may be demonstrated..</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</head><p><s>Patients included are ages 18-65 with an established diagnosis of HCM defined as unexplained LVH (wall thickness &gt;15cm) without cavity dilatation or a predisposing cause (hypertension, aortic stenosis, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Other causes of infiltrative/hypertrophic cardiomyopathies such as amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, Fabry disease, Danon disease, or Noonan's syndrome will be excluded.</s><s>Patients older than 65 are excluded as they have lower event rates related to HCM and more hypertensive heart disease, which can mimic the phenotypic presentation of LVH with or without LV outflow obstruction, and competing mortality risks, in particular from coronary artery disease and cancer.</s></p><p><s>Additional exclusion criteria are 1) prior septal myectomy or alcohol septal ablation, 2) prior myocardial infarction or known CAD 3) incessant ventricular arrhythmias, 4) inability to lie flat, 5) contraindication to CMR including pacemakers, defibrillators, intraocular metal, certain types of intracranial aneurysm clips, severe claustrophobia, and Stage IV/V chronic kidney disease, 6) diabetes mellitus with end organ damage, 7) pregnancy, or 8) inability to provide informed consent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Enrollment</head><p><s>2750 patients with an established or new diagnosis of HCM will be enrolled at a total of 41 sites in the U.S., Canada, and Europe (Tables <ref type="table">1 and 2</ref>) from April 2014 through June 2016.</s><s>The sites were chosen as experienced centers of excellence with focused care of HCM patients as well as state-of-the-art CMR capabilities.</s><s>Emphasis will be placed on recruiting across the risk spectrum (as judged by classical risk factors), including high-risk patients referred for ICD implantation as well as recruiting high percentages of minorities and women.</s><s>After signing consent, patients will have blood drawn for genetic and biomarker analysis and undergo CMR.</s><s>Data regarding baseline demographics and clinical variables will be gathered from clinical records including results of Holter monitoring and stress testing, as available.</s><s>Clinical echocardiographic data will be recorded including LV outflow tract gradient and Doppler variables.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>HCMR is planned as a natural history study of 2750 patients with clinically diagnosed In addition to baseline collection of demographic data and traditional clinical risk factors, markers from CMR, genotyping, and serum biomarkers will be assessed to understand the relationship between these risk markers and clinical outcome, providing novel insights into disease progression and risk.</s><s>This is the largest such prospective outcomes study ever performed in this disease.</s><s>The study is powered to identify risk markers (imaging, serum biomarkers, and genetic beyond standard clinical risk factors) that predict the primary endpoint, which will be cardiac death (including SCD and HF death), aborted SCD (appropriate discharge of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), and need for heart transplantation.</s><s>This study will enable development of a predictive model that will help to identify patients at risk as well as patients for future clinical trials to prevent SCD and HF.</s><s>In addition, it will identify surrogate endpoints to monitor treatment response in HCM.</s></p><p><s>The study was funded in July of 2013.</s><s>The first patient was enrolled in April 2014 and as of April 2015, 35 of 41 sites have been initiated and 457 patients enrolled (77% of projected at this time point).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>One limitation is that the primary endpoint used is a composite of cardiac death (SCD and HF death), aborted SCD including appropriate ICD firing, and need for heart transplantation.</s><s>These reflect a mix of different pathophysiologies.</s><s>However, they were chosen as they are the critical events determining serious morbidity and mortality in HCM patients.</s><s>We have combined them to ensure adequate power, but will also examine each individually as secondary endpoints.</s><s>To power the study using any one of these endpoints would be prohibitive in terms of the sample size.</s></p><p><s>Another limitation is that no validation set of patients is planned currently.</s><s>HCM patients with previously implanted ICD's are excluded from entry into the study.</s><s>These patients are high risk and could yield important data regarding appropriate ICD discharge, which could then be related to imaging, genetic and biomarker data.</s><s>However, in addition to safety concerns which can be overcome, imaging patients with devices would introduce artifacts that interfere with optimal CMR, especially for T1 mapping and LGE imaging.</s><s>We will capture data on newly enrolled patients who subsequently receive ICD's.</s><s>Another excluded patient group is that with either prior septal myectomy or alcohol septal ablation.</s><s>However, these subgroups have clearly altered myocardial pathology that changes their natural history for reasons that may be distinct from genetic drivers.</s><s>In addition, these prior therapies significantly alter CMR findings and biomarker results.</s><s>Patients who undergo these procedures after enrollment will be included and the procedures documented as secondary endpoints.</s></p><p><s>Different therapies chosen at different recruiting sites could introduce a bias.</s><s>However, the sites selected to participate are HCM centers of excellence and as such follow international guideline-based care.</s><s>To account for potential differences we will use a hierarchical model considering sites as a random effect.</s><s>Age 65 was chosen as an upper age limit.</s><s>This may reduce the incidence of HF events although most SCD events occur at a younger age.</s><s>This cutoff was used to increase the homogeneity of the cohort and reduce potential confounding events in an older population such as CAD.</s><s>Age will be a variable included in the statistical analysis as discussed above.</s><s>Including more than one member of a family might introduce a bias.</s><s>This will be taken into account in the statistical modeling.</s><s>In addition, only 5 members from any one family are allowed to enroll.</s></p></div>
