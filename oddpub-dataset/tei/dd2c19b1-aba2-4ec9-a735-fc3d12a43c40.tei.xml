<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Most of current treatments for breast cancer target primarily carcinoma cells, while the pro-carcinogenic actions of the tumor microenvironment were not taken into consider.</s><s>The fact that tumor-associated fibroblasts present some tumor features and are genetically stable and also different from normal fibroblasts make them to be important potential targets of anti-cancer therapy.</s><s>With the increasing understanding of epithelial-stromal biochemical interactions and molecular reciprocal heterotypic signaling, targeting breast carcinomas and/or stromal fibroblasts will be new strategies for the development of new therapeutic regimens.</s></p><p><s>Here we demonstrated for the first time the possibility to use Dovitinib to target the breast cancer motility through interference with tumor supportive effects of CAFs.</s><s>This might provide a complementary approach to conventional treatments that target the cancer cells themselves.</s><s>The multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dovitinib might become a promising agent for treatment of metastased breast cancer.</s></p><p><s>It has been reported that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with VEGF receptor inhibitors such as sunitinib led to enhanced distant metastasis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">25</ref></s><s>However, Dovitinib was shown to prevent lung metastasis in an in vivo xenograft model of hepatocellular carcinoma, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">26</ref> reduce the 4T1 tumor-induced lung metastases after long-term treatment and lymph node metastases in an orthotopic tumor model when treatment was initiated early enough. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">15</ref></s><s>In correlation with these in vivo data, we observed with our in vitro chamber assay that Dovitinib inhibited cell invasion of breast cancer dose-dependently.</s><s>Importantly, Dovitinib antagonized the enhanced cell invasion through co-culture of CAFs with MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for Dovitinib -inhibited metastasis was thereafter investigated.</s></p><p><s>Inflammation could be a causal role for many malignant diseases, including breast cancer.</s><s>The different inflammatory mediators that are involved in this disease include cells, cytokines and chemokines.</s><s>Of these, many studies have addressed the involvement and roles of the inflammatory chemokines CCL2 (MCP-1) and CCL5 (RANTES) in breast malignancy.</s><s>These two chemokines were shown to mediate many types of tumor-promoting cross-talks between the tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment: CCL2 and CCL5 which are expressed by cells of the tumor microenvironment osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells play a role in breast metastatic processes.</s><s>In addition, both chemokines act directly on the tumor cells to promote their promalignancy phenotype, by increasing their migratory and invasion-related properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref></s><s>In line with these knowledge, we observed in this study that the CCL2 and CCL5 were 2 of chemokines which were secreted from CAFs and mediated invasionpromoting effect of CAFs.</s><s>Inhibition of the secretion of CCL2 and CCL5 and thereby inhibiting the cross talk between CAFs and breast cancer cells might be one of the mechanisms by which Dovitinib blocked the invasion-promoting effect of CAFs.</s><s>Since we demonstrated clearly that Dovitinib application resulted in reduced CCL2 and CCL5 expression from the CAFs and the production in cell culture media with ELISA analysis and real time PCR.</s><s>Besides CCL2 and CCL5, other chemokines/cytokines may also be involved in this process including VEGF as shown by our data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Paracrine PDGF signaling is commonly observed in epithelial cancers, where it triggers stromal recruitment and may be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thereby affecting tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">27</ref></s><s>By using a genetically engineered mouse model of cervical carcinogenesis, pharmacological blockade of PDGF receptor signaling with the clinically approved kinase inhibitors slowed progression of premalignant cervical lesions in this model.</s><s>Inhibition of stromal PDGF receptors reduced proliferation and angiogenesis in cervical lesions through a mechanism involving suppression of expression of the angiogenic FGF2 and the epithelial cell growth factor FGF-7 by cancer-associated fibroblasts.</s><s>The possible functional model of PDGF and FGFs in epithelial tumors could be: PDGF expressed by cancerous epithelia evidently stimulate PDGFRexpressing stroma to up-regulate FGFs, promoting angiogenesis and epithelial proliferation, elements of a multi-cellular signaling network that elicits functional capabilities in the tumor microenvironment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">28</ref></s><s>Dovitinib has almost equal in vitro inhibitory activity against bFGF and PDFG receptor kinases with IC 50 values of approximately 10 nM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">29</ref></s><s>In accordance with the previous preclinical and clinical data, interruption of the PDGF signaling by Dovitinib led to reduced breast cancer cell invasion in our in vitro test model (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A and B</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, Dovitinib inhibited the PDGF-stimulated chemokine secretion of CAFs but had no significant effect in MDA-MB-231 cells, while it inhibited FGF2-stimulated chemokine secretion of both CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells significantly (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C-E and F-H</ref>).</s><s>Our result was supported by the reports that FGFR2 was identified as a breast cancer susceptibility gene by genome-wide association studies, especially in the mesenchymal and mesenchymal-like subtypes of triple-negative breast cancer. <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">30</ref></s><s>In connection with the data that mRNA expression of CCL5/CCL2 in CAFs was regulated by Dovitinib treatment, our data suggest the model for Dovitinib to block the supporting effect of CAFs to cell invasion: By inhibition of PDGF and FGF signaling in CAFs, Dovitinib indirectly downregulated the chemokines/cytokines secretion by CAFs, so that the supporting effect of CAFs on breast cancer cells was blocked and this resulted in the inhibition of cell invasion.</s></p><p><s>Some studies in the recent years indicate that chronological age of the tumor environment specifically fibroblasts is the most significant risk factor for human cancer development.</s><s>Mammary tumors grown in a Cav-1-deficient tumor microenvironment (an in vivo model of accelerated host aging) were more than five-fold larger than tumors grown in a wild-type microenvironment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">31</ref></s><s>In vitro experiments showed that the senescent fibroblasts generated by overexpressing CDK inhibitors, such as p16 (INK4A), p19 (ARF) or p21 (WAF1/CIP1) also dramatically promoted breast tumor growth without any comparable increases in tumor angiogenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">32</ref></s><s>PI3K/Akt/mTOR is one of the most critical pathways involved in the cell aging.</s><s>The prolonged activation of PI3K/ Akt/mTOR pathway in post-mitotic cells will convert quiescence or arrest into senescence.</s><s>In turn, aging cells due to their hyperfunctions cause diseases of aging including cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">33</ref></s><s>In this context, anti-tumor effect of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors was not only achieved by significantly inhibiting the tumor cell proliferation and division, but also by targeting tumor stroma, for example decreasing the stromal content, and reducing the levels of both vimentin and phospho-S6 (2 known markers for cell aging) in aging CAFs model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">31</ref></s><s>ecent publications demonstrated with in vitro experiments, mouse models and clinical trials that Dovitinib showed antitumor activity in FGFR-amplified breast cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">34</ref></s><s>The effect of Dovitinib observed included blocking breast cancer cell proliferation and growth, inhibiting tumor metastatic speed of breast cancer in vivo and in vitro models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">35</ref></s><s>Co-targeting of ErbB receptors enhanced those effect of Dovitinib, since this 2 receptor tyrosine kinases have same downstream signaling PI3K/Akt/ mTOR and the anti-tumor effect resulted from the blockade of receptor tyrosine kinases by Dovitinib was shown mostly via PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">35</ref></s><s>However, most of these investigations were focused on the effect of Dovitinib on tumor cells itself.</s><s>We demonstrated for the first time that the inhibition effect of Dovitinib on the breast cancer metastasis is also possibly contributed by its inhibition effect on PI3K/Akt/ mTOR signaling in CAFs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>This notion was further supported by the experiment that pre-treatment of CAFs with the combination of PI3K/Akt inhibitor Ly294002 or mTOR inhibitor RAD001 with Dovitinib resulted in additive invasion inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>We provide a new evidence for the increasingly accepted view that both cancer and aging share the activation of a common signaling pathway, and targeting this pathway directly or indirectly will retard breast cancer progression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">33,</ref><ref type="bibr"

cancer cell invasion by interruption of the breast cancer cells-CAFs interaction.</s><s>This is the first study to show that multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors exert effects on CAFs by interfering with their secretion of chemokines and growth factors which are crucial for tumor invasion and metastasis.</s><s>We are the first to find the phospho-Akt expression in CAFs was correlated with the capacity of Dovitinib to promote cell invasion.</s><s>Treatment with Dovitinib in combination with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitors Ly294002 or RAD001 resulted in additive inhibition of cell invasion.</s><s>Targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling of CAFs will be a complementary way for breast cancer therapy and requires more research.</s></p></div>
