<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Reduced stromal Hh signalling in murine colonic tumours.</s><s>To induce colonic tumours in mice, we employed a chemical model based on injection of the mutagenic agent azoxymethane (AOM), followed by repeated oral treatment with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) to induce epithelial damage and subsequent colitis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Tumours in this model recapitulate central aspects of human CRCs as they consistently exhibit mutations in the genes for adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) or catenin b1 (Ctnnb1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , and, less frequently, in Kras <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>We consider this model particularly well suited to our purposes, as it can be combined readily with Cre-LoxP models to modify epithelial and mesenchymal Hh signalling, and because tumours arise specifically in the colon but not in the small intestine.</s></p><p><s>To assess downstream Hh signalling activity, we first subjected Gli1 reporter mice harbouring a b-galactosidase knock-in to Gli1 (Gli1 lacZ/ þ mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ), to AOM/DSS treatment, and then visualized Gli1 expression with whole-mount X-gal staining.</s><s>Although non-malignant mucosa stained strongly, X-gal staining was weak to absent in AOM/DSS-induced tumours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>).</s><s>Histological analysis revealed Gli1 expression exclusively in the stroma and reduced X-gal staining in the tumours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c,d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed reduced Gli1 expression in tumours from wild-type (wt) mice, with a congruent reduction of the Hh targets, Hhip and Gli2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>).</s><s>Remarkably, expression of the receptor, Ptch1, and its homologue, Ptch2, as well as the main intestinal ligand, Ihh, was dissociated from attenuated downstream Hh signalling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>), whereas all tumours demonstrated increased Wnt activity, as expression of the Wnt targets, Axin2 and Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) was upregulated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>).</s><s>RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) confirmed that downregulation of stromal Gli1 can occur despite high Ihh expression in the adjacent tumour cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Given that Hh downstream signalling in the intestine is exclusively stromal <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , the reduced expression of downstream Hh targets could be the result of a reduction in the number of stromal cells.</s><s>To explore this possibility, we used immunofluorescence (IF) to stain for the intermediate filaments desmin, vimentin and a-smooth muscle actin simultaneously.</s><s>This marker combination covers the majority of normal and cancer-associated noninflammatory stromal cells, for which no specific single marker exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>However, we saw no differences in the amount of stromal cells between normal mucosa and adjacent tumours, indicating that stromal cell loss is not the reason for diminished expression of Hh downstream targets (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a-c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of b-catenin in tumours from Gli1 lacZ/ þ mice revealed its nuclear translocation in areas of low stromal Gli1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1g</ref>), substantiating a model in which the stromal downstream Hh signal is diminished in areas of high epithelial Wnt activity.</s><s>In line with this, we found that the expression of p-Smads1/5-markers of epithelial differentiation driven by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling that are highly expressed in differentiated enterocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> -correlated spatially with stromal Gli1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Hence, colonic tumour development in the AOM/DSS model is unexpectedly associated with a diminution in the stromal Hh response.</s><s>To explore Hh expression in a different colon cancer model, we probed RNA-sequencing data from tumours in which Apc activity is regulated by a doxycycline-dependent short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data set GSE67186 and ref. 21).</s><s>We found that these non-inflammatory colon tumours recapitulated the expression pattern of the AOM/DSS model, in that expression of the downstream Hh targets, Gli1, Gli2, as well as Gli3, was reduced significantly and was dissociated from expression of the ligands, Ihh (unchanged) and Shh (increased), as well as the receptor Ptch1 (increased) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Increased tumour burden upon diminished Hh signalling.</s><s>In the murine colon, Ihh messenger RNA expression exceeds that of Shh by several orders of magnitude (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and refs 22,23), and an Shh conditional knockout model revealed a limited phenotype strictly confined to the terminal ileum <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To assess whether reduced Hh signalling can promote malignant transformation in the colon, we used a genetic model in which the main intestinal ligand, Ihh, can be knocked out by Tamoxifen (Tam) administration to VillinCreER;Ihh flox/flox ;R26-LSL-ZsGreen mice (hereafter Ihh DVil ), simultaneously activating expression of a conditional fluorescent reporter.</s><s>Although prolonged loss of Ihh in intestinal epithelial cells leads to intestinal stem cell accumulation, loss of differentiated cells and activation of the Wnt pathway, it does not, by itself, result in adenoma formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>However, when we exposed Ihh DVil mice to AOM/DSS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>), we found a significant increase in the tumour burden compared with controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>The ZsGreen reporter (indicating successful Cre-mediated recombination) persisted throughout normal and tumourous epithelium, demonstrating a permanent loss of Ihh and strongly suggesting that tumour development is not dependent on Ihh expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Indeed, Ihh mRNA was barely detectable in Ihh DVil mice, Shh did not increase significantly and stromal downstream Hh targets were reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a,b</ref>).</s><s>It is worth noting that Ihh DViI mice lost more weight than controls after DSS treatment and had a higher mortality, which may imply that enhanced inflammatory activity contributes, at least partly, to the increased tumour frequency in this model (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c,d</ref>).</s><s>In a subsequent experiment, we used vismodegib to antagonize canonical Hh signalling at the level of the receptor Smo (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>Twice daily administrations of vismodegib (25 mg per kg body weight) led to a significant reduction in downstream Hh target gene expression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>).</s><s>We treated C57BL/6 wt mice with either vismodegib or vehicle and employed highfrequency ultrasound (US) with intraluminal contrast to assess polypoid colonic lesions at high resolution (Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 and ref. 25).</s><s>We found that inhibition of canonical Hh signalling with vismodegib had an effect similar to the Ihh knockout, in that it led to more frequent and larger tumours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f,g</ref>).</s><s>However, we observed no significant differences in terms of weight loss or mortality due to colitis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f,g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Taken together, the data demonstrated that canonical downstream Hh signalling is attenuated in murine colorectal carcinogenesis, and that Hh inhibition can further accelerate tumour development.</s></p><p><s>Stroma-specific activation of Hh signalling.</s><s>To visualize Hh target cells in a near-native setting, we crossed Gli1CreER T2 mice to Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato reporter mice, yielding inducible Gli1CreER T2 ;Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato mice.</s><s>Seven days after administration of Tam, we found tdTomato þ cells exclusively residing in the stroma, including a mixed population of cells expressing the cytoskeletal proteins desmin, vimentin and a-sma (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>Gli1 expression remained exclusively stromal after DSS-induced epithelial damage, as indicated by analysis of both the Gli1 lacZ/ þ and Gli1CreERT2;tdTomato reporter mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4a-d</ref>), indicating that downstream Hh signalling is not activated ectopically in damaged epithelium.</s></p><p><s>In Gli1CreER T2 mice, Cre is knocked in to the endogenous Gli1 locus <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ; thus, the loss of one functional Gli1 allele alters downstream Hh signalling.</s><s>To circumvent this problem in further experiments aimed at activating Hh signalling specifically in stromal cells, we used mice expressing Cre from a transgenic collagen, type I, a2 (Col1a2) promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Analysis of Tam-induced Col1a2CreER;R26-LSL-tdTomato reporter mice confirmed recombination in an exclusively stromal cell population (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>) and collagen 1 protein expression overlapped with tdTomato expression in Gli1CreER T2 ;Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>).</s><s>We found that Col1a2CreER targets a persistent cell population as indicated by abundant tdTomato þ fibroblasts 100 days after recombination (Fig. <ref type="figure"
