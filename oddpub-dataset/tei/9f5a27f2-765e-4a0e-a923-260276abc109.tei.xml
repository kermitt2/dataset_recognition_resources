<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The prevalence of food hypersensitivity in the UK is still largely open to debate.</s><s>Additionally its pathogenesis is also unclear although it is known that there are differing phenotypes.</s><s>Determining its prevalence, along with identifying those factors associated with its development will help to assess its clinical importance within the national setting and also add to the debate on appropriate prevention strategies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p><s>A population based birth cohort study conducted in Hampshire, UK as part of the EuroPrevall birth cohort study.</s><s>1140 infants were recruited with 823 being followed up until 2 years of age.</s><s>Infants with suspected food reactions were assessed including specific IgE measurement and skin prick testing.</s><s>Diagnosis of food hypersensitivity was by positive double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) where symptoms up to 48 h after the end of the food challenge were considered indicative of a food hypersensitivity.</s><s>Factors associated with food hypersensitivity and its two phenotypes of IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated disease were modelled in a multivariable logistic regression analysis.</s></p><p><s>Results: Cumulative incidence of food hypersensitivity by 2 years of age was 5.0 %.</s><s>The cumulative incidence for individual food allergens were hens' egg 2.7 % (1.6-3.8);</s><s>cows' milk 2.4 % (1.4-3.5);</s><s>peanut 0.7 % (0.1-1.3); soy 0.4 % (0.0-0.8); wheat 0.2 % (0.0-0.5) and 0.1 % (0.0-0.32) for fish.</s><s>The cumulative incidence of IgE-mediated food allergy was 2.6 % with 2.1 % reacting to hens' egg.</s><s>For non-IgE-mediated food allergy the cumulative incidence was 2.4 % (cows' milk 1.7 %).</s><s>Predictors for any food hypersensitivity were wheeze, maternal atopy, increasing gestational age, age at first solid food introduction and mean healthy dietary pattern score.</s><s>Predictors for IgE mediated allergy were eczema, rhinitis and healthy dietary pattern score whereas for non-IgE-mediated food allergy the predictors were dog in the home, healthy dietary pattern score, maternal consumption of probiotics during breastfeeding and age at first solid food introduction.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p><s>Just under half the infants with confirmed food hypersensitivity had no demonstrable IgE.</s><s>In an exploratory analysis, risk factors for this phenotype of food hypersensitivity differed from those for IgE-mediated food allergy except for a healthy infant diet which was associated with less risk for both phenotypes.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control infants</head><p><s>Every child with DBPCFC diagnosed food hypersensitivity was allocated two age-matched controls, who were selected by approaching parents of infants with birthdays just before or after the child with a confirmed food hypersensitivity until two controls were found.</s><s>Since the control child was not selected until after a positive food challenge, some months may have passed between the time of the initial assessment of the case and the initial assessment of the control.</s><s>There was however, never more than 4 weeks between the positive food challenge result and the assessment of the control child.</s><s>Each control child was assessed in the same manner (apart from SPT) as the symptomatic infants, including a blood sample, to ensure they exhibited no signs of food allergy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this UK cohort we found the cumulative incidence of DBPCFC confirmed food hypersensitivity to be 5.0 % (3.7-6.7).</s><s>This is a little higher than other published figures of 0.0-4.2</s><s>% in the 0-5 year age group <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>This is probably due to methodological differences since many studies only performed DBPCFC if there was sensitisation thus potentially missing non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity.</s><s>The observed difference may also be due to geographical differences since it is thought the incidence of food hypersensitivity reactions is higher in Northern European countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Since all children with a clinical history of food hypersensitivity were challenged in this study, a cumulative incidence for both IgE-and non-IgE-mediated conditions could be determined: 2.6 % (1.5-3.6) for IgE-mediated food allergy and 2.4 % (1.4-3.5) for non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity.</s><s>There is a lack of published data for non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity for comparison, but our results are broadly similar to those published in the most recent systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> although they are somewhat higher for hens' egg (2.1 % compared to 0.0-1.7 %).</s></p><p><s>Novel to this study was the ability to look at risk factors for differing phenotypes of food hypersensitivity.</s><s>Our exploratory analysis showed the factors associated with food hypersensitivity were wheeze, maternal atopy, gestation, age at first solids and healthy eating dietary pattern, which are similar to those found in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr"

significant independent risk factors.</s><s>The association between eczema and food allergy has long been recognised <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> and the opinion that eczema is a likely risk factor for food allergy is becoming more widely accepted due to data relating filaggrin gene defects with the development of eczema, allergic sensitization, and asthma and allergic rhinitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Filaggrin gene defect leads to a damaged skin barrier which increases permeability to exogenous proteins and possibly exposure of the innate immune system to allergens <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s>This phenomenon may also account for rhinitis being a risk factor for food allergy since the infant may also have become sensitised to aeroallergens through a damaged epithelial layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>.</s><s>A healthy eating pattern was identified as being protective against the development of food allergy with the possible mechanism being the immunomodulatory effect of nutrients found in fruit and vegetables which were a feature of the observed healthy eating pattern along with a predominantly home-cooked diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Fruit and vegetables are good sources of vitamin C,

protection from the development of allergic disease as suggested by the "Hygiene Hypothesis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the multivariable analysis for infants with non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity, dog in the home, healthy eating pattern, probiotic whilst breastfeeding and younger age at first solid food introduction were independent risk factors.</s><s>The nature of the relationship between pet ownership and allergy development is still under debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>.</s><s>If a protective effect is only seen for IgE-mediated conditions then that may explain the conflicting findings in the literature.</s><s>It is recognised that pet ownership results in altered household microbial communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> and that these differences can lead to altered gut flora <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Whilst this may lead to changes in the immune system which reduce the risk of IgE-mediated allergy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> this altered gut flora can adversely affect digestive enzyme activity, particularly of lactase.</s><s>This is a previously reported phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> and since the majority of infants with non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity were reactive to milk, this is a potential mechanism for these cases.</s></p><p><s>The effect of altered gut microbiota may also be the reason for other observed associations in these infants including healthy eating pattern and probiotic consumption during breastfeeding.</s><s>The healthy eating dietary pattern may have a protective effect on gut health since it contained large amounts of home processed fruits and vegetables which are good sources of oligo-saccharides which, as naturally occurring prebiotics, promote gut colonization by bifidobacterium <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>.</s><s>The observed association between probiotic consumption during breastfeeding and non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity is not readily explained but it can be hypothesised that it relates to the effect of the infant gut flora on gut enzyme activity.</s><s>There is evidence that probiotics taken when breastfeeding alter breast milk composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> and that this may reduce the risk of allergy development in the infant <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>.</s><s>However, there is no data describing the effect of maternal consumption of probiotic during lactation on the infant gut flora but it could be hypothesised that it increases the bifidobacteria colonisation that has been reported during breastfeeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref> thus enhancing the effect of the breast milk on gut flora further.</s><s>At breastfeeding cessation the infant's gut flora becomes predominantly populated by coliform and bacteroid bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref> which do not aid gut enzyme activity like hybridisable bacteria does <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref> so the sudden change in the gut enzyme promoting environment may cause the observed Non-IgE mediated symptoms.</s></p><p><s>The age at first solid food introduction was significantly different for food hypersensitivity and for non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity.</s><s>This observation could explain why some previous studies found an association between the early introduction of solids and food hypersensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24]</ref> and others have not <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51]</ref> since most studies do not identify the phenotype of hypersensitivity being investigated.</s><s>It is considered that the infant gut is relatively immature before age 4-6 months and introducing solids before this time could cause food hypersensitivity symptoms, due to physiological mechanisms such as high intestinal permeability <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref> which could upset the normal homeostasis of mucosal cell transport processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The strengths of this analysis include a large cohort of 1140 infants at general risk of developing food hypersensitivity with good follow-up to 24 months and a diagnosis using the gold standard methodology of a DBPCFC.</s><s>Additionally, the methodology allowed for the prospective identification and clinical assessment of infants reacting to foods which reduced the likelihood of tolerance developing before a diagnosis could be confirmed.</s><s>The prospective design also reduced the likelihood of recall bias during data collection and the prospective collection of food diary data is unique in a cohort of this size.</s><s>Limitations of our analysis are that the study population is not fully representative of the population from which it was recruited since our mothers are older (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Also, the control infants were 5 months older than the cases as they were matched by birth but recruited after the cases were assessed; since control infants had never had any adverse reactions to food we do not expect this difference to impact on any of the factors included in the risk factor analyses.</s><s>Additional limitations are that the numbers of infants diagnosed as reactive to foods were too small to enable all the likely risk factors to be detected, or to allow us to look at individual food reactions to determine whether different foods behave differently and have different risk factors associated with them.</s><s>Also, despite the prospective nature of the study, reverse causality could not be completely avoided as clinical symptoms can lead to treatments which are subsequently associated with the condition in an analysis, as was the case for anti-reflux medication.</s><s>Furthermore, a diagnosis of allergy can result in a change of behaviour as was the case for when mothers first introduced egg into the diet.</s><s>However, where there was a suspicion of reverse causality, the variable was not included in the final multivariable analysis thus reducing its effect on the final study findings.</s><s>Finally, the risk factor investigation represents an exploratory analysis and needs to be replicated, since possible regional differences within the UK may mean the findings from this study are not necessarily nationally representative.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>This study presents unique data from the UK on both IgE-mediated food allergy and non IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity in early childhood.</s><s>It found the cumulative incidence of DBPCFC confirmed food hypersensitivity to be 5.0 % (3.7-6.7).</s><s>Our results also suggest that different factors may affect the development of IgEmediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions to food in infants and young children.</s><s>However, it is important that this exploratory analysis is confirmed in other cohorts.</s><s>Analysis of the EuroPrevall data from all the birth cohort centres for all food reactions can build upon this work and also investigate any geographical differences to food hypersensitivity reactions.</s></p><p><s>was involved in the conception and design of the original study protocol, oversaw all EuroPrevall birth cohorts procedures, revised the manuscript for important intellectual content and approved the final manuscript as submitted.</s><s>GR was involved in the initiation and set up of the study, data collection, diagnosis of food allergy, statistical analysis and interpretation of the data, revised the manuscript for important intellectual content and approved the final manuscript as submitted.</s><s>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>aFig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Criteria for a defining 'symptomatic children' after telephone screening; b eligibility for double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge tests (used with Permission from Keil et al.
