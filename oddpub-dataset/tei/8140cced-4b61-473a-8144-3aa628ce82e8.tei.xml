It is</s><s>probable that the larger risks seen among the prenatally exposed for LBW and preterm birth in our study are driven by the increased frequency of CS also observed in this group.</s><s>However, higher SGA was also observed, which would be a stronger indicator of intrauterine growth restriction.</s><s>Alternatively, there may be common causes for birth outcomes and cancer, with something the mother was exposed to earlier in life influencing her risk of cancer and her offspring's risk of adverse birth outcomes.</s><s>Findings from previous studies on the association between PAC and birth outcomes have focused on prenatal diagnoses and up to 2 years after childbirth, and have been equivocal.</s><s>The results from analyses on prenatal cancer diagnosis exposure are in line with some of these findings; for example, increased risk of preterm birth <ref type="bibr">17 18 42</ref> with any type of cancer, or with breast cancer or Hodgkin's disease during pregnancy.</s><s><ref type="bibr">15 22</ref> LBW has also been seen to be higher among children of mothers with cancer in a number of studies.</s><s><ref type="bibr">14 18-20</ref> However, other studies have reported no increase in risk of preterm birth <ref type="bibr">16 19 44</ref> or LBW. <ref type="bibr">15 16 22 44</ref> Our study supports findings of increases in risk of SGA have been seen among children exposed to any cancer <ref type="bibr">17 42</ref> or ovarian cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> ; however, we did not find increases in risk following exposure to haemopoetic cancers as seen in a study.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> Apgar score has been studied in offspring of mothers who received cancer treatment and was not found to be lower among exposed children.</s><s><ref type="bibr">13 45</ref> While we found an increase in low Apgar score among those exposed to any cancer and some specific types of cancer, we were not able to also look at cancer treatments.</s><s>Sex ratio has been looked at in two studies, both of which found a higher ratio of male to female liveborns <ref type="bibr">15 16</ref> ; however, we did not see a difference between the unexposed and exposed.</s><s>CS has been found to be higher among children of mothers diagnosed prenatally with any cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> and postnatally with breast cancer.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> In summary, our study supports some of these previous findings, in a large, multinational study population, and suggests that the postnatal period considered in some papers could potentially be extended.</s></p><p><s>Associations seen for children of women diagnosed in the 6-15 years postpartum period suggested more normal perinatal health indicators than for those of women diagnosed &lt;6 years post partum.</s><s>However, while this could indicate that the cancer process had not started yet, it could also mean that if the disease process was ongoing, it had not reached a stage that interfered with fetal growth and development.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>strengths and limitations</head><p><s>The main strength of this study is the use of nationwide data from Swedish and Danish register systems.</s><s>These cover the two countries' entire populations, with obligatory data collection and minimal selection bias.</s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> However, even with these large data sets, it is difficult to look at associations with specific types of cancer because they are not common in these age groups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Open access</head><p><s>The study considers PAC in a novel way.</s><s>Previous studies have limited their definition to a maximum of 2 years post partum.</s><s>However, the minimum latency periods to clinical diagnoses for cancers in adults were determined by the World Trade Center Health Program to be 0.4 years for lymphoproliferative and haematopoietic cancers and 4 years for solid tumours (excluding mesotheliomas (11 years) and thyroid cancers (2.5 years)), with the induction and latency times of some cancers being much longer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref></s><s>This suggests that some cancers present during pregnancy would not have been included in previous research.</s><s>Limiting the exposure window to 15 years post partum was an arbitrary decision.</s><s>Some cancers diagnosed towards the end of the window may not have been present during pregnancy, or cancers diagnosed after this point were present but undetected.</s><s>However, reducing the exposure window to 10 years post partum did not alter results.</s><s>Future research could consider the postpartum period further and investigate at what time point after birth maternal cancers were no longer associated with adverse birth outcomes.</s></p><p><s>Although selection bias is minimised by inclusion of the entire populations of Denmark and Sweden, this study only considers live births.</s><s>While some studies have not found an increase in infant and neonatal deaths among those exposed to maternal cancer, <ref type="bibr">18 20 44</ref> others have seen an increase in stillbirth. <ref type="bibr">16 17 19</ref></s><s>This would potentially lead to an underestimation of the effects of maternal cancer in this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref></s><s>hildren in the study were considered exposed if their mother was diagnosed with cancer from 2 years before conception, until 15 years post partum.</s><s>However, as not all mothers could be followed for 15 years post partum, some children will have been misclassified as unexposed.</s></p><p><s>The potential impacts of immortal observation time bias and reverse causation also need to be considered.</s><s>Although a cancer may have already been initiated in the mother before a child's birth, the exposure status of the child is based on the actual diagnosis of a maternal cancer; an event which, in some cases, occurred after birth outcomes were observed.</s><s>However, it is unlikely cancer would be differentially diagnosed among mothers with a preterm or LBW child.</s><s>It should be considered though, for a maternal cancer diagnosis to be made and a child considered 'exposed', mothers need to survive until they receive a cancer diagnosis, not dying of alternative causes before this.</s></p><p><s>Residual confounding resulting from unmeasured factors cannot be ruled out.</s><s>There are many potential confounders that we have not included in our study because they were not available throughout the study period in both countries.</s><s>Some potential confounders which we were not able to control for include maternal smoking during pregnancy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref> or maternal nutrition during pregnancy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref></s><s>Furthermore, we did not have access to any information on treatment during pregnancy.</s><s>Based on the small numbers of women who received a prenatal diagnosis, the numbers in any treatment groups would be small and a study looking into the potential effects of types of treatment would likely be underpowered.</s><s>However, this is of interest and should be considered further in future research, either combining data from multiple Nordic registers, or in a different setting altogether.</s><s>Additionally, we carried out a large number of analyses and the role of chance cannot be excluded in the observations that were considered to be statistically significant.</s></p></div>
