<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our present nation-wide survey showed the prevalence of IHD among Thai patients with diabetes mellitus was 3.54%.</s><s>IHD was significantly associated with being male, age, being in Health Region 4, hypertensive comorbidity, presenting hyperglycemic crisis and insulin therapy.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first report on the prevalence and risk factors of IHD among Thai patients with diabetes.</s><s>The prevalence of IHD was 0.99% among the general population in Thailand reported in 1991 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</s><s>A related study in Sweden found a much higher prevalence of IHD (21.97%) among patients with diabetes including those aged from 45 to 74 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, our study enrolled all patients with diabetes aged from 35 to 97 years.</s><s>However, when the same age groups as the Swedish study were analyzed, the prevalence of IHD was 2.75%.</s><s>In the general population, the prevalence of IHD in Caucasian populations is normally higher than that among Asians <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> and diabetes amplifies this morbidity.</s><s>The present study enrolled patients with diabetes who received medical treatment in MoPH hospitals all over Thailand and public and private clinics in Bangkok under the NHSO.</s><s>However, these populations did not include patients with diabetes who received medical treatment in health promoting hospitals (HPHs).</s><s>These HPHs, primary care units of a community hospital, usually provide health care and medication for uncomplicated diabetes cases.</s><s>The prevalence of IHD in this study may have been overestimated because the diabetic cases in HPHs were not included.</s></p><p><s>After adjusting for confounding factors by multivariate analysis, only older age, being male, being in Health Region 4, hypertensive comorbidity, presenting hyperglycemic crisis and insulin therapy remained significantly associated with IHD among patients with diabetes.</s><s>Prevalence of IHD tended to be higher with older age similar to related studies in Sweden <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> and Finland  SD standard deviation, HbA1c hemoglobinA1c, GFR_EPI glomerular infiltration rate calculated by epidemiology collaboration formula, LDL low density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL high density lipoprotein cholesterol <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Among the elderly, changes occurring in endothelial function include loss of arterial elasticity and reduced arterial compliance, so more vascular aging and degenerative processes lead to atherosclerosis disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the endothelium experiences changed arterial function by decreased nitric oxide and increased endothelin causing a pro-coagulant state and promoting vascular smooth muscle growth and exaggerated increased risk of cardiovascular events <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Another reason is the elderly often have a low frequency of physical activity.</s><s>A recent study showed that adults, who were physically active at least twice weekly, had decreased risk of CHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref

study in Pakistan showed that central adiposity is significantly higher among females compared with males regarding patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, adiposity is positively related to IHD especially among females <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Patients presenting more adiposity may lead to IHD by adipocytokines by the inflammatory pathway causing vascular pathology and establishing atherothrombosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, differing lifestyle or behavioral patterns between male and female indicate males present higher behavioral risks, e.g., from smoking, that predispose cardiovascular events <ref type="bibr"
