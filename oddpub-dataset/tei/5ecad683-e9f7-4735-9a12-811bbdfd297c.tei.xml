<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Setting and samples</head><p><s>The study was conducted in Busan city, South Korea, and included 44 nursing students.</s><s>After approval by the relevant institutional review board, study participants were recruited using convenience sampling from 2 nd year nursing students on The researcher informed the students that participation in the smoking cessation intervention education program was required to receive a grade, but data collection using the questionnaire would be voluntary and anonymous.</s><s>The students were also informed that the data would be used for course improvement and research purposes, and that this process would not affect their grade.</s><s>[15], 2 groups of 21 participants each would provide 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.80, using an independent t test with a significance level of 0.05.</s><s>With this information considered, a total sample of 42 participants was deemed appropriate.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Effects of the smoking cessation intervention education program</head><p><s>An independent t test of mean differences (posttest score minus pretest score) showed that there were significant differences in autonomous motivation (t = 6.882, p &lt; 0.001), controlled motivation (t = 3.729, p = 0.001), and perceived competence (t = 3.801, p &lt; 0.001) between the 2 groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>This demonstrated that the smoking cessation intervention education program based on blended learning produced significant improvements in nursing students' autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and perceived competence in performing a smoking cessation intervention.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The results in this study showed that a smoking cessation intervention education program adopting blended learning was significantly effective in enhancing nursing students' autonomous motivation and perceived competence in a smoking cessation intervention.</s><s>These results are consistent with a previous study that used a 1-group quasi-experimental design, indicating that a SDT-based smoking cessation intervention program consisting of online and offline learning, significantly increased autonomous motivation and perceived competence in nursing students <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The most prominent barriers for nursing students were a lack of knowledge and inexperience concerning performance of a smoking cessation intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>The problem might be that students receive insufficient teaching about smoking cessation interventions in their nursing curriculum <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In interviewing, providing empirical evidence that the optimal motivational profile for sustained behavior change is one of high autonomous motivation and high perceived competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide smoking cessation intervention education programs for nursing students.</s></p><p><s>In our study, we speculated that blended learning would elicit a greater increase in autonomous motivation and perceived competence regarding a smoking cessation intervention.</s><s>This is consistent with the results of previous research , in which nursing students taught with blended learning programs showed higher levels of academic accomplishment such as knowledge and self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Nursing clinical education, such as teaching smoking cessation interventions, is complex and requires a multifaceted approach to address nursing students <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In the current study, the blended learning enabled external knowledge of the smoking cessation intervention to be internalized, enhanced the development of a range of nursing clinical competencies, developed problem-solving strategies, and promoted critical reflective thinking about the smoking cessation intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, blended learning can be a good tool for enhancing the quality of nursing education, despite the limited nursing curriculum time.</s><s>Smoking continues to be a major public health problem and improving smoking cessation intervention training is a recognized public health priority <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, it is important that smoking cessation intervention education programs in undergraduate nursing should include a whole spectrum of interventions with specific details to enable adoption of learner-centered teaching programs.</s></p><p><s>This study revealed that participants in the experimental group also experienced an increase in controlled motivation that involved feeling pressured by external sources to provide a smoking cessation intervention.</s><s>Because our smoking cessation intervention education program did not target controlled motivation and was intended to be non-pressuring and supportive of autonomy, this result was unexpected and is consistent with the findings of another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Simply incorporating smoking cessation content into the course, presumably conveyed to students that the professors believed it was important <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, when a new guideline is first introduced, since most are not intrinsically enjoyable, healthcare providers may feel pressure from external demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Over time, individuals may internalize the value of the guideline and experience a greater sense of autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since this study was performed over a relatively short period of time, it is possible that the increase in controlled motivation reflected the fact that students were relatively early in the internalization process and considered smoking cessation as a "must-do."</s><s>Therefore, internalization of new skills, such as a smoking cessation intervention, may require more time, supportive feedback from peers and tutors, and reflection on learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The findings
