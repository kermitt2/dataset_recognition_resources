<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the primary non-lysosomal ATP-dependent protein degradation machinery in eukaryotic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>By degrading short-lived poly-ubiquitin-tagged substrates, it determines the availability of regulatory proteins and controls a large number of physiologically important cellular processes such as gene regulation and inflammatory response <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The 26S proteasome is the central proteolytic enzyme of the UPS.</s><s>The catalytic activity is restricted to three β-subunits (β1, β2, and β5) of the 20S proteasome core particle <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In response to IFN-γ three alternative proteolytically active β-subunits, β1i/LMP2, β2i/MECL1, and β5i/LMP7 are incorporated into a nascent 20S proteasome generating a new sub-type, named immunoproteasome (i-proteasome) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Constitutive expression of the immuno-subunits occurs in hematopoietic derived cells such as splenocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In comparison to standard proteasomes which are constitutively expressed in all cell types, i-proteasomes exhibit altered cleavage preferences affecting the versatility of antigen processing and the possibility to generate and present immunogenic epitopes onto MHC-class I molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, β5i/LMP7-deficient mice are impaired in i-proteasome formation or efficient anti-viral and anti-bacterial immune response, as shown for CVB-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and L. monocytogenes infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, respectively.</s></p><p><s>However, i-proteasomes not only function by generating MHC-class I epitopes, but also possess additional immunological functions in connection with inflammatory diseases.</s><s>For example, β5i/LMP7 -/mice exhibit an attenuated experimental colitis with no induction of proinflammatory cytokines and reduced intestinal inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, recent human genetics studies, identifying missense or nonsense mutations in the PSMB8 gene encoding β5i/ LMP7, support the involvement of i-proteasomes in inflammatory disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>All patients carrying mutations in the PSMB8 gene suffer from symptoms displaying recurrent fever, elevated levels of acute phase molecules, high levels of IL-6, and auto-immune abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Several studies underline the role of i-proteasomes in specific pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, by controlling gene expression of immune modulators or altering the protein turnover rate of critical signaling molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Streptococcus pneumoniae is estimated to cause 27% of all cases of community acquired pneumonia, being the most frequent pathogen causing lower respiratory tract infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Depending on the serotype S. pneumoniae causes pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis, and bacteremia <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>A cohort study estimated the 28-day mortality in patients, hospitalized due to community acquired pneumonia, to 13% in South America, 9% in Europe, and 7% in North America <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Multiple antibiotic resistance has rapidly increased exerting 21% drug resistance to clindamycin, 39% to erythromycin, and 21% to oral penicillin according to a US study <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Because antibiotic resistance still spreads S. pneumoniae remains a critical pathogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The immune system employs numerous mechanisms to protect the host from an invasive pneumococcal infection.</s><s>Releases of bacterial cell-wall particles, toxins, and DNA initiate activation of these defense mechanisms via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>They recognize bacterial components containing conserved motifs that are referred to as pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>PRRs such as TLRs stimulate the production of NF-κB and AP-1 dependent immune modulating components via the MyD88, TRIM/TRAF, and MAP kinase pathway resulting in activation of innate immune defenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Alveolar macrophages represent the first phagocytic defense and are essential in initiating and coordinating the innate immune response to infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to phagocytosis and endosomal clearance of S. pneumoniae, they rapidly produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as reactive oxygen species.</s><s>Alveolar macrophages are activated by PAMPs but also by cytokines, complement, and antibody complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and finally contribute to the resolution of inflammation in lung tissue by clearing apoptotic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In established pneumonia, neutrophils become the major cells eliminating bacteria.</s><s>Chemokines such as CXCL-1 stimulate their chemotaxis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>If alveolar defense mechanisms are overwhelmed, invasion of S. pneumoniae into the bloodstream takes place.</s><s>Clearance of pneumococci from circulation strongly depends on opsonization enhancing bacterial phagocytosis by leukocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Pentraxins are cytokine-inducible soluble PRRs and part of the humoral innate immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>They opsonize bacteria and promote phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>They include the short pentraxin C reactive protein (CRP), which is systemically produced in liver during the acute phase response and the long pentraxin PTX-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>PTX-3 is produced in various cell types, with macrophages being one of the major sources.</s><s>Pentraxins interact with opsonizing components (C1q, MBL, and Ficolin) of the classical and lectin activation pathway of the complement system, thereby amplifying its effector functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Using β5i/LMP7 -/mice, we studied the impact of i-proteasomes on the innate immune response against S. pneumoniae.</s><s>Our experiments revealed that β5i/LMP7 deficiency alters the composition of proteasomes in murine macrophages and liver, which is accompanied by reduced gene transcription of immune modulating molecules.</s><s>Reduced opsonin expression and impaired bacterial elimination in β5i/LMP7 -/mice is accompanied by a more severe case of pneumonia with early mortality in consequence of critical illness during the late phase of disease.</s><s>Taken together, our findings highlight an unexpected
