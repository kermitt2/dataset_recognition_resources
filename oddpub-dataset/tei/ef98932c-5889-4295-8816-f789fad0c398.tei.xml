<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a subtype of diabetes that arises de novo late in the second trimester or early in the third trimester of pregnancy.</s><s>It represents a global health challenge, with incidences reaching 17.8% of total pregnancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Predisposing factors include maternal obesity, metabolic dysfunction and genetic susceptibility.</s><s>Although the mechanisms are not fully understood, decreased insulin sensitivity and inadequate insulin secretion are two common causative factors.</s><s>Women with GDM are at increased risk of developing other complications of pregnancy, including pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>They also have an increased lifetime risk for type 2 diabetes of approximately 30% <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>For the fetus, GDM poses an increased risk of stillbirth, perinatal complications, macrosomia and growth restriction <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and there is a greater predisposition to type 2 diabetes, obesity and metabolic and cardiovascular diseases later in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Pregnancy is a pro-diabetogenic state due to changes in the endocrine regulation of maternal carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, which are essential for elevating circulating blood glucose to meet fetal demands.</s><s>Consequently, maternal organs and peripheral tissues are adapted for glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.</s><s>As pregnancy advances, the placenta is the major driver of these maternal metabolic adaptations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Although widely recognised as an organ of nutrient and gaseous exchange, the placenta secretes an array of polypeptide hormones, growth factors, cytokines and adipokines that modulate maternal metabolism and fetal growth.</s><s>Human placental lactogen (hPL) and prolactin induce beta cell expansion and insulin release in the maternal pancreas <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, while human placental growth hormone (hPGH) and adipokines cause peripheral insulin resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Maternal serum concentrations of hPL and hPGH increase up to 30-and eightfold, respectively, during pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The placenta also secretes leptin, regulated by a placenta-specific upstream enhancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and adiponectin <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for regulation of maternal lipid metabolism, favouring fatty acids as a fuel source in maternal tissues.</s><s>In normal pregnancy, these factors act in concert to redistribute maternal energy resources, increasing their availability for the fetus.</s><s>However, perturbation of placental function potentially disrupts their bioactivity, altering the normal balance of maternal metabolism and resulting in GDM.</s></p><p><s>Organs with high polypeptide endocrine activity, such as the pancreas and placenta, are susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.</s><s>The ER coordinates the biosynthesis and post-translational modification of secreted proteins and membrane receptors, as well as maintaining calcium homoeostasis in cells.</s><s>Therefore, any perturbation of the ER intraluminal environment can severely affect the bioactivity of secreted proteins.</s><s>Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER provokes activation of an integrated network of signalling pathways known as the unfolded protein response (UPR).</s><s>These pathways aim to restore ER homeostasis and involve protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK)-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit α (eIF2α), which attenuates non-essential protein synthesis, and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), which promote the synthesis of ER-resident chaperones to increase folding capacity.</s><s>If these pathways fail to restore homeostasis, apoptosis is activated to eliminate the damaged cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Research on the role of ER stress in human diabetes has advanced rapidly and targeting to ameliorate ER stress has become a therapeutic intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>In type 2 diabetes, ER stress-induced dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells reduces insulin production as well as its bioactivity, resulting in hyperglycaemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The current view is that GDM is a pre-diabetic state and, although there may be several underlying causes, the majority of cases appear to be due to pre-existing low-grade chronic beta cell dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, insufficient insulin is secreted to overcome the pregnancy-induced insulin resistance in the maternal organs/peripheral tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We have demonstrated the central role of placental ER stress in the pathophysiology of pregnancy complications, including fetal growth restriction and early-onset pre-eclampsia <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we first investigate evidence of ER stress in placentas from women with GDM.</s><s>We then use an in vitro trophoblastic-like cell model to elucidate the mechanisms by which hyperglycaemia may induce placental ER stress.</s><s>Finally, we examine the ability of chemical chaperones and antioxidants to mitigate ER stress in trophoblast-like cells under high glucose concentrations.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we provide the first evidence for the existence of placental ER stress in women with established GDM, demonstrated by dilatation of ER cisternae in the syncytiotrophoblast and increased p-eIF2α and unspliced XBP-1 protein.</s><s>Evidence for activation of the IRE1α arm remains elusive because of inconsistent signals from the downstream effectors, with no splicing of XBP-1, but potential activation of the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (ESM Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>To conclude, the results suggest that placental ER stress in GDM is mild compared with that observed in pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction and earlyonset pre-eclampsia <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>It must be remembered, however, that the GDM placentas studied came from women whose glucose levels were well-controlled, as evidenced by mean HbA 1c levels which were only just outside the normal range.</s></p><p><s>The severity of placental pathology in individuals with diabetes is generally related to the quality of glucose control <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To test whether elevated glucose concentrations per se are able to induce ER stress, we developed a new trophoblast-like cell line adapted to physiological glucose concentrations, BeWo-NG.</s><s>Use of these cells revealed that high glucose concentrations induce ER stress in vitro, most likely through metabolic acidosis.</s><s>Activation of the UPR was limited to the PERK signalling arm.</s><s>Severe acidosis induces ER stress in other cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Although the mechanisms are elusive, the activity of Ca 2+ -ATPases is susceptible to acidosis and there is a pH-dependent Ca 2+ efflux from the intracellular storage compartments.</s><s>Acidification of the medium (from pH 7.0 to 6.5) causes release of Ca 2+ from the ER and loss of ER homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, activating the UPR.</s><s>Lactic acid has been demonstrated to induce phosphorylation of eIF2α in cancer cells, possibly through this mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In GDM, excessive maternal blood glucose could facilitate overproduction of lactate in the placenta, resulting in metabolic acidosis.</s><s>Unlike many organs, in which lactate production is usually under hypoxic conditions, the placenta synthesises considerable quantities of under aerobic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The human placenta expresses all five isozymes of lactate dehydrogenase, which catalyses the inter-conversion of lactate and pyruvate in the glycolytic pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The activity of only one of the five isozymes is increased in trophoblast cells upon hypoxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, suggesting that the majority of the placental isozymes may facilitate lactate production aerobically.</s><s>The amount of lactate produced by the placenta is directly proportional to the maternal glucose concentration, as elevation of the glucose concentration from 4.2 to 10.9 mmol/l during placental perfusion in vitro induced a fourfold increase in lactate production.</s><s>However, raising the glucose concentration further had no additional effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, consistent with our observation of no change in the pH value of media containing 10 or 20 mmol/l glucose.</s><s>Unfortunately, data on placental lactate production in vivo in GDM patients are not available.</s><s>A study by Taricco et al, using indirect measures, reported a 23% increase of lactate concentration in the umbilical vein in GDM pregnancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, the placenta is likely producing more lactate in GDM and transporting it to the fetus for metabolism.</s></p><p><s>An alternative explanation is that the placental ER stress reflects the maternal pro-inflammatory environment associated with obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, a potentially confounding variable as our participants were not matched for pre-pregnancy BMI.</s><s>However, placentas from normoglycaemic obese women did not show ER stress.</s><s>Furthermore, adding palmitic acid to BeWo-NG cells during a high glucose challenge did not exacerbate the ER stress (ESM Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a, b, d</ref>), indicating that high levels of fatty acids are unlikely to be a causative factor.</s><s>Finally, there was no correlation between the level of p-eIF2α and the BMI of the women at the time of delivery (ESM Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results suggest that obesity is unlikely to be the cause of the placental ER stress observed in GDM.</s></p><p><s>Oxidative stress is also a strong inducer of ER stress in the trophoblast <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>However, the existence of oxidative stress in GDM placentas remains contentious as both increased and unchanged stress have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>This may be due to differences in the percentages of women under dietary control (85% vs 53%) and insulin therapy (15% vs 47%).</s><s>Nevertheless, the GDM placentas used in this study (54% of which were from those under dietary control) showed only a mild level of oxidative stress as indicated by activation of JNKs without significant changes in p38 kinase phosphorylation and heat shock proteins (ESM Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>We speculate that placental ER and oxidative stress may occur to a greater extent in GDM pregnancies with more severe metabolic acidosis.</s><s>Indeed, treating BeWo-NG cells with low-pH media strongly activated the oxidative stress marker p38 kinase phosphorylation (ESM Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>), similar to treatment with high glucose concentrations (ESM Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that the oxidative stress observed in GDM placentas may be triggered at least in part by placental metabolic acidosis.</s><s>Further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we demonstrated the potential use of chemical ER chaperones and antioxidant vitamins as therapeutic interventions to prevent glucose-induced placental ER stress.</s><s>Chemical chaperones had a similar efficacy to that of antioxidants in the suppression of ER stress at a glucose concentration of 10 mmol/l, but the chemical chaperones lost their beneficial effects at a higher concentration of 20 mmol/l (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a, b</ref>).</s><s>The exact mechanisms by which vitamins C and E restore pH at high glucose concentrations are not known.</s><s>However, they are unlikely to be related to their antioxidant properties, as other antioxidants (edaravone and N-acetyl-L-cysteine) had no effect (data not shown).</s><s>Nonetheless, both vitamin C and vitamin E protect muscle cells from mitochondrial damage, including membrane rupture, during exhaustive exercise, which is accompanied by lactate accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the vitamins may maintain mitochondrial integrity and function during metabolic acidosis, thereby reducing anaerobic lactate production.</s><s>Indeed, our data in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref> showing inhibition of lactate production support this speculation.</s></p><p><s>These results provide new insight into the potential use of ER chaperones as therapeutic agents in diabetic pregnancies.</s><s>Additionally, vitamins C and E could be administered as health supplements in conjunction with both dietary and insulin control to mitigate the adverse effects of metabolic acidosis on the placenta, thereby improving fetal wellbeing.</s><s>Furthermore, in a mouse model of diabetes, hyperglycaemiainduced ER stress mediated embryopathy can be ameliorated through administration of 4-PBA <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.
