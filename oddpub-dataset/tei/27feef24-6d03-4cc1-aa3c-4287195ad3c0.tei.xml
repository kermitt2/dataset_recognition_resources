<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p><s>Our main finding is that patients with NELM treated with cTACE showed clear OS benefits as compared to DEB-TACE (33.8 vs. 23.4</s><s>months, p=.04) and Y90 (34.0 vs. 22.9 months, p=.032).</s><s>Importantly, after adjusting for confounders in the MVA using the propensity score methodology, the difference in survival remained statistically significant.</s><s>Our study is among very few published datasets that compare clinical outcomes between different IAT modalities in NELMs and the first to specifically compare the three commonly used locoregional therapeutic modalities (cTACE vs. DEB-TACE vs. Y90) in the largest ever reported cohort of such patients.</s><s>Although retrospective in nature, our study uses a comprehensive statistical analysis to correct for potential selection bias, thus providing for relatively homogeneous groups of patients.</s><s>Currently, no clinical trial is completed that would address the questions raised and answered by our data analysis and only one clinical trial is currently ongoing (NCT02724540) that may potentially answer some of the challenging IAT-related issues with respect to decision making in NELMs.</s><s>As such, our results evidently support the preferential use of Lipiodol-based cTACE over other intra-arterial therapies not only by a statistically significant but rather by a substantial margin with respect to OS benefits.</s></p><p><s>The vast majority of currently available studies investigate TAE and cTACE as treatment options for patients with unresectable NELM.</s><s>For example, as exhibited by Ruutiainen et al., MOS were 39 months and 44 months for patients who underwent TAE or cTACE, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, a large-scale study by Dong et al. that included (N=123) patients who received cTACE for NELM reported a 5-year cumulative OS rate of 36% compared to 28.2% in our study <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>If compared further, all of the aforementioned studies achieved slightly better OS outcomes as compared with our own cohort.</s><s>This can be explained by a substantially higher rate of patients with extra-hepatic metastases and TB&gt;50% in our cohort which reflects our institutional approach to treat patients with latestage disease.</s><s>This is in agreement with available data, which suggests a significantly higher mortality in patients with a TB&gt;50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>With respect to extra-hepatic metastases, Gupta et al. reported a substantial negative impact on survival outcomes of extra-hepatic bone and soft-tissue metastases both for carcinoids and pNET <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Initially, DEB-TACE seemed to emerge as an improvement over cTACE in the scope of treating patients with primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>DEB-TACE was demonstrated to allow for a better toxicity profile primarily due to improved targeted delivery of the chemotherapy payload to the liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, an auspicious impact on OS in treatment of NELM disease was also expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>].</s><s>Yet, initial outcome reports for DEB-TACE in patients with NELM were disappointing, and in some cases significant toxicities, such as a higher incidence of biliary injury, occurred which required a modification of protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>As reported previously, the MOS for patients after receiving cTACE can range from 24 to 44 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>Our outcome report is among the first to provide survival data for DEB-TACE in a sizable cohort of NELM patients.</s><s>When compared with cTACE, our findings unequivocally confirm the survival benefits of the Lipiodol-based protocol.</s><s>When taking into account that no differences between both TACE options were observed with respect to RR, HPFS and incidence of adverse events, our results support the use of cTACE in patients with NELM when given the choice between Lipiodol-based and DEB-based protocols.</s></p><p><s>Several recent studies promote Y90 as a potential alternative to TAE/cTACE in the treatment of patients with NELM <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Advantages associated with Y90 treatment include lower incidence rates of adverse events, such as post-embolization syndrome, high RR and lower retreatment rates compared to cTACE, which is usually applied in repeated sessions.</s><s>The majority of current studies compare Y90 to cTACE/TAE in terms of RR and symptomatic improvements with no data available with respect to survival outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Two recent studies, by Rhee et al. and by Kennedy et al., showed substantial disagreement with respect to MOS after Y90 in patients with NELM, ranging from 22 to 70 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s>Our analysis demonstrates significant and substantial OS and HPFS benefits for patients who underwent cTACE as compared to those who were treated with Y90.</s><s>This result remained significant upon elimination of selection bias using the PSA (MOS: 34.0 vs. 22.9 months, p=.032, HPFS: 21.6 vs. 11.2</s><s>months, p=.03) as well as after adjusting for confounders in the MVA.</s><s>In addition, cTACE and Y90 showed similar incidence rates of adverse events.</s><s>An important point which should be considered with respect to this outcome analysis is the number of embolization sessions applied in each group.</s><s>Because of inherent and well known methodological limitations, the total number of Y90 therapy sessions is usually limited to two injections when treating in a lobar fashion.</s><s>As cTACE treatment allows for additional embolization, multiple sessions can be performed in case of insufficient RR or new lesions upon completion of the initial therapy cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>In our cohort, all patients with therapy cross-over were initially excluded with the goal of reducing potential bias.</s><s>Thus, a slightly higher number of sessions per patient has been recorded for cTACE than for Y90.</s><s>Although clear benefits of cTACE over Y90 were evident without therapy cross-over, a true advantage might arise from sequential Y90 and cTACE therapy in patients with slow-growing NELM.</s></p><p><s>As for the comparison of Y90 and DEB-TACE, both techniques demonstrated similar effect on OS and were equally safe.</s><s>However, DEB-TACE corresponded with improved RR (MVA: p=.03).</s><s>As demonstrated by Whitney et al., an exceptional RR (CR+PR) of 100% was attained by Y90 and DEB-TACE treatment after three months.</s><s>However, in a 12-month follow-up, RR in the Y90 group was significantly lower than in the DEB-TACE group.</s><s>Thus, patients who underwent Y90 were initially salvaged with repeated DEB-TACE treatment, which again underlines the potentially tremendous opportunities of the sequential crossover therapy option <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There were several limitations to our study.</s><s>First, due to the retrospective design and the non-randomized cohorts, there was a limited pool of patients and a correspondingly restricted statistical analysis.</s><s>However, the limited number of patients with NELM mirrors the rarity of the investigated disease.</s><s>Furthermore, possible confounders and selection bias were considered and minimized by PSA -as discussed previously.</s><s>Most importantly, our study represents a longitudinal retrospective analysis of data collected over a period of almost 14 years.</s><s>The last decade has seen an unparalleled growth and evolution of embolization and imaging technologies as well as the introduction of multiple new systemic and targeted therapies for neuroendocrine tumors.</s><s>Taken together, all of these factors may have influenced PFS and OS of our patients and thus introduced a substantial bias into our analysis.</s><s>Yet, given the lack of prospectively collected data, such retrospective data analyses represent the only currently available and much needed instrument to identify trends and design prospective trials.</s></p></div>
