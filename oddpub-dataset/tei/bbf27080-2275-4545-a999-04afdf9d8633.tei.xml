(2013b)</ref> differentiated four different MTs based on the importance of peers and teachers as sources for scholastic motivation.</s><s>Applying a latent class analysis (LCA) in 1088 adolescent students from Germany they identified (1) teacher-dependent MT, (2) peer-dependent MT, (3) peer-andteacher-dependent MT and (4) peer-and-teacher-independent MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Raufelder et al., 2013b)</ref>.</s><s>Students of the teacher-dependent MT (1) receive most of their scholastic motivation from teachers.</s><s>Further qualitative interviews <ref type="bibr">(Hoferichter and Raufelder, 2014)</ref> revealed that these students are also affected by teachers' own motivation as well as the support and feedback they perceive from the teacher.</s><s>Likewise, students of the peer-dependent MT (2) are mostly driven by their peers, whereas students of the peerand-teacher-dependent MT (3) perceive both peers and teachers as sources of motivation <ref type="bibr">(Hoferichter and Raufelder, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the motivation of students in the peer-and-teacherindependent MT category (4) remains largely unaffected by the motivation, learning behavior, or perceived support of their peers and teachers.</s><s>The four MT have been validated by another LCA in a sample of adolescent students in Montréal, Canada <ref type="bibr">(Hoferichter et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Based on these findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Raufelder (2014)</ref> formulated the concept of socio-motivational (in-)dependence: individuals whose motivation is affected by others' motivation, learning behavior or perceived support, are considered to be sociomotivationally dependent.</s><s>In the school context, motivation can be affected by both peers' motivation, learning behavior or social support and/or by teachers' perceived support and motivation (see <ref type="bibr">Wentzel, 2009a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Raufelder et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In turn, when the motivation remains largely unaffected by others, socio-motivational independency is assumed.</s><s>A subsequent longitudinal latent transition analysis (LTA) could confirm the four types of socio-motivational (in-)dependence by investigating intra-individual changes from early to middle adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jagenow et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>While slight turnovers were observed between the three types of socio-motivational dependence from early to middle adolescence, the socio-motivationally independent category showed the highest probability (0.68) to remain stable.</s></p></div>

affects learning and vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Mehring and Colson, 1990)</ref>, since both concepts are reportedly related <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rao, 2003;</ref><ref

1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Zusho and Pintrich, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Watt, 2004)</ref>, most students' learning performance and academic achievement also tend to

prominent theory on learning is the reinforcement theory, which is based on the early work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Thorndike (1929)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Skinner (1938)</ref>.</s><s>Their theory of operant conditioning posits that individuals learn according to the outcomes of their actions.</s><s>Specifically, if an outcome -for example good learning performance at school -is reinforced through reward (e.g., praise and feedback from peers and/or teachers), then the corresponding behavior (e.g., good learning performance) is likely to be repeated and vice versa.</s><s>This means that students' motivation to learn is directly increased through reward.</s><s>In turn, punishment can work to suppress certain kinds of undesirable behavior (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ittel et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Both the concept of socio-motivational (in-)dependence and reinforcement theory focus on the interactions between an individual and his or her environment and constitute a promising approach to examine individual differences in motivation and learning patterns.</s><s>Moreover, linking these theories to neuroscience offers the possibility of elucidating individual characteristics beyond mere behavioral aspects.</s><s>Since learning from reward and punishment represents the fundament also for social learning, investigating the neurobiological correlates of these learning mechanisms may help to explain why some individuals depend on the reinforcing aspects of scholar motivators (peers and teachers), while others do not.</s><s>Moreover, in neuroscientific experimental settings, the detailed learning experience (i.e., trial-by-trial learning) within the brain can be investigated directly.</s><s>Here, the combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reinforcement learning paradigms such as reversal learning tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cools et al., 2002)</ref> constitute a well-established research method to investigate simple operant learning and allow researchers to consider potential inter-individual differences on a neural level during a basic learning task.</s><s>Reversal learning assesses an individual's ability to develop advantageous learning behavior by using feedback on performance.</s><s>Standard 2choice reversal learning tasks present participants with two potential responses with different reinforcement contingencies.</s><s>Through multiple trials, participants learn to choose the stimulus associated with a higher reward by referring to their performance feedback.</s><s>Next, the reinforcement contingency is altered without warning participants, who are thus surprised to discover that their previously reinforced response does not yield a reward anymore, cueing them to switch to the alternative response.</s><s>As soon as one response is no longer being rewarded, the alternative response always becomes the better choice (see D <ref type="bibr">'Cruz et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Using such tasks, brain regions that are crucially involved in signaling learning parameters such as the prediction error (PE) have been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(O'Doherty et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schlagenhauf et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The PE is defined as the difference between an expected outcome and the actual outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sutton and Barto, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>These PEs have been found to be encoded in the subcortical striatum <ref type="bibr"

parietal areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(O'Doherty et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tobler et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The striatum which comprises of putamen and caudatus is known to be involved in basic forms of feedback processing and flexible learning processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beeler et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) on the other hand is involved in more controlled social feedback learning processes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Guyer et al., 2012)</ref> and higher order control functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Wood and Grafman, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">van Schouwenburg et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Wolfensteller and Ruge, 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Students' motivation to learn is influenced by basic processes such as operant learning.</s><s>Investigating these processes in experimental neuroscientific studies may help to explain why some individuals depend on reinforcing aspects of scholar motivators and others do not.</s><s>Understanding these neural processes may constitute the basis for the understanding of aberrant behavior in the school context (e.g., conduct disorders).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Aims and Hypotheses</head><p><s>Here, we used computational modeling to estimate PE values based on the behavioral data of each individual.</s><s>This approach also provides meaningful parameters that quantify different aspects of learning behavior like the individually estimated learning rate.</s><s>The learning rate describes how strongly single feedback events influence future choice behavior, i.e., show if an individual adjusts his or her behavior quickly according to the received feedback or if his or her expectations are more stable and only influenced through feedback over a longer period of time.</s><s>Possibly, since individuals with socio-motivational dependence adapt their motivation and learning to peers and/or teachers <ref type="bibr">(Hoferichter and Raufelder, 2014)</ref>, an association of individual learning rate values with the probability of being socio-motivationally dependent rather than socio-motivationally independent is suggested.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, we hypothesize that PE related activation measured using fMRI during the reinforcement learning task is associated with the individual socio-motivational type.</s><s>However, since this is the first study to link students' MT, learning rate and brain activation during a reinforcement learning task, our approach was exploratory.</s></p><p><s>The main goal of the present study was to explore the interplay of reinforcement learning and socio-motivational (in-)dependence in adolescent students by: (1) investigating whether students' individual learning rates in a reversal learning task can predict their respective MT, and (2) investigating whether PE related activation in the PFC and the striatum -brain regions that are known to be crucially involved in reinforcement learning -predict the probability of belonging to specific MTs.</s></p></div>

interplay between learning and sociomotivational (in-)dependence in adolescence.</s><s>In particular, reinforcement learning rates as well as activity levels in brain regions that are associated with reinforcement learning (striatum, PFC) were tested as predictors of four different MTs based on the concept of socio-motivational (in-)dependence.</s></p><p><s>With regard to our first research aim, student's learning rate indeed functions as a predictor discriminating different MTs, in particular between the peer-and-teacher-dependent MT and the peer-and-teacher-independent MT.</s><s>In detail, a temporal short term learning rate, characterized by a high α value, is associated with the peer-and-teacher-dependent MT but not with the independent MT.</s><s>Note that neither a low nor a high learning rate is beneficial in this probabilistic learning task, where an immediate reaction to negative feedback as well as a too slow adjustment of behavior might not increase rewarded events.</s><s>Thus, students of the peer-and-teacherdependent MT are more likely to immediately adjust their behavior according to the feedback they receive during the reinforcement learning task.</s><s>Possibly, this is caused by increased feedback sensitivity in basic learning mechanisms, which could function as a basis for their socio-motivational dependence, i.e., high feedback-sensitivity (recognition and approval) toward peers and/or teachers <ref type="bibr">(Hoferichter and Raufelder, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In turn, the independent MT seems to be less reactive to feedback (reinforcement) during learning as well as in terms of motivation.</s></p><p><s>However, the learning rate neither discriminated between the three socio-motivational types (peer-dependent MT, teacher-dependent MT, peer-and-teacher-dependent MT), nor between the peer-dependent MT and the teacher-dependent MT compared with the peer-and-teacher-independent MT.</s><s>Future studies with diverse samples are warranted and may provide deeper insights into these individual differences.</s></p><p><s>Regarding our second research aim, learning related neural activation in two brain regions (PFC and a subregion of the striatum) discriminated between the probabilities of being socio-motivationally independent as opposed to being sociomotivationally dependent.</s><s>In detail, more PE related activity in the right PFC predicted the probability of being a peer-andteacher-dependent MT rather than an independent MT.</s><s>This finding supports previous research that found the PFC to be associated with more controlled and feedback-related learning processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cools et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">van Schouwenburg et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Wolfensteller and Ruge, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In this way, it also supports previous findings on differences in learning-behavior typically found for different MT.</s><s>In fact, the peer-and-teacher-dependent MT is characterized by a strong feedback-orientation toward both peers and teachers and by well-adjusted and controlled behavior in school <ref type="bibr">(Hoferichter and Raufelder, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Raufelder et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, social-motivational dependence might be associated with tendency to follow directions and adapt to feedback in general.</s></p><p><s>In the additional analysis of subregions within the striatum, we observed that the higher the PE related activity in the left associative striatum, the higher was the probability of being an independent MT rather than a teacher-dependent MT or a peer-and-teacher-dependent MT.</s><s>During the fMRI experiment, we measure PE related BOLD signals in the striatum.</s><s>It can be speculated, that individuals from the sociomotivational independent MT group may more strongly rely on their own assumption about their actions and the associated consequences.</s><s>Such stronger reliance or trust in one's own estimations of the state of the environment can computationally be understood as higher precision of the PE, which mightperhaps through top down processing -lead to an increase in the measured PE signals in the striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hebart et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Overall, these findings support the concept of sociomotivational (in-)dependence by providing evidence that the concept of socio-motivational (in-)dependence is associated with different learning patterns on (a) a behavioral as well as on (b) a neural level.</s><s>Following Jensen's (1998) advice of "teaching with the brain in mind, " our findings revealed that teachers should be aware that student's individual motivation style [i.e., socio-motivational (in-) dependence] is associated with specific feedback-related brain response during reinforcement learning.</s><s>Linking these findings to educational practice in order to better support adolescent students and accommodate their individual learning and motivation preferences, students with a socio-motivational dependence benefit from feedback and concrete directions, whereas students with a socio-motivational independence need a more autonomous learning environment with fewer instructions and feedback from teachers and peers.</s><s>Particularly, students with a socio-motivational independence might not best benefit from the traditional school system, which is dominated through learning in classroom settings and strong teacher involvement and feedback.</s><s>As strength they show a higher behavioral flexibility, which need to be better supported in class through promoting autonomy-supportive or
