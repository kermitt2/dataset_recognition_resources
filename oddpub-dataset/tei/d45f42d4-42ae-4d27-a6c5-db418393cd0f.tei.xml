line could increase the JA level, causing decreases in the rice grain yield and fertility rate (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Both flag and second leaves contribute to the grain-filling process <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, but flag leaves provide more than 50% of the assimilates for grain filling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>In a comparison between WT and transgenic lines, a greater P N was found only in the second leaves of the transgenic lines when grown under salt-stress conditions.</s><s>This may be related to the maximization of the photosynthetic capacity of the flag leaves.</s></p><p><s>Under salt stress, a threefold reduction of P N was detected in WT, while only a 10-15% reduction was found in the flag leaves of transgenic lines (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>This suggested a role for OsNUC1-S in photosynthetic enhancement.</s><s>The increase in photosynthetic activity was supported by the enrichment of genes involved in the photosynthetic processes, as well as in water transport and cellular homeostasis activities (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>).</s><s>The enrichment in nucleic acid and macromolecule metabolic processes supports a role for nucleolin that involves RNA modifications.</s><s>Thus, OsNUC1-S may have a specific target for its activity, which results in greater changes in the expression levels of some genes compared with others when OsNUC1-S is overexpressed.</s><s>The enrichment in carbon fixation, as well as porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, suggests that OsNUC1-S enhanced both the light reaction and the carbon fixation process.</s><s>The increased light-saturation point (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and carbon fixation activity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) were consistent with the transcriptome data.</s><s>Interestingly, when plants were impacted by salt, the function of OsNUC1-S changed.</s><s>Both the transcriptome and physiological data indicated that this gene promoted salt tolerance through enhanced photosynthesis.</s><s>Genes encoding proteins in the photosynthetic processes were strongly expressed in transgenic lines compared with WT during salt stress (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>).</s><s>Most of the up-regulated genes were located in PSI and PSII of the light reaction.</s><s>Moreover, some genes in the Calvin cycle also increased, possibly causing the higher P N values in transgenic plants.</s><s>The enriched genes encoding chlorophyll A-B-binding protein (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>), which functions in light harvesting, were also up-regulated in transgenic plants.</s><s>This supported the light-response curve results in which a higher light-saturation point occurred in transgenic plants under salt stress.</s></p><p><s>The second leaves in WT were more susceptible to salt stress than flag leaves.</s><s>The former had a significant decrease in F v /F m after 9 days of salt stress, while salt stress had no effect on flag leaves.</s><s>Na + can be transferred from root to shoot, and in rice, OsHKT1;5 excludes Na + from the phloem to prevent Na + transfer to the younger leaf blades <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the second leaves were affected by salt stress to a larger extent than the flag leaves.</s><s>This may be the mechanism that prevents Na + toxicity from reaching the flag leaf, which has the main role in carbon fixation for grain development.</s></p></div>
