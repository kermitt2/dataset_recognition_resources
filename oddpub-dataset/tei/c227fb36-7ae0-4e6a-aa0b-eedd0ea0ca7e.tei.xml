The incorporation of preQ 1 into the tRNA is catalyzed by the enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) in a proposed ping-pong mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The 3D structure of a eubacterial TGT was firstly described by <ref type="bibr">Romier et al.</ref> for the Zymomonas mobilis enzyme, a 43 kDa protein.</s><s>This eubacterial TGT (bacTGT) harbors an eight stranded beta (β/α) 8 triose-phosphate-isomerase like fold, a (β/α) 8 TIM barrel, which is a characteristic of this enzyme class that provides the structural basis for substrate binding and catalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, it contains a zinc ion binding site which, in concert with the TIM barrel, provides the scaffold for binding of the tRNA substrate by this enzyme class <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Due to the scarce structural knowledge, insights into tRNA recognition are mainly provided by the structure of the archeosine Pyrococcus horikoshii TGT (arcTGT) in complex with a full length tRNA.</s><s>However, arcTGT specifically targets the G15 base of cognate tRNAs for modification, rather than G34 like the eubacterial and eukaryotic enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Insights into the tRNA protein interaction and the underlying mechanism of the transglycosylation reaction for the bacterial enzyme were provided by the crystal structure of the covalently bound tRNA anticodon stem loop to bacTGT from Z. mobilis.</s><s>Interestingly, this complex structure revealed Asp280 to execute the nucleophilic attack on the C atom of the N-glycosidic bond between the ribose and the guanine base rather than Asp102, the residue that was originally proposed to be involved in this cleavage <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">21]</ref>.</s><s>The consequence of this nucleophilic attack is the formation of a covalent tRNA-enzyme reaction intermediate in which RNA and protein are linked by a covalent bond between the Asp280 and the remaining ribose of the tRNA backbone <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The cleaved guanine base is free to dissociate from the active site and is subsequently replaced by the preQ1 substrate.</s><s>Formation of the N-glycosidic linkage between the tRNA and preQ1 is then achieved by deprotonation of the preQ1's N5 atom through the TGT's Asp102, which facilitates a nucleophilic attack of preQ1 on the covalent tRNA Asp280 intermediate leading to formation of the final reaction product.</s><s>Finally, the modified tRNA product dissociates from the enzyme in a rate limiting step <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This mechanism of queuine incorporation by bacterial TGTs has recently become of interest for drug design as TGT has been identified as an important virulence factor.</s><s>In Shigella, a gram negative bacterium and the causative factor of shigellosis in human, the absence of a functional TGT strongly reduces pathogenicity, allegedly caused by queuine hypomodification of the mRNA encoding the transcriptional factor virF <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore the bacterial TGT has emerged as a valuable target for structure based inhibitor design <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">27]</ref>.</s><s>Beside infection by Shigella, queuine has also been proposed to promote host infection of the pathogenic ameba Entamoeba histolytica, which might scavenge the queuine base from gut bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As for E. histolytica, most eukaryotes possess TGT enzymes, but, in contrast to their bacterial counterparts, they do not encode for enzymes necessary to build up queuine and therefore have to incorporate the queuine base, instead of a precursor, into RNA targets.</s><s>The essence of queuine in eukaryotes requires humans and other organisms to scavenge this modified base from nutritional sources and/or from microbiomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">30]</ref>.</s><s>Likely to meet these altered demand and more complex pathways and regulation in eukaryotic cells, properties of eukaryotic TGTs have emerged to show significant differences to their bacterial counterparts.</s><s>In contrast to the homodimeric architecture of the bacterial and archeal TGT, the eukaryotic, heterodimeric TGT is composed of a catalytically active queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase subunit 1 (QTRT1) and a catalytically inactive QTRT2 subunit.</s><s>This quaternary structure has been confirmed to be essential for catalyzing the incorporation of queuine into tRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, the crystal structure of the noncatalytic mouse QTRT2 subunit has been solved and found to confirm the prior suggestion that this subunit is incapable to catalyze the guanine to queuine exchange reaction as catalytic residues, and the residues involved in substrate coordination are largely replaced by chemically different amino acids and thus are extremely unlikely to facilitate queuine binding or even the transfer reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[32]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, alignment of the human QTRT1 sequence with the Z. mobilis TGT reveals this subunit to be likely catalytically active with relevant residues in place.</s><s>However, despite the potential importance of this subunit as a drug target, its structure remains unknown.</s></p><p><s>Understanding the mechanism of queuine incorporation by the eukaryotic TGT enzyme is of great interest as altered presence of queuine in TGT substrates has been associated with various disease related effects such as cancer.</s><s>Here queuine hypomodification in tRNA has been linked to increased cancer progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">34]</ref> as well as impaired cell differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, mice which were genetically modified to lack a functional TGT enzyme showed symptoms similar to those associated with the disease polyphenylketonurea as they were deficient in producing tyrosine from phenylalanine <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[36]</ref>.</s><s>The underlying mechanism of this effect is not known to date, but Rakovich et al. were able to link this observation to absence of QTRT1 and consequently to the lack of queuine in the tRNA pool.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, queuine has been proposed to increase stress tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[37]</ref>, an effect unraveled more than 20 years ago of which the mechanistic details were only recently described.</s><s>Here, queuine modification of tRNA Asp has been proven in vivo and in vitro to trigger activity of the methyltransferase Dnmt2 which results in establishment of m 5 C modification at cytosine 38 (m 5 C38) of this tRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">39]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite the numerous implications of TGTs in diseases in mammals, little is known on the structural level of queuine incorporation by eukaryotic TGT enzymes, as information about the catalyzed reaction was deducted from analysis of bacterial TGT structures through homology modeling.</s><s>Recently, the QTRT2 crystal structure allowed the first structural insights into the arrangement of the noncatalytic subunit and potential dimer assembly, leaving the biological significance without a functional catalytic site unsolved.</s><s>The 3D structure of a eukaryotic TGT catalytic subunit, which would provide reliable information about the architecture of the active site and thus the mechanism, is not known.</s></p><p><s>Here we report the crystal structure of the human QTRT1 subunit in its apo form and in complex with the queuine base.</s><s>The performed analysis reveals the QTRT1 fold to be highly related to the bacterial TGT of Z. mobilis while the active site is altered in order to accommodate queuine base, which is bulkier than preQ1.</s><s>Furthermore, comparison with the QTRT2 crystal structure provides evidence that this noncatalytic subunit is unlikely to harbor the ability of binding queuine in the active center.</s></p></div>

structure of the eukaryotic TGT that incorporates the finally modified queuine base was unknown.</s><s>Here we report the first crystal structure of the human QTRT1, which is the catalytic subunit of a eukaryotic TGT enzyme.</s></p><p><s>The QTRT1 crystal structure resembles the previously reported two hallmarks of TGTs, namely the (α/β) 8 barrel that builds the supporting structure for the
