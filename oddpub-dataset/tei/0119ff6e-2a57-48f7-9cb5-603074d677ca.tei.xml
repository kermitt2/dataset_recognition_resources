target="#b0">[1]</ref>-often involve widespread human, material, economic, and environmental impacts.</s><s>The range of negative consequences caused by disasters can potentially weaken a community's overall well-being, even for long periods of time, and such impacts usually exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope by only using its own resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>There are four stages in the disaster management cycle: preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref>.</s><s>Traditionally, the aim of disaster management is to significantly reduce the potential losses due to hazards and ensure that the victims of disasters receive the appropriate assistance and recover from the impacts rapidly and effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Recent consensus on disaster management highlighted the importance of pre-disaster mitigation and preparation.</s><s>The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction's (UNISDR) Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> has significantly shifted disaster concepts and approaches from a stance of reactive emergency response and recovery to an attitude of pro-active disaster prevention, mitigation, and preparation.</s><s>This shift is also evident in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (Sendai Framework) adopted in March 2015 in Sendai, Japan by 187 UN members <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>.</s><s>The goals and priority areas for action within the Sendai Framework have particularly stressed disaster risk reduction (DRR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</s><s>According to the UNISDR, DRR refers to the concept and practice aim to analyze and reduce the causal factors of disasters induced by natural hazards, such as earthquake, floods, droughts, and cyclones; initiatives of DRR not only involve various disciplines including but not limited to disaster management, disaster mitigation, and disaster preparedness, but also links every part of society, government and every part of professional and private sectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>.</s><s>DRR is also a significant part of sustainable development <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The 2005 World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction not only issued the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 but also for the first time confirmed the necessity to bring the concept of "resilience" into disaster discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Practices of were DRR thereby encouraged for building resilience to current and future disaster risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Resilience can be considered at different levels including individual, family, community, state or ecological system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>.</s><s>DRR programs have paid growing attention especially to community resilience across the world because communities are widely recognized as the first social units to be affected and to respond when a disaster strikes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>In the United States, for example, community resilience has become a fundamental feature of homeland security and disaster management policy and planning, and has been placed as a critical component of public health, the practice of which requires close collaboration among different sectors and groups, and their partnerships with communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The role of community resilience in disaster management policies and practices has received growing emphasis, but there is not yet a consensus on the definition of community resilience, which is, nonetheless, widely considered as the sustained ability of a community to withstand and recover from adversities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>.</s><s>However, community resilience is not simply a characteristic or property possessed by a community but also an ongoing dynamic process whereby resilience is enhanced by certain activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>.</s><s>Community resilience has also been seen as a social process through which local communities enact collective action independently for community survival and wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>In a more specific manner, CARRI (Community and Regional Resilience Institute) considers community resilience as the ability to monitor threats and reduce negative effects of threats through effective response and adaption <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>In other words, a community is a disaster resilient one when it can take mitigating and preparatory actions to resist disaster and to achieve a required level of protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Hazard mitigation, preparation, and recovery should, therefore, cultivate community disaster resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>At the operational level, Chandra et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> identified eight essential levers of community resilience: wellness, access, education, engagement, self-sufficiency, partnership, quality, and efficiency.</s><s>In this model, community resilience is composed of the social and economic well-being of a community, physical and psychological health of a population, effective risk communication, social connection and integration, and involvement of both governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</s><s>Prior empirical research, such as the study of Leykin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> in Israel and the investigation of Pfefferbaum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> in an impoverished urban community in the United States revealed that the number of years living in a community, engagement with or volunteering in local entities/activities for DRR, having permanent relationships, and home ownership were positively correlated with perceived community resilience, whereas gender, home emergency preparedness, total family income, employment status, past emergency situations, and level of education had no statistically significant impact.</s><s>In another study with affiliated volunteer responders in an American community, Pfefferbaum and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> indicated that the completion of a basic training program in disaster response and the interest in deploying such a program within a community was negatively associated with the responders' perception of community resilience.</s></p><p><s>Disaster management has long been a major concern in China because China experiences a considerable number of natural disasters due to its vast territory, as well as complicated climate and geological conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>.</s><s>Since 2008, when the destructive Wenchuan earthquake (Magnitude = 8.0) caused approximately 87,150 casualties and enormous economic losses, a variety of natural disasters, including the Yushu earthquake (M = 7.1), Zhouqu debris flow, Lushan earthquake (M = 7.0), Maoxian landslide, and Jiuzhaigou earthquake (M = 7.0), have afflicted Chinese mainland especially in the southwest region.</s><s>In the course of responding to these disasters, the disaster management capacity of China has been boosted with a noteworthy shift in disaster management policy and planning from a focus on disaster response and recovery to an equal emphasis on DRR and prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>.</s><s>A series of community-based DRR programs in disaster-prone areas have been promoted by governmental and non-governmental organizations for the enhancement of community disaster resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>These programs usually involve cross-sector risk investigations with community members, education and training, early warning and emergency response drills.</s><s>The primary approaches to these activities are to increase a community's safety awareness, preparedness for disasters, and both self-help and mutual help capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Researchers and practitioners are still being challenged to deal with the resilience of a community at the conceptual level (i.e., defining and identifying resilient actions), the operational level (i.e., modeling the resilient behavior of communities in a framework), and the empirical level (i.e., collecting and analyzing data on community resilience) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, this study contributes to the understanding of community resilience in the Chinese context using recently collected empirical data.</s><s>It can improve our knowledge on community resilience both theoretically and practically, as the concept of community resilience is still in its fledgling stage in China, despite the very limited studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study explores the roles of current DRR activities in promoting community resilience to disasters.</s><s>With a brief review of studies on community resilience and DRR activities, we reported the research methods, including the description of the study area, the instrument and measurements, the participants, and data analysis strategies.</s><s>Then the descriptive analysis of the participation of DRR activities, the perception of community resilience, and the correlation between participants' DRR behaviors and perceived community resilience were presented.</s><s>Finally, the implication of this study on improving the existing resilience-building efforts for policymakers, practitioners, and academic researchers was discussed.</s></p></div>

strength of this study is associated with survey item 4 "People in my community help each other", and the primary community resilience weakness is associated with survey item 6 "My community has the resources it needs to take care of community problems".</s></p><p><s>Previous research has already stressed the scarcity of community resources, such as inadequate infrastructure, underdeveloped transportation, poor communication systems, and the absence of partnerships with private sectors or civil society organizations, for disaster prevention and mitigation in rural China as compared with urban neighborhoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, the community under study is not without advantages, such as close connection and mutual care, as reflected by the primary community resilience strength.</s><s>One explanation for the observed strength could be the "geography-based acquaintances society" characterized by close connection and mutual help among community members, especially in rural China <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>.</s><s>The study of Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> reinforced this idea as rural villagers scored higher than urban residents for items in the Connection and Caring domain (p &lt; 0.05).</s><s>The relations of mutual support among neighbors is a primary component of social capital, the role of which in the enhancement of community resilience has already been widely recognized and promoted <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the continuous investment of resources in rural areas with effective use of local strengths in a culturally responsive manner is suggested for DRR policy, planning, and practice.</s></p><p><s>Unlike prior studies in China focusing on preparedness activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>, this paper highlighted the importance of DRR activities in promoting community resilience.</s><s>In particular, those voluntarily involved in community-based DRR activities are more likely to have a more positive perception of their community's disaster resilience.</s><s>This finding is in line with the study of Pfefferbaum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, who found a positive correlation between engagement with local DRR activities and perceived community resilience in an impoverished urban community in the United States.</s><s>One explanation may be that such engagement simultaneously increases residents' awareness of their community's situation and promoting the realization of their capacities to make a difference to the community.</s><s>In turn, participants' awareness of their self-efficacy and knowledge of disaster preparedness (i.e., social cognitive factors) might potentially encourage their future engagement in the resilience-building campaign <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Shaw <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> also argued for the importance of community participation in DRR for both the process and content as the main actors, since the community will ultimately benefit from improved disaster resilience and development.</s></p><p><s>This study also reveals that people who received disaster education would have a perception of higher community resilience than those who did not receive such education, but this finding is not supported by a study with a group of affiliated volunteer responders in an American community <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s><s>The latter study found the completion of basic training in disaster response was negatively associated with participants' perceptions of communities' Transformative Potential.</s><s>Disaster education/training programs that differ in their contents or processes may be the cause of such a discrepancy.</s><s>In any case, the design of community-specific DRR educational programs has already been recognized as a necessary component of DRR planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>.</s><s>Community-based evacuation drills is another intrinsic component of DRR programs worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>.</s><s>Particular attention should be given to the comparatively high percentage of people who had ever participated in evacuation drills (62%), because it may reflect some extent a satisfactory degree of community engagement at Yingxiu town.</s><s>Moreover, among all the four DRR activities in this study, the percentage of people who had participated in evacuation drills was the highest.</s><s>A study of the Great Shake Out campaign in Southern California also found that the majority of respondents (71%) had participated in the drop, cover and hold drill while they seemed much less interested in other activities such as joining MySpace (0%) and Facebook (3%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>.</s><s>The positive correlations between the participation of people in evacuation drills and their perceived community resilience as uncovered by this study, may have reinforced current DRR planning and supported the further development of relevant programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the same vein, the preparation of emergency supplies such as food and medicine at home is positively related to the perception of community resilience among this study's participants, but the correlation is only significant in the domain of Resources.</s><s>This differs from the findings of a previous study conducted in Israel <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, which indicated no statistically significant correlation between home emergency preparedness and community resilience.</s><s>The reasons for this contrary finding may be due to the differences between the Chinese and Israeli cultures, and in the measurements of community resilience that were used.</s><s>The CART Assessment Survey was adopted in this study while the Conjoint Community Resiliency Assessment Measure was used in Israel's study.</s><s>Moreover, of the four DRR activities in the current study, preparing emergency supplies at home involves less community interaction than the other three and has the least correlation with the five domains of the CART.</s><s>It is also the only one of the four DRR activities that reveal no significant correlation with the overall community resilience.</s><s>This result may imply that the underlying factor promoting the individual perception of community resilience to disaster can be active community interaction, especially given that prior research in other post-disaster rural communities has already found a significant positive correlation between placed-based social cohesion and perceived community resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, provided that community relations or networks are primary components of social capital, future research could examine the association between social capital and perceived community resilience; it is also worth going one step further to explore if anything that increases social capital within community could have the same effect in promoting community resilience.</s></p><p><s>Higher income levels reported by the participants also significantly contributed to their perception of community resilience.</s><s>This might be partly because participants with higher income were more likely to participant in resilience-building activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>.</s><s>The economic well-being of a community has already been widely recognized as a core component of community resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref>.</s><s>Zhu <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref> argued that the extent to which a community could endure the impact of or recover from a disaster largely relied on its economic condition, such as economic capital, income security, and multiple income structures.</s><s>At the family level, evidence suggests that families with better economic status before a disaster would be more likely to bounce back <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, investments in boosting the capacity of the individual household by providing financial assistance and technical support seemed necessary for better recovery after a disaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>.</s><s>Nonetheless, while lower income may cause families in a shortage of financial assets, it does not necessarily reduce their relational and social support assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>.</s><s>This may explain why participants from economically disadvantaged communities will perceive a lack of resources but a strong sense of attachment at the same time <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, sense of community and traditions of mutual help have already been seen as key assets in many local neighborhoods especially where people feel they are in need of protection to avoid economic instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>.</s><s>For people with lower incomes, therefore, the community as a major source of social support and mutual help may be a more important asset compared to people with higher incomes.</s><s>However, this study failed to support the correlations between age, ethnicity, gender, education, employment status, and marital status with an individual's perception of community resilience.</s><s>These results are consistent with previous research findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Besides the contributions discussed above, this study did have at least three limitations.</s><s>First, although the findings from this cross-sectional survey would be instructive for an understanding of community resilience in rural China, what the study presented was the statistical correlations between research participants' DRR activities, socio-demographic factors, and their perceived community resilience.</s><s>Thus, practice research of quasi-experimental research design or randomized controlled trials into DRR programs would help clarify the causal relationship between specific DRR activities and community disaster resilience.</s><s>Second, we used a relatively small sample from one of the most disrupted towns in the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.</s><s>Studies covering larger population in rural and urban communities in China are needed to provide more representative knowledge on community resilience.</s><s>Last but not least, we only used one tool (CART) in this study to assess people's perception of community resilience.</s><s>Investigations using other alternative community resilience assessment tools, such as Chang's framework focusing on physical aspect <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61]</ref>, or Cutter's indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62]</ref>, to cross-check the reliability and validity of varied tools in assessing community resilience will provide more knowledge about resilience from the theoretical perspective.</s></p></div>
