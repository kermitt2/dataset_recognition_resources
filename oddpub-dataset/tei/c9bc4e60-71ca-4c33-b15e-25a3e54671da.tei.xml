<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations frequently cause neurological diseases.</s><s>Modeling of these defects has been difficult because of the challenges associated with engineering mtDNA.</s><s>We show here that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) retain the parental mtDNA profile and exhibit a metabolic switch toward oxidative phosphorylation.</s><s>NPCs derived in this way from patients carrying a deleterious homoplasmic mutation in the mitochondrial gene MT-ATP6 (m.9185T&gt;C) showed defective ATP production and abnormally high mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), plus altered calcium homeostasis, which represents a potential cause of neural impairment.</s><s>High-content screening of FDA-approved drugs using the MMP phenotype highlighted avanafil, which we found was able to partially rescue the calcium defect in patient NPCs and differentiated neurons.</s><s>Overall, our results show that iPSC-derived NPCs provide an effective model for drug screening to target mtDNA disorders that affect the nervous system.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gorman et al., 2015)</ref> suffers from deleterious mtDNA mutations that can cause metabolic disorders and typically lead to dysfunctions of the nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carelli and Chan, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Recent breakthroughs in the field of mitochondrial medicine might yield methods to prevent the transmission of pathogenic mtDNA mutations in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Mitalipov and Wolf, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Reddy et al., 2015)</ref>; but, currently no cures or effective interventional therapies are available for patients who have already inherited the mutations and are subject to such disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pfeffer et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The development of new treatment options has been hampered by a lack of relevant models for mtDNA-related diseases, largely due to the challenges of engineering mtDNA.</s><s>mtDNA mutations can be introduced into mouse germ cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Inoue et al., 2000)</ref>, or they can be induced to occur as a consequence of a proofreading-deficient DNA polymerase gamma <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kauppila et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>However, the generated mouse models cannot recapitulate the heteroplasmy or tissue specificity of mtDNA disorders.</s><s>The most important cellular models of mtDNA diseases are based on cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids), obtained by fusing immortalized human cell lines depleted of mtDNA with patient-derived enucleated cells.</s><s>These models have permitted the identification of some of the cellular and molecular consequences that follow from mutations in mtDNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(King and Attardi, 1989)</ref>.</s><s>But cybrids cannot address the effects that result from the interplay between mitochondrial DNA and specific characteristics of an individual patient's nuclear DNA, which have been shown to influence the course of these diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Be ´nit et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">D'Aurelio et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, the bioenergetics of cybrids depend on glycolysis, whereas the neuronal cells that are symptomatic rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abramov et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carelli and Chan, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>These significant differences limit the extent to which cybrids can be used as models in searching for new types of therapies.</s><s>Here we suggest an innovative, more potent alternative in the form of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which have the characteristics needed in a model to study neurological diseases caused by mtDNA mutations and set up drug discovery pipelines to treat them.</s><s>NPCs can be rapidly obtained from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), either through an intermediate generation of rosettes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Koch et al., 2009)</ref> or the direct application of a cocktail of small molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Li et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Reinhardt et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>We previously have shown that mitochondria undergo morphological and metabolic reconfigurations upon the generation of iPSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Prigione et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Here we further demonstrate that, when iPSCs are put through the steps of neural induction to become NPCs, their mitochondria undergo maturation and a metabolic shift toward neuronal-like oxidative metabolism, while entirely retaining the mitochondrial genome of the parent cell from which they were originally derived.</s></p><p><s>To examine whether NPCs represent a valid cellular system for compound screening approaches for mtDNA diseases, we generated iPSC-derived NPCs from three patients carrying the mutation m.9185T&gt;C in the MT-ATP6 gene for ATP synthase (complex V) in a homoplasmic state (i.e., affecting all mtDNA molecules).</s><s>This mutation is a recurrent cause of neurological diseases such as Leigh syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Moslemi et al., 2005)</ref>, neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Childs et al., 2007)</ref>, and episodic paralysis with spinal neuropathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aure ´et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Patient-derived NPCs exhibited functional alterations, including decreases in ATP production, abnormally high mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and altered calcium homeostasis.</s><s>We developed a high-content screening (HCS) strategy based on the patient MMP phenotype, and we used it to screen a library of FDA-approved compounds.</s><s>The phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor avanafil, a compound that reduced the mitochondrial hyperpolarization, also partially rescued the calcium defect in both patient NPCs and differentiated neurons.</s><s>These findings suggest that iPSC-derived NPCs represent an effective model system to analyze mechanisms underlying mtDNA-related neuro-logical disorders and to carry out personalized phenotypic drug discovery for diseases that have been untreatable until now.</s></p></div>
