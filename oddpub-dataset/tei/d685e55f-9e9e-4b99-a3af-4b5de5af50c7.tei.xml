International Agency for Research on Cancer from WHO reveals that if the estimated trends continue, the incidence of all cancer cases will raise from 12.7 million new cases in 2008 to 21.2 million by 2030 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Facing such an alarming disease progression, varieties of therapies have been developed but expected efficiency has still not been reached.</s><s>Cancer is a genetic disease induced by many factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The process of neoplastic cell apoptosis and its regulation and control factors are the hotspot of investigation in recent years.</s><s>Gene therapy is tried to be realized through inducing cell apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>On one hand, gene therapy is considered to be a safe and effective treatment by using exogenous nucleic acids as therapeutic agents, which has the potential to depress oncogenes and restrain the proliferation of intractable tumors and has no effect on normal cells.</s><s>However, the easy degradation in biological fluids and the low cellular uptake efficiency of nucleic acids cause gene therapy strongly subject to the development of gene vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>All in all, gene transfection is the key technique of gene therapy.</s><s>At present, more and more attention is focused on non-viral vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Polyethylenimine (PEI) is a kind of typical cationic polymer which has large amount of positive charge can form condensed complex with DNA spontaneously through electrostatic interactions.</s><s>Due to its highly effective gene transfection, PEI has gained a remarkable interest in the field of nonviral gene delivery system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>However, testing of PEI vectors in preclinical studies identified several drawbacks: the contradiction between toxicity and transfection efficiency, lacking of specific tumor targeting ability, low transfection capacity in vivo.</s></p><p><s>Chitosan is a natural cationic non-toxic polysaccharide, which has been regarded as a fascinated candidate for transfection as it is biodegradable and biocompatible <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>This attribute has been fully reflected in chitosan-mediated gene transfection systems.</s><s>However, several problems need to be solved before practical application such as insolubility at physiological pH, and low transfection efficiency in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It has been proved that PEI derivatives obtained by cross-linking low-molecular-weight (LMW) PEI with degradable materials display higher transfection efficiency and lower cytotoxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>To salve the conflict between the high cytotoxicity and low transfection efficiency of gene vector, a new polymer has been synthesized by covalent linkage between the activated chitosan OTMCS and non-toxic low molecularPEI (2 KDa) firstly, and was named OTMCS-PEI.</s><s>As what we have reported in that paper, OTMCS-PEI revealed lower cytotoxicity for the property of degrading into small molecules after uptake into the cells.</s><s>However, the transfection efficiency of the polymeric gene vector is not high enough and it was worth improving its tumor targeting <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The strategy for incorporating ligand peptide with favorite characteristics into target molecules has been the most considerable method in developing target specific non-viral gene delivery systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Integrin αvβ3 receptor is highly expressed in tumor cells whereas rarely detectable on quiescent blood vessels.</s><s>This character allows for its use as a suitable target for gene vector.</s><s>Knowing that arginine-glycine-aspartate-cysteine (RGDC) peptide is a key binding moiety that has been shown to bind specifically to αvβ3 integrin receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Cell membrane prevents xenobiotic from entering unless an active transport mechanism involved, which happens mainly with specific peptides.</s><s>TAT peptide is one of the proteinderived peptides, which has been reported capable of facilitating the cellular uptake of macromolecular particles.</s><s>The commonly used transduction domain of TAT extends from residues 47-57: Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg-Gln-Arg-Arg-Arg <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we used RGDC peptide conjunction with TAT to yield a new chimeric peptide RGDC-NLS (named R13), and bifunctional peptide R11 to modify PEI derivates respectively, in order to improve cell selection, promote cargo transport and enhance transfection efficiency.</s></p><p><s>The polymer OTMCS-PEI-R13 has showed low cytotoxicity as OTMCS-PEI, and higher transfection in vitro.</s><s>With the following in vivo studies, gene transfection efficiency was found to be much lower compared with in vitro.</s><s>The main reason is that the transport manner of complexes across nucleus membrane in vivo is different from in vitro.</s><s>DNA complexes get into nucleus via mitosis in vitro as tumor cells are in division phase, while most of the target cells in vivo are non-dividing, which makes it more difficult for gene transport.</s><s>Lack of capacity to cross the nucleus membrane seems to be the principle cause of the low transfection efficiency observed in vivo study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is one of the major limitations for plasmid DNA to entry into the nucleus from the cytoplasm.</s><s>Several groups have demonstrated that the attachment of a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) either directly to DNA or to polymers that form complexes with DNA lead to an increased nuclear import of DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, especially in vivo tranfection with the non-dividing cells, resulting in enhanced protein expression.</s><s>Talsma has declared that PEI conjugated to σ1-NLS performed substantially better as a transfection agent than PEI alone.</s><s>With σ1-NLS, 69% of the internalized protein was recovered in the nuclear fraction after 6 h compared to just 10% when using unmodified σ1.</s><s>At the same time, transfection of cells with PEI-σ1-NLS-DNA complexes resulted in an average 16-fold increase in luciferase activity compared to cells transfected with PEI-DNA.</s><s>These results suggested that σ1-NLS is an efficient targeting ligand for non-viral gene delivery system based on PEI <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Macromolecule mediated by NLS is actively transported to nucleus via nuclear pore complex (NPC), and NLS of SV40 T-antigen with the major functional sequence Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys (KKKRK) was discovered firstly and has been the major research object.</s><s>Therefore, we used the linear peptide R13 (RGDC-TAT), in conjunction with NLS to yield a novel peptide, RGDC-TAT (49-57)-NLS, named R18.</s><s>The trifunctional R18 can adhere to tumor cells by targeting to αvβ3 receptors, facilitate the cellular uptake and nuclear transport of polyplexes.</s><s>Then we adopted R18 to modify OTMCS-PEI to prepare a new non-viral gene vector (OTMCS-PEI-R18).</s><s>The new gene vector was characterized in terms of its chemical structure and biophysical parameters.</s><s>Gene transfection efficiency of this vector was validated by in vitro and in vivo studies.</s><s>Chemical inhibitors specific to various intracellular pathways and confocal laser scanning microscopy have been applied to investigate its nuclear transport.</s><s>The purpose of the present study was to find a gene vector with low cytotoxicity and high transfection efficiency in vivo.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synthesis and characterization of OTMCS-PEI-R18</head><p><s>The degradable PEI derivates of OTMCS-PEI were synthesized by linking PEI 2 kDa with OTMCS and then conjugated with a trifunctional peptide R18 to prepare a new nonviral gene delivery vector OTMCS-PEI-R18 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>As for OTMCS-PEI, the free hydroxyl groups of OTMCS were activated by succinimidyl carbonate in advance and then linked to the amino groups of PEI.</s><s>SMCC was used as a crosslinker to conjugate OTMCS-PEI with R18.</s><s>Comparing OTMCS-PEI with OTMCS-PEI-R18, the proton peaks of OTMCS-PEI-R18 moved to the lower magnet field due to the production of the groups with electronic screening effect from R18.</s><s>The performances of characteristic peaks have changed, the proton peaks at OTMCS-PEI and OTMCS-PEI-R18 were further characterized using MALDI-TOF (Fig 3A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">and 3B</ref>).</s><s>Due to the high polydispersity of our polymers and the resulting mass discrimination against high-mass oligomers in the MALDI-TOF spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, the molecular weight distribution of OTMCS-PEI and OTMCS-PEI-R18 can hardly be accurately determined using the results.</s><s>However, compared with the position of the peaks in the spectrum of OTMCS-PEI, peaks in the spectrum of OTMCS-PEI-R18 have been shifted towards the higher mass rang.</s><s>Such a shift indicated that the molecular mass of OTMCS-PEI-R18 is higher than OTMC-S-PEI, suggesting successful cross-linking of OTMCS-PEI with R18 by SMCC.</s></p></div>
