<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Modernisation of societies has resulted in the high reliance of technology, especially in the workplace; and with this, comes the increasing trend of workplace sedentary behaviour (SB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>SB is denoted by low levels of energy expenditure in a sitting or reclining posture, prevalent in the domains relating to occupation, transportation, and recreation/leisure activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Common SB may include excessive sitting related to television viewing, video game playing, computer or other screen device use, driving automobiles, and reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>An individual can engage in excessive sitting while still meeting the recommendations of 150 min of physical activity (PA) per week in daily activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is important to note that SB is distinct from being physically inactive <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>High SB engagement has been associated with an increased risk for allcause mortality, higher body mass index (BMI), and an array of chronic conditions, while a reduction in excessive SB may have beneficial health impacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr"

a large portion of today's workforce in officebased settings and the large amount of daily waking hours spent at work, occupation-related SB is of critical public health concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Across 20 different countries, the median sitting time on a usual weekday was reported to be five hours per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan were among the sampled countries that reported higher median sitting times, close to six hours per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In other studies conducted in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and Australia that used objective and self-report measurements of SB, adults may spend nearly nine hours per day sedentary <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>These trends are similar in Singapore.</s><s>It was found that about 37 % of Singaporean adults aged 18 to 79 years engage in excessive sitting for more than eight hours per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In examining domain-specific SB, studies have shown that on a typical working day an individual may spend more than half the day sedentary, in bouts of 30 min or more <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>While sitting in the workplace is heavily dependent on the occupation type and types of tasks involved, workforces of many industrialized nations are professional jobs in office-type settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>In Singapore, approximately 80 % of the nation's workforce is in professional occupations, presumably engaging in high levels of SB at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Specific to the work place domain, a variety of factors may influence SB, such as personal habits, social norms of sitting at a desk, or the availability of certain office furniture.</s><s>This is in line with a socio-ecological model of health which conceptualizes multiple levels of influence, including intrapersonal-, interpersonal-, organizational-, environmental-and policy-related factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>It is therefore necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of SB and relevant factors to appropriately establish behaviour change interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Currently, research in the area of work-related SB is in a nascent stage with no standard in assessment of SB, as both self-report and objective assessment offer distinct information <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>Combining different methods of assessments may yield more in depth information on SB <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>There appears to be a scarcity of published research aimed at combining different methodological assessments for a more comprehensive understanding of SB.</s><s>Therefore, to address the current gaps in the literature, the objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive workplace SB assessment.</s><s>Specifically, this study aims to describe SB among Singaporean office-based workers.</s><s>It further aims to identify individual, interpersonal, organizational and environmental barriers and potential strategies towards the reduction of SB among office workers in Singapore.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approach</head><p><s>Under the socio-ecological framework, this crosssectional study used a mixed-method approach in assessing different levels of influences on SB in the workplace.</s><s>Both quantitative and qualitative data related to workplace SB were collected.</s><s>This study was approved by the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board (NUS IRB reference B14-060).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setting and sample</head><p><s>For this study, eligible participants were recruited from a professional school within a local flagship university if they met the following inclusion criteria: non-academic staff, office-based workers ≥21 years old, working ≥4 days per week, proficient in English, not physically disabled or handicapped, and not pregnant.</s><s>Among 180 office-based employees of the professional school, all were invited to join the research study through multiple personal engagements at school-level meetings, senior management announcements, and department-wide mass emails.</s><s>During recruitment sessions, interested and eligible participants were enrolled after signing the informed consent.</s><s>All assessment measures were collected from July to September 2014.</s><s>Anthropometric measurements were taken and accelerometers were distributed with instructions for wear and return.</s><s>Over the course of three months, a total of 10 recruitment and enrolment sessions were held.</s><s>Out of 180 office staff, 43 were enrolled as participants and 40 completed all assessment measures.</s><s>The worksite for this particular professional school spans across two separate, but inter-connected buildings.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures Quantitative</head><p><s>A series of quantitative measures via self-report questionnaires and objective measures were used to capture SB among participants.</s><s>An online survey was developed using Qualtrics 2014 comprising of previously used questionnaires on sociodemographic characteristics, overall and domain-specific SB on working and nonworking days, PA, current health status and lifestyle behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>For details of the survey, refer to Additional file 1.</s></p><p><s>Anthropometric measurements were taken by two trained research staff using a digital column weighing scale (Seca 769) with measuring rod (Seca 220) attached.</s><s>Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg without objects in pockets or heavy jackets.</s><s>Height was measured nearest 0.1 cm without shoes and the participant was looking straight forward.</s><s>Waist and hip circumferences were measured using a flexible measuring tape to nearest 1 cm.</s><s>All anthropometric measurements were taken twice to ensure accuracy.</s><s>Body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) were subsequently calculated.</s><s>BMI was categorized based on the cut off points for Asian populations: 18.5-22.9</s><s>kg/m 2 as "normal", 23-27.4</s><s>kg/m 2 as "overweight", and ≥27.5 kg/m 2 as "obese" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Actigraph GT3X + BT accelerometers were worn for one week to objectively capture SB and PA.</s><s>The device was placed over the right hip and attached by an elastic band to secure around the waist.</s><s>In addition, participants were given an accelerometer time sheet to indicate their transportation time to travel from places, working hours on working days, time spent for any structured exercise, duration of time and reasons for not wearing the accelerometer based on each day over the week.</s><s>Of those enrolled, 37 participants provided valid accelerometer data.</s></p><p><s>An observational, environmental audit was performed in the workplace environment using an adapted version of the Checklist for Health Promotion Environments at the Worksite (CHEW) tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The CHEW instrument is designed to assess three major environments at a worksite, the physical building environment, the information environment, and the surrounding neighbourhood environment.</s><s>For full details of the scoring protocol, please refer to Additional file 2. Given that CHEW was developed for use in the United States and Australia, some adaptations were made to account for the local context in Singapore [Additional file 2].</s><s>Specific elements related to SB, such as adjustable workstations and standing meeting rooms, were also assessed.</s><s>A full description of the adaptation and additional elements can be found in Additional file 2. The observational audit was conducted in August 2014; both buildings of the worksite were assessed on the same day.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative</head><p><s>A focus group discussion (FGD) grounded in the socioecological model was conducted to elicit an in-depth understanding of the perceived individual, interpersonal, organizational and environmental determinants and identify potential strategies towards reducing SB among the participants.</s><s>Topics and domains covered in the FGD included perceived difference between SB and PA, barriers to reducing SB, possible opportunities and strategies within their workplace to reduce SB.</s><s>The FGD was conducted in August 2014 during working hours with six participants who met all eligibility criteria and were already enrolled into the study.</s><s>All quantitative individual data (i.e., from survey, measured anthropometrics, accelerometer time sheet-working hours from workdays) were compiled into a single database.</s><s>Accelerometry data processing and analysis was conducted based on the "accelerometry" package in R (Version 3.1.3)</s><s>using the following established counts per minute cut points applied to the vertical axis: sedentary (&lt;150), light (150-2019), moderate (2020-5998), vigorous (&gt;5999) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Only participants who wore the accelerometer for at least four days with at least 10 h per day were included in the accelerometry analyses.</s><s>To account for differences in individual wear time, the proportion of time spent in each activity category relative to the entire wear time was used.</s><s>CHEW data was entered and analysed descriptively separately.</s><s>Using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) 23.0, descriptive analyses were conducted on individual-level data including frequencies and medians (IQR) to describe SB among the sample participants.</s><s>Differences in distribution of activity minutes between workdays and non-workdays were tested using the Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test.</s></p><p><s>The focus group discussion was transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was conducted.</s><s>A priori themes were established based on the socio-ecological model for levels of influence.</s><s>Two independent coders coded the data into meaning units with 80 % agreement.</s><s>For each unit of disagreement, the coders held a discussion until consensus was reached.</s><s>Meaning units were clustered into higher order themes.</s></p></div>
