<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>objeCtives: LPLD is an ultra-orphan genetic lipid disorder (prevalence 1-2/million).</s><s>It is associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia and an increased risk of acute pancreatitis.</s><s>Other manifestations include eruptive xanthoma, fatigue, difficulty with concentrating and cardiopulmonary symptoms.</s><s>Associated symptoms, complications and the fat-restricted diet affect Quality of Life (QOL).</s><s>Currently no disease-specific measure exists to assess QOL and the burden of LPLD.</s><s>As part of post approval commitments of alipogene tiparvovec, regulatory bodies requested the development of a reliable measure of QOL in LPLD.</s><s>This study evaluates existing EORTC questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26, and a new questionnaire of disease burden devised by clinicians with experience in treating LPLD.</s><s>Methods: To date, eight genetically confirmed LPLD-patients from four countries assessed the relevance and importance of each item of the three questionnaires.</s><s>Patients' ratings were discussed during an in-depth, face-to-face interview and the disease burden questionnaire was comprehensively discussed, analyzed and then modified where necessary.</s><s>Results: Quantitative assessment showed that 25 (45%) of the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 questions were relevant to the majority of patients.</s><s>The most relevant items were pain (6), fatigue and sleeping problems (4), digestive and dietary factors (4), work, daily and social activity restrictions (4) and impact on emotional functioning (3).</s><s>Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the new questionnaire highlighted the unpredictability of pancreatitis attacks and the impact of the strict low fat diet on social and emotional factors.</s><s>Less common clinical manifestations of LPLD (xanthoma, dyspnea) were very important to those affected.</s><s>The new questionnaire has been modified and items on alcohol use and painkillers added for ongoing evaluation.</s><s>ConClusions: Five QOL domains relevant to LPLD have been identified using existing questionnaires.</s><s>A new disease-specific questionnaire identifies significant impacts on patients' lives.</s><s>These instruments may help clinicians to effectively use pharmacological and genetic therapy to manage LPLD patients.</s></p></div>
