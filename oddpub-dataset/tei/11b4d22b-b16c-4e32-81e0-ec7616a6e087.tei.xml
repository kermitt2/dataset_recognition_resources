<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Even in high-income countries some population groups depend on food banks to support their food intake.</s><s>We aimed to explore and compare health and nutritional status of food bank clients (Tafel e.V.) in different cities in Germany.</s><s>Methods: In a cross-sectional study, self-reported health and nutritional status of food bank clients living in three cities (Berlin -capital, Ludwigsburg-affluent city, Fulda -small town) which differ in size, available income and poverty rate, were assessed and compared to survey variables of the low socioeconomic status population of national surveys (DEGS and GEDA).</s><s>Results: Across cities, food bank clients (N = 276, response rate of 21.5 %) did not differ in main socio-demographic characteristics (age, nationality, education, professional qualification, household income).</s><s>Smoking, having at least one chronic illness, estimating their own health status as moderate to poor and low consumption of fruits and vegetables were common characteristics.</s><s>Comparing selected variables with the low socioeconomic status population of DEGS and GEDA, differences were found for a higher prevalence of diabetes among food bank clients and a worse self-reported health status.</s><s>Considerably lower fruit consumption and lower hypertension prevalence among female and lower overweight rates among male food bank clients were found.</s><s>Conclusions: Although people using food banks vary in socio-demographic background, no differences for main demographics across the cities were found.</s><s>In addition, the study suggests that for some health-and nutritionrelated variables, national surveys in Germany might underestimate socioeconomic differences.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Several study limitations need to be mentioned.</s><s>The use of self-reported questionnaires in general has several limitations such as response, recall or selection bias.</s><s>Proneness to bias is particularly prevalent in self-reported height and weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the relatively high education level among our sample might have been caused by our study procedures.</s><s>It is possible that food bank clients with lower educational status were hesitant in participating, a fact that has been repeatedly described <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39]</ref>.</s><s>Another possible selection bias could have occurred by using a Russian questionnaire in Fulda and having a Turkish speaking researcher in Berlin.</s><s>Speaking the native language appears to promote participation and might have disproportionally increased the number of foreigners.</s><s>However, looking at the data, this appears to be only the case in Fulda.</s></p><p><s>Another limitation is the difference in time of data collection and the use of a slightly different array of questions used across locations.</s><s>In Berlin, data collection took place during the fall and about three years earlier (October and November, 2010) than in Ludwigsburg (May and June, 2013) or Fulda (April, 2014).</s><s>Therefore, existing differences could also be explained by time.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, the results of comparing food bank clients with the low SES population of DEGS and GEDA should be treated with caution.</s><s>Data of the DEGS and the GEDA were obtained from published articles and not original databases and the differences in age distribution between the nationwide surveys and our study population might have played a role.</s></p><p><s>Overall, given the small sample size, our results need to be seen as explorative in nature and not generalizable for German people with low SES or for all food bank clients.</s></p></div>
