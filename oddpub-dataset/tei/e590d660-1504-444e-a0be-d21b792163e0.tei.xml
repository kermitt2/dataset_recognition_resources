<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Using a linear array of 16 electrodes (Michigan probe), we recorded the extracellular local field potentials (LFPs) in the hindlimb area of the primary somatosensory cortex in the anesthetized rats, while optogenetically stimulating layer 5 (L5) of the cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>Layer-specific light delivery was achieved with a micro-periscope consisting of a 0.18 mm x 0.18 mm micro rightangled prism, a custom-designed Grin lens, and a multi-mode optical fiber (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Microinjection of adeno-associated virus conjugated with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and a CaMKIIα promoter to L5 was used to restrict expression of ChR2 predominantly to L5 pyramidal neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>The fluorescence image of the cortical slices taken from the recorded rats showed the confined viral expression in L5 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A novel method to evoke dendritic Ca 2+ spikes in vivo.</s><s>Ca 2+ spikes can be evoked in L5 pyramidal neurons by depolarizing the apical dendritic initiation zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Light pulses delivered to L2/3 caused a sink in these layers, however we chose not to use this approach because it was difficult to separate the effect of the ChR2 current from activation of voltage-sensitive postsynaptic currents.</s><s>We therefore chose a second method for evoking dendritic Ca 2+ spikes based on the "critical frequency" approach that uses high-frequency backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) generated at the soma <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>This method has been shown to activate the same dendritic Ca 2+ channels as direct dendritic depolarization in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and has been shown to be effective in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>By activating ChR2 in L5, we avoided the confounding influence on the LFP that would otherwise have occurred by direct activation of ChR2 in the dendrites (i.e., via light to L2/3).</s><s>In other words, we could remotely activate the L5 dendrites without directly stimulating the apical dendrites either optically or synaptically.</s></p><p><s>A single pulse of light (10-30 ms) delivered to L5 reliably caused a current sink in L5 in all cases (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>) but also, in 67.8 ± 23.7 (mean ± SD, n = 17 animals) % of trials with maximum light amplitudes, we observed an additional sink in the upper and middle layers at distances corresponding to the typical location of dendritic Ca 2+ spikes 8 ~20 ms after the offset of the light stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, the current sink in L2/3 was reliably accompanied by a current source in L1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, f and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>The late sink in L2/3 was sometimes "simple", and sometimes "complex" in form (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>, right) and had variable amplitudes (0.48 ± 0.05 mV, n = 17 rats).</s><s>In the remaining cases, there was no discernable late sink at all (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>, bottom left).</s><s>Current source density (CSD) analysis of the evoked potentials revealed that the second sink was initiated at 613 ± 27 μm below the pia and propagated in both directions, upward and downward (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f</ref>).</s><s>The sink was also highly dependent on stimulus strength with a sharp increase occurring at higher light amplitudes (p &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOVA with post hoc multiple comparison, n = 17 animals, Fig. <ref type="figure">1g</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The sink in L2/3 therefore bore all the hallmarks of a dendritic Ca 2+ spike including location, timing and a sharp dependence on the strength of somatic activation.</s><s>To investigate this possibility, we performed a number of tests.</s><s>First, we repeated the optogenetic stimulation experiments combined with a second micro-periscope for recording Ca 2+ fluorescence in L2/3 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1h</ref>, left).</s><s>For these experiments, a Ca 2+ indicator (Cal-590 AM) with a long excitation wavelength (550 nm) to avoid direct activation of ChR2 was injected to L5.</s><s>The light through this microperiscope was shone tonically throughout the experiment so that any residual effect was not time locked to the ChR2 stimulation in L5.</s><s>Here, optogenetic activation of L5 caused an all-or-none fluorescence transient in L2/3 (at higher stimulus strengths) similar to the current sink seen earlier (Fig. <ref type="figure">1h</ref>, right).</s><s>Here the term all-or-none is used to describe the fact that the late sink, while it varied in amplitude and duration, was entirely absent in a significant number of cases resulting in a bimodal amplitude distribution (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>This is consistent with the late sink correlating with a thresholded event such as a dendritic Ca 2+ spike.</s><s>This Ca 2+ transient was dendritic because the indicator, applied in L5, could only have reached L2/3 by diffusing along the apical dendrites of L5 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> which suggested that the current sink seen earlier also corresponded to dendritic Ca 2+ currents.</s><s>However, to rule out contribution from other postsynaptic elements such as disynaptic firing of cells in L2/3 we injected 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 100 μM) into L2/3 and L5.</s><s>In these experiments, there was no change in the amplitude of the current sink in L2/3 (both p &gt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Fig. <ref type="figure">1i</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>We also measured multi-unit activity (MUA) in both L2/3 and L5 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1j</ref>), which did not show any significant increase of MUA before the onset of the late sink compared with the prestimulus period (all p &gt; 0.05, Student's paired t-test, n = 5 animals).</s><s>We therefore conclude that the late current sink in L2/3 was produced by currents in the dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have shown that dendritic Ca 2+ spikes are effectively blocked by the GABA B receptor agonist baclofen <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> due to down-regulation of Ca v 1 (L-type) channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Here, we found that the dendritic current sinks significantly decreased by local injection of 50 μM baclofen to L2/3 (from 0.39 ± 0.05 to 0.09 ± 0.01 mV, n = 5, p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1k</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Local injection of 3 μM TTX into L5 which would be expected to block APs in the L5 pyramidal neurons also significantly decreased the dendritic current sinks (from 0.43 ± 0.06 to 0.11 ± 0.02 mV, n = 3, p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test; Fig. <ref type="figure">1l</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>).</s><s>The late dendritic current sink was clearly not due to bAPs in the dendrites, because they would be expected to take only 1.5 ms to propagate 1 mm back along the dendrites in vivo at 0.67 m/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Taken together, we conclude that the current sink observed in the middle to upper layers was due to dendritic Ca 2+ spikes in L5 pyramidal neurons.</s></p><p><s>A Ca 2+ spike-evoked passive current source in L1.</s><s>The appearance of a passive current source in the superficial layers correlating with the Ca 2+ spike sink in L2/3 was an unexpected finding.</s><s>Several studies have observed that Ca 2+ spikes originate in the apical trunk dendrite and rarely propagate to the most distal tuft branches <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, the distal tuft branches have a high density of the non-selective cation channel (I h ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> that is spontaneously open, and previous in vitro studies showed that I h interacts with dendritic Ca 2+ spikes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> .</s><s>This spontaneous leak current may account for the pronounced source of passive current.</s><s>We tested this possibility by local application of I h blocker ZD7288 (500 μM) on the cortical surface (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>After ZD7288 application the second sink was elongated upward and the source was significantly reduced in both size and duration (all p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Fig. <ref type="figure">2b, c</ref>), suggesting that I h enhanced the passive current under control conditions.</s><s>By similar reasoning, we hypothesized that the source near the cortical surface produced by currents in the distal tuft dendrite should also lead to positively deflected potentials at the cortical surface.</s><s>Using a 4 by 4 surface electrode array (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>), we detected surface positive potentials that were 20-30 ms delayed after the onset of the dendritic Ca 2+ spikes measured at 600 μm deep below the pia (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>).</s><s>In all animals (n = 4) the evoked surface potentials were clearly detected at multiple electrodes that were 500 μm apart.</s><s>The surface potentials were also baclofen-sensitive (from 0.39 ± 0.13 to 0.01 ± 0.03 mV, n = 4, p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>) and clearly detectable even in the awake freely moving animals (n = 3) with similar characteristics (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a-c</ref>, all p &gt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test).</s></p><p><s>We conclude that apical dendritic Ca 2+ spikes are detectable as positive potentials at the cortical surface in both anesthetized and awake brain.</s></p><p><s>Sensory-evoked dendritic Ca 2+ spikes.</s><s>Having determined the impact of dendritic Ca 2+ spikes on surface potentials in the absence of synaptic input to the dendrite (i.e.</s><s>evoked by optogenetic stimulation of L5), we turned our attention to the effect of sensory-evoked Ca 2+ spikes on surface potentials.</s><s>We recorded LFPs, surface potentials, and Ca 2+ fluorescence in the same cortical area-the hindlimb area of the primary somatosensory cortex-while electrically stimulating the contralateral hindlimb (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).</s><s>Simultaneous recording of LFPs and Ca 2+ fluorescence revealed two distinct patterns of activity in response to hindlimb stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>).</s><s>The first kind of response showed a current sink across L2/3 and L5 approximately 10 ms after the stimulus onset, which corresponded to excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) as shown in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> .</s><s>The first current sink was correlated with a small Ca 2+ transient observed with the dendritic micro-periscope (Fig. <ref type="figure">5e</ref>, left).</s><s>The second type of response arrived ~50-60 ms after the stimulus and showed a second current sink in the middle and uppers layers with a similar amplitude and timing to the late Ca 2+ spike-evoked sink produced by optogenetic stimulation of L5 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>, right).</s><s>Moreover, the sensory-evoked late sink was accompanied by a large increase in dendritic Ca 2+ signal (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c, e</ref>) also similar in amplitude and duration to the optogenetically evoked dendritic Ca 2+ transient.</s><s>A principal component analysis of the LFP waveform (Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>) revealed that the second type of response could be further partitioned into simple or complex waveforms, with the complex waveforms accompanying larger dendritic Ca 2+ transients (Fig. <ref type="figure">5e</ref>, middle &amp; right).</s><s>Consistent with optogenetically evoked dendritic Ca 2+ spikes, the second current sink was initiated at 538 ± 57 μm below the pia, propagated in two directions (Fig. <ref type="figure">5f</ref>, right), and generated a passive current source in the superficial layers (Fig. <ref type="figure">5f</ref>, middle).</s><s>Moreover, in all animals (n = 8) this second current sink was abolished by local injection of baclofen in L2/3 (from 0.50 ± 0.12 to 0.00 ± 0.05 mV, p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Fig. <ref type="figure">5g</ref>) while the first current sink did not significantly change (from 0.73 ± 0.12 to 0.43 ± 0.07 mV, p &gt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>).</s><s>Lastly, the surface positive potentials passively generated by the second current sink were clearly detectable with the surface electrode array (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6a, b</ref>).</s><s>Many of these surface potentials were as large as those generated by the first current sink which was presumably due to synaptic input (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6b, c</ref>), although the average amplitude of the second current sink was smaller than the first (first: 0.71 ± 0.01 vs second: 0.59 ± 0.02 mV, n = 6 rats, p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test).</s><s>Moreover, the second surface spike was significantly wider than the first (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 6 animals, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6d</ref>, left) and importantly, optogenetically evoked surface potentials had a similar width (p &gt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6d</ref>, left).</s><s>The peak latency of the second spike was also similar to that of the optogenetically evoked surface potential (p &gt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6d</ref>, right).</s><s>Twophoton Ca 2+ imaging of individual dendrites of L5 pyramidal cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7a-c</ref>) and simultaneous recording of surface potentials further revealed the strong correlation between the amplitude of the second surface potential and the peak fluorescence change (r = 0.7693, p &lt; 0.01, n = 38 dendrites from 4 animals, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7d, e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To examine the predictive power of our characterization, we developed a simple classifier using half of the paired measurements of two-photon dendritic Ca 2+ fluorescence and simultaneously recorded surface potentials (the "training" data); then we tested the classifier with the remaining half (the "validation" data, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7f</ref>, see Methods section for more details).</s><s>Simply taking the average surface potential 50-60 ms after stimulus onset and setting a lower threshold θ 1 that corresponds to the upper limit of fluorescence noise (mean M 0 + one standard deviation SD 0 when surface potentials are zero), the classifier predicts that the surface potentials correspond to Ca 2+ spikes with 73.9% (34/46) accuracy (light gray area in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7f</ref>).</s><s>With a higher threshold θ 3 that corresponds to M 0 + 3SD 0 , the classifier predicts Ca 2+ spikes with 100% (10/10) accuracy (dark gray area in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7f</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, we conclude that sensory stimulation evokes EPSPs that can be detected ~10 ms after the stimulation followed in some cases by dendritic Ca 2+ spikes in L5 pyramidal neurons that have a comparable impact at the cortical surface in the form of positive potentials arriving ~50-60 ms after stimulation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The contribution of the present study is threefold.</s><s>Firstly we developed a novel optogenetic method to evoke dendritic Ca 2+ spikes in vivo (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>This method enabled us to measure the contribution of dendritic Ca 2+ spikes uncontaminated with synaptic inputs.</s><s>Previous studies that reported the correlation between Ca 2+ events and extracellular potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref>  separate these events; therefore it was unclear to which extent intrinsic dendritic Ca 2+ currents contributed to the evoked potential.</s><s>Secondly using the new method we found that dendritic Ca 2+ spikes generate a passive current source in L1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f</ref>) and therefore evoke a positive potential at the cortical surface with an inverted polarity relative to the expected dendritic sink at the site of generation of the dendritic spike (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>).</s><s>To our knowledge, these findings have not been reported in the literature.</s><s>Lastly we quantified the relative contribution of dendritic Ca 2+ spikes to the surface potential and showed that their contribution is on average equal to the contribution of synchronous, stimulus-evoked synaptic inputs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6b, c</ref>).</s><s>Several types of current could in principle contribute to the late sensory-evoked sink including dendritic Ca 2+ spikes, EPSPs generated by feedback input to the upper layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> , bAPs or NMDA spikes in the distal tuft <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Our data suggest that the late dendritic sink is due primarily or perhaps entirely to dendritic Ca 2+ spikes.</s><s>There were four observations that lead to this conclusion: firstly, the late sink in the upper layers was all-or-none in character.</s><s>Second, the late sink was not due to synaptic input.</s><s>Third, the late sink strongly correlated with dendritic Ca 2+ .</s><s>Fourth, the late sink was abolished by baclofen.</s><s>We have previously shown that baclofen abolishes dendritic Ca 2+ spikes but does not block EPSPs or bAPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>We also previously found that local application of baclofen to L2/3 does not change the subthreshold input to L5 pyramidal neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> suggesting that network effects due to baclofen are negligible.</s><s>Moreover, in the experiments using sensory stimuli in this study, the baclofen had no effect on the first sink while abolishing the late sink suggesting that the first sink was due to synaptic inputs that were unaffected by baclofen whereas the second sink was due to a non-synaptic process.</s></p><p><s>Both EPSPs and single or low-frequency bAPs have a comparably small effect on intracellular Ca 2+ in the distal apical dendrite <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>It is generally considered that the contribution of synaptic input to surface potentials is heavily dependent on the synchronicity of the synaptic inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>With a triggered sensory stimulation, the first signal is likely to arise from a barrage of synchronous synaptic inputs generated by the stimulus.</s><s>However, the second signal ~200 ms after sensory stimulation has been shown to be the result of feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> that is more likely to be due to synaptic input that is less synchronous <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>In our extracellular recordings, the late sink had a distinctly all-or-none character (unlike the late signal recorded intracellularly <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> ) implying that the late synaptic input is more or less invisible in the LFP unless it reaches threshold for a postsynaptic event like a dendritic Ca 2+ spike.</s><s>On the other hand, the fact that the late sink we observed, when visible, had the same amplitude as the first sink, implies that the Ca 2+ spike produces extracellular signals of similar magnitude to very synchronous synaptic inputs.</s></p><p><s>NMDA spikes are another form of postsynaptic dendritic spikes.</s><s>However, they are normally confined to individual tuft branches <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> whereas the late sink we recorded spread from depths that correspond to the location of the Ca 2+ spike initiation zone in L5 pyramidal neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Although the data suggest that the late extracellular sink is primarily due to dendritic Ca 2+ spikes which represent a high conductance across a large area of membrane, it is still possible that the initiation of these spikes requires some combination of EPSPs, bAPs and/or NMDA spikes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> that are each likely to have a smaller impact on the extracellular potential.</s><s>The conventional view is that the surface positive potential primarily reflects a current source passively generated by a current sink corresponding to EPSPs in pyramidal neurons arriving in L2/3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>, left) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>Our study demonstrates that dendritic Ca 2+ spikes in L5 pyramidal neurons can also evoke surface positive potentials that are as large as those evoked by EPSPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>, right).</s><s>The corollary of this finding is that surface potentials evoked by dendritic Ca 2+ spikes are an indication that activity has been recruited specifically in these cells.</s><s>Furthermore, the Ca 2+ spike

because L5 pyramidal neurons constitute the major output cells of the cerebral cortex.</s><s>Because dendritic Ca 2+ spikes are more easily evoked in the awake compared to the anesthetized brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , a significant number of surface positive potentials in the awake brain recorded with conventional EEG are likely to represent dendritic Ca 2+ spikes--that is, the output of a given cortical area.</s><s>It should be noted that the surface potentials we characterized here were evoked by optogenetic or sensory stimuli.</s><s>In principle, surface potentials could also be used to detect spontaneously occurring dendritic Ca 2+ spikes (i.e., without sensory stimulation).</s><s>In this case, the predictive power of this approach would be improved by first characterizing the surface potential resulting from evoked potentials.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we have developed a new method for optogenetically evoking dendritic Ca 2+ spikes while recording LFPs,
