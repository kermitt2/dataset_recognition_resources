<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Procedure. The data was collected from March 2012</head><p><s>through February 2016 within the specialized psychiatric outpatient unit for Vietnamese migrants located at the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany.</s><s>All patients were initially screened with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. 5.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>) by trained bilingual (i.e., German and Vietnamese) psychiatrists.</s><s>Subsequently, all patients with a clinical relevant mood disorder answered the second version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>), which had been pretranslated into written Vietnamese language using the technique of back-translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Afterwards, all patients received a questionnaire in the Vietnamese language about sociodemographic facts and potentially experienced migration-related stressors (MRS).</s><s>The latter were assessed with an adapted version of 25 questions originally formulated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lujic (2008)</ref> for the treatment evaluation of Turkish inpatients in Germany (see next section) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Data used for this study was exclusively collected at patients' first admission before undergoing treatment.</s><s>All subjects gave written informed consent before participating in this study.</s><s>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Charité-Universitätsmedizin-Berlin, Germany, and was conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Instruments and Variables</head><p><s>2.2.1.</s><s>Depressive Symptoms.</s><s>Depressive symptoms were assessed with Becks-Depression-Inventory II (BDI-II).</s><s>The BDI-II, as a revision of the BDI, is a DSM-IV based self-report inventory for adolescents and adults, measuring the severity of depressive symptoms experienced over the last two weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>It contains 21 items with each of them being scored on a 4-point Likert scale (except for two items, i.e., change in sleeping pattern and change in appetite, containing seven response options).</s><s>Individual item scores are summed up to provide a total score ranging from 0 to 63 with a higher value indicating greater symptom severity.</s></p><p><s>Since there is no validated Vietnamese version of the BDI-II published, we translated the German BDI-II version <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> into written Vietnamese language using the technique of back-translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, done by different bilingual translators.</s></p><p><s>For an analysis of how the quantity of experienced MRS relates to various facets of self-reported depressiveness, we applied the BDI-II symptom-structure model suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Buckley et al. (2001)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>This factor-analytic derived model clusters the 21 BDI-II items into three equivalent subgroups, labeled as the cognitive, affective, and somatic dimension of depression.</s><s>Accordingly, we summed up (1) the items sadness, pessimism, past failure, loss of pleasure, guilt feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal thoughts, and worthlessness for the BDI-COG-B subscale; (2) the items loss of pleasure, crying, loss of interest, and indecisiveness for the BDI-AFF-B subscale; (3) the items agitation, loss of energy, change in sleeping pattern, irritability, change in appetite, concentration difficulty, tiredness or fatigue, and loss of sexual interests for the BDI-SOM-B subscale.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Migration-Related Stressors (MRS).</head><p><s>Different types of MRS were assessed using a list of 25 questions, originally formulated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lujic (2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for the treatment evaluation of Turkish migrants in Germany.</s><s>We adapted this list for our Vietnamese sample by replacing formal relevant aspects (e.g., "Do you miss your family in Vietnam" instead of "Do you miss your family in Turkey") but with leaving the main content untouched.</s><s>One item was deleted because of addressing a topic not relevant for Vietnamese migrants (item number 25: "Do you have problems at work or with other persons, because of fasting, rejecting pork meat, wearing a headscarf, praying five times a day or washing hands and feet before praying").</s><s>With each of the remaining 24 questions subjects were asked categorically if the particular stressor has occurred ("yes" = 1) or did not occur ("no" = 0) during the migration process.</s></p><p><s>Single item scores of the MRS-list were summed up to create an index of stressor-quantity (SQ) with a higher score standing for a larger number of perceived stressors.</s><s>Scores were calculated when more than 75% of the relevant data were available.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Statistical Analysis.</head><p><s>We calculated a dropout-analysis to assess possible differences in age (t-test), gender (Fisher's exact test), and level of education (chi-squared test) among participants with less and more than 25% missing MRS-data.</s></p><p><s>For the main analysis, hierarchical linear regression models were performed to identify the impact of the MRSquantity on self-reported depressiveness.</s><s>In the first step, the sociodemographic variables age, gender, and level of education were entered as control variables and in the second analysis step the SQ as the primary predictor.</s><s>The BDI-II total and subscores, derived from the Buckley et al. ( <ref type="formula">2001</ref>) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, were included separately as primary outcome measures.</s></p><p><s>Post hoc analyses were conducted on single item level for those subscales being significantly influenced by the SQ.</s><s>Therefore, hierarchical linear regression models using the SQ as predictor and the corresponding BDI-II single items as outcome measures were carried out, while all control variables remained unchanged.</s></p><p><s>Statistical analyses were calculated with IBM SPSS (Version 22).</s><s>Values of  ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and values of  ≤ 0.001 as highly significant.</s><s>All reported  values resulted from two-tailored testing.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">The Relation between Migration Stressors and Depression.</head><p><s>A correlation between the MRS-quantity and the depression severity is in line with several studies indicating a strong association between stressful migration-related experiences and a broad range of mental health problems across different populations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>).</s><s>However, in most studies this welldocumented association has not been further investigated.</s><s>One exception is the field of PTSD-research where the socalled "building-block-effect" provides a theoretical framework about how this kind of psychological complaint develops under the experience of traumata <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>However, since the mechanism underlying a PTSD-disorder is not simply transferable to other psychiatric disorders, studies regarding the question of how nontraumatic but highly stressful migrationrelated burdens are related to the occurrence and course of affective disorders are still lacking.</s><s>At the same time, such an examination of how the number of adverse events impacts the mental health status could provide an understanding for developing migration-adapted treatment options.</s></p><p><s>Through analyzing the different dimensions of depression, we were able to show that the amount of perceived MRS mainly influences the cognitive (and less the affective or somatic) symptoms of depression.</s><s>This impact seems to follow a dose-response relation with a higher count of experienced stressors leading to a greater extent of the cognitive depression symptoms in the BDI-II, especially regarding the items pessimism, past failure, guilt feelings, punishment feelings, and suicidal thoughts.</s><s>This finding is in line with a suggestion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Bhugra and Ayonrinde (2004)</ref> to pay particular attention to migration-associated dysfunctional cognitions when dealing with depressed migrants and refugees <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Simultaneously, these authors state that extensive research is needed to investigate further the kind of dysfunctional cognitive schemata prone migrants and refugees (even more) vulnerable for an affective disorder.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">MRS and the Cognitive Depression-Dimension: An</head><p><s>Explanatory Approach.</s><s>In most cases, the dynamic process of migration does not entail exclusively either advantages or disadvantages but often a mixture of both.</s><s>On the one hand, migration can have a positive effect on mental health, for example, by inducing optimism and hope as well as by leading to an actual improvement of the current life situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>However, moving to another country does not always result in positively perceived changes.</s><s>Many immigrants are confronted by an array of obstacles, such as perceived discrimination, the absence of social networks, homesickness, lack of feelings of belonging, sense of guilt for leaving family behind, language barriers, and an uncertain resident status <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Considering these two possible trajectories of the migration process at one point or another a more or less attentive, intrapsychic weighing up of the so far experienced migration benefits and costs is conceivable, causing depressogenic thoughts and feelings if the result happens to be negative.</s></p><p><s>With regard to our results such a comparison could have the following implications: (1) the less advantageous this psychological evaluation process turns out, the more intense the perception of failure, hopelessness, and resignation may be.</s><s>This finding could explain the dose-effect, with more reported MRS leading to a higher self-reported depressionoutcome.</s><s>(2) Since such a comparison requires cognitive efforts, a negative result, in turn, could play a part when forming the cognitive dimension of depression.</s><s>This may explain our finding that primarily cognitive symptoms of depression were related to the MRS-quantity.</s><s>However, at the same time, it is important to bear in mind that there is a growing body of research documenting the substantial contribution of emotions and affects in the way a migrant experiences his or her own identity and fate <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we do not claim the proceeding evaluation process to be exclusively a cognitive one, without taking into account any emotional states or affective perception, which are essential for any cognitive processing.</s><s>(3) An undesirable outcome could finally result in an overall pessimistic perception of the past (in our study the BDI-II symptoms past failure, guilt feelings, and to some extent punishment feelings) and future (in our study the BDI-II symptom pessimism).</s><s>Such a global negative perception may, in turn, consolidate the belief that no matter what and how hard the person is trying to improve the situation the results of his or her efforts turn out to be negative.</s><s>This experience of uncontrollability and heteronomy may be similar to a mindset commonly referred to as learned helplessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>This psychological model declares the conviction of having no influence over one's destiny to be a major risk factor for the development of symptoms of depression.</s><s>Therefore future studies should also account for a migrant's attribution style and locus of control when further investigating associations between MRS and depression.</s></p><p><s>However, regarding this psychological evaluation process, it is important to keep in mind that the weighing up of migration benefits and drawbacks most likely is not a one-time action.</s><s>It may be rather a dynamic process being repeated several times during migration and its different stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, studies have shown that while the mental health status of newly arrived immigrants often exceeds the one of the host population (being referred to as the "healthy-migrant-effect"; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>), this advantage vanishes over time, and the immigrants' mental health status resembles that of the residents.</s><s>For the present sample, this healthy-migrant-effect may play a subordinate role since the average time spent in Germany was at admission seventeen years.</s><s>Nevertheless, regarding future studies, it might be beneficial to apply a longitudinal design to understand how the mental health condition of Vietnamese migrants develops during their stay in Germany (see also Section 4.5.: Implications for Clinical Practitioners and Future Research).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Migration Stressors and Suicidal Ideation.</head><p><s>Particular attention should be placed on our finding of an increase in suicidal thoughts under the influence of MRS.</s><s>This elevation of suicidality is consistent with current studies on other migrant populations.</s><s>For instance, Latino immigrants in Spain and the United States have revealed a rise in suicidal ideation in the light of discrimination and a weak sense of belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Also among African American college students an elevated risk for suicidal thoughts was reported, especially when they experienced high acculturative stress or a poor group identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The same augmentation of suicidality in the context of migration problems has been reported for Polish and Turkish migrants being compared to a German control sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> as well as for American Indians in comparison to the US host population <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For Asian migrants, this rise in suicidal ideation under MRS may be further aggravated by their tendency to present somatic instead of actual existing psychological complaints (including suicidal ideation) when approaching primary health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>This renders the detection of suicidality among this migrant population challenging and underscores the supplementary use of risk profiles, such as the report of a large amount of experienced MRS, when performing clinical clarification.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Limitations and Strengths.</head><p><s>This study has several limitations that have to be addressed:</s></p><p><s>(1) Due to the relatively small sample size and the constraint on Vietnamese psychiatric outpatients in Berlin seeking help voluntarily our results are not generalizable to other migrant population without caution.</s></p><p><s>(2) Since there is no standardized tool for assessing MRS in migrants from Southeast Asia, we used our questionnaire in a more explorative way covering a broad as possible range of MRS.</s></p><p><s>(3) Additionally, assessment of primary outcomes was limited to self-rated depressiveness and perceived MRS.</s><s>However, self-report questionnaires may encourage respondents from sociocentric cultures as Vietnam to answer less in consideration of social-desirability because of perceived anonymity.</s></p><p><s>(4) Although we performed a dropout-analysis on patients with more than 25% missing MRS-data and found no significant deviations in age, gender, and level of education, a sampling bias cannot be fully excluded.</s></p><p><s>(5) Finally, due to the cross-sectional design of our study limiting causal attribution, we could not fully exclude the possibility that a higher level of depressiveness is not only the result but also the reason for more reported MRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, future research should apply a longitudinal design including a healthy (Vietnamese) control group to clarify the pathway between experienced MRS and depression further.</s></p><p><s>Despite these limitations, the present study is one of the very few on the mental health status of Vietnamese migrants in Germany and the first to examine an association between experienced migration-related stressors and the occurrence and severity of depression among this population.</s><s>Our findings thus may be seen as a promising starting point for future investigations as well as for the development of culturesensible therapy options to enhance the treatment adherence.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Implications for Clinical Practitioners and Future</head><p><s>Research.</s><s>Considering the delayed and diminished mental health care utilization of Vietnamese migrants our study provides the following recommendations for clinical practitioners: (1) The diagnostic assessment of Vietnamese psychiatric patients should not exclusively focus on traumatic but also on non-life-threatening but highly stressful migration-related experiences.</s><s>(2) Therapeutic interventions for depressed (Vietnamese) migrants should pay attention to distorted beliefs and cognitions about recurring migrationrelated stressors.</s><s>This assumption is in line with studies on Vietnamese patients with PTSD, treated with a culturally adapted version of cognitive-behavioral therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>Although the mechanisms underlying a PTSD and a MRSrelated mood disorder may differ, in both cases the common experience of not having sufficient coping capacity to handle stressors may play a major role.</s><s>Such a lack of skills or coping strategies may leave the affected person more vulnerable to self-destructive thoughts and depression-related cognitions.</s></p><p><s>(3) Furthermore, a supplemental screening for suicidal tendencies should be imposed for (Vietnamese) patients reporting a broad range of exposed migration stressors.</s></p><p><s>Since our study was primarily concerned with the negative aspects of the migration process, future investigations should also consider its benefits, such as an improved socioeconomic status or the access to a better health care or educational system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, regarding a psychological evaluation process comparing improvements and deteriorations, it is important to keep in mind that migration can influence mental health in both ways, negative and/or positive.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, future research should apply a longitudinal design, to further investigate how the mental health condition of Vietnamese migrants in Germany varies with the length of their stay in the host country.</s><s>Also, a mixed-methodapproach, combining quantitative and qualitative data, is conceivable for understanding the cognitive and emotional disunity when migrants are confronted with diverging cultural and social requirements and ambivalences.</s><s>Individual and extended case studies would complete the picture by providing further qualitative information on when, why, and how often a migrant takes stock of his or her migration process.</s></p></div>
