<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Polysomnographic Data.</head><p><s>They include sleep efficiency (SE) (sleep in percent of time in bed, %/TiB), SOL in minutes, non-REM sleep 1 and non-REM sleep 2 (%/TiB), deep sleep (%/TiB), REM sleep (%/TiB), arousal-index (per hour sleep, /h), wake after sleep onset in minutes, number of sleep stage changes per night, awakenings per night, and periodic limb movement index (/h).</s><s>Due to the small sample size of OSA patients the AHI and further respiratory parameters were not included in this analysis.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Statistical Analysis.</head><p><s>Patients were classified according to their PSQI values in GS (PSQI ≤ 5) and PS (PSQI &gt; 5).</s><s>Following an exploratory analysis of the data the Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons was performed.</s><s>Statistical significance was established at &lt;0.05.</s><s>Due to the exploratory nature of the study, all tests were performed as exploratory data analyses, such that no adjustments for multiple testing have been made.</s><s>Analysis was performed with SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 21, Copyright 1989, 2010 SPSS Inc., an IBM Company, Chicago, IL, USA).</s></p></div>
