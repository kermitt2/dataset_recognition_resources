<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>In the European Union, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus (Afinitor; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is registered for treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) after failure of a previous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)targeted agent (VEGF antibody or VEGF receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor [VEGFR-TKI]) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Approval was based on results of the phase 3 RECORD-1 study in which everolimus significantly improved median progressionfree survival (PFS) compared with placebo (4.9 vs. 1.9 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.33; p &lt; .001) in patients who previously received sunitinib, sorafenib, or both (previous cytokines and/or bevacizumab also permitted); 21% of patients previously received one medication before everolimus <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>A subgroup analysis of RECORD-1 showed numerically longer median PFS in patients who previously received only one VEGFR-TKI than in patients who previously received two VEGFR-TKIs (5.4 and 4.0 months, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Median PFS of patients who previously received sunitinib as the only antineoplastic treatment was 4.6 months with everolimus (n = 43) and 1.8 months with placebo (n = 13) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22; p &lt; .001)</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>RECORD-1 showed a favorable tolerability profile for everolimus, with a low rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) and low rates of dose modification (7%) and treatment discontinuation because of AEs (13%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Results of the international, open-label, expandedaccess program REACT were consistent with results of RECORD-1 and showed that everolimus was well tolerated and provided clinical benefit (52% stable disease) in VEGFR-TKI-refractory patients with mRCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A recently published retrospective analysis investigated the efficacy of sequential VEGFR-TKI, VEGFR-TKI, and mTOR inhibitor and of sequential VEGFR-TKI, mTOR inhibitor, and VEGFR-TKI in Italy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Median PFS ranged from 36.5 to 29.3 months, and median overall survival (OS) ranged from 50.7 to 37.8 months.</s><s>The study was performed in a nonrandomized, retrospective setting based on a highly selected patient population (only 13% of all treated patients had received three lines of targeted therapy).</s><s>Because of potential immortal time bias for results of second-line treatment, this study did not meet the requirements for inclusion in a metaanalysis of adjusted, multicenter, retrospective cohort studies, which showed that OS was significantly prolonged in VEGFR-TKI-refractory patients with mRCC treated with a second-line mTOR inhibitor compared with a second-line VEGFR-TKI (HR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.98)</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Although these studies and analyses added insight into sequential treatment options for patients with mRCC, data regarding the routine use of everolimus in second-line therapy after initial VEGF-targeted therapy still are limited.</s><s>Therefore, this noninterventional study assessed the efficacy and safety of everolimus after initial VEGF-targeted therapy in patients with mRCC in the routine clinical setting in Germany.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>This was a prospective, observational study conducted at 166 registered sites.</s><s>Patients with mRCC (clear cell or non-clear cell) were enrolled when the physician intended to treat them with everolimus after failure of one VEGF-targeted therapy (VEGFR-TKI or bevacizumab).</s><s>To ensure mainly prospective observation, retrospective enrollment was limited to patients who had begun treatment with everolimus up to 90 days before the start of the study or had undergone no more than one image-based follow-up since treatment initiation.</s><s>Everolimus was administered according to the approved product label in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Patients received everolimus 10 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</s><s>Dose interruptions, reductions to 5 mg/day, or both were used, if necessary, to manage side effects.</s></p><p><s>The study was performed in accordance with German drug law and relevant guidelines of the German health authorities and the pharmaceutical industry for conducting noninterventional studies.</s><s>The ethics committee of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main, which was constituted according to state law and bears responsibility for the medical leader of this study, granted approval of the observational plan.</s><s>Patients provided written informed consent before the start of the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim and objectives</head><p><s>The aim of the study was to estimate the efficacy and safety of everolimus after the first anti-VEGF agent in routine clinical practice.</s><s>The main objective was to determine everolimus efficacy in terms of time to progression (TTP; time between baseline and progression based on physician assessment).</s><s>In addition, PFS (time between baseline and progression or death based on physician assessment or death from any cause) was assessed.</s><s>Patients who did not experience progression and who did not die during the observation period were censored at study discontinuation; patients without a documented study discontinuation date were censored at the analysis cutoff date.</s><s>Other objectives included treatment duration, tumor response, adherence to everolimus, posteverolimus treatment, and safety.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments</head><p><s>Evaluation of treatment response and progression was based on physician assessment (i.e., on clinical judgment and/or imaging results; Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] evaluation was possible but not mandatory).</s><s>In accordance with routine practice, documentation of the following observation parameters was aimed for regular visits, in line with routine practice (e.g., after approximately 3-month intervals): assessment of the response to treatment (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI), skeletal scintigraphy, positron emission tomography (PET)/PET-CT, ultrasound) and/or clinical assessment of the patient's status.</s><s>Kaplan-Meier statistics were applied for analysis of treatment duration, TTP, PFS, and time to worsening of Karnofsky performance status (KPS); in cases of descriptive comparisons of such parameters, the log-rank test was used.</s><s>For all other parameters, descriptive statistics were applied.</s><s>AEs were collected and coded to a preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA).</s><s>According to the methodological features of an observational noninterventional study, all statistical analyses were descriptive, and the presented results should be interpreted as such.</s></p></div>
