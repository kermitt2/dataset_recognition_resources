<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Heart failure (HF) is the fourth leading cause of death and the most common diagnosis leading to hospitalization in Germany. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> However, according to representative surveys, although 76-85% of the German population had heard of HF and many were able to identify symptoms of HF when presented separately (50-70%), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> only about 3% could identify it from a description of typical symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue, and swollen ankles) and showed better awareness about other severe diseases such as angina/myocardial infarction and transient ischemic attack/stroke. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">2</ref> Furthermore, most respondents thought it had a better prognosis than cancer, and roughly 30% thought it was a natural part of the aging process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">2</ref> In 2013, 3086 beneficiaries of the German public health insurance provider DAK-Gesundheit did not even rank HF among the top 10 diseases they feared most, with cancer, dementia, and stroke at the top. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6</ref></s><s>The disparity between the burden of disease and the public perception of it can lead to delays in diagnosis and appropriate care of HF.</s><s>Indeed, symptoms are often present several years before the diagnosis of HF is made. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7</ref></s><s>Half of all patients have NYHA class III-IV symptoms at the time of first diagnosis and are referred to specialist care or hospitalized within one month. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8</ref></s><s>Higher NYHA class and hospitalization for HF are both markers of worse prognosis; 9,10 therefore, early detection and treatment are paramount.</s><s>However, according to registry data from the United States, HF was previously undiagnosed in as many as a quarter of patients hospitalized for acute decompensation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref></s><s>This demonstrates the need to improve the awareness of HF among the general public.</s><s>The above cited surveys showing that awareness was low did not however examine the factors associated with low awareness.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, the first main objective of the current study was to better characterize the impact of factors like educational and professional background, presence of HF in person or family, age, and gender on the level of HF awareness among a large population.</s></p><p><s>Second, as several efforts were made to improve HF awareness during recent years, we followed the development of HF awareness and the use of different information sources over this period starting in 2007 and investigated whether awareness campaigns have brought general improvement in HF awareness.</s></p><p><s>The results may guide future awareness campaigns and patient education efforts.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study sample and data collection</head><p><s>Study participants came from a convenient random sample of visitors attending the national 'Health Research Day' of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Berlin, Marburg, Essen, Hannover, Göttingen, Heidelberg, and Lübeck on 25 February 2007, and the 'Long night of the Sciences' at the Charité Medical University in Berlin in 2012 and 2015.</s><s>Thus, participants were a sample of people who are most probably interested in health issues.</s><s>They were approached by study personnel and filled out the paperbased 22-item survey about HF.</s><s>Participation was voluntary, confidential, and anonymous.</s><s>Inclusion criteria were being adult (≥18 years of age) and proficient in German, as judged by study personnel.</s><s>The questionnaire was developed using expert consensus by the German Competence Network HF based on the experience with a questionnaire on knowledge about cardiovascular emergencies in Berlin by Baumann et al.; it has not been additionally validated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref></s><s>The survey took 3-5 min to complete.</s><s>It contained five demographic items to characterize the study population and determine generalizability but no identifying information, five dichotomous (Yes/No) questions to ascertain the subject's previous experience with the medical profession and heart disease, particularly HF, one categorical question to determine how subjects obtain information about health issues, and 10 multiple-choice questions about HF (seven about epidemiology, symptoms, and causes and three about treatment and prognosis).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Baseline variables are presented as frequencies and percentages for nominal variables, or means and standard deviations for continuous variables.</s><s>For longitudinal analysis, data were adjusted for age, sex, education level, medical profession, and presence of HF total (i.e.</s><s>respondent or family member), as these factors differed between years.</s><s>Adjusted scores were normalized based on per cent rank transformation with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15 (comparable to IQ scaling).</s><s>An ordinal logistic regression was calculated with the baseline data from 2007 for the scores that can be deduced from the answers to the questions shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</s></p><p><s>All variables found to be relevant at baseline showed significant variation between surveys at the different time points.</s><s>Thus, any difference between years could have reflected real increase/decrease in knowledge or changes in sample composition.</s><s>Therefore, scores were adjusted in a multivariate linear model adjusting for age, sex, education level, medical profession, and presence of HF total.</s></p><p><s>All analyses were considered exploratory; thus, no adjustments were made for multiple testing.</s><s>Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics software version 20.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample characteristics at baseline</head><p><s>In 2007, 2531 respondents [53% women; median age 54 (quartiles: 38/66) years, 29% ≥65 years] completed the HF awareness survey.</s><s>Seventeen per cent of respondents worked in the medical profession, 31% had a university education, and 34% of respondents were directly or indirectly (i.e. a family member was) affected by HF (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Participants above 65 years of age (P = 0.001), male (P = 0.001), without an academic degree (P = 0.011), or not employed in a medical field (P = 0.001) were significantly more likely to be affected by HF themselves.</s><s>Respondents with HF were also significantly more likely to have family members affected by HF (P = 0.001) (data not shown).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Awareness about heart failure</head><p><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, 73% of respondents knew HF, and 68% knew that it was a failure of the heart.</s><s>Regarding the symptoms of HF, 79% identified shortness of breath, 74% identified reduced effort tolerance, and 52% identified leg edema.</s><s>All three symptoms were identified by 40% of participants.</s><s>The fact that HF is one of the most common diseases in internal medicine was familiar to 67% of respondents, and 57% knew that HF is most common among adults above 65 years.</s><s>Respondents knew more about HF treatment than about its prognosis: 74% of respondents knew that lifelong treatment with medicines is necessary in most cases, 19% thought HF was healed after at least one month of treatment, 30% thought HF could only be healed through surgery, and 24% did not know about the course of HF.</s><s>The correct statement that HF is as bad as malignant cancer was identified by 25% of participants.</s><s>Eighty per cent of respondents were aware that a healthy lifestyle could reduce their risk of HF (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors influencing awareness</head><p><s>In the linear model, most grouping variables had a consistent impact on the knowledge scores even when each was corrected for the impact of all others.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presents how the variables influence the three overall scores for awareness about HF causes and treatment specifically and awareness in  total.</s><s>Female respondents, respondents with a university degree, those who worked in the medical field, and respondents affected directly or indirectly by HF showed significantly higher scores for total awareness as well as for causes and treatment separately (P &lt; 0.023).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample characteristics in 2012 and 2015</head><p><s>In 2012, 359 respondents completed the HF awareness survey (60% women, 8% ≥65 years, 48% from former Western Germany, 1% from abroad, 63% with university education, 21% in medical profession).</s><s>Seventy-two per cent of respondents had heard of HF prior to the survey, and 36% knew all three main symptoms of HF as described above.</s><s>Six per cent of the respondents reported having a family member with HF.</s><s>Six per cent knew themselves to be affected, 90% knew not to be or did not know.</s></p><p><s>In 2015, 171 respondents completed the HF awareness survey (59% women, 8% ≥65 years, 48% from former Western Germany, 13% from abroad, 63% with university education, 29% in medical profession).</s><s>Most of the respondents (79%) had heard of HF prior to the survey, and 35% knew all three symptoms of HF.</s><s>Having a family member with HF was reported by 7% of respondents, 6% knew themselves to be affected, 92% knew not to be or did not know.</s></p><p><s>Changes in awareness about heart failure through the years All variables found to be relevant at baseline showed significant variation between surveys at the different time points.</s><s>Thus, any difference between years could have reflected real increase/decrease in knowledge or just changes in sample composition.</s><s>Therefore, scores were adjusted in a multivariate linear model adjusting for age, gender, education level, medical profession, and presence of HF total.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the development of the scores for awareness about HF causes, HF treatment, and overall awareness.</s><s>The scores were normalized based on per cent rank transformation with a mean of 100 compared with the total awareness at baseline.</s><s>Over time,</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sources of information about health and cardiovascular risk</head><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows to which extent the respondents used different media at different time points.</s><s>In 2007, the most common sources of information about health and cardiovascular risk were printed media, i.e. magazines and newspapers (54%), and TV/radio (51%).</s><s>Forty-one per cent of respondents gained information from their general practitioner.</s><s>Friends and family as well as the Internet followed with 26% each.</s><s>This behaviour drastically changed over the years.</s><s>The Internet has become the top information source by 2015 (50%), and the use of print media and TV/radio dropped to around 45% after 2012.</s><s>Whereas in 2007, the family doctor had been an important source for 41% of respondents, in 2012 and 2015, only around 31% got their information there.</s><s>Information seeking from friends and family increased by 11% since 2007.</s><s>The information sources were used with very different frequencies by the two age groups &lt;65 years and ≥65 years, and this discrepancy increased over the years.</s><s>In 2015, respondents over 65 relied on TV/radio, printed media, and on their family doctor (69% for each); they used the internet much less than the younger respondents (31%) and were less reliant on friends and family (23%).</s><s>The younger respondents used the information sources with more evenly distributed frequencies: internet at 51%, friends and family 39%, printed media 45%, TV/radio 41%, and their general practitioner at 27%.</s></p><p><s>In 2007, almost all respondents (86%) agreed that more public education efforts about HF are needed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This largest German survey on HF awareness to date aimed to better characterize the knowledge about HF symptoms, causes, treatment, and prognosis, to follow its development over a period of several years with awareness campaigns and to examine the information sources used by the participants.</s></p><p><s>Our study revealed a fair amount of knowledge about causes, risks, prevention and treatment strategies of HF, and poor knowledge about the prognosis and severity of HF.</s><s>These results were comparable to earlier studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref> although the percentage of respondents, who knew all three main symptoms of HF, has strongly increased from only 3% reported for the 912 Germans from the population-based survey study SHAPE conducted in 2002 2 to 39% in our study.</s><s>This huge increase in percentage may also partially stem from a selection bias, as people in the present study can be suspected to be interested in health issues and were picked on a health information event at a university.</s><s>However, 39% still seems to be a very low number for the awareness of a major disease.</s></p><p><s>The SHAPE study reported an overall poor HF awareness in Europeans with one-third of respondents believing that HF was a natural consequence of aging. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref></s><s>Not having asked the exact same question, still one-third of our population thought that people under 50 years were mostly affected by HF.</s><s>On the other hand, 57% knew this is actually true for people older than 65, and 67% knew that HF is one of the most common diseases in internal medicine.</s><s>But only 25% of our participants knew that the course of HF is as bad as that of malignant cancer.</s><s>Thus, our respondents demonstrated a similarly poor understanding of HF severity and prognosis as the SHAPE respondents, where only 29% thought it was a severe condition and two-thirds thought the prognosis was better than cancer (patients with HF live longer).</s><s>Although one in five individuals will develop HF over the course of his or her lifetime, the SHAPE respondents underestimated its prevalence with only half of them knowing that HF was more common than cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13</ref></s><s>hus, HF knowledge does not seem to have improved considerably over the years.</s></p><p><s>One factor that determined which types of information sources were used to obtain information about health and cardiovascular risk was age.</s><s>Younger respondents used all media, but especially the internet, more frequently than their physicians, whereas older participants relied for the most part on printed and verbal media and on their general physicians.</s><s>Additionally, these differences seem to have become greater over the years and can be inferred to be important when planning any future informational activity for the public.</s></p><p><s>Although it is encouraging that working in health care or being affected by HF indicated a better HF awareness in our sample, there is reason for concern.</s><s>First, all participants demonstrated poor knowledge of HF prognosis.</s><s>Second, lower awareness among non-medical, non-diagnosed individuals may lead to late presentation and treatment of HF due to a misinterpretation of the symptoms or misunderstanding of their severity.</s><s>Previous studies of HF have shown that lower anxiety scores and false interpretation of early symptoms are associated with a longer duration of dyspnea and delays in seeking care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15</ref></s><s>Similarly, a large cohort study found that low health literacy, defined as the ability to 'obtain, understand and process basic health information' especially in printed form, was independently associated with higher all-cause mortality in HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref> This is pertinent because many respondents in our study relied heavily on print media, such as newspapers and magazines, for information about their health and cardiovascular risk.</s><s>A recent systematic review of health literacy also found it to be consistently associated to frequent hospitalizations, greater mortality, and global health status.</s><s>Furthermore, individuals with lower health literacy were less likely to exhibit health seeking behaviours, such as participation in cancer screening, scheduled immunizations, or taking medications as prescribed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18</ref></s><s>here are some limitations to the present study.</s><s>First, one limitation of the questionnaire used may be the mode of its development as expert consensus without validation.</s><s>A subdivision into subscales as could, for example, be examined using factorial analysis and subsequent calculation of internal consistency, etc. was not intended.</s><s>However, determination of sensitivity to change could be of interest in the present context.</s><s>Second, our convenience sample does not allow generalized conclusions to be drawn about the level of public HF awareness among the German population, as a selection bias may be inherent due to the setting of the survey and the failure to obtain a response rate.</s><s>Also, the comparably lower number of participants in 2015 may enter a selection bias into the current results even though a multivariate Heart failure awareness survey in Germany: general knowledge on heart failure remains poor model has been used in order to exclude any influence of variables such as differing age, educational background, or gender.</s><s>Other possible variables with an influence on awareness on which data were not collected can, however, not be completely excluded.</s><s>Such variables could be unevenly distributed in the populations at the different time points and therefore have a stronger or slighter impact in different years' populations, biasing the results.</s><s>Indeed, although similar to the German population regarding the distribution of age and gender, a greater proportion of our sample had higher education, worked in a medical profession, and were more frequently affected by HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> As discussed above, our study and others have found these factors to be associated with greater health awareness, which makes it all the more surprising that respondents should show such poor knowledge about HF prognosis.</s><s>Although Störk et al. have very recently shown that hearing about HF may lower the 'prevalence of common misbeliefs', <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref> it would seem that greater health literacy does not automatically translate into better perception about the natural course of HF and the associated high mortality risk.</s></p><p><s>Active knowledge about HF is essential for the appropriate and early recognition of symptoms and thus for earlier treatment and possibly changes of lifestyle.</s><s>It can also help relatives and friends to develop more understanding for their affected loved ones and thus to be more supportive and also aware of changes regarding their health.</s></p><p><s>We recommend health education programs adjusted to the needs of older patients, for example courses about healthy lifestyle and symptoms of illnesses offered by health insurances, hospitals, adult education centres, and community centres.</s><s>Further, as this is a measure of primary prevention and as such in favour of long-term public health as well as finances, family physicians should be given the option to prescribe health education courses.</s></p><p><s>The current study has shown that the overall awareness about HF has not increased since 2007 and is overall not at a satisfactory level.</s><s>This could possibly lead to delays in the timely diagnosis and treatment of this condition.</s><s>Thus, it is feasible to conclude, that more educational advertising should be implemented and also tested for effectiveness.</s><s>Future awareness campaigns have to use all available media channels in an age-appropriate way.</s><s>Especially older patients should be approached through print media, television and radio, and, importantly, by their family physicians in person.</s></p></div>
