<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gross national income per capita</head><p><s>A common application of the HCA, recommended by the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, is to use gross national income (GNI) per capita to estimate the potential economic gains from gaining an additional year of life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">26</ref></s><s>This approach has been applied elsewhere to estimate economic gains and losses of health interventions.</s><s>Although the GNI/capita approach may undervalue benefits from averting a DALY as it does not account for externalities on the wider labour market or care required from family members, the method is transparent and broadly accepted in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">22</ref></s><s>Thus, GNI/capita approximates the economic value that the average individual adds to a society per year, and we simply multiply GNI/capita by the number of DALYs averted in each scenario of met surgical need.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>lifetime earnings forgone</head><p><s>The GNI/capita approach does not necessarily equate to the majority of individuals' economic productivity, particularly in unequal economies such as Sierra Leone, where few very productive individuals may bias mean earning estimates.</s><s>Therefore, we calculate the present value of lifetime earnings (PVLE) forgone for each age category, slightly adapting the model presented in Menzin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">27</ref> PVLE paid (i, j, k) =</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">n j â i=s j ( l i,j,k * w i,j,k ) (<label>1+r</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">) iâs j (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p><s>where the estimated losses for a cohort of persons with age i, gender j, working in employment sector k and with life expectancy s j are a weighted average of their economic activity, l, and wage rate w.</s><s>We split each gender into five age groups, driven by the availability of data on avertable mortality and morbidity and use the midpoint of each strata to estimate years of productive life remaining.</s></p><p><s>We use data from the nationally representative 2011 Sierra Leone Integrated Household Survey (SLIHS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">28</ref> to obtain estimates of labour force participation by gender.</s><s>We estimate the proportion of the population not in the labour force, the proportion employed in agriculture and the proportion in other waged industry.</s><s>For both employed groups, we use SLIHS data to calculate the number of hours worked per year and apply earnings and salary data to estimate total annual earnings.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Value of a statistical life</head><p><s>A number of methods exist to calculate the VSL in Sierra Leone, which are briefly summarised in online supplementary table 1.</s><s>For our main analysis, we use $90 700 as calculated for sub-Saharan Africa by Robinson and Hammit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">29</ref></s><s>We follow Alkire et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">30</ref> and convert this VSL Open Access into its annualised equivalent, the value of a statistical life year, for use with DALYs.</s><s>Here, we assume that the VSL is analogous to an annuity, giving a constant stream of income of $31 415 per year (5% discount rate).</s><s>Consistent with DALY calculations, we do not apply age weighting to this value so assume it remains constant throughout a lifetime.</s><s>The use of Sierra Leonean data negates the rescaling of VSL from the USA, as elsewhere. <ref type="bibr">29 31</ref></s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DIsCussIOn</head><p><s>In 2013, the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health argued that investing in healthcare in LMICs produced profound returns on investment of between</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Open Access</head><p><s>US$9 and US$20 for every dollar invested. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">33</ref></s><s>The question thus arose as to whether investment in the provision of surgical services to avert death and disability would give a similar financial return on investment.</s><s>This question was addressed by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery which presented data on both the economic impact of untreated disease and the financial commitment required to scale up surgical services.</s><s>Alkire et al calculated projected economic losses in LMICs from a variety of surgical conditions using the value of lost output approach of up to 2.5% of annual GDP and 17% of 2010 GDP if a value of lost welfare approach was used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">34</ref></s><s>erguet et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">35</ref> modelled the possible scale up of surgical services in LMICs for the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery target of 5000 operations per 100 000 population per year and calculated that costs of US$300-420 billion would need to be met to achieve scale up over the years 2012-2030, representing 4%-8% of total annual health expenditure.</s><s>This large investment in scaling up surgical services across 88 LMICs was positive when compared with the $12.3 trillion loss to economic growth in these countries if surgical service development was neglected.</s><s>The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery data presented a similar picture presented to the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health-investing in surgical care was beneficial and produced significant economic returns on investment.</s></p><p><s>The few studies that have been published on the macroeconomic impact of surgical disease in LMICs all show significant costs to national economies. <ref type="bibr">11 34</ref></s><s>This study demonstrates significant estimated costs to the economy of Sierra Leone from untreated surgical disease.</s><s>It is the first single-country study and also represents a move away from modelled data to the use of primary surgical data for an estimation of the economic impact of untreated disease.</s><s>The economic impact of untreated surgical disease in Sierra Leone is significant.</s><s>In 2012, the estimated cumulative loss to the Sierra Leone economy from the unmet burden of surgical disease was between US$1.1 and US$3.8 billion, depending on the economic method used.</s><s>This equates to between 23% and 100% of the 2012 GDP for Sierra Leone.</s><s>Eighty per cent of  Open Access economic losses were due to mortality.</s><s>The incremental losses averted by scale up of surgical provision to the Lancet Commission target of 80% were calculated to be between US$360 million and US$2.9 billion, accepting that the Lancet Commission target was for 80% access to the Bellwether procedures, not for all surgery.</s></p><p><s>There are a number of limitations to this study.</s><s>First, we had to discard 46% of the surgical data because they  Open Access were incomplete.</s><s>As a result, we worked with only 54% of the surgical data, which may not have been fully representative and may have skewed the results.</s><s>We assumed that the 54% accounted for the 7.9% of met need and calculated unmet need based on this, although of course, if we had a full complement of data, the met need and hence the unmet need would have been significantly greater.</s></p><p><s>Where data were absent, for example when the age of patients was recorded but not their gender, we used complete data observations to weight how these were distributed across groups at the lowest level of aggregation available, for example, by age group.</s><s>If observations were missing not at random (type 2 error), this could introduce bias into our estimates.</s><s>We assumed operations not listed as either 'emergency' or 'planned' were planned, so as to create a conservative estimate of the overall economic impact.</s><s>In practice, many of these may have been emergencies and would have made the resulting economic losses even greater.</s><s>We assumed that the same proportion of met and unmet need was uniform across all operations.</s><s>However, it may be that the proportion of met: unmet need may be higher for certain operations because of the nature of the pathology and the urgency for example, free healthcare for pregnant women might mean that the ratio of met: unmet need is higher for caesarean sections than it is for emergency laparotomy.</s><s>We also assumed that treating a treatable condition would return the patient back to full economic productivity, although this may not be the case.</s></p><p><s>There is substantial variation between estimates of economic losses depending on the methodology used, despite all methods using an equivalent estimate of DALYs attributable to unmet need.</s><s>The VSL method places the greatest value on each DALY incurred and by definition leads to the largest estimate of economic loss.</s><s>The human capital approaches, using estimates of GNI/capita and lifetime earnings foregone, place a small cost on the loss of each DALY and produce smaller estimates.</s><s>In addition, economic losses estimated here do not consider the value of unpaid or domestic work because of uncertainty in assumptions required and because these do not form part of many estimates of GDP.</s><s>In addition, our use of financial measurements of economic productivity is a limitation in the largely agrarian economy of Sierra Leone.</s><s>Other metrics, which cannot be easily valued in financial terms such as food insecurity or the distribution of labour within the household, may capture potentially important aspects of economic productivity.</s><s>Omitting these factors makes our model more conservative and we are likely to underestimate total economic losses, with a greater underestimation occurring in female groups.</s></p><p><s>Averages (mean values) are used to parameterise the model, and we therefore do not account for heterogeneity in estimates except for between genders and the age at which surgery was required.</s><s>Other literature has shown a notable correlation between propensity for ill health and income, particularly in low/middle-income contexts such as this study, and this model does not account for this.</s><s>The lifetime earnings estimates in the human capital approach may overstate losses and therefore assume that premature mortality or morbidity causes a lifetime's impact to the economy.</s><s>With more data, we could have used a friction cost method to be more conservative; however, the lost earnings estimates are the lowest produced in this study.</s></p><p><s>Despite these limitations which are prevalent in much of the global surgical literature, we have provided the first national study of economic losses based on as much data as is currently available for Sierra Leone.</s><s>This suggests massive economic losses, much of which may be avertable by the provision of timely, surgical care.</s><s>What is now required is the development of a costed national surgical plan as recently undertaken in Zambia.</s><s>In the case of Sierra Leone, the necessary investment might be more than the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery figure of 4%-8% of total annual health expenditure as there is likely to be a large initial capital outlay as well as a very significant necessary investment in the surgical workforce.</s><s>Only then will we be able to compare this required investment with our economic loss figures to quantify the return on surgical system investment in terms of lives saves and disability averted.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 Estimated discounted lifetime economic
