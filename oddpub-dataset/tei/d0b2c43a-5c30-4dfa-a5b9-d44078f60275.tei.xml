<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compulsory treatment</head><p><s>In response to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (73), many countries have modified their laws in order to protect psychiatric patients from being treated compulsorily.</s><s>For example, the German Federal Constitutional Court acknowledged the "freedom to be ill" in several court rulings on forensic patients, diagnosed with schizophrenia, resisting compulsory treatment with antipsychotics.</s><s>Besides these individual decisions, the Court decided that the federal laws allowing compulsory drug treatment were unconstitutional.</s><s>German state parliaments were urged to reformulate their civil commitment laws and implement stricter legal conditions for compulsory treatment.</s><s>In particular, compulsory treatment was limited to patients incapable of consent; justified by the argument that the freedom to be ill must not be considered detached from the real capacities of free decisionmaking which may be limited by illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(74)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although legislation in most Western countries increasingly gives priority to patient autonomy, the concept of autonomy is insufficiently elaborated on.</s><s>Criteria for the legal concept of "free will" require further explanation.</s><s>Particularly, input from neurobiology, psychiatry and philosophy is needed.</s><s>It is important to note that certain psychiatric diagnoses do not exclude freedom of will.</s><s>Tebartz-van-Elst <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(75)</ref> showed the extent to which free will depends on certain mental functions and those that can be compromised by brain diseases.</s></p><p><s>We are convinced that individual court rulings would have come to a different conclusion in light of the mild encephalitis hypothesis of schizophrenia, assuming successful treatment of schizophrenia with anti-inflammatory drugs in a relevant subgroup of patients.</s></p><p><s>First, the Court extensively cited the adverse side effects of antipsychotic drugs.</s><s>In contrast, current anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and NAC are considered harmless; thus, making a ruling in favor of compulsory treatment more plausible.</s></p><p><s>Second, the Court's decision was likely influenced by the fact that antipsychotics are merely a symptomatic, rather than a curative treatment for schizophrenia.</s></p><p><s>Third, the Court argued with the potential of antipsychotic medication to change the personality.</s><s>Although it remained inconclusive with regard to the question whether schizophrenia is a psychosocial disorder or a genetically determined condition, as the disease was considered deeply ingrained to an individual's personality.</s><s>If the Court adopted the understanding of schizophrenia as an acquired neurological condition, caused or triggered by viruses, parasites, tumors or autoimmune processes, it would not condemn curative drugs.</s><s>Rather, these drugs would have to be considered personality-restoring drugs.</s><s>Particularly, the involvement of the parasitic protozoan T. gondii in schizophrenia might be a convincing argument for the judges, as its survival strategy can be explained by the manipulation hypothesis (38): T. gondii is transmitted from intermediate hosts such as mice and rats to its definitive hosts, namely cats, by predation.</s><s>Hence, Toxoplasma relies on cats to eat infected rodents.</s><s>For facilitating the transmission from the intermediate to the definite host, the parasite manipulates the rodents in several ways: reaction times become prolonged, and the rodents specifically lose their fear to cat odor; this peculiarity is called the fatal attraction phenomenon.</s><s>The same mechanism is probable in our next of kin: Toxoplasma-infected chimpanzees lose the fear to leopard urine <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(76)</ref>.</s><s>Toxoplasmosis can also cause similar behavioral changes in humans: it increases reaction times, resulting in higher probability of traffic and work accidents; additionally, infected men rated the smell of cat urine as relatively more pleasant <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>.</s><s>The suicide rate of infected mothers is twice that of non-infected mothers <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(77)</ref>.</s><s>According to the manipulation hypothesis, these changes could result from the fact that our distant ancestors were also part of the leopards' prey.</s><s>In this context, schizophrenia cannot be seen as belonging to the core of the personality.</s></p><p><s>We expect that the threshold for allowing compulsory treatment would decrease, if legal theorists and high judges accepted the mild encephalitis hypothesis of schizophrenia and if antiinflammatory drugs were more effective and had lesser adverse effects compared to antipsychotic medications.</s></p><p><s>However, we expect that the number of compulsory treatment would be reduced significantly in the long run: if patients made the experience that physicians could effectively help them overcome their suffering in the psychotic phases without experiencing the adverse effects of antipsychotics, many would be more compliant with long-term treatment (if necessary).</s><s>Furthermore, they might sign psychiatric advance directives (Ulysses contracts) for allowing drug treatment in case of another psychotic episode, even against the psychotic will (78).</s><s>Finally, the better medical treatments can cure the disease, the lesser compulsory treatments would be necessary at all.</s></p><p><s>We recommend the following: the will of an acutely psychotic individual most likely differs significantly from his or her free will.</s><s>In a psychotic state, reality perception is largely disturbed; the affect is changed; anxiety and panic dominate, such that the power of judgment is corrupted.</s><s>Particularly, thought intrusions corrupt the individual's free will.</s><s>The affected person is not autonomous, and therefore lacks the capacity to give informed consent.</s><s>Consequently, a proxy has to decide-but according to the affected individual's will: first, according to his or her formerly declared will (ideally in an advance directive), second, to his or her assumed will, and third (in case that the latter two are unknown), in his or her best interest.</s></p><p><s>As we have argued elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(79)</ref>, respect for autonomy is also a positive duty.</s><s>If a person's capability for autonomy is corrupted by a disorder, respect for the person's autonomy means primarily to restore her capability for autonomy.</s><s>If restoration of the capability for autonomy is possible with antipsychotics and/or antiinflammatory medication, then it is a moral obligation to treat the person with these drugs.</s><s>Once the capability for autonomy is restored, the patient can decide autonomously about his or her further treatment.</s><s>However, if the patient has ruled out any of these treatments in an advance directive written in a state of legal competence, then this decision has to be respected, as well.</s></p></div>

stigmatization of schizophrenia in several ways: it does not support genetic determinism, but instead the concept of genetic vulnerability.</s><s>Therefore, we expect that it will decrease

change concerning the attribution of onset responsibility.</s><s>We expect a de-stigmatizing effect insofar as it offers some hope for better treatment strategies.</s><s>Additionally, the patients' compliance might improve due to less adverse effects of effective drugs, thus, in the long-term, relapse rates might be reduced and cognitive functioning improved.</s><s>This could decrease the perceived dangerousness and unpredictability of patients and improve their social inclusion.</s><s>Furthermore, we expect reduced stigmatization of genetic relatives, if the influence of genes is seen
