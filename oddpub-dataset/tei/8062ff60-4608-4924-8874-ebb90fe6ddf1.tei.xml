these were distinguished from PIDs by lack of propagation on movies.</s><s>(B) In control (i.e., non-stimulated) animals, PIDs spontaneously occurred in apparently random fashion throughout the MCAO (green circles).</s><s>Each horizontal line represents one animal, and the start and end of each line indicate the time span of imaging.</s><s>(C) Light tactile stimulation of the contralesional forepaw and shoulder (red and orange, respectively) triggered a PID within 5 min (yellow circles) with high incidence (p &lt; 0.001 versus spontaneous PID rate).</s><s>Inset shows the latency between forepaw or shoulder stimulation onset and PID onset.</s><s>In contrast, contralesional whisker pad or hindpaw stimulation (light and dark blue, respectively), and ipsilesional stimulation to activate the non-ischemic contralesional hemisphere (black) did not differ from the spontaneous PID rate in non-stimulated mice.</s><s>Importantly, somatosensory stimulation did not alter systemic blood (legend continued on next page) to anoxic depolarization.</s><s>Such conditions predict metastable hot zones, tenuously maintaining their membrane potential at steady-state ischemia.</s><s>To explain the origins of PID occurrence, we hypothesized that any sudden worsening in metabolic supply-demand mismatch may transiently tip the balance toward anoxic depolarization in these hot zones, triggering a PID.</s></p><p><s>Supply-demand mismatch can be worsened either by decreasing the supply or by increasing the demand for O 2 .</s><s>Functional activation of the cortex is one way to stimulate cortical metabolism and increase O 2 demand.</s><s>We therefore reasoned that transient cortical activation by tactile somatosensory stimulation might trigger PIDs and tested this in a pure cortical distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) model in mice.</s><s>We monitored and detected PIDs in real-time using their characteristic propagation patterns on continuous laser speckle perfusion imaging as a sensitive and specific surrogate <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Eikermann-Haerter et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nakamura et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Shin et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shin et al., , 2007;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Strong et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Strong et al., , 2007;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yuzawa et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Altogether, these data provide compelling evidence for the existence of metastable hot zones within the peri-infarct tissue where any further worsening of supply-demand mismatch precipitates anoxic depolarization and triggers a PID with adverse consequences on ischemic tissue outcome (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>).</s><s>Such hot zones lie within a narrow critical range of hypoperfusion, sufficiently ischemic to render the tissue susceptible, but not ischemic enough to abolish neurotransmission (i.e., electrophysiological penumbra) or to directly precipitate anoxic depolarization (i.e., core).</s><s>The penumbra is, by definition, electrophysiologically silent and, therefore, susceptible to reduced supply only (i.e., hypoxic or hypotensive transients).</s><s>The presence and distribution of hot zones are predicted to be highly dynamic and variable both spatially and temporally, based on the artery that is occluded and the fluctuations in the perfusion defect.</s><s>To add to the complexity, whether a PID is triggered by a given mode of sensory stimulation would depend on the existence of a susceptible hot zone within the activated brain regions, cortical or subcortical.</s><s>Therefore, the efficacy of specific sensory stimuli in triggering PIDs in our study cannot be extrapolated directly to other stroke models or species.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, the proof-of-principle presented herein probably applies to most if not all strokes caused by large-artery occlusions.</s><s>This is because rodent dMCAO model yields infarcts that can be considered medium sized when scaled to human brain.</s><s>In principle, factors modulating the O 2 supply and demand create spatiotemporally highly dynamic ripples of oxygenation in peri-infarct tissue, which are capable of triggering a PID when regional pO 2 dips below the depolarization threshold within a hot zone.</s><s>Such ripples may be more frequent and larger in magnitude, and cortical somatosensory activation is predicted to be stronger in awake patients compared with experimental animals kept under steady anesthesia, as in our study.</s><s>Data from the human cohort also provided evidence for worse supply-demand mismatch predisposing to PIDs in stroke patients.</s><s>It should be noted that although this was a critically ill cohort, with large infarcts requiring craniotomies (thereby allowing invasive measurements), the principle applies to milder strokes as well, because in hyperacute stroke there is always a penumbra that is viable but at risk for infarction, and PIDs will harm penumbra regardless of the infarct size.</s><s>However, considering the extreme variability in the size, location, severity, and mechanism of human stroke, as well as the variability in intrinsic tissue susceptibility to ischemic depolarizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Eikermann-Haerter et al., 2012)</ref>, it would be a challenge to predict the type of sensory stimulation that could trigger a PID in any given patient, including tactile, auditory, or

Tactile Stimulation-Induced PIDs Worsen Ischemic Tissue Perfusion and Outcome (A) Average cumulative induced and spontaneous PID frequency in mice receiving tactile stimulation starting 10 min after MCAO (red, n = 14), and spontaneous PID frequency in non-stimulated controls (green, n = 17).</s><s>None of the mice in these cohorts were subjected to transient hypoxia or hypotension as part of the experimental protocol.</s><s>(B) Area of perfusion defect with %30% residual CBF increased in proportion with PID occurrence in the stimulated group over time.</s><s>Two-way ANOVA for repeated measures.</s><s>Data are represented as mean ± SE. (C) Representative laser speckle flowmetry images showing the expansion of perfusion defect (blue pixels with %30% residual CBF) between 10 and 60 min after MCAO in a mouse that received tactile stimulation, and the stable perfusion defect in a mouse without tactile stimulation.(D)</s><s>Infarct volumes measured using TTC staining were larger in the group receiving forepaw but not whisker stimulation starting 10 min after MCAO (n = 6, 4, and 4 in control, forepaw, and whisker stimulation groups; p &lt; 0.05; t test).</s><s>These experiments were performed in a separate cohort of mice without endotracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation in order to minimize surgical morbidity and mortality.</s><s>The experimental protocol was otherwise identical to other tactile stimulation experiments above.</s><s>There were a total of 2.25 ± 0.25 PIDs in the forepaw-stimulated group, whereas no spontaneous or induced PID was detected in non-stimulated and whisker stimulated cohorts, respectively.</s><s>Data are represented as box-whisker plot (line, median; +, mean; box, 25%-75% range; whiskers, min-max).</s><s>(E) Infarct volumes measured 72 hr after stroke onset using H&amp;E-stained coronal brain sections were larger in the group receiving forepaw stimulation starting 10 min after dMCAO (n = 9 each; t test).</s><s>In this cohort, we initially studied n = 5 mice per group.</s><s>The data showed higher than expected coefficient of variation.</s><s>We then performed a power analysis, determined n = 10 mice per group as the appropriate sample size, and added five more mice in each group.</s><s>One mouse was excluded in each group based on a priori criteria (one in non-stimulated group due to total absence of an infarct; one in stimulated group due to clip-related trauma precluding reliable infarct measurement).</s><s>Therefore, final sample sizes were n = 9 per group.</s><s>As with the 24 hr assessment group above, these experiments were performed in a separate cohort of mice without endotracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation in order to minimize surgical morbidity and mortality.</s><s>In this experimental cohort, inhalation gas included 70%N 2 /30%O 2 mixture.</s><s>By doing this, we also reproduced the effect of stimulation-induced PIDs on tissue outcome in the absence of N 2 O.</s><s>The experimental protocol was otherwise identical to other tactile stimulation experiments above.</s><s>Representative sections show the infarct at each slice level in one non-stimulated and forepaw and shoulder stimulated mouse each.</s><s>Data are represented as box-whisker plot (line, median; +, mean; box, 25%-75% range; whiskers, min-max).</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="13,60.44,101.59,488.86,256.14" type="bitmap" /></figure>
