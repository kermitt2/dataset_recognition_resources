<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The increasing availability of large cross-national datasets enables psychologists to integrate micro and macro levels of analysis.</s><s>Particularly interesting are cross-level interaction effects which show whether the nature of a lower-level relationship depends on a higher-level variable.</s><s>These kinds of cross-level interactions can illustrate to what extent the link between values and behavior changes as a function of context characteristics.</s><s>Although personal values have been found to be associated with a large variety of behaviors, little is known regarding how culture shapes these relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Roccas and Sagiv, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>To date, there have been only a few studies that examined cross-level interaction effects for valuebehavior relations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Vecchione et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated how the interaction of country-level and individual-level values is associated with behavior.</s><s>In this study, we aim to shed light on this issue by examining the interplay of personal and cultural values in predicting drinking behavior.</s></p><p><s>Intensity (or quantity) of drinking is one of the dimensions of alcohol consumption.</s><s>It is usually addressed in health research because of its consequences for mental and physical health.</s><s>Another crucial dimension of alcohol consumption is the frequency of drinking, which is interesting from a socialpsychological perspective, because it can serve as an expression of people's motivational goals.</s><s>Furthermore, this relationship may be moderated by the cultural context, so studying it can provide further insight into the value-behavior link as a function of culture.</s></p><p><s>To date, researchers have focused on socio-demographic and psychological factors, such as age and personality traits, as predictors of drinking behavior.</s><s>The social context in which drinking behaviors are situated has been mostly examined at the meso-level, e.g., in the form of neighborhood characteristics that foster frequent drinking behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sudhinaraset et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>With a few exceptions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Inman et al., 2017)</ref>, societal-level factors have been mainly studied in the form of policies related to alcohol use or in terms of alcohol advertisement and marketing.</s><s>Consequently, there is very little research about how cultural factors relate to alcohol consumption.</s><s>Most importantly, to date no study has examined how the link between personal values and alcohol consumption may depend on the cultural context.</s><s>The present paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the association of personal values with alcohol consumption across European countries and examining how this value-behavior relation is moderated by cultural values.</s></p><p><s>Studies on alcohol consumption can contain a wide variety of different items to assess self-reported drinking behavior, such as drinking status (drinking vs. not drinking), intensity or quantity of drinking (e.g., average volume of alcohol consumption over a given period of time) and frequency of drinking, as well as quantity and frequency of heavy or binge drinking.</s><s>These can be summarized by two overall dimensions: frequency of drinking and intensity of drinking or extent of drunkenness <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Room and Mäkelä, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Past research has shown that frequency and intensity of drinking show different relations with key sociodemographic variables: although it is a universal trend that men consume more alcohol and do so more frequently than women <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mäkelä et al., 2006)</ref>, younger people tend to drink less frequently but in greater quantity than older people (WHO, 2014); people with higher socio-economic status (SES) tend to drink more frequently, but in smaller quantities than low-SES groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sudhinaraset et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we focus on the frequency and not the intensity of drinking alcohol.</s><s>We are interested in examining variation in the use of a recreational lifestyle substance as it applies to most people in society, without focusing on the extent of drunkenness, which is theoretically less related to personal and cultural values and more related to health and addiction issues.</s><s>Frequency of drinking reflects a more conscious behavior that in turn may be based on people's motivational goals.</s><s>Moreover, the frequency of drinking is a much more reliable self-reported measure of behavior than the amount of drinking, and reliability is a crucial issue when examining value-behavior relations.</s><s>Questions about the amount of drinking are highly sensitive and usually underestimate the real amounts (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nugawela et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Previous analyses of European Social Survey (ESS) data have also shown that questions about quantity of drinking and abstinence were much more subject to interviewer bias than questions about frequency of drinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Wuyts et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Why do people drink alcohol?</s><s>When it comes to psychological predictors of alcohol consumption, drinking behavior has been widely explained in terms of immediate self-reported drinking motives.</s><s>Researchers generally agree about the following motives for alcohol consumption: (1) enjoyment and sensationseeking, (2) social motives, and (3) coping motives, related to anxiety and coping with stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbey et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kuntsche et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mobach and Macaskill, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Some researchers also distinguish a so-called conformity motive.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Grant et al. (2007)</ref> found that enjoyment and social motives demonstrated stable positive associations with drinking frequency, whereas conformity motives showed negative and coping showed nonsignificant associations.</s><s>Cross-national studies on drinking motives also found that social and enjoyment motives were generally positively related to frequency of drinking, while conformity motives were negatively related to it <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kuntsche et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In sum, the literature on drinking motives shows that motives are strong predictors of drinking behaviors, even more so than socio-demographic variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Grant et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Different motivational goals have been suggested to be at the core of different types of values which drive attitudes and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, it is conceivable that there is also a link between values and alcohol consumption.</s></p><p><s>Although there are numerous value theories in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rokeach, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hofstede, 2003)</ref>, the one that claims to cover most universal values, elaborated and tested across many cultures was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schwartz (1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schwartz ( , 2007))</ref>.</s><s>This theory assumes value conflicts and compatibilities at both the personal and societal level.</s><s>Its alignment with motivational goals allows for development of specific hypotheses at different levels about the association between values and behavior.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schwartz (1992)</ref> defines values as abstract desirable goals that serve as guiding principles in people's lives.</s><s>He argues that basic values can be organized into two higher-order dimensions and each dimension is marked by a bipolar value orientation which represents the fundamental value conflict.</s><s>One dimension is labeled Openness to Change (vs.</s><s>Conservation) and relates to the conflict of being motivated either to pursue autonomous, self-expressive experiences (intellectual and emotional) or to emphasize order, self-restriction, preserving the status quo <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The second dimension is labeled Self-Transcendence (vs.</s><s>Self-Enhancement) and represents the conflict of being motivated either to transcend selfish concerns and promote the welfare of others (both close and distant, as well as the environment) or to enhance one's own personal interests (even at the expense of others).</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schwartz (1992)</ref> proposes ten specific values that are organized in line with these two higher-order value dimensions: Self-Direction, Stimulation and Hedonism (for Openness to Change); Conformity, Security and Tradition (for Conservation); Power and Achievement (for Self-Enhancement); and Benevolence and Universalism (for Self-Transcendence). <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schwartz (1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schwartz ( , 2007) )</ref> also develops a culture-level value theory consisting of three fundamental value conflicts: Autonomy vs. Embeddedness, Harmony vs. Mastery, and Egalitarianism vs. Hierarchy.</s><s>He acknowledges that these culture-level values parallel individual-level values, such as Universalism being similar to Egalitarianism, or Conservation values approximately matching Embeddedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schwartz, 2007)</ref>, and that it is reasonable to assume that there is some structural isomorphism between values at the individual and the culture levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schwartz, 1994)</ref>.</s><s>In fact, several studies have shown that the individual-level value types can be aggregated and meaningfully used at the culture level without substantial loss of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fischer et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fischer and Poortinga, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fischer, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Using the same value types at both levels of analyses in multilevel models allows researchers to ask new questions about the role of personal and cultural values in shaping people's behavior: are the same value types associated in the same ways with the behavior across levels of analysis or do they show different patterns of association? Do the same value types at the individual and culture levels interact with each other to exacerbate or mitigate their effect on individuals' behavior?</s><s>Such research questions cannot be investigated if value types are conceptualized as being inequivalent across levels of analysis.</s><s>Hence, in this study we examine the same value types as predictors of drinking behavior at the individual and culture levels.</s></p><p><s>A few studies have already examined the link between personal values and various characteristics of drinking.</s><s>A pioneering study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gorsuch and Arno (1979)</ref> suggested that values endorsing group interests were negatively related to problematic alcohol consumption and casual drinking, whereas tolerance toward deviance had a positive association with positive attitudes to drinking.</s><s>Since then, only a few studies have been conducted on the link between values and drinking, as shown in our systematic literature search in Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, using "basic values, " "alcohol, " and "drinking" keywords.</s><s>For the sake of better comparability, we focused on studies that used Schwartz basic values or ones easily coerced to Schwartz theory.</s><s>After excluding duplicated reports, we identified 25 studies.</s><s>With the aid of the reference lists in these papers, we found additional three studies.</s><s>Finally, we removed studies that did not include indicators of alcohol consumption or attitudes toward it, resulting in 10 papers which are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>These studies are very diverse in their design, participants, measures of drinking and values.</s><s>However, there is a consistent pattern where Openness to Change values (Hedonism, Stimulation, and to some extent Self-Direction) are positively related to alcohol consumption, and Conservation values (Security, Conformity, Tradition) are negatively related.</s><s>This is the case for assessments of drinking status used with adolescents in Mexico and Hong Kong (drinking vs. not drinking; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ramírez and Musitu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lam, 2010)</ref> and of the number of alcoholic drink brands consumed among South Africans <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Schwartz et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>In a similar vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sheppard (2011)</ref> showed that positive attitudes toward drinking were positively related to Stimulation, Hedonism, Achievement, and Power values, and negatively to Tradition, Conformity, and Universalism, and somewhat less negatively to Security and Benevolence.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson (2012)</ref> found that US students who self-monitored their alcohol consumption (i.e., limited their drinking) were less likely to value Hedonism and endorsed Conformity and Tradition.</s><s>Studies examining frequency of drinking among adolescents or young adults also found that endorsing Conservation values was negatively related to frequent alcohol drinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Young and West, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>This trend holds even if middle-aged and older adults are surveyed, as was done in a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nordfjaern and Brunborg (2015)</ref> with Norwegian respondents.</s><s>Studies that did not use the Schwartz survey to assess values, but related value constructs, also reported a negative link between drinking and tradition-related values among respondents from Croatia, Hungary, and the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Unger et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Pikó and Brassai, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Livazović and Jukić, 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The findings on values reflecting the higher-order value dimension Self-Transcendence (vs.</s><s>Self-Enhancement) showed less consistent or non-significant associations with drinking behavior.</s><s>Some studies showed that Self-Transcendence values were associated with abstinence (although weakly in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lam, 2010)</ref> and were not endorsed by frequent and problematic drinkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dollinger and Kobayashi, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Regarding the Self-Enhancement values, it appears that Power values were positively related to various drinking behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dollinger and Kobayashi, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cole et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sheppard, 2011)</ref>, except in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nordfjaern and Brunborg (2015)</ref> study of older adults.</s><s>Achievement values were positively related to alcohol consumption in some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sheppard, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nordfjaern and Brunborg, 2015)</ref>, but not in others <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dollinger and Kobayashi, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Studies with related value constructs (but not in the framework of Schwartz value theory) also reported some evidence between drinking and power-related values (namely sexist authoritarianism and material values;

(2017)</ref> found that students from more individualistic countries rated all drinking motives more positively than those from collectivistic countries, reflecting the emphasis on approach motivations to drinking in individualistic societies.</s><s>In a similar vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Inman et al. (2017)</ref> demonstrated that there was a significant link between per capita alcohol consumption across 74 countries and Schwartz cultural values.</s><s>They found that Affective and Intellectual Autonomy, as well as Harmony values, were positively related and Embeddedness and Hierarchy values were negatively related to per capita alcohol consumption.</s><s>Intellectual Autonomy and Egalitarianism showed positive, but marginally significant associations with alcohol consumption.</s><s>Interestingly, in the subsample of European countries, only Embeddedness and Harmony showed significant relations with alcohol consumption, although the directions and magnitudes of associations were similar to the ones in the general sample.</s><s>However, findings are still somewhat inconclusive; for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mackenbach (2014)</ref> did not find significant associations between cultural values and overall alcohol consumption in European countries, although the direction of effects suggests that people in countries with high Embeddedness and Egalitarianism drink less alcohol.</s><s>Overall, the findings suggest that European countries emphasizing conservative values (such as the Embeddedness cultural value) are likely to show lower overall frequency of drinking than countries emphasizing Openness to Change values (such as the Affective and Intellectual Autonomy cultural values).</s><s>Based on <ref type="bibr">Inman's et al. results 2017, it</ref> is also reasonable to expect that individuals in countries emphasizing Self-Transcendence values (such as the Harmony and Egalitarianism cultural values) and de-emphasizing Self-Enhancement values (such as the Hierarchy cultural value) report somewhat more frequent drinking.</s><s>Therefore, we hypothesize that: H2: The value dimension Openness to Change (vs.</s></p><p><s>Conservation) is positively related to the frequency of drinking at the country level.</s><s>H3: The value dimension Self-Transcendence (vs.</s><s>Self-Enhancement) is positively related to the frequency of drinking at the country level.</s></p><p><s>In the studies reviewed above, cultural values were examined in terms of having a direct effect on alcohol consumption.</s><s>However, cultural values can also exert a cross-level interaction effect by changing the strength of the relationship between two individuallevel variables.</s><s>There is some indication that individual-level associations with drinking behaviors may not be the same across different cultures.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kuntsche et al. (2014)</ref> reveal that the motive-drinking link differs between students aged 17-19 from different parts of Europe: social motives show a stronger link with frequency of drinking among Northern European students, while the association with enjoyment and conformity is stronger in Southern Europe.</s><s>However, among younger students, these differences are reversed.</s><s>Taken together, the empirical evidence on the variability of these individual-level associations is scarce, inconclusive and has focused on drinking motives rather than values.</s></p><p><s>From a theoretical standpoint, culture constitutes a powerful normative context that can provide a greater or lesser sense of legitimacy for acting in line with one's personal values.</s><s>Moreover, a culture can directly reward or discourage specific behaviors.</s><s>In other words, culture may moderate the value-behavior link by enhancing or attenuating it <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bardi and Schwartz, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Personal values are individuals' internal compasses that guide them in their selection of possible behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Schwartz, 1996)</ref>.</s><s>In cultures that value intrinsic motivations, internal attributes in the form of personal values are likely to affect behavior more strongly.</s><s>However, the guidance function of personal values may be compromised in cultures in which intrinsic motivations, and therefore acting upon one's personal values, are less important <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Roccas and Sagiv, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Cultures that are characterized by stricter societal norms, such as collectivistic or "tight" societies, regulate individuals' behavior more strictly <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gelfand et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In these cultures, individuals are more likely to take social norms and expectations into account when it comes to their behavioral choices, and so the value-behavior link becomes attenuated (cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Vauclair and Fischer, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, in more "loose" societies, the culture's regulation of behaviors is less pronounced.</s><s>In combination with a norm of higher autonomy, this leads these societies to encourage individuals to express their own values.</s></p><p><s>Values at the individual level can also interact in affecting behavior.</s><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lönnqvist et al. (2006)</ref> show that Conformity values weaken relations between Self-Transcendence and altruistic behavior.</s><s>Individuals low in Conformity are more reluctant to conform to social norms, so they feel free to express their Self-Transcendence values.</s><s>Given that individuallevel Conformity is affected by culture-level Conformity, it is reasonable to expect culture-level Conformity values to have a moderating effect on the link between personal values and behavior.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Schwartz's (2015)</ref> value theory also draws a distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation which is crucial to understanding how cultural values might moderate the valuebehavior link.</s><s>Openness to Change and Self-Transcendence values are characterized by intrinsic motivation.</s><s>Behaviors that express these values provide satisfaction or pleasure through expressing autonomy and competence (Openness to Change) or nurturance and relatedness (Self-Transcendence). On the other hand, Conservation and Self-Enhancement values are characterized by extrinsic motivation, and attainment of these values is regulated more by obtaining social approval and material rewards (Self-Enhancement), meeting the expectations of others and avoiding the sanctions they may impose, or receiving protection and care (Conservation).</s><s>Therefore, cultures that promote intrinsic motivations by emphasizing Openness to Change and Self-Transcendence values encourage people to express their values.</s><s>In contrast, cultures that promote extrinsic motivations by emphasizing Conservation and Self-Enhancement values prevent people from expressing their values in general, encouraging them to follow normatively prescribed behaviors regardless of their values.</s><s>Assuming that frequent drinking is a socially undesirable behavior in conservative cultures (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Inman et al., 2017)</ref>, we would expect that the link between values and frequency of drinking is stronger in cultures that emphasize intrinsic motivations than in those that emphasize extrinsic ones.</s><s>Hence, we hypothesized that: H4: The individual-level value dimension Openness to Change (vs.</s><s>Conservation) has a stronger positive relation to frequency of drinking in cultures characterized by higher Openness to Change (vs.</s><s>Conservation).</s></p><p><s>Given the inconsistency of individual-level findings in regard to the Self-Transcendence (vs.</s><s>Self-Enhancement) dimension, we did not formulate any hypothesis.</s><s>However, following the extrinsic-intrinsic rationale presented above, we expected that value-behavior links may be stronger in cultures valuing Self-Transcendence than Self-Enhancement.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p><s>The current study examined how values relate to the frequency of drinking and how this values-drinking behavior link may be moderated by culture across 21 European countries.</s><s>We found some support for our hypotheses.</s><s>As expected, the individuallevel value dimension Openness to Change (vs.</s><s>Conservation) was positively related to the frequency of drinking.</s><s>This is consistent with previous research showing that individuals who value pleasure and enjoyment also exhibit more frequent drinking, whereas those valuing conformity and security drink alcohol less frequently (cf.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Country-level correlations demonstrated a positive association between frequent alcohol consumption and Openness to Change (vs.</s><s>Conservation) as well as Self-Transcendence (vs.</s><s>Self-Enhancement) cultural values.</s><s>This is consistent with the empirical evidence showing that individuals residing in countries that value Autonomy, Egalitarianism, and Harmony drink more frequently than individuals residing in countries that value Embeddedness and Hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Inman et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>However, in the multilevel regression models, after controlling for sample composition, the associations between the two value dimensions and drinking were found to be non-significant.</s><s>One explanation is that, in the given sample of countries, country differences in average frequency of drinking are related to differences in population structure, including gender and age.</s><s>Another reason might also be the small number of countries in the sample and, therefore, limited variability of both the criterion variable (only 8% of the variance was at the country level) and independent variables (country-level values).</s><s>While our hypotheses about the direct effects of values at the individual level were supported, the country-level hypotheses were not.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, our results on how cultural values may moderate the values-drinking link were contrary to what we expected.</s><s>Following previous theorizing in the literature, we reasoned that cultures differ in the extent to which they encourage individuals to act upon their personal values <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Roccas and Sagiv, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Cultures that promote intrinsic motivations through emphasizing Openness to Change and Self-Transcendence values should encourage people to express their personal values in all kinds of value-expressive behaviors (including drinking), therefore leading to a stronger link between personal values and behavior.</s><s>In contrast, cultures that promote extrinsic motivations through emphasizing Conservation and Self-Enhancement values should prevent them from expressing their values in general and encourage them to follow normatively prescribed behaviors, i.e., to abstain from frequent drinking, regardless of their values.</s><s>Therefore, the link between personal values and behavior should be weaker in these cultures.</s></p><p><s>However, the data did not support these hypotheses, but showed the opposite pattern to what we theorized: there was a positive association between personal Self-Transcendence (vs.</s><s>Self-Enhancement) values and frequency of drinking in countries putting higher importance on extrinsic motivations (i.e., Conservation or Self-Enhancement values), while this link was less positive or even negative in countries valuing intrinsic motivations (i.e., Openness to Change or Self-Transcendence values).</s><s>The marginally significant and negative interaction between individual-and country-level Openness to Change (vs.</s><s>Conservation) also supported this pattern.</s></p><p><s>We suggest two possible mechanisms that could explain these findings.</s><s>First, in countries that emphasize extrinsic motivation, social approval and rewards may be provided to more conservative individuals and to those who emphasize Self-Enhancement, so that they are encouraged to express their values in the form of less frequent drinking.</s><s>Indeed, Conservation values directly involve conformity, whereas Self-Enhancement values involve conformism through motivation for social approval <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kajonius et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, countries that emphasize intrinsic motivations through Openness and Self-Transcendence values keep normative pressure at relatively low levels; therefore expression of values through drinking is neither rewarded nor sanctioned, leading to the less positive or even negative links with drinking behavior.</s></p><p><s>Second, self-affirmation processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Steele, 1988</ref>) may explain why individuals with higher Openness to Change and Self-Transcendence values drink more frequently in more conservative societies (and by trend in the ones oriented toward Self-Enhancement values).</s><s>Their self-concept includes personal freedom and adherence to universalistic norms (beyond their social surroundings).</s><s>However, this self-concept may be perceived to be under threat in a social context in which societal norms require the opposite.</s><s>For these individuals, drinking alcohol may be an effective way to express their individual freedom from social norms and expectations that demand abstention from frequent drinking.</s><s>Engaging in activities that promote the values that are important to an individual can promote self-integrity.</s><s>Promoting one's values through these behaviors can affirm the individual and consequently reduce the perceived threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Sherman and Cohen, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, engaging in drinking behavior in conservative cultures may serve to remind individuals of the Openness to Change and Self-Transcendence values by which they define themselves and try to live their lives.</s><s>Both of these mechanisms are inherent consequences of more restrictive and socially "tight" cultures, as is the case in Conservation and Self-Enhancement cultures.</s><s>Finally, in some ways, drinking behavior could be seen as non-normative behavior which polarizes the population in conservative societies, dividing them into those who follow these norms and those who protest against it as a form of self-affirmation.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, in more open and more "socially loose" societies, there are no strict norms or expectations and there are no social rewards for more or less drinking.</s><s>This also means that the prevalent social and cultural norms are not perceived as a potential threat to one's self-concept.</s><s>Therefore, expressing one's Openness to Change or Self-Enhancement values through more frequent drinking is not socially or psychologically beneficial in these cultures.</s><s>It is noteworthy that the value-drinking link was not just attenuated in countries valuing more intrinsic motivations, but even became negative in the specific case of individual-level endorsement of Self-Transcendence (vs.</s><s>Self-Enhancement) in Openness to Change cultures.</s><s>A possible explanation (though not an exclusive one) is that differences in the value-drinking links evolved due to different value instantiations (i.e., context-specific expressions of values, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hanel et al., 2017)</ref> that depend on the context.</s><s>Instantiation of personal Self-Transcendence values in societies scoring high on Openness might find its expression in a broader set of behaviors, such as engaging in helping behavior or caring about nature.</s><s>In contrast, in conservative cultures the expression of Self-Transcendence values might be limited to higher sociability, which in turn leads to more frequent drinking.</s><s>Future research could more closely examine the phenomenon of value instantiation and the proposed mechanisms that suggest a context-dependent association between values and behavior.</s><s>Likewise, personal endorsement of Openness to Change values might be instantiated as freedom to drink in more conservative societies and as freedom to be involved in activities other than drinking in societies that value Openness.</s><s>Different instantiations could also be related to opportunities provided by different societies in regard to expression of values: in conservative societies, a variety of opportunities tend to be suppressed and it is likely that one of the few options available to express Openness or Hedonism is to break the social rules and drink.</s><s>On the other hand, societies with higher emphasis on Openness to Change offer more options for instantiating one's values, of which drinking is only one.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the evidence from our study challenged the general idea put forward in the literature that more "socially tight" cultures that emphasize extrinsic motivations place constraints on acting upon one's values-at least in the particular case of drinking frequency behavior.</s><s>The opposite seems to be the case; these cultures seem to strengthen the link between personal values and frequency of drinking, or even transform it from negative to positive.</s><s>In a way, this supports the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kuntsche et al. (2014)</ref>, who show that among older students in Northern Europe (usually scoring higher on Openness and lower on Conservation values), the link between frequency of drinking with enjoyment and conformity motives was weaker than in Southern Europe (scoring higher on Conservation and lower on Openness values).</s><s>Our results offer a new theoretical perspective by suggesting that freedom to express one's personal values does not always lead to a stronger value-behavior link.</s></p><p><s>Our study has some limitations.</s><s>First, it is limited to one dimension of drinking, namely the frequency of drinking, which is more related to individual preferences, lifestyle, and cultural patterns of drinking, rather than to risky health behaviors and alcohol abuse.</s><s>It is reasonable to expect that binge drinking or degrees of drunkenness have different correlates and distributions across cultures.</s><s>Second, as mentioned above, the sample was limited to 21 European countries, and these countries were not selected randomly.</s><s>This limits the generalization of the results to a larger set of countries.</s><s>The relatively small sample size also underpowers country-level effects, restricting the inclusion of covariates at the country level and making them less precise than they could be in a larger sample.</s><s>This might also explain why one of the cross-level interaction effects was only marginally significant.</s><s>However, the overall pattern of results-also supported by the additional analyses reported in the Supplementary Materials-corroborates our interpretation of the findings.</s><s>Future research with data from more countries could establish whether the effects of cultural values are reproducible outside Europe and whether they change after controlling for the relevant country characteristics, such as climate or prevalent religion.</s><s>Third, causality between values and drinking behavior is not guaranteed in our study, as all the key variables were measured at the same time.</s><s>It is possible that more frequent drinking leads to less stress or more emphasis on Hedonism values.</s><s>However, as is the case with most behaviors, the direction of causality from values to behavior is more plausible (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Maio, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>These relations are less obvious at the country level, where the opposite direction of causality is possible, as well as some third variable that may determine these relations.</s><s>Fourth, we studied self-reported behaviors, and since the frequency of drinking can be a sensitive issue, respondents could have underreported their drinking behavior.</s><s>Fifth, we examined the direct link between values and the frequency of drinking, although these relations might be mediated by many variables, such as attitudes to drinking, drinking intentions, oras we suggested above-value instantiations.</s></p><p><s>Despite these limitations, the current study makes an important contribution to the literature.</s><s>It is the first study to report cross-country differences in value-drinking links.</s><s>It sheds light on how the value-drinking behavior link may be moderated by the cultural context.</s><s>And, most importantly, it identifies a number of novel results suggesting a set of possible explanations that can shed more light on explaining drinking patterns across nations, taking into account not only individual characteristics but also the cultural contexts in which individuals live.</s><s>Ultimately, this study suggests that the strength of the value-behavior link differs across cultures, yet in a way that is more complex than was previously assumed.</s><s>This opens up new possibilities for research on values and behavior in a crosscultural context.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Female</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p></p></div></figDesc></figure>
