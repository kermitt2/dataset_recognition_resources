<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Imaging Protocol</head><p><s>All examinations, including contrast-enhanced CT, were performed on a dedicated 16-slice SPECT/CT system (Discovery NM/CT670; GE Healthcare) after intravenous injection of 200 MBq (5.4 mCi) of 111 In-octreotide (Octreoscan; Mallinckrodt Medical GmbH).</s><s>SRS was performed in accordance with current guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Planar Imaging.</s><s>Whole-body planar imaging was performed 4, 24, and 48 h after injection.</s><s>Images were acquired in step-and-shoot mode using medium-energy general-purpose collimators and energy windows centered on 171% 6 10% and 245% 6 10% (256 • 1,024 matrix, table speed of 13.3 cm/min, and zoom of 1.0).</s></p><p><s>Low-Dose SPECT/CT.</s><s>Whole-body low-dose SPECT/CT was performed 24 and 48 h after injection using the same collimators and energy windows as for planar imaging (360°, 60 frames, 40 s per frame, step-and-shoot mode, 6°angles, 128 • 128 matrix, 540 • 400 field of view, 2 bed positions, and roughly 4 cm of overlap).</s><s>The SPECT data were reconstructed iteratively (ordered-subset expectation maximization, 2 iterations, 10 subsets) with CT-based attenuation correction using the low-dose CT images (10 mA, 120 kV, 3.75-mm slice thickness) for generation of the m-map.</s></p><p><s>Diagnostic CT and Diagnostic SPECT/CT.</s><s>Diagnostic CT was performed 24 h after injection using a multiphase delay after administration of intravenous contrast medium (70-100 mL of Imeron 300 [weight-dependent]; Bracco Imaging Deutschland GmbH).</s><s>The delay was 25 s for the arterial phase and 45 s for the portal-venous phase (upper-abdominal imaging), and there was a 70-s delay for the venous phase (thoracoabdominopelvic imaging) (50-300 mAs as modified by body region and automatic dose modulation [AutomA]; 120 kVp; 16 • 1.25 mm collimation; pitch of 1.375; and 16 • 1.25 mm slice thickness).</s><s>The protocol did not include oral contrast medium.</s></p><p><s>A dedicated Xeleris workstation (GE Healthcare) was used to coregister the low-dose SPECT/CT images at 24 h with the venous CT images to create the diagnostic SPECT/CT dataset.</s><s>In evaluating the diagnostic SPECT/CT images, the interpreters also viewed and coregistered the arterial and portal-venous CT images if necessary.</s></p></div>

Imaging study of 39-y-old man with suspected NEN of pancreas (patient 3 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Although focal uptake on low-dose SPECT/CT increased from 24 h (A) to 48 h (B) after injection, focus could be decisively attributed to pancreatic tail only on diagnostic SPECT/CT (D), as contrastenhanced CT component itself revealed no hypervascularized correlate (C).</s><s>Wong et al. that in SR SPECT/CT an acquisition at 24 h may be sufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, SPECT/CT affected therapy management in about 25% of patients by detecting previously unknown lesions, resulting in alteration of the initial treatment strategy.</s><s>Although this observation is in line with experience with SR PET/CT imaging, the absolute rate of examinations resulting in treatment changes is lower than in PET/CT imaging, which has been reported to alter therapy management in more than half of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>.</s><s>This apparent inferiority of SPECT/CT can be explained in part by the poorer performance of conventional SRS than of SR PET <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s>In analogy, and taking such biases as those due to statistics or different patient populations aside, the majority detection rate of conventional SRS, including SPECT, in the present study was only 55.6% (low-dose SPECT/CT at 48 h) and does not compare with the performance of the SR PET component (72.8%) in PET/CT <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this context, it must be mentioned that the performance of SRS may be improved with 99m Tc-labeled SR ligands.</s><s>In a head-to-head comparison of 99m Tc-labeled hydrazinonicotinyl-Tyr 3 -octreotide and 111 In-octreotide, the former showed a higher sensitivity and higher lesional uptake and could be performed as a 1-d examination <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the 99m Tc-based approach is also clearly advantageous with regard to tracer availability and quality of image reconstruction.</s><s>Therefore, further prospective comparative studies between these two tracers are needed.</s><s>Finally, even taking the prospect of better SPECT or SPECT/CT performance with 99m Tc-labeled tracers into account, a recent metaanalysis on SR PET and PET/CT reported an impressive sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 91% for the detection of NENs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, we believe that SR PET/CT should be the modality of choice for initial staging, before curative surgery, or in patients with an unknown primary.</s><s>However, in accord with Schillaci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, we conclude that the detection rate of 86% achieved by modern SR SPECT/CT technique may provide valuable information in a noncurative setting for patients with metastatic disease under systemic therapy if SR PET/CT is not available.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>With state-of-the-art SPECT/CT scanners, it is possible to streamline the conventional 111 In-DTPA-octreotide SRS protocol to a single planar and tomographic whole-body acquisition at 24 h after injection.</s><s>As expected from PET/CT, the integration of a triple-phase CT protocol provided robust results, had the highest NEN lesion detection rate, and greatly improved interpreter confidence in anatomic lesion assignment.</s><s>Also, similar to SR PET/CT, conventional hybrid imaging by SPECT/CT had a high impact on patient management and therapy planning.</s></p></div>
