<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task</head><p><s>During the MIB and half of the Replay runs (henceforth called Replaybutton condition), subjects were asked to press and hold a button with their right index finger during target disappearance and another button with their right middle finger during target re-appearance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, top panel, left).</s><s>In the other half of the Replay runs (henceforth called Replay-count condition), subjects were instructed to silently count the number of target offsets and report the total in a four-alternative forcedchoice question displayed on the screen after the end of the run (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, top panel, right).</s><s>There were always one correct and three incorrect numbers; the incorrect numbers were generated by randomly subtracting or adding 1, 2 or 3 from the actual number of disappearances, under the constraint that the four alternatives were all different from each other.</s><s>Replay-button or Replay-count conditions were randomly selected before each run, under the constraint that each would occur equally often.</s><s>The corresponding instructions were displayed on the screen and communicated verbally by the experimenter before each run.</s><s>Each run had a duration of 3 min.</s></p><p><s>To test for an effect of surprise on the pupil dilation amplitudes, the predictability of the timing of perceptual events (stimulus disappearance or re-appearance) was manipulated during three different Replay conditions.</s><s>To this end, the intervals between physical target offsets and onsets were randomly sampled from three different distributions, corresponding to narrow, intermediate and broad hazard functions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>The hazard function describes the probability that an event will occur at a particular point in time, given that it has not occurred yet <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Luce, 1986)</ref>, and is computed as</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">kÃ°tÃž Â¼ f Ã°tÃž 1 Ã€ f Ã°tÃž ;<label>Ã°1Ãž</label></formula><p><s>where f(t) is the value of distribution f at time t, k(t) is the value of the hazard function at t, and f(t) is the area under the curve of f until t.</s><s>Varying the hazard function changes the overall level of surprise elicited by stimulus changes, which can be formalized as the negative logarithm of the probability of an event <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Friston, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, most events in the narrow, intermediate and broad hazard function conditions (i.e.</s><s>those that occur around the center of mass of the corresponding distribution) are associated with low-, medium-and high-surprise, respectively.</s><s>For simplicity, we here refer to these conditions overall as 'low-surprise', 'medium-surprise' and 'highsurprise' conditions, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>Splitting up individual events by the level of the associated surprise (which varies from event to event within each condition) might enable a more sensitive analysis; because we found significant modulation of the pupil dilation amplitude by the surprise condition (see Results), the analysis reported here seemed sufficiently sensitive.</s></p></div>

Munoz, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>This effect would result in a stronger dilation around target re-appearance, in contrast with our results.</s><s>Future work should test the effects of visual contrast and perceived brightness under the stimulus and task conditions used here.</s></p><p><s>We propose that the perceptual content effect in the pupil response reflects a difference in engagement that depends on the behavioral context.</s><s>The effect might reflect a difference in the subjective saliency assigned to the disappearance and re-appearance events or, relatedly, a (stronger or more reliable) shift in covert attention towards the target triggered by the sudden target disappearance.</s><s>Indeed, shifts in attention modulate the pupil response under certain conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mathot et al., 2013)</ref>, and microstimulation of an important node in the attentional control network, the superior colliculus, induces transient pupil responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wang et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>While neither physical stimulus properties nor the temporal context of the switch events seem sufficient to account for the perceptual content effect, one relevant aspect might be that only one of the two perceptual interpretations in MIB is illusory (target absent) whereas the other is veridical (target present).</s><s>Future work should compare different types of perceptual illusions to determine the factors governing the subjective salience of the perceptual switch events.</s></p><p><s>Our findings indicate that the phasic activation of pupil-linked brainstem systems can be driven by purely subjective perceptual changes in a content-specific fashion.</s><s>This conclusion has important implications for neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies of perception.</s><s>Phasic brainstem activation is rapidly followed by changes in cortical state <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parikh et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pinto et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our current and previous <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Einhauser et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hupe et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Naber et al., 2011)</ref> pupillometry results may, at least in part, account for retinotopically global modulations of population activity that have been observed in early visual cortex during perceptual switches in various illusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Donner et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Donner et al., , 2013;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">de-Wit et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kloosterman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">N. Rubin, personal communication)</ref>.</s><s>In particular, in MIB, this global activity modulation exhibits similar characteristics as the pupil diameter modulation reported here, occurring during both the illusion and its physical replay, and differentiating between target disappearance and re-appearance.</s><s>An important difference, however, is that the activity modulation during MIB differs in sign between target disappearance and re-appearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Donner et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kloosterman et al., 2015)</ref>, as opposed to the scaling of the (generally positive) pupil response amplitude by perceptual content observed here.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our findings point to an intriguing feedback interaction between subjective perception and global brain state.</s><s>Pupillinked brainstem systems are phasically activated by changes in subjective perception.</s><s>We here show that the amplitude of this phasic activation can depend on the contents of the perceptual changes.</s><s>Because this phasic activation, in turn, causes widespread changes in cortical state, our finding implies that subsequent perception and cognition is affected in a way that depends on the contents of preceding perceptual changes.</s></p></div>
