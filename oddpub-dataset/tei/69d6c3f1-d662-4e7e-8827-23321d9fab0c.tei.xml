<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The present pilot study evaluated repetitive imaginary cue-exposure to reduce craving in recently abstinent alcohol-dependent patients.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies focussed on the effects of in vivo cue-exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rohsenow et al., 2001)</ref> or thinking about negative consequences of drinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Naqvi et al., 2015)</ref> on the level of craving.</s><s>We hypothesized a reduction of craving in subjects who imagined drinking their preferred alcoholic drink repetitively since a previous study in healthy subjects found a significant decrease in real chocolate consumption as a result of repetitive imagination of chocolate consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Morewedge et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The authors concluded that these findings were a consequence  of habituation which has also been explored in the research area of food intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Epstein et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Morewedge et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wisniewski et al., 1992)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Intriguingly, alcohol-dependent patients showed no reductions in craving scores after the first imagination session, whereas, in line with the findings of Morewedge and co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Morewedge et al., 2010)</ref>, healthy subjects showed a nearly significant decrease in the urge to drink alcohol after applying the same imagination protocol in our study.</s><s>Control groups imagining drinking of water did not show any significant changes in craving.</s><s>Interestingly, the group imagining performing an analogous movement without cues of alcohol or drinking (filling a washing machine with cleaning agent) showed a reduction in craving.</s><s>It is possible that this finding is related to the absence of the desired target within this protocol (i.e., alcohol).</s><s>However, conclusions cannot be drawn due to the small sample size of this group (n = 6).</s></p><p><s>More importantly, craving was not reduced in patients of both groups that imagined the consumption of alcohol repetitively (3 vs. 30 times), potentially indicating that even a high number of repetitions might not be sufficient to engender habituation.</s><s>These preliminary results might indicate an aberrant ability to habituate to alcohol-related stimuli in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients.</s><s>Findings from studies investigating cue-reactivity in alcohol-dependent patients using fMRI suggest an altered central processing of alcohol-related stimuli in alcohol dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Myrick et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wrase et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Also, our preliminary results are partially in line with the findings of a study in moderate to heavy smokers, who reported constant craving for cigarettes in consequence of cue-exposure on several days <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Miranda et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Desire thinking has been reported to have a significant effect on the occurrence of craving <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Caselli et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, since we did not assess desire thinking by questionnaires such as the DTQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Caselli &amp; Spada, 2011)</ref> in our study, no clear conclusions on the role of desire thinking in the modulation of craving can be made.</s></p><p><s>Our preliminary results indicate that repetitive in sensu cue-exposure therapy might not reduce craving in alcohol-dependent patients.</s><s>Possibly, a different protocol including a higher number of repetitions during a longer period of time is needed to induce habituation to alcohol-related stimuli in patients with AUD.</s><s>On the contrary, an aberrant ability to habituate to alcohol-related stimuli might be a key component of the pathology in alcohol dependence.</s><s>One might argue that habituation is only relevant in the modification of responses related to aversive stimuli and not applicable to appetitive stimuli.</s><s>However, research regarding food intake suggests that habituation also occurs after repeated presentation of appetitive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Coelho et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Morewedge et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Park and co-workers recently investigated the efficacy of virtual reality cue-exposure techniques on craving in gamblers <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Park et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to our study, a significant reduction in urges to gamble after repetitive virtual cue-exposure was found.</s><s>Interestingly, the study was not conducted in individuals who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling.</s><s>Thus, one might speculate that subjects with addictive disorders might have shown divergent responses.</s><s>A recent review of studies on the use of virtual reality in the assessment of craving and the treatment of substance use disorders revealed craving induction during virtual cue-exposure in most studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hone-Blanchet, Wensing, &amp; Fecteau, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However, results concerning the therapeutic potential of virtual reality were inconsistent and mainly hard to compare.</s><s>Also, most of these studies only investigated nicotine abuse/dependence.</s><s>Nevertheless, in line with our preliminary findings, craving was not significantly decreased by therapeutic use of virtual reality cue-exposure in the majority of the reviewed trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hone-Blanchet, Wensing, et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several limitations of our pilot study need to be addressed.</s><s>First, we only assessed effects of repetitive imagination of alcohol consumption in abstinent patients after detoxification treatment; the degree to which these findings also extend to other phases of alcohol dependence (e.g., currently drinking patients) remains unclear.</s><s>Second, the sample size of each group was far too small to draw clear conclusions, although several control conditions were integrated in the study design.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our preliminary results indicate that the repetitive imagination of alcohol consumption does not lead to a consecutive craving reduction in patients with AUD.</s><s>It is possible, that the ability to habituate to alcohol-related stimuli during in sensu cue-exposure is impaired in alcohol-dependent patients.</s><s>Future clinical trials with larger samples and varying imagination protocols are needed to evaluate the effects of repetitive imaginary alcohol consumption on craving in alcohol-dependent patients.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Flow diagram of the study.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,102.84,423.44,398.56,302.63" type="bitmap" /></figure>
