<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoreactive localization of resistin in rat pancreatic islets</head><p><s>Resistin immunohistchemical and immunofluorescence staining was observed only in the periphery of pancreatic islets in male Wistar rats (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In the case of immunohistchemical localization, control incubation of tissue slices with anti-resistin primary antibody and blocking peptide -resistin protein (Biovendor, Czech Republic) was performed.</s><s>Observed signal was abolished.</s><s>Immunofluorescence technique was used to identified resistin co-expression in glucagon-producing a-cells.</s><s>Signals from glucagon and resistin were localized in the same cells.</s><s>To prove the lack of glucagon binding by the anti-resistin antibody we performed additional western blots.</s><s>One microgram of resistin and glucagon proteins were loaded on 2 gels.</s><s>Then samples were transferred into 2 membranes.</s><s>The first one was incubated in anti-resistin antibody and the second one was incubated in antiglucagon antibody.</s><s>Clear signals were obtained only from resistin lane with anti-resistin antibody and only from glucagon lane with anti-glucagon antibody.</s><s>This experiment excluded the possibility of potential crossreactivity of anti-resistin antibody in Western blot as well as in Immunofluorescence.</s><s>In above mentioned experiment the same resistin (from Biovendor) was used, glucagon was from Sigma Aldrich cat.</s><s>no.</s><s>G2044.</s><s>Primary antibodies which were used in additional Western blots were identical with the ones used in main Western blot and Immunofluorescence.</s><s>The presence of 2 or even 3 bands is due to a strong tendency of resistin to create dimmers, trimers and hexamers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detection of resistin expression by real time PCR and Western Blotting</head><p><s>Detection of resistin mRNA in rat pancreatic islets was carried out by real time PCR technique.</s><s>As a negative control INS-1E cells producing insulin were used.</s><s>These cells are clones of b cells which are located in the center of pancreatic islets.</s><s>As a positive control isolated rat adipocytes were used, which are one of the main resistin sources in rat organism.</s><s>We found resistin gene expression in pancreatic islets.</s><s>The observed expression was lower than in adipocytes but clearly detectable, in contrast to the INS-1E cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Resistin protein expression was quantified by Western blotting technique.</s><s>The same positive (adipocytes) and negative (INS-1E cells) controls as in PCR were used.</s><s>Results obtained at the protein level corresponded to the results at mRNA level.</s><s>Similarly to PCR we observed the highest quantity of resistin in adipocytes, mediate in islets and it was not detectable in INS-1E cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glucagon secretion from cell lines and pancreatic islets</head><p><s>As above mentioned all results are presented as a percent of control.</s><s>Variable effects on glucagon secretion were observed in InR-G9 cells exposed to resistin.</s><s>At 1 mM glucose, glucagon secretion declined by 20% at 10 nM resistin and 100 nM resistin.</s><s>At 6 mM glucose glucagon secretion increased in response to resistin by 40% at 1 nM resistin and near 50% at both 10 nM or 100 nM resistin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 A-B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In the case of secretion from pancreatic islets at 1 mM glucose glucagon level was also significantly decreased in response to resistin treatment by approximately 15% at 10 nM resistin, and a distinct significant increase at 6 mM glucose (approximately 45%) was found -in the presence of 1 nM and 10 nM resistin and 20% at 100 nM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 C-D</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study shows that resistin is expressed in rat pancreatic a-cells, and can modulate secretion activity of clonal cell lines and pancreatic islets.</s><s>A novel finding is the detection of resistin protein in rat pancreas by different methods: immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, real time PCR and Western blotting.</s><s>To our knowledge, studies evaluating resistin immunoreactivity in rat pancreatic islets haven't been published so far.</s><s>The presence of resistin-immunoreactivity in pancreatic cells was shown in humans only.</s><s>Minn et al. detected positive signals in the center of islets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11</ref></s><s>t suggested that human resistin could be co-expressed with insulin in pancreatic b cells or expressed in a new type of cells.</s><s>While, Al-Salam showed that resistin is co-localizated with insulin in human islets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12</ref> .</s><s>We assume that pancreatic resistin may lead to paracrine and autocrine regulations within the islets.</s><s>So far there has been small number of publications showing the presence of resistin in rat tissues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref></s><s>Surprisingly, in our research we found resistin signals in the periphery of rat pancreatic islets only.</s><s>Furthermore, we confirmed that resistin is co-expressed in glucagon-immuoreactive a cells.</s><s>To exclude a potential resistin penetration from the blood into the a cells we performed real time PCR analysis.</s><s>It confirmed resistin gene expression inside the islets.</s><s>Protein localization inside the islets was confirmed also by Western blotting.</s><s>It is likely that this opposite localization of resistin in rat and human suggests different local interactions (paracrine and autocrine) between pancreatic hormones within the islets of rat and human.</s><s>Therefore, as far as studies of resistin are concerned rat model should not be referred to human one.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, we found inhibitory influence on insulin secretion from INS-1E cells at physiological as well as supraphysiological glucose concentrations (6 and 24 mM respectively), and similar but less strong effect on pancreatic islets.</s><s>Furthermore, resistin also inhibited glucagon secretion from InR1-G9 cells as well as isolated islets at 1 mM glucose and reversely increases glucagon secretion from cells and islets at 6 mM glucose.</s></p><p><s>Our results were obtained without any stimulants.</s><s>Probably the effect of arginine on glucagon secretion might change the results observed in our manuscript (perhaps resistin suppression of glucagon secretion would be more visible or inversely -abolished) but we decided to perform our experiments on basal level without stimulants.</s><s>Our main goal was to show the basic influence of resistin on cells and islets even though that influence would be mild.</s></p><p><s>Results obtained in both, pancreatic b and a cell lines show that resistin can contribute to disturbances in glycaemia.</s><s>In experiments at identical glucose and resistin levels on freshly isolated pancreatic islets, resistin was not so effective in regulating glucagon or insulin secretion.</s><s>It is possible that compensatory mechanisms prevent from high fluctuations of the secretion of both pancreatic hormones.</s><s>Nonetheless, we speculated that reduction of insulin secretion and simultaneous increase of glucagon secretion at normoglycaemia may lead to increased blood glucose level.</s><s>We may speculate that mechanisms involved in this effect are connected to increase of SOCS-3 expression and a decrease of Akt phosphorylation inside islets as described Nakata. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref></s><s>he influence of resistin on the secretion of insulin and glucagon from pancreatic islets is not well understood.</s><s>Nakata et al. revealed no differences in insulin secretion from murine pancreatic islets treated with 10 nM resistin at 2.8 or 8.3 mM glucose for 60 min, as compared to vehicle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref></s><s>However, when the incubation was prolonged until 24 h, a rise of insulin secretion at 2.8 mM glucose was reported.</s><s>On the other hand, at 8.3 mM glucose, a decline of insulin secretion was observed.</s><s>The increase of insulin secretion at 2.8 mM glucose tempted the authors to conclude that resistin induces a local insulin resistance in pancreatic islets by impairing the autocrine action of insulin.</s><s>This hypothesis was supported by the reported increase of SOCS-3 expression and a decrease of Akt phosphorylation in islets.</s><s>Our results confirm that resistin can inhibit insulin secretion at physiologically moderate glucose levels (6 to 8.3 mM), which is in agreement with the report by Nakata et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref> It seems that resistin can decrease insulin secretion; however this appears to be rather a longer lasting process.</s></p><p><s>In a different study on pancreatic b cells Brown et al. reported in bTC-6 cell a 70% decrease of insulin receptor mRNA and a 60% decrease of insulin receptor protein after overnight incubation with resistin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">14</ref></s><s>his observation may confirm that resistin contributes to insulin resistance in islets.</s><s>In BRIN-BD11 b cell line resistin failed to affect insulin secretion at supraphysiologically high glucose (22 mM).</s><s>The authors concluded that this observation can be explained by a lower sensitivity of this cell line in comparison to freshly isolated pancreatic islets.</s></p><p><s>Summarizing, we showed for the first time the presence of resistin in glucagon-immunoreactive cells of the rat pancreatic islets.</s><s>Furthermore, we observed that resistin can decrease insulin secretion from b cell lines and pancreatic islets, and increase or decrease glucagon secretion from a cell lines and isolated islets depending on glucose concentration.</s></p></div>
