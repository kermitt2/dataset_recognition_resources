<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We had previously established ICAM-1 -/-NOD mice as a novel animal model of human CIDP.</s><s>Here, we used this model to make important discoveries in chronic neuritis.</s><s>First, IVIg treatment ameliorates chronic neuritis in ICAM-1 -/-NOD mice and this treatment response features great heterogeneity.</s><s>This opens up an angle to experimentally study this heterogeneity.</s><s>Second, nerve MRI is feasible and allows quantifying treatment-dependent nerve abnormalities in a rodent model of chronic nerve inflammation.</s><s>Nerve MRI may thus also allow tracking treatment effects in chronic inflammatory neuropathies.</s><s>Third, prospectively quantified IL-17 production by blood T cells predicts the response to IVIg treatment in ICAM-1 -/-NOD mice and intraneural IL-17 production is enhanced preferentially in early stage human CIDP patients.</s><s>These findings support the adequacy of the ICAM-1 -/-NOD model and set the stage for subsequent studies directed at identifying prognostic markers of the highly heterogenous IVIg treatment response in CIDP.</s></p><p><s>MRI abnormalities correlated with clinical impairments in our model and were most pronounced in distal parts of the sciatic nerve while MRI demonstrated IVIg treatment effects most prominently in distal parts of the sciatic nerve.</s><s>We thus show that nerve T2 signal is a useful marker to monitor inflammatory neuropathy in mice and can also be used to monitor and localize effects of IVIg treatment.</s></p><p><s>Peripheral nerve MRI has been used to study many different aspects of peripheral nerve diseases (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>).</s><s>Recent studies have utilized contrast enhancement agents to visualize different cellular components and aspects of nerve damage and regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>More recent studies have also used the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique to assess axonal integrity and regeneration by MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several studies have reported T2 signal hyperintensities of the affected peripheral nerve but also reported that MRI signal alterations cannot be directly equated with one type of lesion or a primary cause of disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>It has been speculated that T2 hyperintensities reflect axonal injury and persistent signal abnormailities may even allow to detect inadequate axonal regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>T2 hyperintensities may thus reflect axonal degeneration and may in fact even allow assessing axonal regeneration.</s><s>Acute immune-mediated and chronic inherited demyelination on the other hand did not result in obvious T2 hyperintensities in another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>We therefore speculate that the T2 hyperintensities we observed, reflect ongoing axonal degeneration.</s><s>In our animal model of CIDP, cellular infiltration, inflammatory demyelination, and axonal degeneration are closely linked <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> because all abnormalities result from T cell autoreactivity against the PNS.</s><s>The ICAM-1 -/-NOD mouse is thus poorly suited to dissect the relative contribution of demyelination, axonal loss and cellular infiltration in causing specific MRI alterations.</s><s>Performing nerve MRI in this model of CIDP, however, does allow monitoring treatment effects and preclinically testing and localizing the primariy site of action of such treatments.</s></p><p><s>Other studies have reported an increase in IL-17 production in CIDP.</s><s>The percentage of peripheral Th17 cells and IL-17 plasma levels were increased in human CIDP patients with active disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Concentrations of IL-17 and IL-6, which induces IL-17, were also reported to be increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of CIDP patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Others reported an increased IL-17 production by blood mononuclear cells in CIDP patients, although this was not specific for this cytokine and IFN-γ levels were also increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our findings demonstrating increased intraneural IL-17 production in CIDP are in accordance with previous studies and IL-17 may constitute a future prognostic marker of IVIg treatment response.</s></p><p><s>IVIg is a preparation of human polyclonal IgG obtained from plasma of several thousands of healthy donors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in CIDP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>However, the mechanism of action of IVIg remains incompletely understood and probably cannot be attributed to one specific mechanism of action.</s><s>Potential mechanisms of IVIg include: anti-idiotype effects, inhibition of the complement pathway, Fc receptor modulation on macrophages and other effector cells, suppression of pathogenic cytokines, and effects on cell migration and direct effect on remyelination (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>).</s><s>Human IVIg have previously demonstrated efficacy in murine models of inflammatory neuropathies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> and in murine models of other diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and rheumatoid arthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>The IVIg effects are thus at least partly species independent and have been attributed to the Fc portion of the immunoglobulins (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>).</s><s>This supports our approach of utilizing human IVIg preparations to treat a murine autoimmune disease model.</s><s>In addition, our study was specifically designed to identify prognostic markers of the IVIg treatment response in CIDP and we identify IL-17 as one potential prognostic factor in chronic inflammatory neuropathies.</s></p><p><s>Our study has certain technical limitations: Despite stratification by both pre-treatment NCV and clinical score we observed a considerable degree of inter-individual variability in clinical score and response to treatment.</s><s>The differences between treatment groups were thus not very pronounced.</s><s>IVIg treatment also did not significantly change electrophysiology measures after treatment (data not shown).</s><s>Interestingly, electrophysiology measures were also not significantly altered by IVIg treatment in human CIDP patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> although electrophysiology correlated with clinical impairments <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>We speculate that more clearly demonstrating IVIg efficacy may require a longer treatment duration or further increase of IVIg dosage.</s><s>An alternative approach could be to synchronize the disease onset of chronic neuritis by adoptive transfer into immunodeficient hosts as we have previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and treating the recipients with IVIg.</s></p><p><s>Prospectively collecting samples from early stage human CIDP patients during IVIg treatment is challenging.</s><s>CIDP diagnosis is often made with considerable delay and due to its cost, IVIg is often used as a second-line treatment.</s><s>This prognostic aspect can be addressed with relative ease in our model.</s><s>Compared to human patients, a relatively homogenous cohort of mice can be treated even before the onset of severe clinical impairments.</s><s>Our attempt to identify a prognostic biomarker of treatment response to IVIg was pre-biased by our previous findings that IL-17 production is enhanced in ICAM-1 -/-NOD mice.</s><s>It will be an important future direction of study to perform prospective, un-biased, genome-wide expression analyses in IVIg-treated ICAM-1 -/-NOD mice.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we here utilized a previously established model of chronic inflammatory neuropathies to identify a potential prognostic biomarker and to establish nerve MRI as a noninvasive tool for treatment monitoring, that sets the stage for future studies.</s></p></div>
