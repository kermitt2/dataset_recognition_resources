<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Swine influenza is a respiratory disease caused by multiple subtypes of influenza A virus (IAV).</s><s>The genome of IAV consists of eight segments, which code for different virus proteins.</s><s>Subtype classification of IAV is based on the encoded surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and so far, 16 different HA and nine different NA subtypes have been described together with two recently discovered bat-derived subtypes, H17N10 and H18N11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cheung and Poon, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Wu et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Influenza A virus contains further six "internal" gene segments which encode basic polymerase 2 (PB2), basic polymerase 1 (PB1), acidic polymerase (PA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix (M1, M2), and non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2).</s><s>These segments and their translation products have an essential role in the virulence and host specificity of a given IAV and can also impact the risk of transmission to humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bi et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The predominant swine IAV (swIAV) subtypes globally are H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2, which all show considerable diversity.</s><s>The genetic and antigenic characteristics of IAVs in pigs differ depending on their geographic locations (Kuntz- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Simon and Madec, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Simon et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In Europe, the dominant H1N1 swIAV is of avian origin, referred to as avian-like swine H1N1 (H1 av N1 av ), which was introduced from waterfowl to pigs in the late 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Pensaert et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Simon et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The dominant genotype of H3N2 virus in European pigs is the H3N2 (H3 sw N2 sw ) virus that was introduced in 1984.</s><s>The HA and NA genes of the H3 sw N2 sw are of human origin, while the other six gene segments are of avian (H1 av N1 av ) descent <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Castrucci et al., 1993)</ref>.</s><s>In 1994, an H1N2 reassortant was isolated for the first time in United Kingdom and has subsequently been detected in many European countries.</s><s>This human-like reassortant swine H1N2 (H1 hu N2 sw ) virus comprised the HA gene from a human seasonal H1N1 virus, the NA gene from the H3 sw N2 sw virus and internal genes from the H1 av N1 av virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alexander et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>The dominating European H1 hu N2 sw virus has never been detected in Denmark, however, a new reassortant H1 av N2 sw , containing the HA gene from the H1 av N1 av virus and the NA gene from H3 sw N2 sw , was found in Denmark in 2003 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Trebbien et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>This avian-like H1N2 (H1 av N2 sw ) virus has become established in Denmark and other European countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Trebbien et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Simon et al., 2014)</ref> and is now the most prevalent subtype circulating in Danish pigs.</s><s>In 2009, a new human pandemic strain [A(H1N1)pdm09] entered the global swine population and is now enzootic in swine globally.</s><s>Furthermore, an increasing number of reassortants between the predominant enzootic swIAVs and the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus have been observed, making subtyping of swIAV a very complex task <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Starick et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Watson et

2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Krog et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In Denmark, a passive surveillance program for swIAVs has been conducted since 2011.</s><s>A requirement for efficient swIAV surveillance is highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests.</s><s>Today, the swIAV screening test and subsequent subtyping is performed by reverse transcription (RT) quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR), where several different assays are needed to cover the wide range of circulating subtypes, which make detection and subtyping costly and time consuming.</s><s>The aim of the present study was to establish a high-throughput method for detection and subtyping of swIAVs in Danish pigs.</s><s>The BioMark dynamic array (DA) (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, USA) is capable of performing parallel qPCRs by combining e.g., 48 samples with 48 assays or 96 samples with 96 assays in a combinatorial manner inside the integrated fluidic circuit (IFC) resulting in either 2,304 or 9,216 individual reactions in a single run.</s><s>Besides being able to process a high number of reactions in a single run, the high-throughput qPCR BioMark system also uses less sample and reagent volume compared to standard qPCR platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Spurgeon et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The present study describes the design, optimization and validation of a swIAV 48.48DA; a setup consisting of 18 qPCR assays targeting the different swIAVs circulating in Europe.</s></p></div>

for each of the sample was clarified based on the Cq-value and on the accuracy of the corresponding amplification curve.</s><s>The swIAV 48.48DA and the multiplex RT-qPCR revealed the same HA type for 30 of the samples.</s><s>However, none of the qPCR methods could define the HA subtype of sample A/Swine/Denmark/9079-2/2016.</s><s>Furthermore, the HA subtype was not defined by the multiplex RT-qPCR for sample A/Swine/Denmark/6686-1/2015, but it was successfully determined using the swIAV 48.48DA.</s><s>The sample A/Swine/Denmark/7988-2/2016 was found positive in both the H1 av and H1 pdm assay by the swIAV 48.48DA, but only positive for H1 pdm in the multiplex RT-qPCR.</s><s>Therefore, this sample was further tested in the H1 av and H1 pdm assays on the Rotor-Gene Q, where it was found

sample A/Swine/Denmark/6598-1/2016 no signal was obtained in any of the NA assays on the swIAV 48.48DA, while it was positive in the N2 B2 assay in the multiplex RT-qPCR.</s><s>The sample was also tested in the N2 assay on the Rotor-Gene Q, where it was found to be weakly positive, with a Cq-value around 30.</s><s>For the samples A/Swine/Denmark/14170-2/2016 and A/Swine/Denmark/8938-1/2015, no NA signal was obtained in the multiplex RT-qPCR, while the swIAV 48.48DA detected a signal in the N2 B1 and N2 B2 assays and in the N1 B2 , respectively.</s><s>The swIAV 48.48DA found sample A/Swine/Denmark/7961-7/2016 to be of both N1 pdm and N2 sw origin, while this sample was only positive in the N1 pdm assay when using the multiplex RT-qPCR.</s><s>Additional test on the Rotor-Gene Q

sequencing and multiplex RT-qPCR results for the virus isolates and field samples, fully matching subtyping results (based on HA and NA genes) were obtained for 57 (29 virus isolates and 28 field samples) of 61 tested samples, and three of the 57 samples also showed an additional subtype in the analysis with the swIAV 48.48DA indicating a double infection.</s><s>Furthermore, when comparing the number of positive findings in the gold-standard tests (sequencing and multiplex RT-qPCR) with the swIAV 48.48DA test an agreement was observed for nine of the tested genes, while a difference between

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The BioMark high-throughput qPCR protocol for detection and expanded subtyping of influenza virus in pigs described in the present paper proved to be as specific and sensitive as standard state-of the art diagnostic methods based on "conventional" qPCR and sequencing.</s><s>This new approach makes it possible to combine multiple assays and samples and run them simultaneously.</s><s>It requires less labor and pipetting, leading to an economical benefit.</s><s>Another benefit is the use of nanolitre volume chambers in the DA, in contrast to conventional qPCR that uses microliter, thereby decreasing the use of expensive reagents.</s><s>The BioMark highthroughput qPCR system has for years been widely used in research studies i.e., for the study of innate immune response to pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Skovgaard et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>More recently, highthroughput qPCR protocols using the BioMark platform have also been designed as surveillance tools for tick-borne diseases and for food-and waterborne pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ishii et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Michelet et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Similar to the present study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ishii et al. (2013)</ref> found the system to offer highly sensitive and specific simultaneous quantification of multiple food-and waterborne pathogens in multiple samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ishii et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The platform is a flexible tool because it is easy to modify the assay panel by adding or removing primers or probes when new pathogens or new variants emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ishii et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Michelet et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge this is the first paper describing the use of the BioMark high-throughput qPCR platform for detection and subtyping of influenza viruses.</s><s>In general, there was a high degree of agreement for the results provided by multiplex RT-qPCR or sequencing and the results generated by the swIAV 48.48DA.</s><s>For a few of the tested samples, there was a discrepancy.</s><s>These differences could be explained by either co-infection with two viruses or by mismatches in the primer/probe binding regions.</s><s>Thus, imperfect match between the target sequence and the primer and/or probe sequences can result in a falsenegative signal even though the sample is positive for swIAV.</s><s>This emphasizes that the swIAV 48.48DA or multiplex RT-qPCR protocols cannot stand alone as a subtyping method, but has to be combined with a continuous surveillance by sequencing of circulating swIAV isolates.</s><s>Due to the high mutation-and reassortant rate of IAVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Simon et al., 2014)</ref> it is important to do continuous sequencing of selected isolates because changes will occur over time and it is necessary to adjust the PCR assays accordingly.</s><s>Sequencing is a very informative tool and it can contribute with indispensable information about evolutionary relationships based on similarities and differences between the sequences.</s><s>However, since the number of isolates that can be sequenced is limited by practical and economic reasons, the swIAV 48.48DA provides an excellent screening tool for selection of atypical isolates for downstream characterization by sequencing.</s></p><p><s>Pre-amplification of the RNA samples was needed because of the very small sample volumes (&lt;10 nL; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Korenková et al., 2015)</ref> in the reaction chambers.</s><s>This is in accordance with recommendations from the supplier and previous studies using the BioMark protocols for the detection of i.e., water-borne pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ishii et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The supplier of the BioMark platform recommends performing the cDNA synthesis and pre-amplification as two separate steps.</s><s>However, we managed to change this into a one-step procedure by combining the cDNA synthesis and pre-amplification, which further reduced the analysis costs and the number of handling steps.</s><s>A benefit of this alteration is also the reduced risk of contamination due the fewer handling steps.</s><s>The swIAV 48.48DA was tested against a panel of representative virus isolates in order to assess the sensitivity and specificity.</s><s>All the assays had an acceptable PCR efficiency between 80 and 110%.</s><s>Comparison of the assay performance on the two qPCR platforms; Rotor-Gene Q and BioMark, revealed only a minor difference in the dynamic range and efficiency for all the assays.</s><s>For a majority of the qPCRs, the dynamic range was one-two log 10 higher on the Rotor-Gene Q platform compared to the BioMark.</s><s>This might be a result of the considerable lower reaction volume in the 48.48DA (&lt;10 nL) compared to the tubes (25 µl) of the Rotor-Gene Q.</s><s>No cross reactions were observed for any of the assays on the swIAV 48.48DA, which testifies a high specificity.</s><s>To test the specificity in more detail, virus isolates and field samples, which have previously been subtyped by sequencing or multiplex RT-qPCR, were tested on the swIAV 48.48DA.</s><s>Again no cross reactions were observed and the three field samples, which failed to provide a signal in the HA or NA analysis in the multiplex RT-qPCR test, were subtyped by the swIAV 48.48DA.</s><s>This difference can be explained by the ability of the swIAV 48.48DA to subtype weakly positive samples (Cq-value of 30 or above in the M qPCR assay) which cannot be subtyped using the standard multiplex RT-qPCR protocol.</s><s>The improved sensitivity of the swIAV 48.48DA is related to the 24 pre-amplification cycles used prior to the PCR step.</s></p><p><s>The heat map generated by the Fluidigm Real-Time PCR Analysis software illustrates the raw Cq-values for each reaction, which makes is feasible to quickly evaluate which subtype the individual samples have (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Using the swIAV 48.48DA for the subtyping of swIAVs in surveillance programs, will make the analysis more simple compared to the traditional subtyping methods and it will give a more detailed subtyping of the samples since the internal genes are included in the analysis.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the use of the swIAV 48.48DA will allow future subtyping of many more influenza virus isolates for the same resources and by that contribute to a more sensitive surveillance program and provide the basis for an improved early detection of new virus re-assortments and variants.</s><s>The high sensitivity, specificity and robustness of the test system may also provide an opportunity for development of other similar chips i.e., for the surveillance and diagnose of other veterinary pathogens.</s><s>Work is in progress on the development of a 48.48DA containing all important swine pathogens for the use in future surveillance and diagnostic programs in Danish swine herds.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>dFull</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Cq-value achieved by swIAV 48.48DA.Samples where a discrepancy was observed between the two analyses are in bold letter.TABLE 2 | Parallel subtyping of virus isolates by full genome sequencing (left) and qPCR using the swIAV 48.48DA (right).</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
