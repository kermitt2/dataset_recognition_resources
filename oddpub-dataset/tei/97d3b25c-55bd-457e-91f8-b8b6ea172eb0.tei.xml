<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene expression profiling of CNS macrophages</head><p><s>Myeloid cells in the brain are a diverse group of cells localized at strategic places of the CNS.</s><s>The parenchyma is filled with microglia, whereas tissue borders host Iba-1 + macrophages that can be found in the meninges (mMΦ), perivascular spaces (pvMΦ) and choroid plexus (cpMΦ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>CNS macrophages have historically been classified based on their localization, morphology and expression of selected molecular makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Here, we used unbiased quantitative singlecell RNA-sequencing to perform a molecular census of microglia, pvMΦ and their proposed precursors, the monocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,c</ref>, Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Individual RNA molecules were counted using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , which greatly reduces PCR amplification bias.</s><s>Dimensionality reduction using t-distributed stochastic network embedding (t-SNE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , revealed that pvMΦ and microglia were transcriptionally closely related whereas monocytes had a distinct RNA profile.</s><s>All populations expressed the myeloid markers Cx 3 cr1, Csf1r and Aif (gene for Iba-1), but pvMΦ were distinguishable based on their expression of Mrc1and Cd36, microglia based on their expression of P2ry12 and monocytes based on their expression of Cdc20.</s><s>Notably, RNA levels of Ptprc (encoding CD45) were higher in pvMΦ compared to microglia which was confirmed on protein levels for all non-parenchymal macrophages in situ but not in microglia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, cytometry-based distinction of CD45 hi macrophages, CD45 lo microglia in the CNS is feasible (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>) as described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Comparison of the gene expression profiles revealed that the 46 most highly expressed genes in CD45 hi macrophages were largely immunologically-related transcripts encoding molecules such as antigen presentation (H2 molecules), pattern of recognition/activation (Cd36, Fcgr4) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f, g</ref>) which was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>), immunofluorescence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref>) and flow cytometry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these data show a close transcriptional relationship between non-parenchymal macrophages and microglia albeit with some cell type-specific differences.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prenatal yolk sac origin of CNS macrophages</head><p><s>The current concept that macrophages at CNS borders are derived from blood-borne myeloid cells during adulthood largely depends on previous work on BM chimeras using irradiation of the recipient <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> a finding that we could confirm by transplanting BM from actin-GFP mice into irradiated hosts leading to a vigorous engraftment of donor-derived GFP + Iba-1 + macrophages in the meninges, perivascular spaces and choroid plexus whereas microglial exchange was limited (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>However, in several organs, resident macrophages arise from embryonic precursors in the yolk sac (YS) that seed the tissue before birth <ref type="bibr">5-7, 21, 22</ref> (Ensan et al. 2015, in revision).</s><s>In accordance with these findings we already observed Cx 3 cr1GFP + macrophages in the meninges at E9.5 and shortly thereafter in the choroid plexus and the perivascular spaces (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) suggesting prenatal seeding of tissue macrophages in these compartments.</s><s>To test whether YS progenitors indeed contribute to the pool of CNS macrophages we adapted our recently developed Cx 3 cr1 CreER mouse system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Female Cx 3 cr1 CreER mice -which upon exposure to tamoxifen (TAM) express Cre recombinase under the control of the CX 3 CR1 promoter -were crossed to Rosa26-yfp reporter mice and pregnant animals were injected with a single intraperitoneal dose of TAM at E9 to pulse Cx 3 cr1-expressing progenitor cells in the YS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>This approach induced irreversible expression of the yfp promoter in YS-derived CX 3 CR1 expressing cells and their progeny.</s><s>55.4 ± 3.3 % Iba-1 + mMΦ, 51.3 ± 11.5 % Iba-1 + cpMΦ and 36.2 ± 7.5 % Iba-1 + microglia were yfp + at E16.0 indicating robust labeling efficiency of YS progenitors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,c</ref>).</s><s>Considering that microglia are entirely of YS origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> we can also assume that pvMΦ, mMΦ and cpMΦ have their major source in the YS.</s><s>Not only microglia but also pvMΦ and mMΦ retained the yfp label in 8-9 weeks old mice, demonstrating that YS labelling persists into adulthood (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d, e</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, cpMΦ dramatically lost their yfp label indicating that YS cells were replaced in the choroid plexus.</s><s>Expression of yfp in pvMΦ in the perivascular space was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s><s>Several transcription factors have been shown to be important for lineage commitment in myeloid cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>To determine which transcription factors are required for macrophage development we investigated the presence of CNS macrophages in mutants lacking Sfpi (encoding Pu1.), Irf8, myb and batf3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>i, Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Mice lacking Pu.1 were devoid of any pvMΦ, mMΦ and cpMΦ.</s><s>Notably, we found a reduction of mMΦ but not cpMΦ in Irf8 −/− mice, whereas absence of the master transcription factor for stem cell development in the BM, myb did not impair mMΦ and cpMΦ development similar to its redundant role for YS-derived macrophages such as microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Batf3-defiency did not impair any macrophage numbers.</s><s>In sum, mMΦ, pvMΦ, cpMΦ and microglia have their prenatal origin in the YS and largely depend on similar transcription factors for proper development.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maintenance of pvMΦ, mMΦ and cpMΦ in adulthood</head><p><s>Once established in the CNS, microglia persist throughout the entire life of the organism without any significant input from circulating blood cells due to their longevity and their capacity of self-renewal <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>We therefore sought to use this unique feature of microglia to compare the kinetics of persistence with mMΦ, pvMΦ, cpMΦ and blood cells such as Ly-6C lo monocytes.</s><s>For this purpose we challenged Cx 3 cr1 CreER :R26-yfp animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> with TAM and determined mMΦ, pvMΦ, cpMΦ labeling at several time points after application (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>FACS analysis demonstrated long-term labeling of yfp + CD45 hi CD11b + macrophages even 30 weeks after TAM treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>Histological examination confirmed the FACS data and revealed a high percentage of Iba-1-labeled mMΦ, pvMΦ, cpMΦ that co-expressed yfp (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Quantitative examination on histological slices revealed constant high expression of the reporter gene in mMΦ and pvMΦ comparable to microglia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>These data indicate that mMΦ and pvMΦ are stable populations which do not undergo significant exchange with blood cells within 43 weeks.</s><s>In contrast, yfplabeling continuously dropped in Iba-1 + cpMΦ suggesting a slow continuous exchange with blood cells.</s><s>Due to their ephemerality Cx 3 cr1-targeted Ly-6C lo monocytes in the blood lost their yfp mark very rapidly and were quickly replaced by the non-targeted progeny.</s><s>Thorough confocal analysis confirmed the long-term persistence of pvMΦ in perivascular spaces of cerebral vessels (laminin + ) at 8 weeks after TAM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>At this time point, microglia were still labelled but not blood monocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>).</s><s>Notably, yfp-expressing mMΦ and cpMΦ were detected by Immuno-EM 30 weeks after recombination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>).</s><s>Labelled cpMΦ were found in close proximity to the microvilli of the choroid plexus epithelium indicating that these cells represent Kolmer's epiplexus cells.</s><s>To further analyse whether the integration of these long lived myeloid cells into distinct CNS microenvironments shapes their dynamic behaviour we imaged fluorescently labelled mMΦ, pvMΦ and microglia in the intact spinal cord of living Cx 3 cr1 CreER :R26-tomato mice at 8 weeks after TAM by confocal and 2-photon microscopy.</s><s>Time-lapse imaging revealed that these myeloid cells populations that derived from a common origin can be differentiated in vivo not only based on their anatomical location but also based on their characteristic morphology and distinct dynamic behavior (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3h</ref>-j and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2).</s><s>While mMΦ present with amoeboid morphology and movement characteristics, microglial cells show a ramified morphology with highly dynamic processes and a rather stable cell body.</s><s>These cell types can be further differentiated from pvMΦ, which are elongated and highly oriented cells that follow the blood vessel outline and extend and retract their protrusions along the blood vessel wall.</s></p><p><s>To evaluate a possible contribution of blood cells to the pool of macrophages at CNS boundaries during non-diseased conditions, we needed to develop a method for tracking circulating cells without affecting the CNS environment or resident cells.</s><s>We therefore induced peripheral blood chimerism by surgically joining two syngeneic mice, one of which ubiquitously expressed GFP.</s><s>These parabiotic mice established a rich anastomotic circulation, which quickly led to efficient blood chimerism as described before <ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This study described the molecular signatures of tissue macrophages at CNS boundaries, their developmental pathways and key mechanisms to ensure their homeostasis and response to inflammation (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>By using large-scale single cell RNA-sequencing we were able to dissect the individual transcriptional profiles of non-parenchymal macrophages and parenchymal myeloid cells (microglia) in the CNS and found a close relationship between these cells that was not shared by circulating monocytes.</s><s>Our unbiased high-throughput methodology allows to define extensive functional specialization between cell classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>In fact, we found that the marker Mrc1 was specific for macrophages at CNS interfaces whereas P2ry12 was expressed only by microglia which confirms previous data that used expression profiling of several thousands of cells in the CNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>However, our finding that mMΦ, pvMΦ, cpMΦ have only limited relation to circulating myeloid cells represents a major change in the field.</s><s>Since the 1980s it has been assumed that macrophages at CNS interfaces are solely blood-derived based on BM chimera data using whole-body irradiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>The involvement of the CNS during the irradiation procedure clearly leads to substantial local priming with concomitant induction of myeloattracting and myelopromoting factors and damage of the BBB <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Consequently, all previous studies on mMΦ, pvMΦ and cpMΦ using these techniques to establish BM chimeras have to be interpreted with caution.</s><s>Tissue macrophages arise from two distinct developmental programs; early YS-derived erythromyeloid progenitors (EMPs) that give rise to macrophages without monocyte intermediates and fetal monocytes that derive from myb + EMPs generated in the YS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>These pathways contribute variously to macrophage development in several tissues including the brain, skin, heart, liver and lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with these findings we found Cx 3 cr1 + mMΦ, pvMΦ and cpMΦ already during early embryogenesis and fate mapping approaches confirmed the persistence of YS-derived macrophages in embryonic as well adult mice.</s><s>Development and homeostasis of CNS macrophages is not uniform.</s><s>Similar to microglia, the maintenance of mMΦ and pvMΦ does not dependent on circulating monocytes and non-parenchymal CNS macrophages persist over a very long period of time.</s><s>This is in contrast to cpMΦ that show features of relative ephemerality (compared to other CNS macrophages) and some replenishment by blood cells (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Neurological diseases in which the choroid plexus (CP) is crucially involved as one of the interfaces between periphery and CNS are abundant <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Several studies suggested a fundamental involvement of the CP in the development and progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, EAE.</s><s>Firstly, CP inflammation with immune cell activation and infiltration has been described preceding parenchymal inflammation and clinical disease onset in humans and mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Secondly, autoaggressive sentinel T cells are thought to enter the CSF through the CP during incipient stages of MS and EAE, travelling to the subarachnoidal space where they are reactivated by local APC presenting cognate antigen <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>All findings argue for the dual role of the CP as an immune cell modulatory site as well as an entry gate for peripheral immune cells to the CNS during neuroinflammation.</s><s>To fulfil these highly specialized tasks during diseases it is very advantageous for the CP to host cpMΦ that are also derived from short-lived circulating cells.</s></p><p><s>During inflammation pvMΦ perform local self-renewal by proliferation.</s><s>Notably, our genetic labelling strategy in Cx 3 cr1 CreER :R26-tomato mice does not allow to distinguish between pvMΦ and microglia by marker expression and we therefore decided to use their relative localization to the vascular basal membrane as a discriminating feature.</s><s>However, we cannot exclude that during inflammation pvMΦ may also migrate to the CNS parenchyma.</s><s>Further studies are needed to address this issue.</s></p><p><s>Flt3 is expressed only by definitive hematopoietic progenitors in the embryo and during adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>It can therefore be used to distinguish YS-derived versus fetal liver and bone marrow-derived macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>This approach helped us to define cpMΦ as a distinct population of CNS macrophages that is different from mMΦ, pvMΦ and microglia that have no input from Flt3-dependent definitive hematopoiesis.</s><s>CpMΦ development from circulating monocytes was confirmed by our results from the parabiosis experiments and in Ccr2deficient animals.</s><s>In contrast, genetic labelling using the TAM-inducible Cx 3 cr1 CreER :R26yfp system revealed that mMΦ and pvMΦ remained remarkably stable when compared between embryonic and adult animals arguing against a significant contribution of fetal liver to these macrophages population which is in contrast to other tissue macrophage populations such as in the liver and gut <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Strategically positioned at the CNS barriers, mMΦ, pvMΦ, cpMΦ may modulate immune cell entry and phenotype.</s><s>The myeloid cells in the CNS-adjoining tissues have thus been implicated in various immunopathological processes, including antigen presentation to circulating lymphocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> (Brendecke 2015, in press).</s><s>As presumed guardians of tissue homeostasis, the CNS-surrounding myeloid cell network appears to be crucially involved in the development, progression and resolution of neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative and neurooncological diseases.</s><s>Our results help to unravel the regulatory program that controls mMΦ, pvMΦ and cpMΦ function in vivo, and to identify new means to manipulate these cells for the treatment of neural diseases.</s></p></div>
