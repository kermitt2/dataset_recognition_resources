<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Earth's rotation within repetitive cycles of 24 hours (h) led to the evolution of an endogenous timing system across all phyla: the circadian clock, which allows organisms to anticipate and adapt to environmental changes such as light and darkness.</s><s>At the molecular level, the generation of circadian rhythms in each cell is based on a complex interplay of positive and negative transcriptional/translational feedback loops.</s><s>In mammals, two main feedback loops have been dissected in greater detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In the period (PER)/cryptochrome (CRY) loop, a heterodimer of the proteins circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein (BMAL) drives the expression of genes from the Per and Cry families.</s><s>The resulting proteins translocate back to the nucleus, form complexes, and bind to the CLOCK/BMAL heterodimer, thereby inhibiting their own synthesis.</s><s>CLOCK/BMAL also induces the transcription of the nuclear receptor gene families reverse strand of ERBA (Rev-Erb) and RAR-related orphan receptors (Ror) within the ROR/Bmal/ REV-ERB loop.</s><s>REV-ERB and ROR compete for the binding to ROR response elements (ROREs) in the promoter region of Bmal1, regulating its transcription in antagonistic ways.</s><s>By controlling rhythmic RNA and protein abundance, the cellular endogenous clock regulates circadian rhythms of a variety of biological processes such as rest/activity cycles, metabolism, hormone level, immune functions, and the metabolism of drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Disturbances of the circadian system are associated with many pathological phenotypes including cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, though the effect of the circadian clock in tumourigenesis is still an issue of ongoing debate.</s><s>Several epidemiological studies reported increased occurrence of cancer in long-term shift workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, indicating that disrupted circadian rhythms may constitute a cancer risk factor.</s><s>However, a causative connection is still disputed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Particularly at the molecular level, there is a need for further investigation regarding the putative role of the circadian clock in tumourigenesis.</s><s>An oncogenic-driven mouse model identified CLOCK and BMAL1 as playing a key role in regulating proliferation and differentiation pointing to a complex role of the circadian clock in cancer progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Perturbations of the circadian clock (via experimental chronic jet lag) in mice led to accelerated tumour growth, which could be counterbalanced by regular timing of food access <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>While the disruption of core-clock genes such as Per1 and Per2 has also been associated with cancer promoting mechanisms, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, their role in tumourigenesis is still debatable because a recent study showed that Per1 or Per2 deficiency does not lead to more tumour-prone phenotypes in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In turn, cancer strongly influences circadian rhythms of biological processes, such as fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, and metabolic oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>Current attempts of chronobiological cancer treatment

of drugs and increasing survival times of cancer patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>One of the processes via which the circadian clock could potentially influence tumourigenesis, namely by triggering malignant proliferation, might be the cell-division cycle in whose regulation the clock is involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Several links between the circadian clock and the cell cycle have been reported for mammalian cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The clock was found to unidirectionally gate the cell cycle in mouse liver cells via a circadian expression of the cell cycle regulator Wee1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, whereas in mouse fibroblasts, the circadian clock was reported to be phase-shifted by mitosis, possibly via concentration changes of the PER-CRY complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>More recently, the non-POU domain containing octamer binding (NONO)-PER protein complex has been reported to couple the clock and the cell cycle by activating the rhythmic transcription of the cell cycle checkpoint gene Ink4a <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which encodes, as part of the Cdkn2a locus, the cyclindependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p16 Ink4a <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>p16 Ink4a can be activated by the oncogene RAS, leading to cell cycle arrest in the Gap 1 (G1) phase, a tumour-suppressive mechanism counteracting abnormal cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>A correlation between the expression level of Per2 and the expression of Ink4a mRNA has also been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, indicating that PER is a positive regulator of Ink4a expression and might be responsible for its circadian expression.</s><s>In addition, Cdkn2a encodes for another tumour suppressor and cell cycle regulator protein, alternate open reading frame (ARF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, which is mainly activated by mitogenic stimulation through the cell cycle checkpoint protein avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, but can also be induced via oncogenic RAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>ARF interacts in a circadian time (CT)-dependent manner with a mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), a negative regulator of the tumour suppressor gene p53 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>p53, in turn, directly modulates the expression of Per2 by binding to a response element in its promoter region, which is overlapping with the E-box cis-element essential for the CLOCK/BMAL binding and the transcriptional activation of Per2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the transcription factor E2F was described as a putative bridging element between the circadian clock and the cell cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recently, we demonstrated that RAS induces a dysregulation of the mammalian circadian clock in HaCaT keratinocyte cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>We showed that the induction of RAS leads to a lengthening of the circadian period while inhibition of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway causes a period shortening.</s><s>These findings were supported by using a mathematical model to analyse the rhythmic properties of the core-clock network in silico <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>Other mathematical models have been developed that investigate the cell cycle-related functions of the tumour suppressor genes p53 and Arf, as well as Mdm2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr"

by influencing the expression of genes, which are direct targets of CLOCK/BMAL1 as a result of other potential, noncircadian functions of Bmal1.</s><s>Therefore, the output results of Bmal1 knock-down phenotypes must be seen in light of this wider perspective.</s></p><p><s>We further observed Ink4a/Arf-dependent changes in the expression levels of core-clock and cell cycle-related genes: RAS overexpression in combination with shBmal1 leads to an increase of Cry2 and Per2 when Ink4a/Arf is present, whereas it results in its downregulation in the knock-out MEFs.</s><s>The concurrent perturbations (overexpression of RAS and simultaneous knockdown of Bmal1) lead to an additive effect on the expression levels of genes of the Per family.</s><s>This indicates that Ink4a/Arf may be involved in regulating the gene expression of core-clock genes upon RAS overexpression, including but not limited to members of the Per family.</s><s>This correlates with changes in the expression levels of the cell cycle-related gene Rb1 that is also up-regulated in the Ink4a/Arf +/+ shBmal1+RAS MEFs and downregulated in the corresponding knock-out condition.</s><s>We speculate that upon RAS-induced dysregulation of the core-clock, the expression level changes of the clock gene Per2 might lead to the differential regulation of Rb1.</s><s>In addition, the predicted loss of oscillations of p53 upon Ink4a/Arf knockout could account for the downregulation of Rb1 in the knock-out MEFs and be the cause for the observed experimental variations in Rb1 gene expression upon perturbations by RAS and shBmal1.</s><s>Ultimately, this could result in abnormal cell fate decision phenotypes, including cell-cycle arrest, which would also be in agreement with published data <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> and points to a correlation between the core-clock gene Bmal1 and cellular senescence.</s></p><p><s>Based on a curated list of senescence-related genes derived from the literature and on our results from β-Gal-staining and growth measurements, we used a machine learning approach to classify the cell cycle fate decision of our experimental model system upon perturbations by RAS overexpression and dysregulation of the circadian system.</s></p><p><s>While in the Ink4a/Arf +/+ MEFs overexpression of RAS leads to oncogene-induced senescence, the Ink4a/Arf -/-MEFs are classified as proliferating despite the up-regulation of the oncogene RAS.</s><s>We validated the conditions that were predicted to proliferate by cell-cycle analysis and compared them to the WT and the senescent conditions.</s><s>The downregulation of Bmal1 shows an enhancing effect of the Ink4/Arf knockout-induced proliferation phenotype, resulting in the highest percentage of cells in the S phase and lowest in G1 phase.</s></p><p><s>Altogether, our experimental and modelling analyses strongly point to a role for Ink4a/ Arf in mediating the clock connection to important cell cycle checkpoints and controlling its response upon RAS oncogenic signalling.</s><s>This led us to propose a model for the interplay between the cell cycle and the circadian clock that highlights Ink4a/Arf as an important regulator for the period-changing effect of RAS on the circadian clock as depicted in Fig 6 <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>The Ink4a/Arf locus seems to act as a switch for the effect of RAS.</s><s>If the Ink4a/Arf genes are functional while the system is perturbed by the oncogenic signalling, the period increases and the cells receive a senescence signal (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6A</ref>).</s><s>If on the contrary, Ink4a/Arf genes are impaired, then the period of the system decreases upon RAS perturbation, and the cells receive a proliferation signal (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6B</ref>).</s><s>Whereas some studies have questioned the role of the clock as a tumour suppressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, our data is in line with several publications including a recent work in which enhancing circadian clock function seems to control cancer progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, and points to clock dysregulation as a tumourigenesis-promoting factor.</s><s>It is conceivable that the tumourigenesis promoting/inhibiting properties of the circadian clock are context dependent, and to unravel the full complexity of such interactions will require a tumour-specific circadian analysis.</s></p><p><s>Our combined theoretical and experimental approach using a primary cell model system interrelates high-throughput data with mathematical modelling, which together provide compelling evidence for the control of both cellular oscillators, the cell division cycle, and the circadian clock via the oncogene RAS.</s><s>Furthermore, our data points to the existence of a fine-tuning system of circadian regulation via Ink4a/Arf, as a response to RAS overexpression with severe consequences on cell fate decisions.</s></p><p><s>To see whether our results hold true for other systems as well, we analysed the expression of Bmal1 and Ink4a/Arf in several publicly available human cells, e.g., fibroblasts and CRC cell lines with RAS overexpression or Bmal1 downregulation.</s><s>We found that RAS overexpression leads to increased levels of Ink4a/Arf and Bmal1 in the senescent human fibroblast cell line IMR-90 as compared to their proliferative counterparts.</s><s>In the CRC cell line SW480 (derived from the primary tumour), Bmal1 downregulation by shRNA lead to an increase of cells in Sphase and a decrease of cells in G1-phase resembling the cell-cycle phenotype observed in the metastasis-derived cell line SW620, in which Bmal1 was already downregulated independent of the shRNA.</s></p><p><s>Based on our results, it seems to us that the clock is likely to act as a tumour suppressor, and that it is of advantage for cancer cells to circumvent circadian control.</s><s>One cannot stop wondering whether disrupted circadian timing should be included as a next potential hallmark of cancer.</s></p></div>
