<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: This study examined the development of chronic pain, a cardinal symptom of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in mice with antigen-and collagen-induced arthritis (ACIA).</s><s>Since the role of CD8 + T cells in arthritis is controversial, we investigated the consequences of CD8-depletion on arthritis development and opioid modulation of pain in this novel model of chronic autoimmune arthritis.</s></p><p><s>Methods: Disease severity in control and CD8-depleted animals was determined by histological assessment of knee-joint sections and measurement of autoantibody formation.</s><s>Pain was evaluated by measuring mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in von Frey and Hargreaves tests, respectively.</s><s>The production and release of endogenous opioids and inflammatory cytokines was assessed in immunoassays.</s><s>Results: In ACIA, mice display persistent mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia for more than 2 months after induction of arthritis.</s><s>The blockade of peripheral opioid receptors with naloxone-methiodide (NLXM) transiently increased thermal hyperalgesia, indicating that endogenous opioid peptides were released in the arthritic joint to inhibit pain.</s><s>CD8 + T cell depletion did not affect autoantibody formation or severity of joint inflammation, but serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-17 were increased.</s><s>The release of opioid peptides from explanted arthritic knee cells and the NLXM effect were significantly reduced in the absence of CD8 + T cells.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p><s>We have successfully modeled the development of chronic pain, a hallmark of RA, in ACIA.</s><s>Furthermore, we detected a yet unknown protective role of CD8 + T cells in chronic ACIA since pro-inflammatory cytokines rose and opioid peptide release decreased in the absence of these cells.</s></p></div>
