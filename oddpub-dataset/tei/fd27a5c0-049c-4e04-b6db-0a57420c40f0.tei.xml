<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>We present genetic, genomic and functional evidence implicating SMCHD1 as the predominant driver of arhinia in humans.</s><s>Overall, 84% of subjects harbored a missense mutation in a constrained region encompassing the ATPase domain of SMCHD1.</s><s>Through a large collaborative effort, we were able to combine data from 24% of subjects reported in the literature with data from 21 new subjects, facilitating a uniform evaluation of the clinical phenotype associated with this condition and revealing that most subjects with arhinia who could be assessed presented with the BAM triad.</s><s>These analyses represent the first evidence of a genetic cause for this rare craniofacial malformation and its associated reproductive phenotype, suggesting a novel and complex role for SMCHD1 in cranial NCC migration and/or craniofacial placode development.</s></p><p><s>These observations raise broader questions about the molecular mechanisms by which mutations in the same gene can produce distinct phenotypes.</s><s>For SMCHD1, these include arhinia, BAM and FSHD2.</s><s>Truncation variants are common in FSHD2, but missense variants have also been reported, whereas all arhinia-associated variants were missense alleles.</s><s>This suggests that the mutant SMCHD1 protein must be synthesized in arhinia and that these mutations probably interfere with one or more critical protein functions.</s><s>We found largely identical hypomethylation patterns at the 4q35 D4Z4 locus in arhinia and FSHD2 probands, indicating that neither a loss nor a gain of this particular function of SMCHD1 alone (gene silencing by methylation) explains the difference in phenotype.</s><s>We also investigated the possibility that arhinia-associated SMCHD1 mutations inflict genome-wide de-repression of repeat silencing but found no significant differences (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).</s><s>Additional factors must therefore be involved in producing these distinct phenotypes, such as interactions with variants at other loci or disruption of SMCHD1 protein interactions that are critical to its epigenetic functions.</s><s>Indeed, we found that the arhinia-specific variants tend to cluster on the surface of the protein, potentially disrupting ATP or DNA binding and/or interfering with assembly of the SMCHD1 homodimer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Correspondingly, results in peripheral tissue of arhinia probands and controls precluded models of simple haploinsufficiency or overexpression resulting from these mutations, further suggesting that the bioactivity of the protein, rather than the total amount of protein, is the critical defect in humans.</s></p><p><s>Distinct findings in two model systems reinforce the complexity suggested by our data in humans.</s><s>In the zebrafish model, loss of function was sufficient to drive specific phenotypes that were rescued with full-length hWT SMCHD1 mRNA but not with mRNA containing arhinia or FSHD2 variants, and overexpression conferred no discernible phenotype.</s><s>In mouse, complete loss of function of Smchd1 (homozygous exon 23 nonsense mutation) produces hypomethylation, which causes female-specific embryonic lethality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Heterozygosity for this nonsense mutation likewise produces no phenotype in mice, nor did CRISPR/Cas9-mediated induction of homozygous or compound heterozygous deletions in the current study.</s><s>Unfortunately, we were unable to replicate the heterozygous missense genotypes characteristic of human arhinia in the mouse (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>The fact that loss of Smchd1 produced distinctive phenotypes in zebrafish but not in mouse supports the importance of genetic background and functional interactions of the mutant protein in the pathogenesis of human arhinia.</s></p><p><s>The complex oligogenic architecture of FSHD2 suggests that only a small fraction of individuals with arhinia, an exceedingly rare condition on its own, will be at risk for FSHD2.</s><s>Our analyses identified seven subjects potentially at risk for FSHD2, and at least one appears to be symptomatic.</s><s>Notably, one-quarter of individuals who meet genetic criteria for FSHD2 are clinically asymptomatic, indicating that some of the factors that mediate FSHD2 are unknown 42 .</s><s>The absence of arhinia in patients with FSHD2 who harbor SMCHD1 mutations within the constrained ATPase domain argues that loss of SMCHD1 activity alone is insufficient to produce a craniofacial phenotype, comparably to mutations in DNMT3B in FSHD2 patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, the expressivity of this phenotype is clearly complex, as we observed family members harboring SMCHD1 mutations with only mild dysmorphism or anosmia and at least one individual without dysmorphic features.</s><s>Given the epigenetic function of SMCHD1, it is plausible that one or more interacting loci influence susceptibility to arhinia.</s><s>Variants at these secondary loci need not be ultra-rare: TAR syndrome (MIM274000) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> and SMAD6-associated craniosynostosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> are two examples of severe developmental disorders caused by the combination of a rare, deleterious, frequently de novo mutation with a common variant.</s><s>Disentangling these genetic interactions and biochemical consequences of SMCHD1 missense mutations will be a critical area of further study.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, through an international network of collaborators we discovered that rare missense variants in an evolutionarily constrained region of SMCHD1 are the predominant cause of isolated arhinia and BAM.</s><s>Using multigenerational families, we found that phenotypes associated with these mutations can be subtle or even absent in family members.</s><s>The distributions of these variants and their molecular mechanisms are not fully distinct from those in FSHD2, and the molecular pathways leading from SMCHD1 dysfunction to either arhinia or FSHD2 remain unknown.</s><s>Our findings thus emphasize yet another example in a growing list of genes in which mutations can give rise to pleiotropic phenotypes across the spectrum of human anomalies.</s><s>For SMCHD1, these phenotypes-a rare muscle disease and a severe craniofacial and reproductive disorder-are notably diverse.</s><s>Identifying the genetic modifiers influencing SMCHD1-related disease will significantly enhance understanding of the pathogenesis of the arhinia-BAM-FSHD spectra and placode biology and, more broadly, the architecture of oligogenic disorders.</s></p></div>
