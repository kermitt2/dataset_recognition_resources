<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Food insecurity research has been mainly examined among young people.</s><s>The root causes of food insecurity are closely linked to poverty, and social policies and income supplements, including public and private pensions, have been shown to sharply curb food insecurity into later life.</s><s>However, social, economic, and political trends that are closely connected to social and health inequalities threaten to undermine the conditions that have limited food insecurity among older people until now.</s><s>Exploring the prevalence and predictors of food insecurity among older people across Canada has important implications for domestic policies concerning health, healthcare, and social welfare.</s><s>Methods: Data come from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2012 Annual Component (n = 14,890).</s><s>Descriptive statistics and a generalized linear model approach were used to determine prevalence and estimate the associations between food insecurity-as measured by the Household Food Security Survey Module-and social, demographic, geographic, and economic factors.</s><s>Results: Approximately 2.4% of older Canadians are estimated to be moderately or severely food insecure.</s><s>Income was by far the strongest predictor of food insecurity (total household income &lt;$20,000 compared to &gt;$60,000, OR: 46.146, 95% CI: 12.523-170.041,</s><s>p &lt; 0.001).</s><s>Younger older people, and those with a non-white racial background also had significantly greater odds of food insecurity (ages 75+ compared to 65-74, OR: 0.322, 95% CI: 0.212-0.419,</s><s>p &lt; 0.001; and OR: 2.429, 95% CI: 1.438-4.102,</s><s>p &lt; 0.001, respectively).</s><s>Sex, home ownership, marital status, and living arrangement were all found to confound the relationship between household income and food insecurity.</s><s>Prevalence of food insecurity varied between provinces and territories, and odds of food insecurity were approximately five times greater for older people living in northern Canada as compared to central Canada (OR: 5.189, 95% CI: 2.329-11.562,</s><s>p &lt; 0.001).</s><s>Conclusion: Disaggregating overall prevalence of food insecurity among older people demonstrates how disparities exist among sub-groups of older people.</s><s>The seemingly negligible existence of food insecurity among older people has obscured the importance, practicality, and timeliness of including this age group in research on food insecurity.</s><s>The current research underscores the critical importance of an income floor in preventing food insecurity among older people, and contributes a Canadian profile of the prevalence and predictors of food insecurity among older people to the broader international literature.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>The Guaranteed Income Supplement and Canada Pension Plan that was legislated in 1967 addressed a long-running trend of pervasive poverty among older citizens (aged <ref type="bibr">65 and older)</ref> in Canada and continues to be considered a major achievement for policymakers <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>However, there exist challenges facing current and future Canadian older people.</s><s>In Canada, the proportion of older adults to the total population is rapidly increasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> amidst constant threats to the social safety net <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, food prices and cost of living are ever increasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, and low-wage, part-time, and precarious employment are rampant across sectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>Worsening conditions of poverty and inadequate savings trends among the poor and working poor are likely to lead to a new wave of older people living in poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Research suggests that when people are unable to meet their most basic living needs, such as housing and heating, they make difficult tradeoff decisions with more flexible expenses, primarily food <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>While hunger is defined as the physical pain or discomfort an individual experiences in response to inadequate intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, food insecurity encompasses hunger as a severe outcome, but also captures the ongoing stress associated with not knowing if you will have enough to eat, and the quantitative, qualitative, psychological and social coping and consequences of not being able to put enough food on the table <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Household food insecurity is defined as "the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways" <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Food insecurity is argued to be the most sensitive indicator of poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and is a persistent problem in Canada, despite strong national economic prosperity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In Canada, benefits for older people have been shown to act as an income floor to buffer against food insecurity among older people, as older Canadians (aged 65 and older) are least likely to be food insecure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, some research has demonstrated a reversal in trends among some of the most vulnerable sub-groups of near-old (aged 55-64 years), which is directly attributable to the weakening of older adult-focused social policies and income supplements <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Food insecurity has been monitored in Canada at the population level since 2004, when the Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) was first included in the Canadian Community Health Survey as optional content for each province <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Since then, food insecurity research has mostly focused on younger populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>.</s><s>This is in part due to older people experiencing the lowest rates of food insecurity as compared to younger people.</s><s>Indeed, rates of food insecurity among older people are a fraction of those in younger people, with household food insecurity affecting one in six children (under the age of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>, and approximately 12.0% of all households in Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, research on food insecurity in other countries with strong social safety nets for older people also report lower rates of food insecurity among older people.</s><s>For example, in Australia, rates of food insecurity among older people have been reported as 2.0%, 2.6%, 4.5%, and 13.0% <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Rates of food insecurity among older people in the United States are estimated to fall between 6% and 18% [22, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>However, inconsistent measurement across surveys makes it difficult to draw conclusions from comparisons between and sometimes within countries.</s><s>Additionally, in Canada, there are few studies that specifically examine the prevalence of food insecurity among older people, or the social, demographic, or economic factors that predict food insecurity among older people <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>This information is important for informing the development and evaluation of health care and social welfare policies for older people <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, it is important to contribute a Canadian profile of food insecurity among older people to the international literature.</s></p><p><s>Our primary research objectives are to determine the prevalence of household food insecurity among older people in Canada overall, and by province.</s><s>Furthermore, we intend to determine what sub-groups of older people are most vulnerable to household food insecurity, as well as the predictors of household food insecurity among older people.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Materials and Methods</head><p><s>The current study used a retrospective cross-sectional design using secondary data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), 2012 Annual Component <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>The CCHS is a cross-sectional survey that collects information related to health status, health care utilization, and health determinants for the Canadian population.</s><s>CCHS data is collected from persons aged 12 and over living in private dwellings in 115 health regions of all provinces and territories <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</s><s>The survey does not include indigenous people living on reserves (a reserve is a tract of Crown land (not privately owned) set aside for the use and benefit of an Indian band (community)), institutional residents, full-time members of the Canadian Forces, and residents of certain remote regions.</s><s>Younger and older people were oversampled, and the CCHS is estimated to cover approximately 98% of the Canadian population (aged 12 and over) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</s><s>We followed the recommendations of Statistics Canada and applied population weights to appropriate analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Because this study is a secondary analysis of data collected by Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada is Canada's National Statistical Agency, and and how the Agency mitigates survey respondent risk can be found at https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/rdc/mitigation), and makes use of a publicly available dataset that does not contain identifiable information, Queen's University General Research Ethics Board does not require an ethics review of the data collection methods or the analytical approach taken in this research <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In 2012, the Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) was administered as common content to all regions.</s><s>The HFSSM is a household measure, and is designed to capture self-reports of uncertain, insufficient, or inadequate food access, availability, and utilization due to limited financial resources, and the compromised eating patterns and food consumption that may result <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>.</s><s>The HFSSM contains 18 questionnaire items-10 comprising the adult scale, and 8 comprising the child scale-and asks about the food security situation in a household over the past 12 months, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Often, sometimes, and "yes" are considered positive (affirmative) responses.</s><s>Based on the responses, the following three categories can be used to describe household food security situations, as defined by Health Canada: food secure, food insecure (moderate), and food insecure (severe), as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</s><s>We used the adult scale of the HFSSM.</s><s>The dependent variable, (adult) household food security, was defined as a dichotomous variable, food secure and food insecure.</s><s>Food insecure (moderate), and food insecure (severe) were collapsed into one category, as per recent discussions in food security research in Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>.</s><s>The selection of covariates and their categorization was informed by other studies, as per the important characteristics of food insecure older people.</s><s>Accordingly, the following potential risk factors were explored in the analysis: age, sex, racial background, self-perceived health, education, income, marital status, living arrangement, home ownership, and province of residence.</s><s>Each potential predictor was categorized as follows: age (65-74, and 75 and over), sex (male, female), racial background (white, visible minority), self-perceived health (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor), education level-household (graduated post-secondary, other post-secondary, graduated secondary, less than secondary).</s><s>Income was measured by total household income from all sources (&gt;$60,000, $40,000-$59,999, $20,000-$39,999, &lt;$20,000).</s><s>The provinces included were Newfoundland (NFLD), Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia (NS), New Brunswick (NB), Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba (MN), Saskatchewan (SK), British Columbia (BC), and Alberta (AB).</s><s>Territories were combined (Yukon, Northwest Territories (NWT), and Nunavut).</s><s>Alberta was arbitrarily selected as the referent group.</s></p><p><s>All statistical analyses and calculations were performed using SPSS version 24.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s>The CCHS 2012 Public Use Microfile (PUMF) was obtained and included a total of 61,707 cases (unweighted) and 1381 variables.</s><s>Data were restricted to people aged 65 years and older (n = 16,785).</s><s>We explored food insecurity by the previously mentioned social, demographic, economic, health, and geographic variables.</s><s>Respondents with missing data for the selected study variables were excluded (n = 1895).</s><s>A complete case analysis was performed, and the final unweighted sample size was 14,890.</s></p><p><s>Next, response frequency by questionnaire item was broken down for food insecure older people.</s><s>Group differences between food security status and selected variables were analyzed using Chi-Square tests, in order to compare the prevalence of food insecurity among older people between levels of the independent characteristics.</s><s>Prevalence ratios were calculated for each characteristic by dividing the category with the greater prevalence by the category with the lesser prevalence.</s><s>We used a generalized linear model for binomial data with a logit link function.</s><s>A robust variance was used in order to account for weighting of cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</s><s>The statistical significance threshold was set for p &lt; 0.05.</s><s>Reference categories were selected based on previous literature and/or hypothesized relationships.</s><s>Odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values were reported for each category of characteristic.</s><s>Our base model controlled for age, sex, and race as the most likely potential confounders of the relationship between household income and food insecurity status.</s><s>We then explored the impact that adding additional covariates had on the magnitude and precision of the household income parameters and looked at model fit using AIC (Akaike information criterion) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Based on AIC values for each model, we were able to narrow down the number of variables to be considered, and selected the model with the smallest AIC.</s><s>The final model thus represents the best overall statistical properties and parameter balance.</s><s>We show a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to depict our assumptions in the relationships between potential confounders/predictors of the relationship between household income and food insecurity, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure"

Indeed, cases of food insecurity were concentrated among the lowest levels of income, so people who reported an annual household income of $40,000 or less accounted for 93% of cases of food insecurity in this sample, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>.</s></p><p><s>While there were other important predictors that were uncovered in the current analyses, the relationship between income and odds of food insecurity was so profound that many of these predictors were found to confound the household income-food insecurity relationship.</s><s>For example, while food insecurity was more prevalent among women than men, and significantly associated with food insecurity in bivariate analysis, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>, when added to the model was found to be insignificant when combined in the multivariable model with age, race, and household income, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>.</s><s>This suggests that women may be more vulnerable to food insecurity through economically-driven mechanisms.</s><s>Similarly, home ownership, marital status, and living arrangement have been found to be significantly
