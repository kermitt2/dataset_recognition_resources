<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the electrical properties of ileal Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secreting L-cells using murine organoid cultures and the electrophysiological and intracellular signaling pathways recruited following activation of the G aq -coupled free fatty acid receptors FFA1 and G as -coupled bile acid receptors GPBAR1.</s><s>Methods: Experiments were performed using ileal organoids generated from mice transgenically expressing fluorescent reporters (Epac2camps and GCaMP3) under control of the proglucagon promoter.</s><s>Electrophysiology and single cell imaging were performed on identified L-cells in organoids, and GLP-1 secretion from cultured organoids was measured by immunoassay.</s><s>Results: The FFA1 ligand TAK-875 triggered L-cell electrical activity, increased intracellular calcium, and activated a depolarizing current that was blocked by the TRPC3 inhibitor Pyr3.</s><s>TAK-875 triggered GLP-1 secretion was Pyr3 sensitive, suggesting that the TRPC3 channel links FFA1 activation to calcium elevation and GLP-1 release in L-cells.</s><s>GPBAR1 agonist triggered PKA-dependent L-type Ca 2þ current activation and action potential firing in L-cells.</s><s>The combination of TAK-875 and a GPBAR1 agonist triggered synergistic calcium elevation and GLP-1 secretory responses.</s><s>Conclusions: FFA1 and GPBAR1 activation individually increased electrical activity in L-cells by recruiting pathways that include activation of TRPC3 and L-type voltage-gated Ca 2þ channels.</s><s>Synergy between the pathways activated downstream of these receptors was observed both at the level of Ca 2þ elevation and GLP-1 secretion.</s></p></div>
