<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Neuroblastoma is a malignant paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system 1 .</s><s>Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy.</s><s>By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive 2-4 .</s><s>Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT).</s><s>These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome.</s><s>Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT.</s><s>In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype.</s><s>The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region.</s><s>Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity.</s><s>In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.</s></p><p><s>Reprints and permissions information is available at www.nature.com/reprints.</s></p></div>

type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> .</s><s>Neuroblastoma has a low mutation frequency and a heterogeneous mutation spectrum with few recurrently mutated genes.</s><s>Besides MYCN, which is amplified in 20% of neuroblastomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , the most frequently mutated gene is the tyrosine kinase gene ALK, altered in 8-10% of the cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, inactivating ATRX mutations were found in a small subgroup of neuroblastomas with unfavourable outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Beyond these alterations, no mechanisms have so far been identified that define high-risk neuroblastoma at the molecular level.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that additional structural alterations might occur in high-risk neuroblastoma and performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 tumours and matched normal controls (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>By searching for breakpoint clusters occurring within 100 kilobase-pair (kb) regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> we identified four locations exhibiting clustered breakpoints in more than three samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</s><s>Three of these regions were related to known genetic alterations in neuroblastoma, namely, MYCN amplifications, ATRX deletions, and copy number gains of chromosome 17q.</s><s>The fourth region was located at chromosome 5p15.33</s><s>and affected 12 out of 56 tumours (21%, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</s><s>Chromosomal regions translocated to the 5p15.33 breakpoints were scattered across chromosome 5 (seven cases) and other chromosomes (five cases).</s><s>The types of structural alterations were diverse and included balanced rearrangements, translocations associated with single copy number gain, and focal, high-level amplifications (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the rearrangement at 5p15.33 was caused by chromothripsis affecting chromosome 5 in two tumours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>).</s><s>We noticed that the rearrangements in the 5p15.33 region consistently clustered in a region 50 kb upstream of the TERT transcriptional start site without directly affecting the gene or its core promoter region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>We did not observe mutations affecting TERT itself or its promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In accordance with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , we found an overall low rate of non-synonymous mutations with 13.3 mutations per genome on average (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), and a significantly lower mutation rate in low-risk tumours than in the high-risk group (lowrisk, 5.9 ¬± 5.5 mutations; high-risk, 16.6 ¬± 9.9 mutations; P &lt; 0.001).</s><s>Four cases exhibited chromothripsis affecting chromosomes 5, 17, and 20 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>We detected only three genes that were expressed and altered in more than two samples (MYCN, n = 10; ALK, n = 7; and ATRX, n = 7).</s><s>Notably, TERT rearrangements occurred exclusively in high-risk tumours in 12 out of 39 of the cases (31%, P = 0.01), similar to ATRX mutations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, ALK mutations and chromothripsis were found across both risk groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, TERT rearrangements, ATRX alterations, and MYCN amplifications occurred in a mutually exclusive fashion within the high-risk group (P = 0.008), suggesting that they may converge on similar effector functions.</s></p><p><s>To further clarify the clinical relevance of TERT rearrangements in a large cohort of patients, we examined 161 additional primary neuroblastomas by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and targeted sequencing, and found 16 additional TERT-rearranged cases.</s><s>In the entire set (n = 217, Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1a</ref>), we detected 28 TERT rearrangements (13%), 27 of which occurred in high-risk tumours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref> and Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1b</ref>).</s><s>The remaining case was classified as intermediate risk (stage 3, 8 years at diagnosis), and the patient is currently in complete remission after surgery and chemotherapy.</s><s>TERT rearrangements were strongly associated with the unfavourable prognostic markers of stage 4 disease and patient age at diagnosis older than 18 months, but occurred predominantly in tumours without MYCN amplification in the high-risk cohort (Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1b</ref>).</s><s>Together, 27 of 114 high-risk neuroblastomas (24%) and 22 of 65 MYCN-non-amplified high-risk tumours (34%) harboured TERT rearrangements, indicating their frequent occurrence in these groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>).</s><s>Patients whose tumours harboured TERT rearrangements had a poor clinical outcome, which was similar to that of patients with MYCN-amplified tumours and significantly worse than that of high-risk patients without MYCN amplification or TERT rearrangements (overall survival, P = 0.056; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>; eventfree survival, P = 0.038; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>).</s><s>The clinical relevance of TERT alterations was substantiated by multivariable analyses, in which TERT rearrangements predicted unfavourable outcome independently of the established variables stage and MYCN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Since MYCN is a known transcriptional activator of TERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , we compared TERT expression in tumours with 5p15.33 rearrangements with that in MYCN-amplified specimens and with the remaining cases.</s><s>TERT expression was significantly higher in neuroblastomas with rearrangements than in MYCN-amplified tumours (P = 0.028) and in those without these alterations (P &lt; 0.001, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref>).</s><s>The median TERT expression was 92-fold higher in TERT-rearranged tumours than in low-risk tumours (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>).</s><s>In addition, TERT expression was higher in MYCN-amplified tumours than in the remaining samples (P = 0.021, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Since the region upstream of TERT consists of condensed chromatin in most somatic cells, which keeps TERT in a silenced state <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , we hypothesized that the rearrangements may induce TERT transcriptional upregulation by genomic repositioning, rather than by gain of TERT copy numbers.</s><s>In support of this hypothesis, TERT expression was massively increased in TERT-rearranged tumours compared with low-risk tumours in both subgroups with and without additional TERT copies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2e</ref>).</s><s>In addition, TERT copy numbers and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels did not correlate in TERT-rearranged neuroblastomas (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2e</ref>), indicating that additional TERT copies have little influence on TERT expression in these tumours.</s><s>In line with that notion, we found evidence for mono-allelic TERT expression in five evaluable tumours, suggesting that only the rearranged allele is expressed in these cases (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, we found no evidence for the existence of tandem duplications affecting TERT without the presence of complex rearrangements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>).</s><s>Together, these findings suggest that remodelling of the genomic context by the rearrangement itself-rather than copy number gain of this region <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> -is the major cause of TERT mRNA upregulation in TERT-rearranged neuroblastomas.</s></p><p><s>We also noticed that the distance of the breakpoints to the transcriptional start site of TERT did not affect TERT expression (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3f</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, identical rearrangements and elevated TERT expression were detected in four tumours biopsied at initial diagnosis and relapse (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>), supporting the notion that 5p15.33 rearrangements and consecutive upregulation of TERT are stable genetic events during neuroblastoma development and progression.</s></p><p><s>We observed that in TERT-rearranged neuroblastomas three genes (bleyplaby (AceViewannotated human gene; http://www.aceview.org),</s><s>SLC6A18, and SLC6A19) neighbouring TERT on the distal side of the breakpoint showed markedly increased expression, while expression of suweeby, blorplaby, and CLPTM1L (cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1-like protein), located on the proximal side of the breakpoint, did not follow this pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2f</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, MYCN-amplified tumours exhibited upregulation of only TERT and bleyplaby, but lacked upregulation of SLC6A18 and SLC6A19, whereas all four genes were silenced in low-risk neuroblastomas and in highrisk tumours without TERT rearrangements or MYCN amplification (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2f</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5a, b</ref>).</s><s>Our findings were substantiated by analyses of differential gene expression of tumours bearing TERT rearrangements or MYCN amplification versus low-risk tumours: in both comparisons, TERT was among the most highly upregulated genes, while SLC6A18 and SLC6A19 were upregulated in TERT-rearranged tumours only (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a,   b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, genomic rearrangements at 5p15.33 abrogate silencing of gene expression in this chromosomal region, whereas amplified MYCN selectively upregulates TERT by transcriptional activation.</s><s>In line with this notion, we found that TERT was the most strongly downregulated gene upon short-interfering-RNA-mediated MYCN knockdown in a MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>).</s><s>Together, these observations suggest that both 5p15.33 rearrangements and MYCN amplification converge on TERT activation in high-risk neuroblastoma.</s></p><p><s>The massive upregulation of TERT expression observed in tumours bearing structural rearrangements of the TERT locus suggested that translocation of regulatory elements (for example, enhancers) might be responsible for TERT activation.</s><s>We therefore examined patterns of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 histone modifications, which are known to mark active enhancers 16,17 , in three TERT-rearranged tumours using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to sequencing (ChIP-seq).</s><s>In all three tumours, we detected peak signals in the translocated regions that predict the presence of multiple enhancer clusters immediately adjacent to the breakpoints (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>).</s><s>Ranking of H3K27ac peak signals revealed that rearrangements consistently juxtapose TERT to strong enhancer elements, several of which are compatible with the recent definition of super-enhancers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To examine the chromatin context of the TERT locus further, we analysed additional histone modifications, known to mark active promoters (H3K4me3), transcription elongation (H3K36me3), DNA methylation (H3K9me3), and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)related gene silencing (H3K27me3), in neuroblastoma cells with and without TERT rearrangements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref> and Extended Data Figs <ref type="figure">7 and
