represents a major clinical challenge.</s><s>Autologous bone graft transplantation is on the one hand beneficial due to lack of induced immune response.</s><s>On the other hand, it creates the need for secondary surgical procedures, which can cause severe side effects and donor site morbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Different cell types are currently being investigated for their potential use in bone repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) are rapidly gaining interest for regenerative medicine approaches.</s><s>As nonhematopoietic stromal cells, hMSCs are capable of self-renewal and exhibit the ability to differentiate along multiple mesenchymal lineages such as osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Besides their direct differentiation potential, transplanted cells may exert a great influence on the surrounding cell microenvironment indirectly by the paracrine secretion of a broad spectrum of cytokines and growth factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Bone healing in response to fractures is well orchestrated and involves a broad spectrum of cytokines during the different healing phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Such growth and differentiation factors exert significant impact on resident cells thereby influencing subsequent repair.</s><s>The importance of this cytokine milieu was demonstrated directly in different in vivo approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and indirectly by the delayed fracture healing when hematoma was removed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), as well as other inflammatory cytokinesplay an essential role in the initiation process of the repair cascade by mediating inflammation, degradation, and matrix synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref

target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>While the exact reasons for this are unclear, differences in study design (young versus older donors, 7-day versus 28-day stimulation) make direct comparison difficult.</s></p><p><s>Recently, it has been described that short stimulation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells can influence their differentiation behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, 2hour short-term stimulation of bone marrow derived hMSCs with IL-1 had a strong impact on protein synthesis and influenced the secretion of proteins involved in chemotaxis, inflammation, angiogenesis, and bone formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The intraoperative usage of autologous hMSCs may be beneficial for the patient as it avoids in vitro cell manipulation, which is associated with changes in cell behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, reduces the risk of contamination, is immunologically compatible, and minimizes surgical intervention to one procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Considering the potential future use of transient intraoperative stimulation for therapeutic purposes, we investigated the effect of 2-hour IL-1 stimulation on hMSCs as a proof of principle.</s><s>In order to study the effect of IL-1 on hMSCs, we used high density micromass culture, which mimics more closely the cell microenvironment in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, it has been shown that micromasses promote the differentiation of osteoblast-like cells in comparison to monolayer culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the direct effect of IL-1 stimulation on MSC osteogenic differentiation, their regulatory behaviour towards surrounding cells by indirect coculture was also investigated.</s><s>Here, we took advantage of the homogenous cell population of the MG63 cell line, an osteosarcoma cell line that exhibits an immature phenotype, arrested at preosteoblastic state, which ensured consistent cell response and conditions when comparing the cell response of different MSC donors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Indirect coculture with MG63 cells constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein (MG63-GFP) was carried out by separating both cells types via a transwell system, which allows the exchange of soluble factors but avoids direct cell-cell contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p></div>
