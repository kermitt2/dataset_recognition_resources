<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The European Hematology Association Roadmap</head><p><s>In 2014, at its 19 th Annual Congress in Milan, Italy, the European Hematology Association (EHA), Europe's largest non-profit membership organization in the field of hematology, decided to launch a Roadmap project.</s><s>One of its goals was to better inform European policy makers and other stakeholders about the urgent needs and priorities of patients with blood diseases and the field of hematology.</s><s>Another goal was to help the European hematology research community in harnessing resources by bringing basic researchers, clinical trial networks and patient advocates together in comprehensive study groups.</s><s>A European consensus on medical and research priorities will also promote excellence and collaboration between academics and the pharmaceutical industry.</s></p><p><s>The EHA Roadmap Task Force included EHA board members and other top experts from all fields of hematology.</s><s>Hundreds of hematologists, clinical trial groups, drug makers, national hematology societies, patient representatives and others were invited to provide input and advice.</s><s>Many contributed to the drafting of the document and the various stages of review.</s></p><p><s>This Roadmap is the outcome of this project.</s><s>It identifies the greatest unmet needs in hematology research and clinical science, describing: 1) state-of-the-art hematologic research; 2) the most urgent research priorities; and 3) the anticipated impact this research could have.</s></p><p><s>The EHA Roadmap Task Force identified nine major 'sections' in hematology: normal hematopoiesis, malignant lymphoid and myeloid diseases, anemias and related diseases, platelet disorders, blood coagulation and hemostatic disorders, transfusion medicine, infections in hematology, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).</s><s>For each section, the Roadmap Task Force appointed one or two editors.</s><s>Together, the Roadmap Task Force and section editors drafted and reviewed a more detailed framework of 60 'subsections' of groups of diseases and conditions.</s><s>Section editors selected experts from their various fields to contribute as subsection editors or authors.</s><s>Each section and subsection adapted the same basic format.</s></p><p><s>Draft texts and figures were discussed by the Roadmap Task Force and section editors during three meetings between October 2014 and March 2015.</s><s>Sections were then reviewed by the Roadmap Task Force, the EHA board, and a selection of experts.</s><s>The final draft was sent for consultation to stakeholders such as national hematol-ogy societies, patients' organizations, hematology trial groups, and other European organizations in, for example, overlapping disease areas.</s><s>All comments were discussed and integrated before submission of the manuscript to Haematologica.</s></p><p><s>In all, around 300 European hematologists and top experts helped to create the Roadmap.</s></p><p><s>At the request of the EHA board, the University of Oxford simultaneously carried out a study into the societal burden and cost of blood disorders in Europe.</s><s>Outcomes from their analysis also informed various parts of this Roadmap.</s><s>Some dominating topics and unmet needs can be recognized in nearly all of the nine EHA Roadmap sections.</s><s>They include:</s></p><p><s>1. developing novel targeted therapies based on genomic profiling and chemical biology; 2. unleashing the power of cellular immunotherapy; 3. eradicating minimal residual disease (MRD) in hematologic malignancies; 4. creating smarter combination treatments; 5. developing better tolerated treatments for blood disorders with a special emphasis on elderly patients; 6. using gene therapy to tackle blood disorders; 7. maximizing the clinical application of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for transfusion, immunomodulation, and repair.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, this EHA Roadmap highlights major past achievements in the diagnostics and treatment of blood disorders, identifies unmet clinical and scientific needs in those same areas, and will enable better funded and more focused European hematology research.</s></p><p><s>The EHA will pro-actively bring this Roadmap to the attention of all stakeholders involved in hematology, and calls upon those stakeholders to do the same.</s><s>etic system has served as a paradigm for the study of many other stem cell types as well.</s></p><p><s>We have learned much about growth factors and cytokines that regulate the fate of HSCs and their progenies.</s><s>With the availability of genome-wide multiomics technologies, transcription factor (TF) networks and epigenetic landscapes of cells within the hematopoietic hierarchy are currently being characterized at a rapid pace.</s></p><p><s>Step by step, we are now beginning to understand how these are interlinked and how they control the transcriptomes and proteomes of hematopoietic cells.</s><s>We have learned a lot about the microenvironment within the bone marrow that keeps HSCs in their quiescent state and regulates their self-renewal.</s><s>We have learned about how and where HSCs are formed during embryogenesis, and we are also beginning to better understand how HSCs age.</s></p><p><s>Fundamental translational research has been critically important in getting us where we are today.</s><s>But still many questions remain.</s><s>Among many others, these include the question as to how (epi)genetic aberrations cause hematologic malignancies, and how we can use these insights to develop better therapeutic strategies.</s><s>It is now being realized that there is a clonal heterogeneity in many hematologic cancers, and possibly even within the normal HSC compartment.</s><s>But how does this affect disease development and current treatment options?</s><s>In contrast to adult life, HSCs are rapidly expanding during embryogenesis.</s><s>So can we unravel those mechanisms and apply them to in vitro HSC expansion protocols for clinical use?</s><s>A thorough understanding of embryonic versus adult hematopoiesis might also help us to better understand the differences between childhood and adult hematologic malignancies.</s><s>Reprogramming now allows patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to be generated, but the generation of fully functional HSCs from these is still rather challenging.</s><s>Can this be improved?</s><s>We live in a continuously aging society, but how does HSC aging actually affect health and disease?</s><s>Within the first section, we have brought together leading scientists and clinicians in the field of hematopoiesis.</s><s>They provide an overview of the current status of the field and an outlook on where future research should be directed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>We firmly believe that combining fundamental and translational research will result in not only a better understanding of the hematopoietic system, but also in the development of better therapeutic approaches for hematologic malignancies, many of which are still difficult to treat.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The major cell type in our blood is the red blood cell (RBC) or erythrocyte.</s><s>RBCs transport oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body, and from there they carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs.</s><s>An adult has approxi-mately 5 liters of blood, containing 25x10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">12</ref> RBCs.</s><s>Because the lifespan of an RBC is approximately 120 days, a healthy person needs to produce 2.4x10 <ref type="bibr">6</ref> RBCs per second to maintain a constant number of RBC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">16</ref></s><s>The oxygen carrier hemoglobin (Hb), composed of two a-like and two b-like globin proteins, makes up approximately 90% of soluble protein in RBCs.</s><s>RBCs and Hb form during a process called erythropoiesis, which includes the initial specification of HSCs from mesoderm during embryogenesis, the decision of these cells to self-renew or differentiate, the process of proliferation and erythroid specification, and, finally, their terminal differentiation and post-mitotic maturation.</s><s>Terminally differentiating erythroid cells extrude their nucleus and shed their endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.</s><s>The new cells enter the circulation as reticulocytes, which are still engaged in protein translation.</s><s>Finally, the population of mature, biconcave RBCs with diameters of only 6-8 micrometers creates a large surface area for gas exchange, which, through RBC membrane deformability, extends from major blood vessels into the microcirculation.</s></p><p><s>Abnormally low Hb levels cause anemia.</s><s>Approximately one-third of the world's population has some form of anemia, making this diverse group of disorders by far the most common clinical problem worldwide.</s><s>Perturbation of erythropoiesis might be acquired and related to iron deficiency or to different systemic disorders associated with chronic inflammation (e.g.</s><s>autoimmune diseases and cancers) or myelodysplasia.</s><s>A multitude of different inherited anemias affect erythropoiesis by diverse mechanisms, such as thalassemias (by reduced or absent functional Hb), sickle cell disease (SCD) (by a pathological Hb variant), HAs (by defects in membrane proteins, metabolic enzymes, or pathological Hbs), Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) (by impaired ribosome biogenesis), Fanconi anemia (FA) (by DNA repair defects), and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) (e.g.</s><s>CDA type II by defects in protein trafficking).</s><s>Polycythemia vera (PV), although not limited to erythropoiesis and also seen in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), is caused by activating JAK2 kinase mutations.</s><s>The physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders are still not completely understood, while erythroid defects are also associated with many other, and often still unknown, genetic defects.</s><s>Elucidation of normal erythropoiesis is, therefore, essential to develop new strategies for treating the wide variety of conditions affecting the erythroid system.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>European research contributions</head><p><s>Historically, research of the hematopoietic system has driven novel biological concepts and methods, owing to the accessibility and ready purification of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) for molecular and functional analyses.</s><s>Early European contributions included the Nobel Prize winning discovery of the structure of Hb <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">7</ref> and understanding the etiology and epidemiology of inherited anemias, leading to implementation of pre-natal diagnostic programs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">17</ref></s><s>Other European contributions include determining the origin of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the transcriptional circuitry underlying erythropoiesis, the molecular control of differentiation versus apoptosis, the role of iron metabolism, and DNA sequences driving high-level expression of Hb, which are now applied in gene therapy vectors.</s><s>Other discoveries, such as the roles of serotonin and transferrin receptors, also heralded significant progress in our understanding of normal erythropoiesis.</s><s>Recently, purified cells have been characterized using "omics" techniques to determine their transcriptional profiles, epigenetic programs, and responses to cell signaling.</s><s>A database dedicated to erythroid disorders has been established <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">18</ref> aiming to integrate data from fundamental and translational research with data from routine clinical care.</s><s>Translational research has resulted in optimized BMT protocols, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitoring of iron overload, improved iron chelation therapies, and targeted inhibition of signaling pathways mutated in (pre)leukemic conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">19</ref></s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Europe has a long-lasting track record of research focusing on the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche.</s><s>In fact, in 1978, Manchester-based Ray Schofield was the first to postulate that HSC function critically depends on their occupancy of specific niches located within the bone marrow.</s><s>Since then, numerous cell types comprising the HSC bone marrow niche have been identified, and some of the molecular signals that they transmit to HSCs have been discovered.</s><s>These signals trigger the cell-intrinsic molecular mechanisms known to regulate HSC fate.</s><s>Here we provide a short summary of these studies, and discuss the new challenges and questions faced by the HSC niche field.</s><s>A better understanding of the HSC niche is critical to develop both novel therapies for and preventative strategies against hematologic disease.</s><s>Furthermore, delineating the molecular pathways by which the niche regulates HSC fate decision may contribute to solving the unmet clinical need for HSC ex vivo expansion and enhanced in vivo reconstitution activity for regenerative therapies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>European research contributions</head><p><s>Both functional studies and direct observation of HSCs in vivo and ex vivo have been critical in developing our knowledge of the HSC niche and have highlighted how several stromal and hematopoietic cells must co-operate to ensure that the necessary number of hematopoietic cells are produced every day.</s><s>European researchers have both contributed to and led these studies since their earliest days.</s><s>Osteoblastic cells were the first to be identified as a component of the HSC niche and subsequently several perivascular mesenchymal cells, including nestin + progenitor cells, PDGFR/NG2/LepR-expressing cells, Schwann cells, neuronal terminations, adipocytes, and, within the hematopoietic lineages, macrophages, regulatory T cells, and megakaryocytes, have all been shown to produce molecular signals directing HSC quiescence and proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation.</s><s>These signals act through direct cell-cell interactions, such as Notch-Delta and integrin signaling; short-range gradients, such as Wnt, CXCL12, Ang1, and SCF; and long-range signals, such as cytokines and hormones.</s><s>More recently, the chemical and physical composition of the bone marrow microenvironment has begun to be studied, including factors such as oxygen levels and matrix stiffness.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anticipated impact of the research</head><p><s>A major bottleneck to curing genetic diseases originating from mutations in HSCs is that even though efficient methods for gene targeting are now available, HSCs from neither adult nor human PSC sources can be expanded sufficiently for this to become routine practice.</s><s>The combined projects in subsections 9.1 and 9.2 seek to address this and bring safe gene therapy to the clinic via HSCs.</s></p></div>
