<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The gp100 mel 47-52/40-42 antigenic peptide is generated by a new proteasomal catalytic mechanism.</s><s>For identification of new spliced peptides and/or epitopes we subjected the gp100 mel -derived synthetic polypeptide substrate gp100 mel 40-52 [RTKAWNRQLYPEW] to in vitro digestion by purified human 20S proteasomes.</s><s>By applying SpliceMet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">23</ref> we identified three spliced peptides among the proteasomal processing products.</s><s>These were the previously reported spliced antigenic peptide gp100 mel 40-42/47-52 [RTK][QLYPEW] <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">12</ref> and the novel gp100 mel 47-52/40-46 [QLYPEW][RTKAWNR] and gp100 47-52/40-42 [QLYPEW][RTK] peptides (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, a theoretical IC 50 value of 86.1 μM for HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-A*011 binding was predicted for gp100 mel 47-52/40-42 [QLYPEW][RTK] by in silico analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">24</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, we decided to analyze the formation of this potential new spliced tumor epitope in more detail.</s></p><p><s>Monitoring the in vitro generation of the spliced peptides revealed that the spliced peptide gp100 mel 40-42/47-52</s></p><p><s>was produced approximately 6-fold more efficiently by erythrocytes s-proteasomes than the new spliced gp100 mel 47-52/40-42 peptide, being composed of the same peptide fragments but in reversed order (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, opposite to the generation kinetics of the individual splice-reactants [QLYPEW], [RTKAWNR] or [RTK] (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), spleen i-proteasomes generated the spliced peptides gp100 47-52/40-46 and gp100 47-52/40-42 more efficiently than erythrocytes s-proteasomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Both the gp100 mel 47-52/40-42 and gp100 mel 47-52/40-46 peptides were the result of the linkage between the gp100 Trp 52 and Arg 40 residues of the gp100-derived substrate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>However, the Trp 52 residue of the N-terminal splice-reactant [QLYPEW] represents the C-terminal residue of the synthetic polypeptide substrate gp100 mel 40-52 .</s><s>This excluded the formation of an O-acyl-enzyme intermediate with the proteasomal active site Thr 1 as a result of peptide-bond hydrolysis as demanded for the established transpeptidation reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">14</ref> .</s><s>We therefore hypothesized that spliced peptides could also be produced in a proteasome-catalyzed condensation reaction.</s></p><p><s>To test this hypothesis we co-incubated purified 20S proteasomes with the two splice-reactant peptides gp100 mel 40-42 [RTK] and gp100 mel 47-52 [QLYPEW].</s><s>The resulting spliced peptide products were then analyzed by mass spectrometry.</s><s>In support of our hypothesis, 20S proteasomes catalyzed the formation of the gp100 mel 47-52/40-42 peptide in vitro when the two peptides were added individually (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>In accordance with the results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> i-proteasomes derived from different cellular sources catalyzed the condensation reaction with higher efficiency than s-proteasomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In principle, all active sites of both proteasome isoforms are capable of catalyzing a transpeptidation reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">14</ref> .</s><s>However, because condensation reactions require specific favorable conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">16</ref> we next asked whether any of the proteasome active sites were specifically involved in the condensation reaction.</s><s>To do so, proteasome active site subunit specific inhibitors, whose active site specificity had been previously documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">25</ref> were added to 20S proteasomes derived from T2 cells (s-proteasome) or LCLs (i-proteasome) together with the two splice-reactants [RTK] and [QLYPEW].</s><s>PR-893 (0.5 μM) was used to block the activity of the β 5 subunits of 20S s-proteasomes and PR-924 (0.5 μM) to inhibit the activity of the β 5i immuno-subunit <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">25</ref> .</s><s>Blockage of either the β 5 active site as in T2 cell-derived 20S proteasome or the β 5 and β 5i active sites as present in LCL-derived proteasomes led to a strong reduction of the condensation reaction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, blocking the β 1/β 1i and β 2/β 2i active sites with YU-102 (2 μM) and LU-102 (2 μM) proteasome inhibitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">25</ref> , respectively, barely affected the production of the antigenic peptide, suggesting that the condensation reaction was mainly executed by the active sites of the β 5 subunit isoforms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s></p></div>

response towards the spliced epitopes may in part be due to priming and the activation of naïve CD8 + T cells during the in vitro assays Supporting the conclusion that generation of MHC-class I ligands by PCPS was not a rare event, we also identified, by applying our SpliceMet-supported reverse immunology approach, a significant number of potential spliced epitopes derived from human gp100

for generation of a spliced epitope or a non-spliced epitope from a given substrate are most likely not very different.</s><s>Therefore, the pool of spliced antigenic peptides available for selection
