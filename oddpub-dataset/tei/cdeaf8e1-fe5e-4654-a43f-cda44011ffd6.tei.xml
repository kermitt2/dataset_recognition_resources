<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics statement</head><p><s>The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee at Pwani University, Kilifi County, Kenya; approval number ERC/PhD/010/2014.</s><s>The custodians and their prote ´ge ´s were informed about the objectives and procedures of the study in their mother language (Giriama or Swahili) by a Community Health Worker (CHW).</s><s>The right to deny participation and withdraw consent at any given time was clearly explained.</s></p><p><s>The informed consent form was read out loud word by word in Giriama or Swahili and explained further when required, before any interviews were conducted.</s><s>Questions of the custodian and the children were discussed and answered by a CHW.</s><s>Consent was obtained via fingerprint or signature from the legal guardian.</s><s>The examination was performed in a protected surrounding to guarantee the privacy of the patient.</s><s>Children and adolescents were only examined in the presence of their caregiver.</s></p><p><s>Any individuals found to have tungiasis were referred to the local CHWs for treatment and follow up according to their standard protocols which have been approved for use by the Ministry of Health at national and county level.</s><s>For other illnesses requiring treatment a referral form was prepared by a CHW, and patients were referred to the nearest Health Facility.</s><s>Washing and treatment were also made available for compound members with tungiasis who did not participate in the study.</s></p><p><s>The information provided to the households verbally is included as supplementary electronic information along with the consent form which was to be signed (S1 Appendix).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study area and study population</head><p><s>The study was performed in eight villages located in Kakuyuni and Malanga Sub-locations of Malindi Sub-county, Kilifi County, eastern Kenya, in the dry season from August to October 2014.</s><s>In the area tungiasis is endemic with prevalences ranging from 30 to 85% in school age children (S2 Appendix).</s></p><p><s>In Malindi Sub-county rural communities are small and consist of clusters of two to five houses separated by bush or farm land.</s><s>The area is divided into two ecological zones: Kakuyuni Sub-location, a very densely populated area in the coastal strip with homesteads located side by side.</s><s>It has a tropical climate with an average annual rainfall of 1,200 mm, temperatures ranging from 28-34˚C and high humidity most of the year.</s><s>Malanga Sub-location is located inland and is much drier with average annual rainfall of 400 mm.</s><s>Homesteads are located about 100 m from each other in this area.</s><s>There are two rainy seasons: one between March and May and the other between October and November, interspersed with dry seasons.</s></p><p><s>Malindi Sub-county has a population of 272,000 with 42.3% being under 15 years of age.</s><s>The population included in the survey are entirely of the Giriama tribe.</s><s>While 55% of households have access to piped water and 60% to improved sanitation, only 17% have access to electricity (Malindi Public Health Office 2015).</s><s>Many of the people live in mud-walled houses with a thatch roof and sandy floor (First Kilifi County Integrated Development Plan 2013-2017).</s><s>For Kilifi County as whole the poverty rate (i.e.</s><s>&lt; 1 US$ per day) is 71.4% (http://www.</s><s>crakenya.org/county/kilifi/).</s><s>The majority of the population in the study area practice subsistence agriculture, charcoal burning and small scale businesses.</s><s>The main foodstuffs cultivated are maize, cassava, coconuts, and mangoes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>The study was a cross-sectional survey of a random sample of households in Kakuyuni and Malanga Sub-locations, Kilifi County, Kenya.</s><s>These sublocations were selected because no intervention against tungiasis had been performed so far.</s></p><p><s>For this study a household was classified as a single structure/house.</s><s>Since most people live in homesteads of extended families, sharing eating, washing and sanitation facilities, we selected one structure/house per homestead in a standardized manner, always choosing the first house on the left when entering the compound.</s><s>Individuals of any age and sex were eligible for participation as long as they had spent at least 4 nights per week in the selected household for the last three months.</s><s>To be included, a household needed to have someone over the age of 18 present at the time of the visit to sign the consent forms and respond to the interview questions.</s></p><p><s>During the preparation phase contact was made with the County and District leadership in both the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education, the Zonal Education Officer and the Community Health Officers to obtain their approvals and support for the study.</s><s>We held meetings with all CHWs in each Sub-location, gave specific training on tungiasis and explained the aims and procedures of the study, emphasizing that participation was completely voluntary and subjects had the opportunity to withdraw from the study at any point of time.</s></p><p><s>The study was carried out between August 13 and October 5, 2014, i. e. during a dry season.</s><s>A total of 1,086 individuals from 233 households in eight villages were included in the study.</s></p><p><s>Data were collected through a door-to-door survey of the selected households with the help of local CHWs.</s><s>Eligible patients were explained the procedure and were asked for consent.</s><s>In case of minors a caregiver (usually the mother) was asked to provide informed consent.</s><s>If household members were not present during our first visit, we returned to the house on one further occasion.</s><s>Individuals who could not be reached at home during the second visit were invited to come to the local health facility within the next days.</s><s>Household members who could not be examined on any occasion were not included in the study.</s></p><p><s>In order to identify risk factors for the occurrence of tungiasis and severe disease, we requested information about demographic, socio-economic, environmental and behavioural characteristics of the individuals and the household.</s><s>Structured interviews were conducted with the head of household (usually the mother) using a pre-tested questionnaire in Giriama or Swahili.</s><s>Environmental, socioeconomic and some behavioural risk factors were assessed at the household level, other risk factors were assessed on the individual level.</s></p><p><s>Since cash flow does not correctly indicate the economic status of a household in lowincome communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref>, we used an asset score similar to the one previously established for cutaneous larva migrans, another neglected tropical skin disease associated with poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The score is composed of the following assets:</s></p><p><s>Presence in the household of a radio (2 points), television (5 points), fridge (5 points), gas/ solar lamp (1 point);

type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>.</s><s>The observation that age-specific prevalence significantly correlated to high intensity of infection (rho = 0.90; Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) confirms that children and the elderly bear the highest burden of disease.</s><s>Anecdotal reports show that elderly individuals without social support structures tend to be infected with tungiasis more frequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>This tendency was confirmed in this study, although it was not significant.</s></p><p><s>Tungiasis is a zoonosis in which sylvatic, peri-domiciliary and domestic cycles are interlinked in a complex manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The situation becomes even more intricate when transmission also occurs inside the house, without the involvement of an animal reservoir.</s><s>Intra-domiciliary transmission indicates that the off-host cycle of T. penetrans is completed inside the house.</s><s>Usually, this is a room in which family members spend many hours a day, such as the sleeping room.</s><s>If the floor in this room consists of sand, dried mud or rugged cement with holes and cracks, eggs that have been expelled by embedded female sand fleas overnight and which have fallen on the floor are swept into crevices of the floor or into the cracks between floor and wall, when the room is cleaned with a broom in the morning.</s><s>Eggs can develop into larvae and pupae in such cracks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>That intra-domiciliary transmission occurs in the study area is supported by the finding that direct sleeping on the floor or if walls of the sleeping room consisted of mud remained significant risk factors in the multivariate analysis.</s><s>The more people slept in a room the higher were the odds of tungiasis in household members.</s></p><p><s>It is known that different animal species act as reservoirs in different countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref>].</s><s>In our study population, 74% of all households had chicken, 60% had goats, 25% had dogs and 25% had cats.</s><s>However, no specific animal species was identified as a risk factor for tungiasis in this study.</s><s>This finding supports the assumption that perhaps in these coastal communities the Tunga penetrans cycle is almost entirely human and does not involve animal reservoirs.</s><s>It should be noted that animals were not examined for infection in this study, only observed as present in the compound and reported as to where they sleep at night (S3 Appendix).</s><s>In Northeast Brazil, stray dogs and cats are important reservoirs in urban areas, whereas in rural areas pigs are the most import species <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>.</s><s>Pigs were also identified as the major reservoir of T. penetrans in Nigeria and in Uganda <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>.</s><s>However, pigs were not kept in any of the households in the study area, because a considerable part of the population is Muslim.</s><s>Actually, being Muslim was identified as a significant protective factor in the bivariate analysis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>), which may be explained by the fact that Muslims wash their feet several times a day before entering the mosque for prayer.</s></p><p><s>Other risk factors which remained significant after multivariate regression analysis were the limited access to water (water only available from muddy pools), frequency of washing as well as bathing without soap.</s><s>A similar finding was made in a resource-poor community in Northeast Brazil <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>It is tempting to speculate that these risk factors are correlated to the reproductive biology of T. penetrans.</s><s>Female sand fleas are fertilized by males exploring the skin only after females are embedded in the epidermis and have started neosomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s><s>There is circumstantial evidence that males are attracted by odor emitted from the faecal material released by females in regular intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>.</s><s>The faecal material spreads into dermal papillae around the lesion, and since it is very sticky, it needs soap to be washed off.</s><s>Hence, when soap is not used or unavailability of water prevents any washing at all, more male sand fleas should be attracted to the skin and, hence, more females will be fertilized.</s><s>Over time, this will lead to a higher intensity of infection.</s></p><p><s>It has previously been reported that within endemic areas, tungiasis is heterogeneously distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>This was confirmed in this study: where prevalence varied between villages from 7.8% to 64.7% in the five study villages in Malanga Sub-location, all situated within 4 km of each other and from 13.4% to 35.5% in the three study villages in Kakuyuni Sub-location, within 2 km of each other.</s><s>Whether the heterogeneity is determined by differences in the predominant type of exposure within a community, such as intra-domiciliary versus peri-domestic could not be clarified in this study.</s></p><p><s>We found very high Population Attributable Fractions for biologically very plausible variables.</s><s>Trickling of sand and dust from mud walls creates ideal conditions for the off-host life cycle of sand fleas in cracks of the floor.</s><s>Building walls of stone or cement would reduce the prevalence of tungiasis by 64 percent.</s><s>Similar, promoting better hygiene, particularly washing with soap, would reduce the prevalence of tungiasis in the community by 17 and 20%, respectively.</s></p><p><s>We realize that this study has several limitations.</s><s>First, there is an overrepresentation of adult females in the study group.</s><s>The study was conducted during the day on all days of the week, including Saturday and Sunday, in order to encounter school children on the compound.</s><s>However, since the majority of adult males in our study population worked as farmers and returned only after sunset we could not examine them.</s><s>Extending our working periods towards the evening was not possible due to insufficient lighting and safety concerns.</s><s>The distances between the households in Malanga and our time constraints, also meant that there were fewer households included in the study from this area than from Kakuyuni.</s><s>Ecologically the two areas are quite different.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, many factors which-by one way or another-are linked to poverty were identified as important risk factors in the bivariate and/or multivariate regression analysis, such as poor construction characteristics of the house, absence of a ventilated pit latrine, no access to drinking water on the compound, a single sleeping room for children and adults, absence of beds and mattresses, unavailability of soap for body wash, an asset score below 5 points and a low level of education among adults.</s><s>Thus, as seen elsewhere in the world, tungiasis in rural Kenya is a poverty-associated disease in which the poorest of the poor bear the highest burden of disease, but that it can be controlled with simple housing improvements, improved access to water and hygiene practices.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
