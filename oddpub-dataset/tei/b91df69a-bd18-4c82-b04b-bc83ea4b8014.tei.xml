type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>These complex structures serve as templates for family A GPCR homology modeling with the purpose of studying details of ligand binding or signal

limitations such as lack of an entire ectodomain, as no structural template is yet available.</s><s>Moreover, the putative binding mode of PEN, a GPR83 ligand <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, cannot be included in complex models, because of missing structural information of both the eNDo and PEN, or concrete data on ligand binding determinants.</s></p><p><s>All structural modifications to

simulations.</s></p><p><s>a.</s><s>An inactive hGPR83 model based on rhodopsin.</s><s>For structural modeling of the inactive state conformation of hGPR83, crystallized rhodopsin was used as an initial template (PDB entry 1F88 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>).</s><s>In addition to usual modifications for template preparations such as removal of the ligand or loop length adjustments <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, further modifications were performed including substitution of the entire extracellular loop (ECL) 2 by an alternative template.</s><s>The ECL2 is located close to the transmembrane helices in rhodopsin and opsin, almost parallel to the membrane and tightly closing the binding pocket of the permanently bound ligand retinal.</s><s>In available crystal structures of peptide receptors (such as the GPR83), this spatial localization differs, whereby the fold of the ECL2 is similar that of the rhodopsin ECL2.</s><s>In the neurotensin (NTSR1, PDB entries 4GRV, 4XEE) and the angiotensin 1 receptors (AT1R, PDB entry 4ZUD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the spatial ECL2 localization is oriented more towards the extracellular space compared with the rhodopsin/opsin ECL2.</s><s>Similar properties for the ECL2 can be observed at the nociceptin/orphanin FQ

substituted the ECL2 of the active-like neurotensin receptor (PDB entry 4XEE, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>) into our rhodopsin template.</s><s>Moreover, amino acids of the N-terminal part of the crystallized neurotensin receptor (i.e., in interaction with the ECL2) were also substituted into the structural template to receive a fragmental template structure for amino acids that were tested in our hGPR83 mutagenesis approach.</s><s>The hGPR83 model includes residues Phe55-Asn67 of the eNDo.</s></p><p><s>Amino acids of this chimeric receptor template were than substituted with residues of the human hGPR83.</s><s>This was followed by side chain energy minimization until converging at a termination gradient of 0.2 kcal/mol Ã Å with constraint backbone atoms of the transmembrane helices, which were finally released in a second minimization step until converging at a termination gradient of 0.1 kcal/mol Ã Å.</s><s>The entire hGPR83 model is constituted by amino acids from positions Phe55 to Cys363.</s><s>This first preliminary model was further refined by short molecular dynamic simulations (300 K, 2 ns) and energetic minimizations of the side chain orientations with constrained backbone atoms of helical parts and the beta-sheet like fold of the ECL2 (until converging at a termination gradient of 0.1 kcal/mol Ã Å).</s><s>Finally, all constraints were released and the model minimized until a termination gradient of 0.1 kcal/ mol Ã Å.</s></p><p><s>b.</s><s>An active hGPR83 conformation bound with beta-arrestin.</s><s>The β-adrenergic 2 receptor
