<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The major finding of this subanalysis is that pre-and postoperative mHLA-DR were influenced by smoking, gender, and overweight.</s><s>Smokers revealed an attenuated pre-and postoperative immune function, whereas recovery of mHLA-DR was better in normal weight patients, women, and nonsmokers.</s><s>This is an important finding, particularly with regard to the impact of smoking on pre-and postoperative function on the immune system.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, no other study has investigated influencing factors on postoperative mHLA-DR up to date.</s><s>HLA-DR is a key molecule on antigen-presenting cells and a marker of impaired immunity and immune suppression, for example, during sepsis and after surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>We found lower values of mHLA-DR preoperatively in smokers as well as higher levels of CRP and a delayed recovery   of mHLA-DR after surgery.</s><s>Smoking might therefore have direct influences on pre-and postoperative immune function, a generally lower immunity, and delayed recovery of immune suppression after surgery.</s><s>Most likely, these alterations   resulted in outcome differences seen in a prolonged ICU stay in smokers.</s><s>Shiels et al. found a decrease of inflammatory markers and an increase in CRP in long-term smokers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> whereas Hiemstra et al. could show that inflammation is increased and host defence against infections is decreased by cigarette smoke <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>In accordance with Hiemstra et al., we observed an increased inflammation by CRP and a decreased host immunity by mHLA-DR.</s><s>Dogan et al. conclude that regular smoking correlates with alterations in peripheral mononuclear cells interfering inflammatory and immune function pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>In previous studies, smoking showed significant interactions with subtypes of HLA-DR alleles and therefore increased the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, our study was not designed to analyze these interactions but most likely smoking influences not only subtypes of HLA-DR alleles, but also mHLA-DR expression.</s><s>Our analyses show that smoking is not only related to postoperative complications such as cardiovascular <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, respiratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and wound complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, but also related to preoperative immunological complications that might influence or induce postoperative complications.</s><s>We hypothesize that regular smoking has long-term effects on immunity through directly affecting mHLA-DR.</s><s>After surgery, mHLA-DR remains impaired resulting in a delayed recovery which increases the risk of postoperative complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Further studies are warranted to evaluate potential pathological mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, we found a delayed recovery of mHLA-DR in overweight patients after surgery.</s><s>Likewise diabetes, obesity generally constitutes a chronic inflammatory state, particularly elevated leukocyte counts, activity of granulocyte phagocytosis and oxidative burst, and increased levels of TNF- and IL-6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>Obesity is also an important risk factor for increased mortality up to 20% and a shortened life expectancy up to 2 to 4 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</s><s>In various surgical procedures, overweight or obesity can lead to an increased risk of postoperative infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>We have not seen increased CRP or leukocytes in overweight patients but an increased risk for postoperative complications by a delayed recovery of mHLA-DR <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In summary, overweight patients had a postoperatively impaired immunity and thus most likely an increased risk for postoperative complications.</s></p><p><s>In GEE, we found differences in postoperative mHLA-DR between men and women over time and lower postoperative levels in men in univariate analyses.</s><s>Gender generally constitutes an unmodifiable risk factor for postoperative complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Ono et al. investigated postoperative mHLA-DR and also found lower levels in men on day one after gastrectomy but did not study further courses as we did <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In clinical studies,

target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</s><s>Surgical time contributes also as a risk factor for postoperative infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</s><s>However, we did not see any influence of

analyzed.</s><s>Though significant differences occurred, a higher sample size could have shown more reliable results.</s><s>Furthermore, we analyzed mHLA-DR of postoperative immune suppressed patients
