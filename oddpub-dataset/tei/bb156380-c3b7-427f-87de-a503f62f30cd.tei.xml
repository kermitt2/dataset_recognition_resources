<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Human nitrilase1 (hNit1) was recognized during the characterization of the human fragile histidine triad (Fhit) tumour suppressor protein, when it was realized that in D. melanogaster and C. elegans Fhit is expressed as a C-terminal fusion protein with the unrelated protein nitrilase (Nit).</s><s>Sequence alignments identified hNit1 as the closest homologue of the Nit domain in the Drosophila and C. elegans NitFhit fusion proteins exhibiting about 50% identity at the amino acid sequence level within the Nit domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The C. elegans NitFhit fusion protein forms a tetrameric complex with four Nit domains building the central core and the C-terminal Fhit domains aligning as dimers at opposing sites of the Nit core <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>A similar dimeric structure was previously reported for the human Fhit protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, Fhit and Nit1 show similar expression patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Based on these observations, Fhit and Nit1 were defined as Rosetta-Stone proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> with a postulated common tumour suppressive function, although a direct interaction of both proteins has not been shown till now.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to Fhit, little is known about the function of Nit1 and interaction partners have not been studied.</s><s>Together with nitrilase2 and the NitFhit fusion proteins of D. melanogaster and C. elegans, Nit1 is a member of the 10th out of 13 branches of the Nit protein superfamily.</s><s>Only branch 1 enzymes are known to have specific nitrilase activity performing nitrile hydrolysis, whereas most other branches have apparent or postulated amidase or amide condensation activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Mammalian Nit1 was reported to cleave several synthetic dipeptide substrates, but has no amidase activity as reported for mammalian nitrilase2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>To date, no physiological substrate of Nit1 is known.</s></p><p><s>Nit1 − / − mice developed normally and revealed similar phenotypes as reported for Fhit − / − mice such as accelerated cell proliferation, increased cyclin D1 expression and higher N-nitrosomethylbenzylamineinduced tumour incidence.</s><s>Overexpression of Nit1 similar to Fhit overexpression resulted in enhanced apoptosis.</s><s>Mutation of the Cys residue within the catalytic triad did not affect the tumour suppressive activity of Nit1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, it was shown that Nit1 acts as a negative regulator of T-cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, overexpression of Fhit induces apoptosis in Nit1 − / − cells and vice versa, suggesting that both proteins can promote pro-apoptotic signalling independently <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>In oesophageal adenocarcinoma, a loss of Nit1 expression was observed in 48% of the cases, suggesting a role in human cancer development <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>However, loss of Nit1 and Fhit expression did not correlate in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Currently, little is known about the mechanisms of Nit1 tumour suppressor function.</s></p><p><s>β-Catenin acts as a multifunctional adaptor protein, for example, within the cadherin-catenin cell-cell adhesion complex and in the canonical Wnt signalling pathway, thereby regulating diverse cellular processes including morphogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, tumourigenesis and neurodegenerative disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>.</s><s>This requires that β-catenin level and function have to be tightly controlled.</s><s>Excess cytoplasmic β-catenin is rapidly marked for degradation by the β-catenin destruction complex composed of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, Axin, Dishevelled and the Ser/Thr kinases casein kinase 1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3-β.</s><s>Activation of the Wnt pathway by binding of secreted members of the Wnt family to Frizzled/LRP6 receptor complexes in turn destabilizes the destruction complex and finally results in accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol and its translocation into the nucleus.</s><s>There, in association with LEF-1/ TCF transcription factors β-catenin recruits further components including Bcl-9, Pygopus, Parafibromin and CREB-binding protein, which modulate transcription at promoters of target genes such as c-myc, cyclin D1, sp5, axin2, survivin and MMP-14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previously, we have identified β-catenin as a direct Fhit interaction partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>.</s><s>Based on this observation and in the context of a putative cooperation of Nit1 and Fhit as postulated by the Rosetta-Stone hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>, we here addressed whether hNit1/ Drosophila NitFhit (dNitFhit) has a modulatory role in the canonical Wnt/Wingless (Wg) pathway by both biochemical and genetic analyses.</s></p></div>

co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with β-catenin-FLAG and hNit1-myc 6 .</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, anti-FLAG-M2 antibody co-precipitated hNit1-myc 6 in cells co-transfected with both constructs but not in controls that were transfected with only a single plasmid.</s><s>Moreover, using the monoclonal anti-Nit1 (1C3) antibody it was possible to precipitate endogenous hNit1/β-catenin complexes from lysates of HeLa and HEK-293 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were obtained with a polyclonal anti-Nit1 antibody in HEK-293 HeLa, HCT116 and MCF-7 cells (not shown).</s><s>Proximity ligation assays (PLAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref> further confirmed an endogenous interaction of β-catenin and hNit1 within MCF-7 cells.</s><s>Knockdown of endogenous hNit1 significantly reduced the PLA signals both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Immunofluorescence microscopy also showed cytosolic and nuclear localization of overexpressed hNit1 (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>In nuclear/cytosolic fractionation experiments, overexpressed hNit1 predominantly localized in the cytosol with lower amounts localized in the nucleus.</s><s>In these assays, overexpression did not change β-catenin cytosolic/ nuclear distribution (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, when HEK-293 cells were stimulated with Wnt3a-conditioned medium, β-catenin in the Nit1 represses Wnt/β-catenin signalling nucleus increased and overexpression of hNit1 apparently decreased the amount of nuclear β-catenin (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>).</s><s>In addition, hNit1 was co-precipitated from lysates of HEK-293 cells transfected with FLAG-LEF-1 and hNit1, suggesting that hNit1 may associate with the β-catenin/LEF-1 transcription complex (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In this context, we next analysed in reporter gene assays whether hNit1 has an effect on β-catenin-mediated transcriptional acitivity.</s><s>Transfection of increasing amounts of hNit1 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the pGL4.26BAR-luc</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref> reporter gene activity in HEK-293 cells.</s><s>Mutation of the Cys residue in the catalytic centre of the protein (hNit1C203A) did not impair the repressive activity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>A similar repressive activity of hNit1 was detectable in SW480 colon carcinoma cells in which the Wnt pathway is constitutively active due to a mutation in APC (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</s><s>Comparable results were obtained when reporter gene assays were performed with Siamois-luciferase reporter gene constructs (S5 and S0) containing an endogenous promoter of a known β-catenin target gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, columns 1-3).</s><s>Transcriptional activation induced by ΔNLEF-VP16, a construct that drives β-catenin-independent transcription via the herpes simplex virus VP16 transactivation domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>, was not inhibited by hNit1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, columns 4-5), indicating that hNit1 has not a general inhibitory effect on transcription but depends on β-catenin.</s><s>As it has been reported that Nit1 and Fhit act additively <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we next wanted to address whether an additive effect is also detectable in respect to β-catenin-mediated transcription.</s><s>Indeed, co-transfection of both hNit1 and hFhit induced further repression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, expression of an artificial hNit1Fhit fusion construct, where the hNit1 protein was fused with hFhit by a linker peptide taken from the dNitFhit fusion protein, resulted in a similar repressive activity as detected for the co-expressed separate proteins (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, overexpression of hNit1 repressed reporter gene activation in response to Wnt3a stimulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, when hNit1 was knocked down by stable transfection of a short hairpin RNA construct in MCF-7 cells, expression of the endogenous Wnt target genes sp5, cyclin D1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>) and MMP-14 (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>) was increased.</s><s>Efficiency of knockdown was analysed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>) and western blotting (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>) in two different Nit1 represses Wnt/β-catenin signalling clones.</s><s>To examine whether hNit1 is recruited to promoters of TCF/β-catenin target genes, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed, showing that endogenous hNit1 indeed is associated with the cyclin D1 and MMP-14 promoters (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7</ref>).</s><s>From these data we conclude that both hNit1 and hFhit repress β-cateninmediated transcription in an additive manner.</s></p></div>
