the cytokines IL-2 and TGFb (ref.</s><s>5).</s><s>Development and function of Tregs have been tightly linked to the transcription factor FOXP3, since its mutation leads to an autoimmune syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and overexpression of FOXP3 in conventional T-cells induces the majority of genes

conserved enhancer regions, termed CNS1 to 3, have been implicated in regulation of FOXP3 expression and Treg development <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>CNS3 is particularly relevant for generating tTregs through binding of the TF c-Rel <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>In particular, stable demethylation of this locus in tTregs correlates with continuous FOXP3 expression, while ongoing methylation in iTregs or pTregs indicates decay of FOXP3 expression after removal of TGFb (ref.</s><s>15).</s></p><p><s>Several other transcription factors also contribute to FOXP3 expression.</s><s>For CNS1, these include the TFs Smad3 and NFAT and reflect TGFb activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , while the TFs CREB and STAT5 control the activity of the promoter and/or CNS2 (refs 16,18,19).</s><s>Furthermore, FOXO1 and FOXO3, two members of the FOXO TF family, bind to and activate the foxp3 promoter and CNS2 (refs 20-22).</s><s>Because FOXO proteins are inactivated by phosphorylation via a signalling axis formed by the molecules PI3K-Akt-mTOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , enhanced binding of FOXO proteins to CNS2 explains upregulated FOXP3 expression upon interference with Akt/mTOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> .</s><s>Very recent evidence demonstrated that the Tec family tyrosine kinase Itk influences mTOR signalling and that Itk-deficient animals have increased numbers of Tregs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Apart from Akt/mTOR, the signalling molecules MEK/ERK and PKC-y are also implicated in iTreg homoeostasis, as suggested by higher iTreg frequency when these pathways are inhibited <ref

target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>In vivo instability may be reflected by in vitro downregulation of FOXP3 in iTregs under conditions of continuous TCR stimulation but absence of TGFb (refs 28,32,36).</s><s>Recent evidence indicates that an ongoing TCR-signal transmits a negative signal for FOXP3 expression, because continuous culture without TCR-signal is sufficient to maintain FOXP3 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>In the present report, we characterize this negative feedback loop and decipher TCR-mediated

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>A TCR-mediated suppressive pathway for FOXP3 expression.</s><s>We first confirmed reports by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> that the TCR creates a dominant negative signal for maintenance of FOXP3 expression in iTregs but not in ex vivo prepared Tregs.</s><s>In our study, these are mixtures of tTreg and pTreg and will be termed nTreg.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, high levels of FOXP3 were observed in nTregs, sorted as green fluorescence protein (GFP) positive cells from DEREG mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>These mice contain a BAC transgene encoding the regulatory domains of foxp3 upstream of gfp.</s><s>Therefore, GFP positivity reflects active transcription of foxp3.</s><s>FOXP3 was similarly expressed in iTregs induced from normal CD4 þ wildtype (WT) cells after stimulation for 72 h via antibodies to CD3/ CD28 (aCD3/28) in the presence of IL-2 and TGFb.</s><s>These antibodies recognize the CD3 complex of the TCR or the costimulatory molecule CD28, respectively, and can serve as mimic of antigenic recognition.</s><s>After 72 h, iTregs were washed and further cultured in the presence of IL-2 and with or without restimulation via aCD3.</s><s>Throughout this manuscript, we will refer to this culture period of iTreg as 're-culture'.</s><s>As published before, re-culture with aCD3 for 48 h profoundly suppressed FOXP3 expression compared with re-culture without the TCR-signal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,c</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, CFSE staining confirmed that FOXP3 downregulation was regulated independently of cell proliferation, that is, was not an artefact caused by outgrowth of FOXP3 negative cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Downregulation of FOXP3 was also observed with PMA/Ionomycin instead of aCD3 to imitate intracellular signalling aspects of CD3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,c</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to iTregs, neither aCD3 nor PMA/Ionomycin caused downregulation of FOXP3 expression in nTregs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d,e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In theory, the above described finding could have been secondary to a soluble mediator like a cytokine induced by stimulation with aCD3/28.</s><s>To rule this out, we re-cultured iTregs in the absence of aCD3 or PMA/Ionomycin, but presence of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and antigen presenting cells (APCs).</s><s>The superantigen SEB is recognized by all TCRs carrying a Vb gene of the Vb8 family, but not by Vb6 family members.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>, Vb8 þ and Vb6 þ iTregs kept high levels of FOXP3 after re-culture without SEB, while in its presence Vb8 þ but not Vb6 þ iTregs downregulated FOXP3 to a great extent.</s><s>This demonstrates that the negative signal is also delivered by TCR-mediated recognition of an antigen presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules.</s><s>Collectively, these data show that stimulation of the TCR generates an active negative signal for FOXP3 expression in iTregs, but not in nTregs.</s></p><p><s>To understand the underlying mechanisms, we next analysed molecules previously connected to FOXP3 regulation.</s><s>Inhibitors of the signalling molecules PKC and MEK/ERK rescued FOXP3 expression during the re-culture period strongly or partly, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</s><s>Although inhibition of PI3K by itself had no impact, it synergized with MEK/ERK for almost complete reversion of the negative TCR-signal.</s><s>Thus, the previously reported negative effects of PKC, MEK/ERK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR on FOXP3 expression during generation of iTreg are likely embedded in the herein analysed TCR-initiated pathway.</s><s>As anticipated, interference with proximal TCRsignalling by an inhibitor of the kinase Src also rescued FOXP3 expression.</s><s>The pan inhibitor PS-1145 of the NFkB TF family, which also blocks c-Rel, had no effect (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>), while it reduced the luciferase activity in 293-mTLR9-luc cells.</s><s>These cells report NFkB activity by enhanced expression of luciferase and were used as control for the activity of PS-1145 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</s><s>This result demonstrates that the suppressive TCR-activity acts independently of the published FOXP3-agonistic activity of c-Rel <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, cyclosporine A (CsA) did not interfere with FOXP3 downregulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the FOXP3-depleting TCRactivity acts independently not only of c-Rel but also of the phosphatase calcineurin and thus of NFAT TFs.</s></p><p><s>The TCR signal interferes with active FOXP3 production.</s><s>To analyse whether the TCR-signal led to instability of FOXP3 protein or interfered with foxp3 transcription/translation, iTregs were re-cultured with or without cycloheximide.</s><s>Presence of this protein synthesis inhibitor entirely blocked FOXP3 expression even in the absence of the TCR-signal (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>Thus, persistence of FOXP3 in iTregs relies on active de novo production, a process most likely blocked by the TCR-signal.</s><s>To confirm this concept, we induced iTreg from sorted GFP-negative non-regulatory CD4 þ T-cells of DEREG mice.</s><s>After 72 h of induction of iTreg in these cells, GFP þ iTregs were sorted again and re-cultured with or without TCR-signal, as described above.</s><s>As explained before, GFP positivity of these cells reflects active transcription of foxp3.</s><s>Despite similar viability, most of these iTregs expressed GFP in the absence of the TCR-signal, but lost reporter gene expression after TCR stimulation (lower panels in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s><s>FOXP3 protein expression was suppressed by the TCR signal as before (upper panels in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s><s>Using a modified protocol with a 48 h resting period in the absence of the TCR signal between iTreg induction an re-culture, we confirmed these results for sorted RFP þ iTregs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>) from FIR mice which encode the gene for RFP after an IRES sequence located in the endogenous foxp3 locus.</s><s>Because of the signal strength of RFP, downregulation of RFP could here only be determined by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).</s><s>Using FIR cells, we also confirmed with RFP þ iTreg that FOXP3 downregulation occurs independently of cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results from both types of reporter cells clearly indicate suppressed gene transcription/ translation as the reason for downregulation of FOXP3 protein.</s><s>In addition, these findings exclude that lack of FOXP3 expression after stimulation with aCD3 is because of an hypothetical overgrowth of contaminating conventional non-regulatory CD4 þ T-cells.</s><s>TGFb and IL-2 are crucial for induction of foxp3 gene transcription.</s><s>To test their contribution for FOXP3 maintenance after the induction period and in the absence of the TCR-signal, we re-cultured WT iTregs without aCD3, but added either exogenous IL-2 and/or TGFb or anti-(a)IL-2 antibodies.</s><s>Although TGFb further increased FOXP3 expression, aIL-2 totally blocked it (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c,e</ref>).</s><s>Notably, the FOXP3 enhancing effect of exogenous TGFb was also neutralized by aIL-2.</s><s>These findings demonstrate that foxp3 maintenance can almost totally be traced back to mutually dependent activities of TGFb and IL-2.</s></p><p><s>In a next step, we tested the influence of TGFb and IL-2 on FOXP3 expression during TCR stimulation.</s><s>We also analysed the effect of IL-6, which in combination with TGFb induces pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and thus counteracts the foxp3 inducing effect of TGFb.</s><s>As anticipated, TGFb abolished the TCR-mediated block of foxp3 transcription during re-culture (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d,f</ref>).</s><s>Again, this TGFb activity depended almost totally on the presence of IL-2.</s><s>IL-6 led to the known downregulation of FOXP3 even in the presence of TGFb.</s><s>Very interestingly however, IL-6 had almost no effect on the high FOXP3 levels observed after re-culture without TCR-signal.</s><s>These results were confirmed with sorted RFP þ iTreg (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>).</s><s>Clearly, IL-6 does not suppress FOXP3 expression by itself but rather interferes with the activity of TGFb which abrogates TCR-mediated FOXP3-depletion.</s><s>Because the amounts of FOXP3 seen in the absence of the TCR-signal are also dependent on TGFb but not influenced by IL-6 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d,f</ref>), these findings suggest two qualitatively different TGFb-mediated signals.</s><s>Likely, binding of the TF Smad3 to CNS1 reflects the well known activity of TGFb, which cooperates with STAT5 and is not influenced by IL-6.</s><s>The novel TGFb activity becomes only visible in the presence of the TCR-signal and can be counteracted by IL-6.</s></p><p><s>The TCR-signal interferes with STAT5 phosphorylation.</s><s>Sixteen years ago, a report demonstrated that a TCR-trigger interfered with STAT5 signalling in human T-cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>To test for such a mechanism in our setting, iTregs were re-cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of the TCR-signal as before.</s><s>After washing, the cells were deprived of IL-2 for 1 h, re-incubated for 10 min with IL-2 and the amounts of STAT5 phosphorylated on tyrosine residue Tyr694 (pSTAT5) were visualized by western Blot.</s><s>Without TCR-signal, phosphorylation of STAT5 was induced by IL-2 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, presence of the TCR-signal (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>) drastically blocked STAT5 phosphorylation.</s><s>This result was confirmed by using sorted RFP þ iTreg (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, simultaneously added TGFb dose-dependently maintained the potential to phosphorylate STAT5 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>This finding illustrates that the above identified new biological activity of TGFb can be characterized as licensing of STAT5 phosphorylation even in the presence of the TCR-signal.</s><s>IL-6 in turn counteracted this licensing activity of TGFb, resulting in the re-established block of STAT5 phosphorylation by TCR-signalling.</s></p><p><s>Inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation could be secondary to downregulation of components of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R).</s><s>To test this, iTregs were re-cultured with or without TCR-signal as before and were analysed for expression of CD25, CD122 and CD132 by FACS analysis.</s><s>We found no influence of the TCRsignal on expression of CD25 and CD132 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>).</s><s>As for CD122, we faced the problem that IL-2 added during re-culture blocked antibody staining (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5A</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, we repeated the experiment in the presence of considerably lower amounts of IL-2.</s><s>Under these conditions, FOXP3 levels were still quite high in the absence of the TCR-signal and completely downregulated in its presence (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>, lower panels).</s><s>With these limiting amounts of IL-2, staining with aCD122 was not influenced and no difference of CD122 expression in the presence or absence of the TCR-signal was found (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>, upper panels).</s><s>We confirmed this result by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (qRT-PCR) analysis of CD122 mRNA after reculture in the presence of the high concentrations of IL-2 used before (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation cannot be explained by lack of components of the IL-2R.</s><s>Tyrosine phosphatases are obvious candidates to explain abrogated Tyr694 STAT5 phosphorylation during TCR-engagement.</s><s>Indeed, several tyrosine phosphatases such as CD45, PTPN1 and PTPN2 have previously been linked with STAT5 (refs 39-42).</s><s>To investigate the involvement of a phosphatase, we deprived iTreg of IL-2 as before and subsequently treated them for 45 min with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na 3 VO 4 .</s><s>Thereafter, IL-2 was added for 10 min and lysates were prepared for western blotting.</s><s>Importantly, Na 3 VO 4 dose-dependently restored the ability of IL-2 to phosphorylate Tyr694 of STAT5 to normal levels (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>These findings indicate that TCR-signalling induces the activity of a phosphatase that blocks STAT5 phosphorylation.</s><s>Of note, the toxicity of the phosphatase inhibitor did not allow to directly measure its effect on FOXP3 expression during the long re-culture period.</s></p><p><s>To identify the phosphatase involved, we next transfected iTregs with a commercially available panel of siRNAs directed against different p-Tyr-phosphatases.</s><s>To do this, iTregs were induced as before, removed from the TCR-signal, nucleofected with the siRNAs and 24 h later were re-stimulated via aCD3.</s><s>Thereafter, cells were deprived of and resupplied with IL-2 as described above, and STAT5 phosphorylation was determined.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>, siRNAs directed to PTPN1, PTPN6, PTPN22 and DUSP3 had no effect.</s><s>In contrast, siRNA targeting PTPN2 entirely rescued pSTAT5 generation in response to IL-2 even after provision of the otherwise suppressive TCR-signal (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>).</s><s>The specificity of PTPN2 knockdown was confirmed with scrambled siRNA or the siRNAs against the other p-Tyrphosphatases and verified by detection of PTPN6 instead of PTPN2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>).</s><s>PTPN2 knockdown was verified by western blot (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Given the involvement of PTPN2 in the FOXP3-depleting TCR-signal, we wondered if the TCR regulates the amounts of PTPN2 in iTregs.</s><s>To address this question, iTegs were again recultured with or without the TCR-signal and cell lysates were tested for quantity of PTPN2 protein by Western blot.</s><s>Remarkably, re-culture in the presence of aCD3 for 24 or 48 h upregulated PTPN2 protein compared with culture in IL-2 only (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>).</s><s>A similar activity was noted in the IL-2-deprivation experiment described before (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>) and for PMA(Ionomycin (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>).</s><s>No upregulation of PTPN2 was found in nTreg after 48 h of in vitro stimulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The TCR-signal interferes with FOXO1 expression.</s><s>In the context of clonal expansion of conventional T-cells, it has recently been described that the amount of FOXO1, a TF upregulating foxp3 by binding to its promoter and to CNS2 (refs 20-22), is also downregulated by TCR-signals, a process involving microRNA miR-182 (ref.</s><s>43).</s><s>In addition, FOXO TFs upregulate their own transcription, if they are not inhibited by phosphorylation, for example, in response to Akt <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, TGFb also interferes with Akt activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> , thus creating a potential scenario for yet another FOXP3 protecting activity of this cytokine.</s><s>Finally, ERK was shown to phosphorylate FOXO1 independently of Akt <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> , a finding possibly explaining the previously described ERK activity during TCR-mediated downregulation of FOXP3 (ref.</s><s>28).</s></p><p><s>To test for these options, the amount of FOXO1 protein was analysed in cell lysates of iTregs after 24 or 48 h of re-culture.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6B</ref>, the TCR-signal strongly downregulated FOXO1 protein.</s><s>No alteration in FOXO1 expression was observed in nTreg (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6A</ref>).</s><s>The effect in iTreg was inhibited by TGFb (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>) and, to a similar extent, by inhibition of ERK via the MEK-inhibitor UO126.</s><s>Accordingly, combined inhibition of ERK and Akt (via PI3K) synergistically protected FOXP3 expression in the presence of the TCR-signal (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</s><s>Addition of PMA/ionomycin had a similar effect as stimulation with aCD3.</s><s>At the same time, aCD3 and PMA/ionomycin upregulated the expression of miR-182 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>).</s><s>This process was also slightly influenced by TGFb, but without statistical significance.</s><s>Thus, the TCR-signal interferes with FOXP3 induction not only by disturbing STAT5 phosphorylation but also by reducing the expression of FOXO1.</s><s>Because miR-182 regulates FOXO1 (ref.</s><s>43), this effect of the TCR is partially caused by upregulation of miR-182 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>).</s><s>In addition, it likely involves phosphorylation of FOXO1 via ERK and Akt to hinder binding and transcriptional activity of FOXO1 at its own foxo1 promoter.</s><s>The finding that TGFb conserves FOXO1 quantities even in the presence of the TCR signal (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>), represents a third activity of this cytokine to support expression of FOXP3.</s></p><p><s>Active FOXO1 plus STAT5 restore FOXP3 expression.</s><s>We aimed to prove that STAT5 (via PTPN2) and FOXO1 were the decisive mediators of the TCR-induced FOXP3-depleting activity.</s><s>In a first step, we tested if infection with retroviruses, which overexpress phosphorylation-independent and thus constitutively active (CA) forms of STAT5 or FOXO1, might rescue FOXP3 expression in the presence of the TCR-signal and absence of TGFb.</s><s>iTregs were generated as before and were infected with these retroviruses, either separately or combined, or with control viruses.</s><s>Thereafter, cells were re-cultured, as before.</s><s>Data in Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref> demonstrate that, depending on the strength of the TCR signal (reflected by variable amounts of aCD3), only the combination of CA STAT5 and FOXO1 was able to restore FOXP3 expression to a great extent.</s><s>In contrast, CA STAT5 on its own was less active, while FOXO1 alone had no detectable activity, similar as in cells that had been infected with control viruses only.</s><s>This result was confirmed in sorted RFP þ FIR iTreg cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</s><s>The relative frequency of cells infected with none, one or both of the viruses also allowed us once again to confirm that downregulation of FOXP3 was not accompanied by outgrowth of a hypothetical FOXP3 negative cell population (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>).</s><s>Altogether, these data confirm that the above described pathways all merge to control FOXP3 expression by influencing either amount or phosphorylation of FOXO1 and STAT5, respectively.</s></p><p><s>In the next experimental setup, we replaced the retrovirus encoding CA STAT5 in the experimental setup described before by knocking-down PTPN2 via siRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>).</s><s>iTregs were again re-cultured with or without the TCR-signal and lost FOXP3 expression in its presence.</s><s>However, if cells were nucleofected with siRNA, FOXP3 expression was significantly restored even in the presence of the TCR-signal.</s><s>These effects were observed at different concentrations of aCD3 and were again reproduced in sorted RFP þ FIR iTreg cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>) and also, if aCD3 was replaced by PMA (Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>).</s><s>As expected, FOXP3 recovery was not observed if scrambled control siRNA was used.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we wanted to prove that the herein demonstrated TCRmediated pathway is of relevance not only in vitro, but also in vivo.</s><s>To do this, we generated iTregs from OT II T-cells which express a transgenic TCR reactive with ovalbumin

retroviral transduction.</s><s>The gating strategy is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>.</s></p><p><s>When analysing the non-infected ('double negative') cells in all groups of mice, we found that the combination of LPS and OVA led to strong downregulation of FOXP3.</s><s>In contrast, mice injected with LPS or OVA separately, only showed small reductions compared with mice without treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7b</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, we noted a strong cell expansion in the presence of LPS, with or without OVA, while only low numbers of transferred cells were detectable in mice without LPS.</s><s>Their low frequency precluded the acquisition of enough cells simultaneously infected by both viruses ('few events', f.e.), while there were still enough cells infected with either one of the viruses separately.</s><s>With this limitation, it became apparent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7c</ref>) that CA STAT5 was able to restore FOXP3 expression to some extent.</s><s>CA FOXO1 had a small but significant effect only in LPS/OVA-injected mice.</s><s>Coexpression of CA STAT5 and CA FOXO1 totally restored FOXP3 expression in mice injected with LPS/OVA.</s></p><p><s>Because of the strong expansion of cells after LPS application, we wanted to confirm again that our findings were not explained by outgrowth of FOXP3 negative cells.</s><s>We therefore crossed FIR and OT II mice.</s><s>RFP þ FIR/OT II iTreg of these mice were induced, sorted and the above described experiment was repeated; however, the mouse group receiving only OVA was omitted because of limited cell numbers.</s><s>The main findings of the previous in vivo experiment were all confirmed (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>Strong downregulation of FOXP3 was deteced after application of LPS/OVA, while LPS alone had no effect, compared with mice receiving neither LPS nor OVA.</s><s>Again, this downregulation was partly eliminated by separate overexpression of CA STAT5 or CA FOXO1, but fully neutralized by their combined overexpression.</s><s>Together, these experiments prove that the herein described TCR-initiated mechanism responsible for FOXP3 downregulation, also operates in vivo and is not an in vitro artefact.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Despite considerable progress in recent years, treatment of autoimmune diseases remains a challenging task, regardless whether they occur spontaneously or are a collateral damage of treating another disorder, such as during graft-versus-host disease.</s><s>iTregs are an attractive novel therapeutic concept for therapy-resistant autoimmune diseases, because they can be induced in vitro from peripheral blood T-cells, react with a wide range of different antigens and potently suppress effector T-cells.</s><s>However, the stability of iTregs has been a matter of debate, especially after in vivo transfer.</s><s>Several reports have demonstrated that in an inflammatory environment, iTregs may lose FOXP3 expression and turn into harmful inflammatory cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In this report, we provide evidence that in conventional CD4 þ T-cells, FOXP3 expression is under permanent stringent control of the TCR.</s><s>As also reported by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and to our own surprise, the TCR-signal was not necessary for perpetuation of FOXP3 expression, but actually suppressed it continuously.</s><s>Thus, the conditions used to generate iTregs on purpose in vitro, include at the same time signals for reversion of their phenotype.</s><s>Previous reports studying mainly induction and not stability of iTreg in vitro, have demonstrated a FOXP3-suppressive signal mediated via the PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> .</s><s>However, when FOXP3 is not yet expressed, missing positive and active negative signals are much more difficult to be discerned from each other.</s><s>Our experimental setup separates induction and test period and allows us to characterize the nature and potency of the suppressive TCR-signal.</s></p><p><s>Under such experimental conditions, our data show that the known role of TGFb to upregulate foxp3 transcription via the TFs Smad2/3 (ref.</s><s>17), is only one part of its activity.</s><s>Rather, TGFb has the additional role of neutralizing the suppressive TCR-signal, as also found by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>This mechanism serves as a safe-guard to assure that iTreg activity is enhanced only in TGFb-rich conditions which aim at immunosuppression.</s><s>In contrast, during inflammation TGFb cooperates with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 to generate inflammatory Th17 rather than iTreg cells, and FOXP3 is depleted.</s><s>Remarkably, the TCR-counteractive activity of TGFb is in itself a target of IL-6.</s><s>Thus, IL-6 reduces FOXP3 expression not as much by an intrinsic transcriptional activity, but rather by interfering with the interplay of suppressive TCR-signal and its neutralization by TGFb.</s><s>Of course, the interplay between TCR, TGFb and IL-6 is of high relevance for any therapeutic application of iTregs, because IL-6 is primarily present exactly under conditions, in which a therapeutic application of iTregs is attempted, namely during uncontrolled inflammation.</s><s>Therefore, adoptive transfer of in vitro-induced iTregs may turn out to be more harmful than beneficial.</s><s>Thus, it is of prime relevance to better understand the nature of the suppressive TCR-signal in order to potentially influence it for stabilisation of FOXP3.</s></p><p><s>In this report, we show that two TCR-triggered and separate pathways, which influence the mediators FOXO1 and STAT5, respectively, cooperate to suppress FOXP3 expression in response to the TCR-signal.</s><s>The first pathway leads to downregulation of the TF FOXO1, which is known to bind to the foxp3 promoter as well as to CNS2 and to act as an important inducer of foxp3 transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</s><s>Certainly, the decrease in FOXO1 is particularly prominent due to the self-enhancing activity of FOXO1 for its own transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, the TCR-signal raises the presence of miR-182, which as we showed previously, blocks foxo1 transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>The activity of FOXO1 is inhibited by phosphorylation via Akt <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , which explains the above mentioned FOXP3-suppressive activity of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway.</s><s>Independently of Akt, FOXO1 is also phosphorylated by ERK <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>These previous data fit to our results that combined inhibition of ERK and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis partially overcomes the negative TCR-signal for FOXP3 expression.</s><s>We further show that one of the TCR-neutralizing activities of TGFb is to raise expression of FOXO1, probably via its published ability to interfere with the Akt signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In addition to these activities on FOXO1, we find that the TCR-signal also interferes with Tyr-phosphorylation of the TF STAT5, which is essential for foxp3 transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>This interference is not caused by a missing kinase, but rather by overexpression of the phosphatase PTPN2 in response to TCR-signalling.</s><s>Accordingly, a blocker of p-Tyr phosphatases or specific knockdown of PTPN2 but not of other phosphatases re-established STAT5 phosphorylation despite presence of the TCR-signal.</s><s>The decisive roles of STAT5 and FOXO1 during TCR-mediated FOXP3 depletion were confirmed by overexpressing CA and phosphorylation-independent versions of STAT5 and FOXO1, which were able to fully rescue FOXP3 expression even in the presence of the TCR-signal and absence of TGFb.</s><s>We further substantiated the crucial impact of PTPN2 in this process, because by depletion of PTPN2 via knockdown, FOXP3 expression was also partially restored.</s><s>A cartoon summarizing our main findings on iTreg is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to iTreg, nTreg showed unaltered expression of FOXO1 and PTPN2 in response to TCR-triggering, thus potentially explaining, why nTreg are resistant to TCR-mediated FOXP3 suppression.</s></p><p><s>Our data show that the mechanism used by the TCR to suppress FOXP3 expression includes elevations of miR-182 which downregulates foxo1 and of PTPN2 which dephosphorylates STAT5.</s><s>The need for tight regulation of this phosphatase is demonstrated by the early lethality of PTPN2-deficient mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>In accordance with our results, mice with T-cell-specific PTPN2 deficiency harbour increased numbers of Tregs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> , although the mechanism analysed by us was not addressed in that study.</s><s>Despite slightly increased Treg frequencies, these mice suffer from an autoimmune syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> , demonstrating that PTPN2 also controls conventional T-cells.</s><s>In this regard, PTPN2 limits lymphopenia-induced proliferation in conventional T-cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s><s>Of note, another study found reduced frequencies of Treg cells upon T-cell-specific deletion of PTPN2 (ref.</s><s>50).</s><s>The difference between the two studies was explained 50 by the time frame during which the promoters used (CD4 vs Lck) are active.</s><s>In contrast to our work, both studies relate to the primary induction of Tregs, not to their regulation by PTPN2 once they are differentiated.</s><s>In further confirmation of the importance of PTPN2, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human PTPN2 gene are a risk factor for developing autoimmunity, although in that study <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> , reduced PTPN2 levels were for unknown reasons associated with reduced rather than enhanced STAT5 signalling.</s></p><p><s>In addition to mechanistic insights, our data explain, why iTregs may revert to pathogenic effector cells in vivo.</s><s>Accordingly, we have demonstrated also in vivo that the antigen recognized by iTregs leads to downregulation of FOXP3 and that again, this effect can be neutralized by a combination of CA FOXO1 and STAT5.</s><s>As a consequence, treatment of autoimmune diseases with in vitro derived iTregs may not be successful because of limited availability of TGFb at the target organ or to dominant amounts of inflammatory IL-6.</s><s>To maintain iTreg activity, it may be necessary to systemically apply TGFb or other FOXP3 stabilizing components such as retinoic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Alternatively, PTPN2 inhibitors or FOXO1-inducing compounds may be included during the induction
