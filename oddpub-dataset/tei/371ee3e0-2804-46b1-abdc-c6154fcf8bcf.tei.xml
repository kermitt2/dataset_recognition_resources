<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Transgenesis is an essential tool to investigate gene function and to introduce desired characters in laboratory organisms.</s><s>Setting-up transgenesis in non-model organisms is challenging due to the diversity of biological life traits and due to knowledge gaps in genomic information.</s><s>Some procedures will be broadly applicable to many organisms, and others have to be specifically developed for the target species.</s><s>Transgenesis in disease vector mosquitoes has existed since the 2000s but has remained limited by the delicate biology of these insects.</s><s>Here, we report a compilation of the transgenesis tools that we have designed for the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, including new docking strains, convenient transgenesis plasmids, a puromycin resistance selection marker, mosquitoes expressing cre recombinase, and various reporter lines defining the activity of cloned promoters.</s><s>This toolbox contributed to rendering transgenesis routine in this species and is now enabling the development of increasingly refined genetic manipulations such as targeted mutagenesis.</s><s>Some of the reagents and procedures reported here are easily transferable to other nonmodel species, including other disease vector or agricultural pest insects.</s></p></div>

postfeeding.</s><s>In addition, the activity of the Vg promoter inserted at the X1 locus was similar to its expression when inserted on the X chromosome in the FK line.</s><s>Besides the GFP transgenesis marker, FK expresses YFP under control of the Vg promoter.</s><s>Using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis, we showed that reporter expression in these mosquitoes reproduces the expression of endogenous Vg (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1, A-C</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, RNAi experiments showed that key regulatory elements are present in the cloned Vg promoter because, similar to endogenous Vg, YFP expression was repressed by depletion of the NF-kB negative regulator Cactus <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Rono et al. 2010</ref>) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1, D and E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Just as the Lp and Vg promoters provide the possibility to respectively express transgenes in a constitutive and inducible fashion in the fat body, another pair of promoters enables constitutive or inducible expression in the midgut.</s><s>Drosophila Actin5C is midgut-specific in A. gambiae and shows GFP expression at all stages of development (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, I-M).</s><s>In contrast, the A. gambiae midgut-specific G12 promoter that was tested previously in A. stephensi <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Nolan et al. 2011)</ref> shows very low levels of basal expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, N and O) but becomes strongly induced after the blood meal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, P-R).</s><s>Interestingly, in contrast to the mosaic pattern observed in A. stephensi, all midgut cells homogeneously expressed GFP in A. gambiae.</s><s>This makes it an attractive promoter to induce anti-Plasmodium factors in the midgut of transgenic mosquitoes designed to fight malaria.</s></p><p><s>Because many of our ongoing gene engineering experiments rely on the vasa promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Papathanos et al. 2009)</ref> for expression of enzymes in the germ cells, we wanted to ascertain the expression pattern of this promoter when inserted at the X1 docking site.</s><s>For technical simplicity, our recombinant genes are terminated by SV40 terminator sequences rather than by the endogenous vasa 39-UTR, making our constructs distinct from the published ones and giving rise to the possibility of distinct expression patterns due to this change.</s><s>We inserted a vas2-tdTomato-SV40 reporter transgene at the X1 locus.</s><s>Red fluorescence was observed in both male and female gonads during all developmental stages (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, S-Y), similar to the GFP pattern expressed from other genomic locations and with the native vasa 39UTR <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Papathanos et al. 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Like GFP, tdTomato mRNA and/or protein was deposited in oocytes, resulting in strong persistent red fluorescence throughout the body of larvae originating from a transgenic female (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, S and T; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>), even in larvae that had not themselves inherited the transgene.</s><s>In contrast, transmission of the transgene from a male did not result in inherited systemic expression of red fluorescence in nontransgenic larvae (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>In addition to gonadal red fluorescence due to the vasa promoter, some red fluorescence was also observed in larval eyes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that reporter gene expression is also influenced by the neighboring 3xP3 promoter element driving the YFP transgenesis marker, located immediately downstream of the Vas2-tdTomato-SV40 terminator cassette in tandem orientation.</s><s>Thus, the 3xP3 promoter element can act at some distance.</s></p><p><s>We generated additional reporter lines to characterize the expression pattern of antiparasitic genes TEP1, LRIM1, and APL1-C (G.</s><s>Volohonsky and E. <ref type="bibr">Marois., unpublished data)</ref>.</s><s>Collectively, the nine reporter lines show that the X1 docking locus is amenable to the expression of a diverse array of promoter-specific patterns, without obvious leakiness in nontarget tissues other than that due to enhancers incorporated in the construct.</s></p></div>

GFP/YFP, which have been codon-optimized for human) or 6 (Cre recombinase), 26 (phage FC31 integrase), to as high as 126 (yeast Flippase) or 105 (piggyBac transposase), suggesting that the outcome of experiments involving piggyBac transposase may be improved if its coding sequence were codon-optimized.</s></p><p><s>Considering codons less frequent than 10% for a given amino acid, native CSP has a penalty index of 65.</s><s>Codon optimization by the GENEius software resulted in a new penalty of 21.</s><s>The optimized synthetic CSP sequence was inserted into the mosquito genome again under the control of the Vitellogenin (blood meal-induced) or Lipophorin (constitutive and further increased by a blood meal) fat body-specific promoters.</s><s>For each promoter, we prepared a CSP version with and without GPI anchor, replacing the Plasmodium GPI anchoring signal (which may not be recognized as such in mosquitoes) with the GPI anchoring signal of the Drosophila Fasciclin protein.</s><s>All versions were provided with the N-terminal secretion signal of the lipophorin protein (annotated sequence files of each transgene are provided in File S5).</s><s>These four constructs assembled in our CFP-, GFP-, YFP-, and RFP-marked transgenesis vectors were injected simultaneously into 455 embryos of the X1 docking line.</s><s>Approximately 65 of these survived to adulthood.</s><s>Females and males were separated and crossed en masse to wild-type mosquitoes.</s><s>We isolated all four desired transgenic lines from this single round of injections by recovering neonate larvae of each fluorescence color.</s><s>CSP protein from the codon-optimized transgenes could easily be detected in transgenic mosquito tissues and hemolymph using the CSP monoclonal antibody 3D11 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>), indicating that codon optimization was sufficient to convert an inactive gene into an efficiently expressed gene.</s><s>As expected of a functional GPI anchor, directing secreted protein attachment to the outer leaflet of plasma membranes, the GPI-containing versions of CSP remained tightly associated with carcass tissues, whereas the GPIfree version was released more efficiently into hemolymph (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>).</s><s>Subsequent analyses did not reveal any major impact of the transgenically expressed CSP on mosquito fitness, behavior, or susceptibility to the parasite (data not shown).</s><s>Thus, the presence of CSP had no obvious effect on the susceptibility of transgenic mosquitoes to P. berghei, although we cannot rule out the possibility that any CSP activity was abolished by the absence of Plasmodium-specific posttranslational CSP modifications in the mosquito, or by unnatural modifications added by the mosquito translational or secretory machinery onto the transgenic protein.</s><s>Nevertheless, besides the importance of codon optimization, we conclude that the fasciclin GPI-anchoring signal and the lipophorin secretion signal can be used to manipulate the cellular localization of transgenically expressed proteins of interest.</s></p></div>
