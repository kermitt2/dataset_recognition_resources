<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background</head><p><s>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death for gynaecological cancers.</s><s>Its poor prognosis is contingent on various factors: (a) nearly 70% of the concerned women have advanced FIGO stages with extrapelvic metastasis at diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, (b) more than 20% are resistant to chemotherapy, (c) furthermore EOC's molecular complexity makes targeted chemotherapy and potent diagnostic marker difficult to establish, and (d) more than 60% of the patients will relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Currently standard of care is debulking surgery followed by platinum-taxane chemotherapy.</s><s>After surgery the largest diameter of the residual tumour mass is recorded and acts with FIGO stage at diagnosis as the strongest prognostic factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Moreover ascites before surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and the temporal context of debulking surgery and chemotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> have a strong clinical prognostic value as well.</s><s>The ROVAR (Risk Of Ovarian Cancer Relapse) score categorises EOC patients into three risk groups by determining preoperative CA-125, FIGO stage, histological grading, and presence of residual disease at posttreatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and accomplishes a sensitivity and specificity for relapse of 94% and 61%.</s></p><p><s>With the determination of EOC's tumorigenesis and its certain histopathologies and molecular subclassifications the development of specific therapies for the different types of EOC becomes achievable.</s><s>Predictive or prognostic associations with such subgroups might occur as well.</s></p><p><s>Therefore on the one hand powerful diagnostic markers for earlier diagnosis and on the other hand predictive and prognostic markers to dedicate suitable targeted therapies to the patients are needed.</s><s>They can be used to identify the most benefitting therapy management for those women.</s><s>Therefore random tumour markers and markers that have been found upregulated in the environment of EOC are in the focus of research.</s><s>In this study we determined the soluble form of (pro)renin receptor (PRR).</s></p><p><s>The (pro)renin receptor (PRR) has four main functions in the human body.</s><s>Initially the receptor was described by Ludwig et al. in 1998 as a component of V-ATPase and called ATP6M8-9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Later it was discovered by Nguyen et al. in 2002 that linking renin or prorenin to this receptor (a) starts the cascade of tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with the conversion of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I and (b) also initiates intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>In recent studies PRR has been revealed to act as an adaptor protein between V-ATPase and LRP6, which are parts of the Wnt receptor complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Such Wnt cascades are known to affect oncogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> and cardiorenal end-organ damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As there are studies proving that the activity of the RAS is increased in ovarian cancer patients, we decided to investigate also the cascade-starting receptor PRR.</s><s>Such increased activity is characterised by, for example, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1), which has a prognostic role in EOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) which is upregulated in cancer patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The presence of a soluble form (sPRR) makes the receptor more likely to become an easy quantifiable marker.</s><s>It is proved that blocking the AGTR1 with candesartan in vitro and in mice reduces peritoneal carcinomatosis, decreases ascitic VEGF concentration, and prevents angiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore a possible similar impact of sPRR should be investigated.</s></p></div>
