this depth cannot be reached by suitable spectroscopic techniques in other wavelength regions.</s><s>Another important advantage of the NIR diagnostics of tissue tumors, compared to traditional methods, is the measurement flexibility due to the application of fiber-based light guides and probes, which is necessary under clinical conditions (e.g., during a surgery).</s><s>The literature review revealed no data on kidney cancer diagnostics using fiber-based NIR spectroscopy.</s></p><p><s>Recent works have shown that high-resolution NIR spectroscopy can be replaced by optical sensing at a few specific wavelengths optimized for a particular application <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Technical downgrade does not necessarily result in an accuracy loss.</s><s>Inexpensive sensors may perform as well as the respective full-scale spectroscopic techniques, or even better <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>An inevitable loss of accuracy as a result of a much lower sensor resolution is compensated for by excluding less-and non-informative spectral regions (i.e., those containing irrelevant variance and noise) from consideration.</s><s>The resulting simplification of the data and models tends to improve the model's robustness and hence the reliability of a diagnosis.</s></p><p><s>In this study, a new tumor diagnostic sensor based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with emission wavelengths in the region of 900-1500 nm was developed and tested.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, the use of LED-based optical sensing for kidney cancer diagnostics has not yet been reported.</s><s>Two sensor prototypes were implemented and tested for kidney cancer diagnostics using seven pairs each of tumor and normal in vitro clinical samples from different patients.</s><s>Considering the novelty of the presented approach, the main analytical task of this study was to establish the fundamental feasibility of the LED-based optical diagnostics, that is, the sensor's capability to capture cancer-related tissue variances at a few selected wavelengths.</s><s>The measurements on real kidney samples are expected to be helpful for further sensor development.</s></p><p><s>Sensors 2017, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr">1914</ref> 3 of 17</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and Conclusions</head><p><s>LED-based optical sensor technology has already been shown to be suitable for the production of miniaturized chemical sensors and optical diagnostic devices (e.g., pulse oximetry and detection of oral cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>).</s><s>The presented combination of LEDs with simple photodiode detection provides a good alternative to full-sized spectroscopic devices and allows for a fine tuning of the analysis to the requirements of a particular practical task.</s><s>Another method advantage is the possibility of miniaturization, which is especially important in the context of real-time medical diagnostics.</s><s>Distinguishing between tumor and non-tumor tissues using LED-based sensors is a new approach, and much work remains to be done.</s><s>A significant technical simplification of the LED-based sensing, compared to the conventional full-range spectroscopy, should result in a dramatic reduction of the device's purchase and maintenance prices.</s><s>Additionally, LED sensors are portable and do not require the permanent availability of a computer and power supply.</s><s>The appearance of a budget tool for cancer diagnostics, and hence, the growing total number of analyses are expected to have a positive impact on human health worldwide.</s><s>The choice between a spectrometer and an LED-based sensor does not necessarily indicate a trade-off between the analysis price and reliability.</s><s>Using a limited number of wavelengths rather than the full spectrum makes it easier to focus on the most informative signals, therefore avoiding the areas of noise and irrelevant variance.</s><s>This concept is particularly useful for the investigation of complex biological objects.</s></p><p><s>This study provides a proof-of-concept demonstration of the LED-based sensor for tumor discrimination.</s><s>Only four LEDs with emission wavelengths in the NIR range were employed.</s><s>Further dedicated studies are needed to yield the next sensor prototype.</s><s>For example, examinations of various organs, the selection of optimal wavelengths, and data processing methods must be addressed.</s><s>The presented technology of diffuse reflectance NIR sensing for tumor diagnostics can be extended to other tissue and cancer types.</s><s>To provide the optimal sensor performance, the working LED set, that is, the LED number and wavelengths, should be adapted to each case individually to take respective biomarkers and optical properties of the tissue into account.</s><s>The experimental and data analysis approaches suggested here can be used to minimize the number of clinical measurements during the development stage.</s></p><p><s>The main disadvantage of the LED-based sensor in its present form is a very high measurement variance in cancer tissue samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">9</ref>).</s><s>The main requirement for the sensor improvement is therefore to increase the accuracy and specificity of detection, as FN are unacceptable outcomes in oncological diagnostics.</s><s>Although the sensor performance demonstrated by the present prototype should be further improved, the results reported here can be considered as a successful feasibility study of an LED-based NIR sensor for cancer diagnostics aimed at in vivo applications.</s><s>The sensor's general sensitivity to the kidney tumors, illustrated here, provides the necessary motivation for further development of the method.</s></p><p><s>The directions for the further improvement of the sensor are (1) LED number and wavelength optimization, (2) optimization of the measurement conditions (distance, angle, light intensity, spectral reference, probe construction, elimination of environmental effects, etc.), and (3) data processing optimization.</s><s>These improvements represent an important part of the future work.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>NIR spectral and sensor measurements were obtained from unstained cryo biopsies of normal and tumor renal tissue in the Department of Urology at the Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin (Germany).</s><s>Seven pairs each of normal and tumor samples from different patients were investigated after nephrectomy.</s><s>The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>It was approved by the Ethics Committee of Charité, approval number EA1/134/12.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
