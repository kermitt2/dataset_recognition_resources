<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>conditional knockdowns of ATP6AP2 in the nervous system of Drosophila and mouse models.</s><s>In Drosophila, ATP6AP2 knockdown Introduction ATP6AP2 has been associated with cognitive disorders based on a mutation identified in one family with seven affected males presenting with mild-to-moderate intellectual disabilities, delayed motor milestones and speech acquisition, and generalised tonic-clonic seizures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</s><s>However, the implication of ATP6AP2 in intellectual disabilities has been questioned after an ATP6AP2 mutation was identified in a single male within a cohort of 6500 sequenced control exomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>More recently, another family with Parkinsonian features and variably penetrant spasticity was reported to have an ATP6AP2 mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>.</s><s>The mutations identified in these two families are different splicing mutations that give rise to skipping of exon 4 of the ATP6AP2 gene in both cases.</s></p><p><s>ATP6AP2 was described as a receptor for renin and prorenin ((P)RR).</s><s>The binding of renin or (P)RR to the ATP6AP2 extracellular domain activates the renin-angiotensin system, leading to the production of angiotensin II and also to activation of other pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>However, ATP6AP2 is also found in invertebrates such as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, which do not possess the renin-angiotensin system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, suggesting alternative functions for ATP6AP2.</s><s>Indeed, this protein was also isolated as an accessory component of the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>.</s><s>V-ATPase is a multisubunit proton pump that consists of a V0 proton-translocation domain, a V1 pump domain and two associated proteins, Ac45 and ATP6AP2.</s><s>This pump is responsible for the acidification of intracellular and some extracellular compartments and thus is crucial for many fundamental processes that require an intact membrane-trafficking system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, including endocytosis, protein and signalling molecule processing, protein sorting and trafficking, and lysosomal and autophagosomal enzyme activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In agreement with its fundamental role, several studies regarding ATP6AP2 in mouse, zebrafish, frog and Drosophila have shown that its full deletion is lethal (reviewed in 11).</s><s>Moreover, the tissue-specific deletion of Atp6ap2 in mouse cardiomyocytes and podocytes also leads to lethality, as both conditional knockout mice died between 2 and 3 weeks after birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Concomitantly, multivesicular bodies and autophagic vacuoles accumulated in the tissues with deleted Atp6ap2 owing to autophagic flux alterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</s><s>Recent work in the Drosophila wing disc epithelium has demonstrated that ATP6AP2 (VhaM8.9/</s><s>VhaPRR) is required for V-ATPase function in vesicular acidification, endosomal sorting and protein degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, ATP6AP2 was shown to be essential for both of the Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling pathways in Xenopus and Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Whereas Cruciat and collaborators <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> identified Xenopus ATP6AP2/(P)RR as an adaptor between V-ATPase and the Wnt complex, Hermle and collaborators <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> found that its function in proper trafficking of the planar cell polarity molecular core machinery in the Drosophila wing disc is independent of V-ATPase.</s></p><p><s>Surprisingly little is known regarding the function of ATP6AP2 in the nervous system, the tissue type most prominently affected in humans with ATP6AP2 mutations.</s><s>In zebrafish, the absence of ATP6AP2/(P)RR induces necrosis in the central nervous system, eventually resulting in embryonic lethality <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>In Xenopus, ATP6AP2/(P)RR is required for mediating Wnt signalling during early CNS development, including neural patterning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>.</s><s>In mouse, Atp6ap2 regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis via Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/PCP signalling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>Whether ATP6AP2 executes specific roles in postmitotic neurons that can directly underlie impaired cognitive and motor functions in individuals with ATP6AP2 mutations is unclear; however, this question is important in the light of the unclear causative role of this gene in intellectual disabilities (ID) and Parkinsonism with spasticity.</s><s>To decipher the function of ATP6AP2 in behaviour and cognition, we generated and characterized conditional ATP6AP2 knockouts in Drosophila and mouse nervous system models.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Drosophila ATP6AP2 knockdown in the eye causes defective phototaxis and ultrastructural defects, and knockdown in the mushroom body causes defects in short-and long-term memory First, we investigated the Drosophila orthologue of the ID candidate gene ATP6AP2, also termed VhaM8.9/VhaPRR and from here on referred to as ATP6AP2, in a combination of Drosophila phototactic behaviour and morphological studies on the fly eye as primary readouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>We used the UAS-Gal4 system and two independent conditional RNAi constructs, UAS-ATP6AP2 RNAi1 and UAS-ATP6AP2 RNAi2 , to induce ATP6AP2 knockdown in the developing eye with the GMR-Gal4; UAS-Dicer-2 driver.</s><s>The potency of both lines to induce knockdown was confirmed by qPCR (see Materials and Methods).</s><s>Both lines were effective, with UAS-AT-P6AP2 RNAi1 inducing slightly stronger knockdown compared with UAS-ATP6AP2 RNAi2 (Supplementary Material, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>).</s><s>ATP6AP2 eye-specific knockdown did not result in external eye morphology phenotypes (data not shown) but dramatically affected performance in the phototaxis assay.</s><s>Whereas the genetic background control animals were strongly attracted by light [ phototaxis index (PI) = 5.2], the majority of ATP6AP2 eye-specific knockdown animals remained in the first vial, resulting in PIs of merely 2.3 for both RNAi conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and data not shown).</s><s>This finding suggested potential dysfunction of ATP6AP2deficient photoreceptor (PR) neurons.</s><s>To obtain further insights into the cellular basis of these defects, we analysed the structural integrity of PRs by histological semi-and ultrathin sectioning.</s><s>While ATP6AP2-deficient ommatidia and PRs showed overall intact organization, PR-surrounding pigment cells were highly vacuolated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, asterisk).</s><s>Electron microscopy of PRs revealed a large number of accumulated vesicular structures in PR cytoplasm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, arrowheads).</s><s>Interestingly, identical phenotypes, low PI, vacuolated pigment cells and large vesicular structures in PRs were observed upon knockdown of the Drosophila V-ATPase subunit Vha100-1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A-C</ref>, Supplementary Material, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A, 22</ref>), whose homologue, ATP6V0A2, is also

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Here, we investigated the role of ATP6AP2 in the nervous system of two animal models, mouse and Drosophila.</s><s>The identified phenotypes are largely consistent in both organisms and suggest an essential role of ATP6AP2 in nervous system development, basal synaptic transmission and cognitive functions.</s><s>ATP6AP2 was found to play an evolutionarily conserved role in the regulation of spontaneous motor activity.</s><s>MB-specific ATP6AP2 knockdown in Drosophila caused elevated activity in response to stimulation, and mice with Atp6ap2 deletion in glutamatergic neurons exhibited increased spontaneous locomotor and vertical activities in several tests.</s><s>ATP6AP2 is also crucial for short-and long-term memory, as shown in the contexts of Drosophila courtship conditioning and mouse fear conditioning.</s><s>The fear conditioning defect observed in the mouse model could be attributed to the defective hippocampal-to-basolateral amygdala transmission.</s><s>Indeed, the efficiency at hippocampal projections to the basolateral amygdala was shown to be of crucial importance for the aversive conditioned response in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>At the cellular level, ATP6AP2 appears to play a crucial and pleiotropic role at various membrane compartments.</s><s>In neurons, it localized primarily to the ER and to a lesser extent to lysosomes and autophagosomes.</s><s>Its deletion in mouse glutamatergic neurons induced an increase in the number vacuoles in cortical and hippocampal neurons.</s><s>Similarly, its knockdown in Drosophila eye led to vacuolated photoreceptor-surrounding pigment cells and induced ectopic multivesicular body-like membrane compartments in photoreceptor neurons.</s><s>In addition, we observed strong accumulation of two autophagy substrates, p62 and UBQLN2, in the cortex and hippocampus of Atp6ap2 Camk2aCre/0 mice.</s><s>These results suggest a defect in lysosome-mediated protein degradation and, thus, autophagic activity.</s><s>Interestingly, this defect corresponds to the situation observed in the

conditional Atp6ap2 mouse models <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>In Drosophila, Hermle and collaborators (15) also suggested a role for ATP6AP2/(P)RR in protein degradation.</s><s>We propose that one primary function of ATP6AP2 in neurons is to regulate autolysosomal material digestion.</s><s>This hypothesis is supported by the tight physical and functional association of ATP6AP2 with V-ATPase and by the identification of V-ATPase V0 subunit A1 among the down-regulated genes in Atp6ap2 Camk2aCre/0 hippocampi.</s><s>Indeed, the V-ATPase complex is a major element of lysosomes and autolysosomes, where it acidifies the vesicle lumen.</s><s>Vesicle acidification is required for the activation of lysosomal enzymes.</s><s>The absence of Atp6ap2 in glutamatergic neurons may induce a perturbation of V-ATPase function in lysosomes, resulting in defective lysosome acidification and, thus, defective activation of lysosomal enzymes and defective digestion of lysosomal substrates.</s><s>We suggest that this deregulated autophagy induces the axonal and neuronal degeneration observed in the cortex and hippocampus of Atp6ap2 Camk2aCre/0 mice.</s><s>Indeed, neurons, particularly axons, are well known to be highly sensible to autophagy dysregulation, resulting in degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One unexpected finding of this study is the consequence of Atp6ap2 neuronal inactivation on myelin.</s><s>Indeed, Atp6ap2 Camk2aCre/0 mice showed decreased amount of myelin layers and reduction in the total thickness of myelin sheath in the cortex and hippocampus.</s><s>In addition, we identified the enrichment of dysregulated genes expressed predominantly in oligodendrocytes and implicated in regulating myelination.</s><s>Nevertheless, the decreased thickness of the myelin sheath in Atp6ap2 Camk2aCre/0 mice seems to be a secondary effect of Atp6ap2 loss in glutamatergic neurons, and the up-regulation of oligodendrocyte myelination genes may be a compensatory effect of oligodendrocytes to counteract decreased myelination.</s><s>Myelin deficits or defective glial/neuronal interactions have already been found in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> and Rett syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> and in adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>At the synapse level, we demonstrated both morphological and functional aberrations in mouse and Drosophila models.</s><s>In mouse, we observed reduced synapse width in the cortex and hippocampus of Atp6ap2 Camk2aCre/0 mice with synapse splitting.</s><s>Similarly, pan-neuronal ATP6AP2 knockdown in Drosophila led to a reduction in presynaptic terminal size, with abnormal organization of boutons and an increased number of satellite boutons.</s><s>We also observed defects in subsynaptic organization, including the presence of atypically elongated vesicles in the mouse cortical and hippocampal presynaptic compartments and abnormal active zones in presynaptic terminals of Drosophila NMJs.</s><s>These converging data suggest a role for ATP6AP2 in synaptic vesicle homeostasis, which is in agreement with a close functional relationship of ATP6AP2 with V-ATPase and its role in synaptic vesicle acidification.</s><s>V-ATPase is required for synaptic vesicles loading with neurotransmitters <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the V0 domain of V-ATPase is part of a complex involved in the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane and thus participates in the regulation of neurotransmitter release <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</s><s>Poea-Guyon and collaborators (41) also proposed that V-ATPase, as a sensor of intravesicular pH, informs the exocytosis machinery of the contents of synaptic vesicles to avoid exocytosis of unloaded vesicles.</s><s>The absence of ATP6AP2 could perturb V-ATPase function in synaptic vesicles and thus disturb synaptic vesicle loading and/or fusion.</s><s>In addition to morphological alteration, we also provided evidence for defective synaptic transmission.</s><s>In Drosophila, ATP6AP2 knockdown in photoreceptor neurons caused synaptic transmission defects.</s><s>In mouse, we showed a decreased release probability of excitatory synapses at the hippocampal to basolateral amygdala connections.</s><s>However, the reduced presynaptic release probability could also be partly explained by the reduced number of excited fibres owing to axonal degeneration.</s><s>Altogether, our results confirm an important role for ATP6AP2 in regulating synaptic size, connections and synaptic vesicles, with consequences for presynaptic transmission.</s></p><p><s>One family with ATP6AP2 mutation was reported to have epilepsy, hence, we tested the mouse model for epilepsy susceptibility.</s><s>We did not observed spontaneous epilepsy in Atp6ap2 Camk2aCre/0 mice and mutant mice even had reduced susceptibility to epilepsy induced by PTZ administration.</s><s>In our mouse model, Atp6ap2 is deleted only in Camk2a-positive neurons, i.e. excitatory neurons, but not in inhibitory neurons.</s><s>Thus, considering the important role of inhibitory neurons in preventing epilepsy, we cannot exclude that the absence of epilepsy could be due to the absence of Atp6ap2 deletion in the inhibitory neurons.</s></p><p><s>Transcriptome analysis of Atp6ap2 Camk2aCre/0 hippocampi revealed up-regulated genes related to myelination, motor behaviour and action potential regulation and down-regulated genes implicated in membrane-bound vesicles, showing a striking correlation with the behavioural and physiological phenotypes observed in mouse and fly.</s><s>This finding suggests that some of the observed phenotypes could be linked to aberrant signalling converging onto transcription.</s><s>The effects of Atp6ap2 deletion on transcription regulation may be direct or indirect.</s><s>Atp6ap2 deletion could have indirect effect on gene transcription as suggested for the transcriptional changes observed in genes implicated in myelination mainly expressed in oligodendrocyte; however, this deletion could also affect transcriptional responses directly, e.g.</s><s>via the Wnt signalling pathway or the MAP kinases ERK1/2

behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s><s>ATP6AP2, also known as ( pro)renin receptor, is also involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).</s><s>Activation of ATP6AP2 by (

pathways (including the MAP kinases ERK1/2 pathway) and another resulting in direct activation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 pathway and the promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger transcription factor (PLZF)
