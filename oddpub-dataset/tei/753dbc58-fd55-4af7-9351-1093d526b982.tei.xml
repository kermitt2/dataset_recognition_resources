however, the mechanisms in live cell membranes remain elusive.</s><s>The living cell membrane comprises heterogeneous lipids.</s><s>The binding of volatile anesthetics to membrane lipids is closely related to the partition coefficient between anesthetics and lipid molecules.</s><s>Therefore, the distribution of volatile anesthetics in the biomembrane is predicted to be heterogeneous.</s><s>We hypothesized that the heterogeneous distribution of anesthetic molecules in living membranes would result in heterogeneous changes in membrane fluidity.</s></p><p><s>To verify this hypothesis, we investigated the fluidity of marker proteins in the cell membrane using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).</s><s>HaloTag-fused transferrin receptor (TfR) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor protein, representative markers proteins in the cell membrane, were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and neural cells.</s><s>These cells were exposed to isoflurane (ISO), a volatile anesthetic generally used in clinical medicine, and were analyzed using FRAP to ascertain whether ISO induced heterogeneous changes in fluidity.</s><s>We also used midazolam (MDZ), a general anesthetic, water-soluble benzodiazepine agonist.</s><s>Unlike volatile anesthetics that act on multiple sites in the cell, MDZ specifically binds to the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA A ) receptor.</s><s>Hence, MDZ was predicted to induce minimal changes in membrane fluidity.</s></p><p><s>Because volatile anesthetics are easily vaporized at room temperature, we closely monitored the aqueous concentration of ISO during the experiment using GC/ MS.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment of cells with isoflurane and midazolam</head><p><s>To investigate the effect of anesthetic drugs on cell membrane fluidity, we analyzed the lateral diffusion of fluorescence-labeled membrane molecules in the presence of anesthetic drugs using FRAP.</s><s>FRAP is a method used to analyze the fluidity of target molecules in living cells using a confocal fluorescence microscope.</s><s>We studied the frequently used anesthetic drugs ISO, a volatile anesthetic drug generally used in clinical medicine with an unknown detailed mechanism of action, and MDZ, a benzodiazepine agonist (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>).</s><s>To analyze cell membrane fluidity, TfR fused to HaloTag protein was used as a membrane molecule.</s><s>This was transiently expressed in cells and then allowed to bind to Alexa FluorÒ 488, a ligand of HaloTag (Alexa488-TfR).</s><s>Cells were treated for 30 min with 1 mM ISO and 60 lM MDZ, the optimal blood concentrations for the clinical use of these anesthetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, and then observed under a fluorescence microscope.</s><s>Microscopic analysis showed neither significant morphological changes nor cell death under the conditions used (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>).</s><s>We selected cells with no morphological changes following drug treatment for FRAP analysis.</s></p><p><s>In addition, dose of 0.5-2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC; ED50 concentration of volatile anesthetics) is necessary for surgical anesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> this study was 0.51 mM <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it can be assumed that 1 mM ISO (2 MAC) is clinically relevant.</s><s>We attempted a similar study with 2.5 mM ISO (data not shown).</s><s>However, as remarkable changes were observed in the cell membrane morphology at this concentration, FRAP analysis was not performed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes in cell membrane fluidity after anesthetic drug treatment</head><p><s>We analyzed cell membrane fluidity of Alexa488-TfR by FRAP for 60 s after anesthetic drug treatment.</s><s>Membrane fluidity measured using FRAP can be explained by two parameters: half-time to recovery (t 1/2 ) and mobile fraction (M f ).</s><s>The t 1/2 is a time constant and is an indicator of the velocity of the moving fluorescence molecules.</s><s>On the other hand, M f is the fluorescence recovery rate in ROI and indicates the number of mobile components.</s><s>The results obtained by FRAP indicated that MDZ-treated HEK293T cells were not different compared with the control, whereas ISO-treated cells showed a significant decrease in t 1/2 , indicating an increase in membrane fluidity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A,  B</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, we analyzed isolated neural cells using the same FRAP procedure and also found that the t 1/2 of the neural cells decreased significantly, as observed in HEK293T cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C,D</ref>).</s><s>In HEK293T cells, M f increased significantly; however, it decreased in neural cells but not significantly.</s><s>Furthermore, to investigate whether these changes could occur in other membrane proteins, the same study was conducted using Alexa-488-GPI.</s><s>However, there were no significant changes in either t 1/2 or M f values after anesthetic drug treatment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>).</s><s>Thus, ISO affects the membrane fluidity of transmembrane proteins in living cells.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantification of isoflurane in culture media</head><p><s>Because ISO is a volatile molecule and cells were treated with 1 mM saturated ISO solution for 30 min prior to FRAP analysis, it was necessary to confirm that the concentration of ISO in the aqueous phase did not change during the experiment.</s><s>We prepared eight individual chambers containing various concentrations of ISO solution used in the study.</s><s>The ISO concentration in each chamber was measured using GC/MS immediately prior to incubation and again after a 30-min incubation.</s><s>The saturated concentration of neat ISO, which was theoretically 15 mM, was measured as 13 mM in the chamber, and the concentration was unchanged after 30 min.</s><s>Furthermore, the measured concentration of the 1 mM ISO solution (diluted in DMEM) stayed the same in the chamber after 30 min; therefore, it was confirmed that the chamber contained appropriate concentrations of ISO.</s><s>Residual quantities of ISO in 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100% ISO solutions in the culture medium were measured over time by GC/MS and are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Isoflurane is a halogenated hydrocarbon.</s><s>It does not have a specific binding receptor, and its mechanism of action as an anesthetic is unknown; however, a report using artificial lipid membranes showed that it is distributed at the lipid-water interface and weakens the membrane structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</s><s>ISO enters the lipid membrane of bacteriorhodopsin and acts on the hydrophobic sites of membrane proteins and lipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>MDZ, like ISO, is a drug that is clinically used for general anesthesia, and is a benzodiazepine with sedative and antispasmodic actions.</s><s>Its site of action is the GABA A receptor.</s></p><p><s>We treated living cells with ISO and MDZ and performed FRAP analysis, a method used for live cell imaging, to observe the dynamics of the GPI anchor and fluorescence-labeled TfR.</s><s>We found no significant changes in the MDZ group compared with the control group.</s><s>Because MDZ acts by binding directly to the GABA A receptor, it is believed that it has little effect not only on lipid membranes but also on the GPI protein TfR.</s><s>Therefore, it is reasonable that no significant difference was observed in the liquidity of Alexa488-GPI or Alexa488-TfR compared with the control group.</s><s>On the other hand, in the ISO group, the fluidity of Alexa488-GPI did not change, but that of Alex-a488-TfR did.</s><s>It has suggested that GPI-anchored proteins and TfRs exist in different domains on the cell membrane, and ISO may have acted heterologously on these domains.</s><s>And biochemically, although it is reported that GPI exists in raft domain and TfR exists in nonraft domain, we think that it is difficult to evaluate this difference by FRAP analysis.</s><s>We assume that at least the volatile anesthetic ISO has a marked influence on the fluidity of the transmembrane protein rather than the membrane lipids.</s><s>Furthermore, it is also important to consider the influence of the cytoskeleton and its supporting proteins as factors regulating the movement of transmembrane proteins.</s><s>In particular, the cytoskeleton is thought to limit the diffusion of transmembrane proteins by constructing an actin mesh structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Lenne et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> showed that treatment of COS-7 cells with latrunculin B and cytochalasin D, inhibiting actin polymerization, alleviated restricted transferrin motility brought about by the cytoskeletal network structure.</s><s>At the same time, they reported that GPI-anchored proteins were less sensitive to site skeleton agonists (polymerization inhibitors and polymerization stabilizers) than TfR.</s></p><p><s>A study of nerve cell experiments using volatile anesthetics showed that ISO disturbs the structural stability of the actin cytoskeleton (structural destabilization), inhibits elongation of hippocampal dendritic spines <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, and inhibits the development of immature astrocytes and neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>.</s><s>All of these effects (mainly morphological changes) depend on the anesthetic dose, exposure time, and intracellular actin distribution (dendritic spines are rich in actin).</s><s>Because the cytoskeleton takes various forms depending on the cell type, the cause of the difference in M f change between HEK293T and neural cells observed in our study may be due to characteristics of the cytoskeleton in each cell.</s><s>In other words, differences in the sensitivity of various cells to ISO may be attributed to the differences in the cytoskeleton between cells.</s><s>Although the primary cultured cells were used only on the 10th day in this study, the level and composition of sphingolipids in neural cells changes greatly as the cells mature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, and therefore, membrane fluidity in response to ISO at each stage of differentiation may vary.</s><s>Age-and organ-dependent differences in anesthesia susceptibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> may be due to differences in membrane fluidity as a result of differences in sphingolipid composition.</s><s>And considering the effects of actin skeleton and sphingolipid composition on the plasma membrane, the difference in time constant of lateral diffusion of Alexa488-TfR (t 1/2 of HEK293T: 12 s; and t 1/2 of neural cells: 3 s) may be an indicator of anesthetic efficacy.</s><s>Further verification using other cells is required.</s><s>On the other hand, the change in liquidity shown using artificial membranes was &lt; 1°in terms of change with temperature; therefore, we cannot conclusively state that the change in lipid bilayer fluidity is a key mechanism of anesthesia.</s><s>Following a change in cell membrane fluidity, we would expect an amplification mechanism to ultimately achieve whole-body anesthesia.</s><s>Several reports suggest that lateral diffusion of receptor proteins influences signal transduction.</s><s>Using quantum dots, Bannai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> showed that the GABA A receptor that accumulates in the postsynaptic membrane in association with Ca influx (excitatory nerve activity) into the cell via the Nnitrosodimethylamine (NMDA) receptor becomes easy to move on the cell membrane, and the number of receptors decreases with deviation inside the synapse.</s><s>A decrease in the number of GABA A receptors within the synapse causes attenuation of inhibitory neurotransmission.</s><s>On the contrary, it was reported that the metabotropic glutamate receptorphospholipase C-to-inositol trisphosphate receptor signaling pathway is necessary for the accumulation and stable maintenance of GABA A receptors on synapses.</s><s>In addition, Suzuki et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref> reported that a temporary pause of about 0.5 s is necessary for the CD59 cluster, diffusing on the cell membrane, to transmit an intracellular signal.</s><s>These findings suggest that when a signal is transferred into the cell, it is necessary for the receptor to remain on the cell membrane for a certain period of time.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, by increasing the fluidity of the membrane receptor protein, ISO is able to inhibit signal transduction.</s><s>Because signal transduction involves multiple steps and maintains a balanced state, it is very difficult to identify the multiple active sites affected by volatile anesthetics in each system.</s><s>The present study only evaluated the liquidity of GPI and TfR, and future studies are required to investigate changes in liquidity on exposure to anesthetics, with a focus on anesthetic-related receptors such as GABA A , NMDA, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our findings suggest that ISO is an anesthetic agent that affects the mobility of transmembrane protein molecules.</s><s>This study is the first to use live cells to examine the mechanism of action of volatile anesthetics on cell membranes and membrane proteins in detail.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>.
