<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a significant health problem, and add significantly to the cost of drug development.</s><s>Immune mediated adverse drug reactions (IM-ADRs) are amongst the most difficult to predict.</s><s>Recently, an increasing number of studies have implicated specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles with various IM-ADRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>This is exemplified by the strong association between the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor abacavir and a drug hypersensitivity syndrome in individuals carrying HLA-B Ã 57:01, with a 55% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Our group and others have proposed the altered repertoire hypothesis to explain abacavir-induced hypersensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In an earlier study, we were able to illustrate that abacavir interacts with residues in the F-pocket of HLA-B Ã 57:01 which are typically in contact with the side chain of the C-terminal residue of the bound peptide.</s><s>This results in an alteration of the specificity of HLA-B Ã 57:01 for self-peptides, and a corresponding presentation of de-novo self-peptides with much higher affinities in the presence of the drug <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The assays performed to study the effect of abacavir on HLA binding could be utilized to screen other drugs for potential effects on the self-peptide repertoire.</s><s>This would provide a potential in vitro screening strategy to identify drugs at highest risk of causing IM-ADRs in vivo when used in human donors that express the affected HLA molecules.</s><s>Such an in vitro screen would be of high value in the early phases of drug development as a typical phase I or II clinical trial would be underpowered to ensure that every known (or even every common) HLA molecule is represented at sufficient frequency, particularly taking into account the incomplete positive predictive value of any HLA allele for a specific IM-ADR.</s><s>Thus severe HLA associated IM-ADRs are often only detected when a drug comes into broad use and significant investment has already been made.</s></p><p><s>We have established two in vitro assays that are potentially suited to screen whether a drug can alter the repertoire of HLA-bound self-peptides.</s><s>The first is a purified HLA binding assay, which can be used together with a positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries (PSCPL) approach to measure changes in the peptide-binding specificity in the presence or absence of the drug in question.</s><s>The second is a peptide elution assay performed on single HLA allele transfected cell lines performed in the presence and absence of the drug directly identifying the effects on the selfpeptide repertoire <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>For these assays to become useful in practice, it is necessary to establish what distinguishes a safe drug from a drug that can induce a treatment-limiting IM-ADR.</s><s>In this study, we have used in silico approaches to identify drugs on the market that have structural similarities to abacavir and performed in vitro binding and elution experiments to test whether these drugs can alter the repertoire of HLA-B Ã 57:01 in a manner similar to abacavir.</s><s>By comparing the safety profile of these drugs with the detected effect on HLA binding, we propose a strategy to identify and test a preliminary threshold for effects on HLA binding that can be considered safe.</s></p></div>

drugs for similar effects.</s><s>To assess if there is indeed a correlation between clinical safety and the readouts of these assays, we here examined drugs with established clinical safety profiles that are structurally similar to abacavir.</s><s>Of the panel of drugs tested, we found that acyclovir had the strongest effect and did alter the binding specificity and ligand repertoire of HLA-B Ã 57:01 in a qualitatively similar fashion as abacavir, although quantitatively to a much lower degree.</s><s>Similar to abacavir, acyclovir is a guanosine analogue currently used as an antiviral agent.</s><s>Acyclovir, however, has a robust safety record with almost 30 years of post-marketing experience, unlike abacavir has not been associated with any treatment limiting IM-ADRs except for isolated case reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the changes induced by acyclovir to the binding specificity and ligand repertoire of HLA-B Ã 57:01 are not in themselves sufficient to trigger IM-ADRs.</s></p><p><s>Quantitatively, the presence of acyclovir led to 2-3 fold increases in binding affinity as measured by IC50 and to the presentation of a single peptide that was clearly absent in untreated cells.</s><s>In contrast, abacavir led to 1,000 fold increases in IC50 values for individual peptides and large numbers of peptides presented exclusively in the presence of the drug (such as 15 peptides with a C-terminal valine).</s><s>Given the safety profile of acyclovir, we suggest that effects of the magnitude observed here are below the threshold of what can be considered safe in terms of induction of an altered peptide repertoire based IM-ADR.</s><s>Thus, this study establishes a first estimate of a threshold of what can be considered a safe in the assays utilized here.</s></p><p><s>Based on our binding studies, one could have expected that peptides with a C-terminal Cysteine would preferentially be presented and eluted in the presence of acyclovir.</s><s>However, peptides with c-terminal cysteine residues are poor substrates for both proteasomal cleavage and TAP binding, and are found at low frequencies in peptide elution studies (e.g.</s><s>2/935 = 0.03%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Given the small effect of acyclovir, we were not surprised that it did not overcome this barrier to presentation.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the binding and elution assays, we also performed cell culture studies in which we examined if we can induce drug responsive T-cells in HLA-B Ã 57:01 + PBMCs cultures from abacavir naive healthy individuals.</s><s>These studies suggest that abacavir, but not acyclovir, can induce drug response T cells after a two-week culture.</s><s>Such cell culture assays have the advantage of requiring less specialized instrumentation and reagents compared to the radioimmuno binding assay or the mass spectrometry coupled elution experiments.</s></p><p><s>One limitation of our study was that, in the absence of identifying a drug that showed strong abacavir-like effects, we cannot say for certain that the structure based drug selection strategy applied was successful.</s><s>Future studies will examine if different selection strategies or screening compounds at a large scale might have identified drugs with similar or larger effects than acyclovir.</s><s>Furthermore, most drugs that were predicted to have structural similarity to abacavir showed no effect in our binding assays.</s><s>Given that we are unable to measure direct binding of the drugs to HLA, we cannot know if these results are due to the drugs not binding to HLA-B57:01.</s><s>We do consider such lack of binding the most likely hypothesis given the rather constrained binding site of abacavir in the crystal structure, which could mean that even similar drugs are too different from abacavir to fit into the specific site.</s><s>More importantly, we consider such lack of binding to be a more likely explanation compared to the alternative hypothesis that the drugs do bind to HLA-B57:01 but do not alter the binding specificity of the molecule, which seems structurally unlikely given the fact C-terminal peptide residue side chains do overlap with the site occupied by abacavir.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we have here compared different in vitro readouts that could be potential indicators of HLA-associated IM-ADRs.</s><s>Notably, the clinically safe drug acyclovir which is structurally very similar to abacavir showed qualitative evidence of interaction with HLA-B Ã 57:01 but little or no quantitative or functional effect.</s><s>We suggest that these in vitro approaches show great promise as a pre-clinical screening strategy if they can be developed further to establish safety thresholds that can be validated with high sensitivity and specificity to predict altered self-repertoire mediated IM-ADRs.</s></p></div>
