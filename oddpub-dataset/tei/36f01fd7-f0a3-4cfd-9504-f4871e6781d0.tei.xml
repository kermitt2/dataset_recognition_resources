<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>During infection, replacement of the standard proteasome (sp) by increased formation of the immunoproteasome (ip) with its catalytic subunits LMP2/β1i, MECL-1/β2i and LMP7/β5i represents a cellular mechanism to modulate proteasome activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to this regulation in target cells of cytokine signalling, the ip is highly abundant in cells of hematopoietic origin including professional antigen presenting cells like dendritic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Likewise, a variety of studies have demonstrated that the ip quantitatively modifies proteasomal cleavage preferences and enhances the generation of a significant number of antigenic peptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</s><s>PA28 is an IFN-γ-induced 11S regulator complex of proteasome cleavage capability that was initially also connected to improved MHC class I antigen processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Two homologous subunits-PA28α (REGα or PSME1) and PA28β (REGβ or PSME2)-form a ring-shaped (180 kDa), heteroheptameric complex by the association of three PA28α and four PA28β subunits <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</s><s>PA28 binds to either one or both ends of the 20S proteasome in an ATP-independent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, it forms a larger complex with PA700 single-capped 20S proteasome complexes resulting in PA700-20S-PA28 particles also referred to as hybrid proteasome <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The original observation leading to the identification of PA28 was its capacity to stimulate substantially the peptidase activity of all active sites of the proteasome <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>.</s><s>Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying PA28 function are still unclear, several lines of evidence indicate allosteric modification of the 20S proteasome active sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, stimulation of peptide entry into the complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>, stimulation of peptide exit <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref> and mediating the binding of the proteasome to components of the endoplasmic reticulum <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Crystallographic studies of yeast 20S proteasomes associated with PA26 (the PA28 homologue in T. acidophilum) demonstrated that binding of PA26 facilitates access to the channel in the proteasome αring <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> through which peptide substrates enter into the proteolytic complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and products are released <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>A quantitative analysis on the rates of protein substrate hydrolysis revealed that PA28-20S particles hydrolyze proteins at identical rates compared to 20S proteasomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Based on peptide product analysis, Cascio et al. lately proposed a molecular model where PA28 acts as a selective sieve that controls the exit of products from proteasomes based on size and sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>.</s><s>Such a model is consistent with the biochemical properties of the hybrid proteasome.</s><s>Degradation assays performed with several denatured proteins showed no effect of PA28 complex formation with PA700-20S proteasome particles on the overall rate of protein degradation.</s><s>Although the pattern of peptide products was different, the mean size of peptide products was similar between PA700-20S-PA28 and PA700-20S proteasomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The observation that PA28-containing proteasomes generate a highly divergent pattern of peptide products might be relevant under certain pathophysiological conditions.</s><s>The increased abundance of PA28-20S ip particles in IFN-γ treated mammalian cells suggests a contribution of this proteasome complex to improved MHC class I antigen processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Althoughexperimental data demonstrated facilitated antigen processing by ip particles in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>, mice lacking PA28 complexes had no defects on CD8 T cell responses during infection with Influenza virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, as shown for the Tyrosinase-related protein (TRP) 2-derived melanoma tumor antigen TRP2 181-188 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, PA28 has the capability to modulate the generation of MHC class I epitopes also in vivo.</s><s>Apart from being involved in antigen processing, PA28 has general protective functions under conditions of altered redox homeostasis.</s><s>The Wang laboratory provided data for an anti-oxidative function of the PA28 complex specifically in cardiomyocytes, all being in line with previous reports by other groups on PA28-20S proteasome complex-dependent proteolysis irrespective of ubiquitin/ubiquitination <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>PA28 is important for cell fate determination in embryonic stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and was connected to reduced obesity-induced ER-stress and insulin resistance in the liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our previous studies, we reported on increased formation of ip complexes in heart tissue during viral myocarditis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>.</s><s>Substantial in vitro evidence was provided for facilitated antigen processing by such ip particles during CVB3 infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref> and ablation of LMP7 in mice resulted in aggravated myocardial inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> putatively involving ip-dependent pentraxin3 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, the abundance and function of IFN-γ-inducible PA28α/β complexes is still enigmatic during viral myocarditis.</s><s>In this study, we tackled the question whether and how PA28 might regulate ubiquitin-proteasome function during CVB3 infection.</s><s>Given that the precise molecular mechanism for the protective function of the ip in cells of the immune system remains to be determined, we also investigated the nature of PA28-20S proteasome and PA28-20S-PA700 hybrid proteasome formation in the context of either standard or immune-20S proteasome core complex expression.</s></p></div>

also been reported earlier for the capacity of the ip regarding MHC class I antigen presentation during CVB3 infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to unaltered CD8 + T cell responses found in mice with impaired ip function during CVB3 infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, the ip is well-known to efficiently facilitate antigen presentation in other infection models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Taken into account that CVB3 elicits weak, presumably immuno-subdominant CD8 + T cell responses with unknown in vivo significance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59]</ref>, the mouse model of CVB3 infection might not be optimally suited for concluding on a general biological role both of PA28α/β and the ip for MHC class I antigen presentation.</s></p><p><s>According to in vitro data, the PA700-20S ip degrades unfolded proteins at a 10-fold higher rate than 20S ip and PA28-20S-PA28 ip complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, PA700-20S ip represents presumably the most potent form of an immunoproteasome in terms of generating potentially immunogenic peptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, differences in cleavage efficiency are attributed to changes in substrate gating <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> due to the association of PA700 with 20S particles.</s><s>There is also substantial experimental evidence indicating accelerated protein turnover mediated by de novo formation of PA700-20S ip compared to their PA700-20S sp counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>.</s><s>The underlying molecular mechanisms for such effects are still poorly understood.</s><s>The biological impact of altered peptide hydrolysis as a consequence of replacing the catalytic active sites in the sp with respective immunosubunits of the ip was investigated in LMP7 -/mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>, and thereby the influence of PA28α/β has not been addressed.</s><s>We demonstrate in this study that PA28α/β associates both with 20S sp and 20S ip as well as with PA700-20S sp and PA700-20S ip particles, respectively.</s><s>Together with the differential biological impact found during CVB3 myocarditis in LMP7 -/mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>, we conclude that PA700 binding to 20S proteasomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> as well as formation of ip are biologically relevant ways to alter proteasome function.</s><s>PA28α/β, however, is able to modulate total proteostasis in cells but is most likely a redundant component of the UPS during the pathogenesis of CVB3-induced acute myocarditis in C57BL/6 mice.</s><s>Mice on this genetic background are resistant to the development of severe acute myocarditis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> and this resistance is tightly connected to an efficient type I IFN response <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60]</ref> with a minor role of adaptive cellular immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, there is also the opportunity that mice on another genetic background with higher susceptibility to CVB3 infection might reveal an alternative in vivo function of PA28α/β during viral myocarditis that could possibly also reflect the in vitro findings of this study.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"

a significant decrease of cellular proteasome activity (Fig 2A).</s><s>As the abundance of PA28α/β levels is directly affected by CVB3 infection, we decided to circumvent viral infection experiments and address PA28 function by using polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) that mimics double-stranded viral RNA replication intermediates and binds to TLR3 receptors.</s><s>After day 8 of CVB3 infection, both inflammatory monocytes and macrophages represent the most frequently detected types of immune cells in heart tissue [unpublished observation].</s><s>To address the question whether in these cells PA28 is involved in controlling redox and protein homeostasis during infection, we examined polyI:Ctreated bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM) 24 and 48 hours after TLR3-stimulation.</s><s>This treatment resulted in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Fig 2B) and consequently in protein oxidation that was slightly more induced in BMMs derived from PA28α/β -/mice in comparison to cells from wild-type mice (Fig 2C).</s><s>In line with this observation, PA28α/β deficiency in BMMs resulted in a slight increase of the overall level of
