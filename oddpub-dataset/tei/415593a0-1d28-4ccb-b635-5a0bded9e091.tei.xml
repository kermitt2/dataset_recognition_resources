<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Using data from the phase III studies for CIU, we sought to compare the efficacy, safety, and time to loss of response of omalizumab in patients with different background therapy.</s><s>Despite differences in background therapy between studies, including triple therapy (H 1 -antihistamines, H 2 -antagonists, and LTRAs), we observed similar treatment effect sizes across multiple endpoints.</s><s>This suggests that background therapies in patients with refractory disease do not affect response to omalizumab (ie, patients with more intense background therapy respond at the same level as those with less intense background treatment).</s></p><p><s>At baseline, mean DLQI scores were higher (ie, worse healthrelated quality of life [HRQoL]) than those observed in patients with atopic dermatitis, moderate to severe psoriasis, or psoriatic arthritis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref> which indicated considerable impact of CIU/CSU symptoms on HRQoL.</s><s>Consistent treatment effects for omalizumab 300 mg versus placebo were observed across multiple efficacy endpoints in patients receiving different background therapies for CIU/CSU.</s><s>After 12 weeks of treatment with omalizumab 300 mg, more than half of patients had well-controlled symptoms (UAS7 6) and more than one third were completely itch-and hive-free (UAS7 ¼ 0).</s></p><p><s>The European/World Allergy Organization (EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO) published guidelines for the management of CIU/CSU suggest that omalizumab should be used as the third line of therapy (ie, on top of increased dosage up to 4-fold of modern second generation antihistamines) in the algorithm of treatment of urticaria (strong recommendation/high level evidence). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s>However, the US published guidelines for the management of CIU/CSU suggest that omalizumab should be used as the fourth step of therapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref></s><s>Yet, there are limited to no robust clinical data that demonstrate incremental response rates for therapies other than omalizumab after using step 2 therapies.</s><s>Whether or not omalizumab should also be considered as a thirdstep treatment in the United States (after up-dosing of second generation H 1 -antihistamines) remains to be determined.</s><s>A systematic review of omalizumab in patients with CIU determined that the 300 mg dose has the most compelling data supporting its use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>The more recently published omalizumab phase III results, including this pooled analysis, will likely be of importance to include in such assessments.</s></p><p><s>There were few serious AEs and the rate of serious AEs was lower in the omalizumab 300-mg group than in the placebo group.</s><s>With the exception of urticaria-specific AEs, the most common AEs were consistent with those known for omalizumab in allergic asthma with no instances of anaphylaxis.</s><s>Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity.</s><s>Taken together with the efficacy results, the totality of the data suggests a favorable benefitrisk profile for omalizumab in the treatment of CIU.</s></p><p><s>The loss of response after discontinuation of therapy was similar despite the length of treatment received by the patient, which suggested that disease modification does not occur at these treatment durations.</s><s>Rebound did not occur following omalizumab discontinuation.</s><s>The return of symptoms on a consistent basis highlights the need for more prolonged therapy and a continued unmet need in this population of patients for disease modification.</s><s>Treatment with omalizumab offers a fast onset of relief from symptoms for many patients with difficult-to-manage symptoms, yet the nature of the disease requires treatments that can reduce symptomatology on a chronic basis.</s><s>Although efficacy over a 6month treatment period has been demonstrated, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> further studies that evaluate long-term treatment with omalizumab in CIU/CSU are needed to examine benefits with chronic therapy.</s></p><p><s>On a practical level, the population of patients in the GLACIAL study, in which patients were taking multiple concomitant therapies for CIU/CSU, may be more reflective of patients with H 1 -antihistamine-refractory CIU/CSU encountered in clinical practice.</s><s>These patients with refractory symptoms continued the background therapies once they entered the trial and demonstrated similar responses to omalizumab as patients receiving less intense background treatment (ie, approved doses of H 1 -antihistamines) indicating that the response to omalizumab is not appreciably influenced by background therapies.</s></p><p><s>Because the placebo-controlled period in the ASTERIA II study was 12 weeks, the current pooled analyses were limited to evaluating changes up to week 12.</s><s>However, 2 of the 3 studies, ASTERIA I 9 and GLACIAL, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> also provide safety and efficacy information for the longer treatment period of 24 weeks.</s><s>Additional studies in real-world populations will provide additional information on the efficacy and safety of omalizumab.</s><s>One limitation of the UAS7 is that noneurticaria-related itch is captured and this may result in underestimation of the rate of complete response (ie, UAS7 ¼ 0) to omalizumab.</s><s>The analyses were based on clinical studies with strict eligibility criteria, and, thus, the results may not be generalizable to all patients encountered in clinical practice.</s><s>The indirect comparisons across different studies and the post hoc nature of the analyses are further limitations of note.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the findings from this post hoc analysis indicate that omalizumab 300 mg had similar efficacy in CIU/CSU patients regardless of the background therapy for urticaria used in the trials, and the safety profile in CIU was generally similar to that in allergic asthma.</s><s>There was no evidence of dose-related safety issues.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
