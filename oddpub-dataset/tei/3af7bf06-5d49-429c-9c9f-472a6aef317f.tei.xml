expression (RT-PCR) and protein expression (Western Blot) confirmed successful differentiation of B-13 cells to hepatic B-13/H cells in the bioreactor culture system.</s><s>The expression of hepatocyte-specific markers previously described for B-13/H 2D cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> were maintained at both the mRNA and protein

B-13/HT and B-13/ HP to primary hepatocytes.</s><s>Expression of albumin and CPS-1 proteins was also detected, though in low levels.</s><s>CPS-1 is an important enzyme involved in the urea cycle and its expression in B-13/HT and B-13/HP on gene and protein levels further confirms urea production via the urea cycle.</s><s>However it cannot be excluded that part of the observed urea release is produced via hydrolysis of arginine by arginase as described for human liver cell line C3A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>mmunohistochemical staining showed the formation of 3D cell clusters in bioreactor cultures and confirmed the hepatic differentiation of B-13 cells in the 3D bioreactor culture system in that there was a loss in expression of amylase and an increase in hepatocyte-specific markers.</s><s>CYP2E1 and albumin expression confirmed the results of gene expression and Western blot analysis.</s><s>In addition, cells positive for CK18, a marker for liver epithelial cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> as well as expression of MRP2, a major canalicular transporter responsible for biliary elimination of drugs in hepatocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> indicate a liver-like phenotype of B-13/H cells in the bioreactor cultures.</s><s>Further, activation of CEBP-β shows the involvement of this transcription factor in generating liver-like tissue, according to results from other studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Significant improvement of hepatic differentiation in 3D as compared with 2D cultures could not be demonstrated in our study.</s><s>However some liver markers, i.e.</s><s>CPS-1 and albumin, while showing lower expression in suspension cultures than in 2D cultures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>), showed at least equal expression in bioreactor cultures of pre-differentiated (B-13/HP) or trans-differentiated (B-13/HT) cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</s><s>In both 2D and 3D culture systems B-13/H cells do not attain the functionality of native hepatocytes.</s><s>Improvement of this cell line may need further genetic modification.</s><s>For example expression of metabolically functional human CYP1A2 was achieved by introducing the corresponding gene into the cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>n conclusion, the studies show successful hepatic transdifferentiation of B-13 cells as well as stable maintenance of B-13/H cells over two weeks in the bioreactor.</s><s>B-13 cells are cost-effective and can be generated in high amounts, which makes the cells an attractive source for larger scale in vitro studies.</s></p></div>
