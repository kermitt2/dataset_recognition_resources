<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Neuroblastoma is the most common deadly solid tumor of infancy, and accounts for 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>rimary tumors derive from precursor cells of the sympathetic nervous system along the sympathetic chain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Neuroblastoma most frequently arises in the adrenal, but also develops from the superior cervical or celiac ganglia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>The most prominent genetic marker of high-stage disease is amplification of the MYCN oncogene, which occurs in 20-25% of all neuroblastomas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Mouse models for human neuroblastoma can be helpful to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and serve as important tools for preclinical studies.</s><s>Weiss et al. has previously demonstrated that MYCN has the potential to drive murine neuroblastoma in a transgenic model, in which MYCN expression is driven by a rat tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>Transgenic mice expressing MYCN in the abdominal ganglia developed neuroblastoma.</s><s>Although representing an excellent and broadly used tool, some limitations exist: (i) the transgene integration site and its genomic context is ill-defined, potentially resulting in less robust MYCN expression, (ii) tumors predominantly originate from abdominal ganglion structures, thus resembling only a subset of human neuroblastoma, (iii) no intrinsic option for in vivo tumor imaging is included and (iv) tumor incidence of heterozygous TH-MYCN mice is 70% in the 129 × 1/SvJ strain background, but only 5% in C57Bl6/N background, reducing the potential for combination with other cancer-relevant alleles.</s><s>We aimed to overcome these limitations by developing a novel mouse model with targeted Cre-conditional MYCN expression in the neural crest.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Characterization of LSL-MYCN mice LSL-MYCN transgenic mice were viable and fertile without obvious physiological or morphological phenotypes.</s><s>Offspring resulting from breeding LSL-MYCN mice with wild-type mice were born according to the expected Mendelian ratio (data not shown).</s><s>We next confirmed the molecular integration site and localization of the transgene.</s><s>Representative examples of PCR analyses validating transgene integration in heterozygous and homozygous LSL-MYCN mice are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>.</s><s>PCR analyses validating the presence of a wild-type allele at the ROSA26 locus in wild-type and heterozygous LSL-MYCN mice are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Targeted expression of MYCN in the neural crest causes abdominal tumor formation in double-transgenic LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice Double-transgenic LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice developed palpable abdominal tumors with an incidence of 76% in a mixed C57/Bl6/129 × 1/SvJ strain background (n = 38).</s><s>Tumor onset was detectable between 26-337 days of age, and the mean age at tumor onset was 79.6 days (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly prolonged tumor-free survival of mice heterozygous for TH-MYCN compared with LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice (P = 0.001; Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Of note, none of the single transgenic LSL-MYCN or Dbh-iCre mice developed a tumor (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>); P o0.0001.</s><s>Cre-mediated recombination in tumors, but not in control tissue from LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice was validated using B1 and B2 primers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>In the presence of the transcriptional termination site, a 2241-bp band was present in control tissue, whereas Cre-mediated excision of the transcriptional termination site upstream of the MYCN allele was indicated by the presence of a 703-bp band (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Tumor localization, histology and expression of marker genes in LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice recapitulate the patterns of human neuroblastoma In vivo bioluminescence imaging (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>) revealed that tumors in LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice arose from the superior cervical ganglion (I), the adrenals (I, II, III) or the celiac ganglion (III).</s><s>Several tumors were shown to originate from adrenal structures using high-frequency ultrasound imaging (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d and e</ref>).</s><s>Macroscopic images acquired during dissection of mice carrying palpable tumors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>) also confirmed that tumors arose from both adrenals and the celiac ganglion (left) and from the superior cervical ganglion (right).</s><s>Tumors had elevated expression of both MYCN mRNA and protein compared with normal tissues (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a and b</ref>).</s><s>Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histological tumor sections and electron microscopy showed a small round blue cell tumor with cells harboring neurosecretory vesicles (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c and d</ref>), indicative of neuroblastoma.</s><s>Furthermore, tumors strongly expressed the neuroblastoma-specific marker genes, dopamine β-hydroxylase (Dbh), tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) and paired-like homeobox 2b (Phox2b), as observed by quantitative PCR (qPCR; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>The neural cell adhesion molecule, Ncam1, a marker for neuroendocrine tissues, was strongly expressed in tumors from LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>).</s><s>Expression of tyrosine hydroxylase was also confirmed on the protein level (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>).</s><s>To analyze early or even premalignant stages of neuroblastoma development in our mouse model, we collected adrenals for histological examinations at day of birth, at days 14 and 28 of life (Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-c</ref>).</s><s>Hyperplastic cells were present in the adrenal medulla of some, but not all, of adrenal glands from 0-day-old transgenic mice and most 14-and 28-day-old transgenic mice.</s><s>Especially at day 28, the adrenal medulla of LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice had an atypical, nodal tissue architecture.</s><s>In contrast, no hyperplasia was observed in adrenal glands from control mice of any age.</s><s>The observed hyperplasia is in line with the hyperplastic lesions (in superior cervical ganglia) previously described in TH-MYCN mice by Hansford et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Taken together, we demonstrate that LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice develop neuroblastomas that arise from the adrenal medulla and other neural crest derivatives.</s></p><p><s>Murine MYCN-driven neuroblastomas are characterized by genomic aberrations syntenic to human neuroblastomas An overview of all genomic aberrations detected in tumors from heterozygous LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice compared with tail DNA is depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>.</s><s>A partial gain of murine chromosome 11q was detected in the tumors of four mice (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a and c</ref>).</s><s>This region is syntenic to human chromosome 17 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>), for which gain or partial gain (17q) occurs in the majority of human neuroblastomas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>Five tumors exhibited gain of the entire murine chromosome 6 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>), which is partially syntenic to human chromosomes 7p, 7q and 12p.</s><s>In human neuroblastomas, gain of an entire chromosome 7 occurs in 40% of tumors and appears to be prevalent in all tumor stages, whereas gain of 7q, observed in 12% of human tumors, is more common in higher stage tumors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>Three tumors harbored a gain of the entire mouse chromosome 12, which is syntenic to human chromosome 2p and includes the MYCN locus, as well as human chromosome 14q and parts of human chromosome 7p and 7q (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>).</s><s>Eight tumors displayed gain of the entire chromosome 3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>), which is partially syntenic to human chromosome 1q, a region often gained in human neuroblastomas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>Interestingly, two tumors showed a focal gain on chromosome 6 that encompassed the ROSA26 locus, in which the human MYCN transgene was integrated (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a and b</ref>).</s><s>This focal gain resulted in a 20-to 25-fold increase in MYCN transgene copy number in these two tumors, as measured by qPCR (inset Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, the two tumors containing this aberration had elevated expression of the human MYCN mRNA (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>), as assessed by reverse transcription-qPCR.</s></p><p><s>No chromosomal deletions and only few focal deletions were observed in the tumors from heterozygous LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mice.</s><s>The region on murine chromosome 8 that was lost in two murine tumors, which is syntenic to human chromosome 4, does not harbor any annotated genes (data not shown).</s><s>Each of the remaining focal losses were only observed in one
