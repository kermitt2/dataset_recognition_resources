<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The aim of the study was to estimate the incidence and prevalence of SLE in Alberta, Canada.</s><s>It used multiple population-based data sources including the Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan Central Stakeholder Registry (AHCIP CSR), Fee-For-Service, and Hospital Discharge Abstract Database.</s><s>A prevalence of 47.99 per 100,000 (male = 13.5, female = 83.2) of SLE was observed for the year 2000, and has increased to 90 (male = 25.5, female = 156.7)</s><s>per 100,000 population in 2015.</s><s>This study was compared with a population-based study conducted in the First Nations populations of Alberta <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>We observed the prevalence of 2.73 cases per 100,000 female and 0.32 cases per 100,000 male in the First Nations populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The prevalence rate of SLE in the First Nations of Population was lower than the   current study.</s><s>This may be because the prevalence of SLE was estimated only from 6% of the Alberta populations who were ≥ 45 years.</s><s>Approximately, a similar prevalence of SLE (42.3/100,000) to the current study was also reported in the Firth Nations population in Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The prevalence in the current study was compared to studies conducted in United Kingdom (UK) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and the United States of America (USA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The data sources used for the Birmingham, UK study were the lupus patient support group, and hospital inpatient and laboratory data and notification by attending and the primary care physician.</s><s>The prevalence rate of SLE (27.7/100,000) in Birmingham was approximately half of the prevalence rate in Alberta, Canada.</s><s>On the other hand, the prevalence rates of SLE in California (107.6/100,000) and Pennsylvania (149.5/100,000) were two times higher than this current study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The cause of the dramatic differences in prevalence of SLE between countries may be due to the methodology issues such as the size and type of sample used for data collection.</s><s>For example, the current study was based on population of all age groups; this is because patients in Canada have no financial barriers to accessing healthcare, as they have in the United States.</s><s>In addition, the environmental factors such as drugs, physical or mental stress, and air pollution may contribute to the high number of people with SLE in some countries.</s><s>For example, the potential cause of SLE cases in Alberta could be air pollution, nitrogen dioxide and systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study is the first of its kind in Alberta to report the overall incidence rate of SLE using a population-based data collected between 2000 and 2015.</s><s>The overall incidence of SLE for all ages in Alberta was 5.39/100,000.</s><s>This observed incidence rate of SLE was compared to the most recent studies carried out in Spain <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and Iceland <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The incidence rate of SLE (2.15/100,000) in Spain was lower than in Alberta.</s><s>Similar to this, the incidence rate of SLE in Iceland was estimated at 3.3/100,000, again this is lower than the present study.</s><s>The possible factor for the differences in the incidence estimate between these studies could be the availability of cases of SLE to be used as a data source.</s><s>For example, some milder cases of SLE may never present to hospital or be just treated as anaemia with skin rash by physicians.</s></p><p><s>Observation of the peak incidence rate of SLE in the current study for both female (21.75/100,000) and male (7.68/100,000) at the ages of 70-74, and 75-79 was made, respectively.</s><s>Contrary to our study, the peak incidence rate of SLE in females in Birmingham, UK was reported between the ages of 18 and 19 years and a similar finding in the USA suggested the peak incidence rate of SLE was between the ages of 15 and 44 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>However, studies from Nottingham, Sweden and Iceland have reported that the peak incidence rate was similar to that observed in current study which was between the ages of 40-49, 40-50 and 55-74, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Reasons for discrepancies in reported peak incidence of SLE in different countries, could be explained by patient characteristics (age, race and socioeconomic) they consider in their study.</s></p><p><s>There are some strengths and limitations to this study.</s><s>The strengths to this study include the data being population based, recall bias was not an issue, any misclassification errors on the side of providing conservative estimates, and it is the first of its kind to estimate the incidence of SLE in Alberta.</s><s>One of the limitations of the study is that our prevalence and incidence estimate were based on use of health services; the impact of this is that we may have misclassified or estimated cases of SLE.</s><s>This study was also limited in taking account of the geographic distribution of cases.</s><s>Further, we do not have any data on deaths attributable to SLE, as a result this could not be included.</s><s>Individuals that died, for any reason, were removed from prevalence estimates.</s><s>Future research may include looking at the geographic distribution of cases to better assess potential environmental influences, direct health care costs, and pharmaceutical use.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>This study has estimated the prevalence and incidence of SLE in Alberta based on multiple population-based data sources.</s><s>It is the first of its kind to estimate for both male and female in all age groups of population.</s><s>Despite the stable incidence of SLE, the present study confirms that the prevalence of SLE has increased over the 16-year period.</s><s>The increase in prevalence of SLE in Alberta will have an impact on health service utilizations.</s><s>This finding can, therefore, be used for planning and evaluating health services for this group of patients.</s><s>Future research may include looking at geographic distribution of cases, direct health care costs, and pharmaceutical use of SLE.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 Fig. 2</head><label>12</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.1The prevalence of SLE for male and female by age for the year 2000</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
