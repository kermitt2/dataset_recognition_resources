<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endothelial Glycocalyx in Normal Capillaries</head><p><s>To confirm the surface structure of normal pulmonary capillaries, ultrastructural analysis was first performed by using scanning electron microscopic and TEM imaging without lanthanum nitrate staining (  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1B4</ref>).</s><s>To confirm that these structures were in fact endothelial glycocalyx, the backscattered electron method with scanning electron microscopic imaging was used (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A5</ref>).</s><s>The detected backscattered high-energy electrons that rebounded from the sample surface indicated the presence of metals in the sample.</s><s>Moreover, the location of backscattered electrons was consistent with the moss-like structure, indicating that it was the endothelial glycocalyx stained with lanthanum nitrate.</s><s>Because the endothelial cells were coated with endothelial glycocalyx, their surface was not seen directly.</s><s>The occupancy of the endothelial glycocalyx area inside the lumen area of the pulmonary capillaries was 3.7 AE 0.6%.</s><s>To quantitatively analyze the glycocalyx, plasma levels of syndecan-1, a component of glycocalyx and a marker of glycocalyx injury, were measured.</s><s>We found that plasma syndecan-1 levels were significantly higher in LPS-injected mice than in sham mice.</s><s>The levels had significantly increased by 6 h following LPS injection and had reached a peak by 24 h.</s><s>By 48 h following LPS injection, however, plasma syndecan-1 levels had returned to baseline (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To further assess for endothelial injury, plasma thrombomodulin concentrations were examined.</s><s>Thrombomodulin is an integral membrane protein expressed on the surface of healthy endothelial cells and serves as a cofactor for thrombin; it is released from the endothelium under endothelial injury condition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>The concentration of plasma thrombomodulin levels significantly increased 92.2 AE 5.0 ng/mL 6 h following LPS injection and 134.8 AE 14.1 ng/mL 24 h following injection compared with baseline (10.8 AE 0.9 ng/mL) (Fig 2C <ref type="figure">)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>ARDS is characterized by increased numbers of neutrophils within the lung and increased capillary permeability, leading to pulmonary edema and, as a result, to decreased pulmonary gas exchange. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>To quantitatively analyze blood vessel permeability, the extravasation of Evans blue was measured.</s><s>Three hours following treatment, the amount of extravasated Evans blue was significantly higher in LPS-injected mice than in the sham mice.</s><s>The level of extravasation reached a peak about 6 h following administration of LPS and then gradually declined (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>).</s><s>This finding suggests that LPS increases the permeability of pulmonary capillaries and that the endothelial injury peaks approximately 6 h following administration of LPS.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Because syndecan-1 is released from endothelial cells into the circulation upon endothelial injury, we anticipated that its levels would be decreased within damaged lungs.</s><s>Consistent with that idea, plasma syndecan-1 levels were significantly increased 12 h and 24 h following injection (6.8 AE 1.7 ng/mL and 15.9 AE 2.0 ng/mL, respectively) compared with baseline (0.9 AE 0.4 ng/mL; P ¼ .03</s><s>and .001)</s><s>(Figs 3D <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">, 3E</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present study describes the three-dimensional glycocalyx structure of pulmonary capillaries.</s><s>In a previous report, the percentage of glycocalyx varied in different capillary structures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>The present study showed that the glycocalyx of pulmonary capillaries is at the low end of the range compared with that of the heart and kidney. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>1]<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> The pulmonary circulation is a low-pressure system (ie, a low fluid shear stress system) compared with cardiovascular and renovascular circulation.</s><s>Because the fluid share stress on the pulmonary capillary wall is lower than on capillaries of the heart and kidney, it is believed that the pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx is thinner than in the heart and kidney.</s></p><p><s>Sepsis commonly progresses to ARDS, an inflammatory lung disease with high morbidity.</s><s>ARDS is precipitated by an influx of neutrophils, causing acute inflammation and resulting in interstitial edema, loss of surfactant, and diffuse alveolar damage.</s><s>This scenario in turn leads to  reduced lung compliance and impaired gas exchange.</s><s>An earlier report suggested that degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx contributes to the pathogenesis of ARDS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Consistent with that idea, the present threedimensional images revealed exacerbated pulmonary vascular permeability and peeling away of the endothelial glycocalyx from endothelial cells following injection of LPS.</s><s>The high mortality raises concern for a survival bias in the data collected from the mice at later time points.</s><s>Therefore, we also examined a lower dose sepsis model in which 10 mg/kg of LPS was injected.</s><s>Forty-eight hours following LPS administration, 17 of the 20 injected mice (85%) were still alive.</s><s>In this model, we confirmed endothelial glycocalyx injuries 48 h following LPS administration in scanning electron microscopic and TEM imaging (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>LPS induces release of tumor necrosis factor, which activates neutrophils and increases their expression of adhesion molecule E-selectin.</s><s>The activated neutrophils then bind to injured endothelial cells and extravasate, leading to inflammation and organ dysfunction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>In the present study, we were able to directly visualize the extravasating neutrophils with the use of scanning electron microscopic images.</s></p><p><s>Synthesis of glycocalyx is complicated, involving multiple enzymatic pathways and factors regulating its shedding, including local pH and mechanical stimuli. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>Syndecan-1 is the core protein in heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which comprises glycocalyx.</s><s>Syndecan-1 is released from the endothelium upon injury to the glycocalyx, causing its concentration in the circulation to increase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>We observed that plasma syndecan-1 levels were increased and tissue syndecan-1 was decreased following LPS injection, which is consistent with earlier reports. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>owever, it was unclear how the endothelial glycocalyx was injured under stressful conditions such as sepsis.</s></p><p><s>We observed numerous spherical structures within vessels following LPS administration.</s><s>These structures were smaller than RBCs and had a single-membrane structure, not the double-membrane characteristic of exosomes; in addition, these spheres contained glycocalyx.</s><s>Because they were even detected in the specimens without lanthanum nitrate staining, they must contain elements from endothelial cells as well as glycocalyx.</s><s>This scenario suggests endothelial glycocalyx breaks off from endothelial cells together with a portion of the endothelial plasma membrane to form spherical bodies inside the capillaries.</s><s>Although many of these structures were detected approximately 6 h following LPS administration, their numbers had decreased by 12 h following LPS administration.</s><s>Apparently, these spherical structures exist for only a short period following endothelial injury, and their significance is not yet known.</s></p><p><s>A previous report showed that the shedding of glycocalyx and release of syndecans into the circulation may serve an adaptive function by limiting the inflammatory damage through structural rearrangement of endothelial cells and the loosening of intercellular junctions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>These spherical structures may have something to do with the structural rearrangement of endothelial cells under septic conditions.</s><s>However, additional study is needed to clarify the precise mechanism by which they are formed and their function.</s></p><p><s>The present study also showed that the endothelial glycocalyx layer returns to normal with resolution of injury.</s><s>The result is that the endothelial glycocalyx is recovered in a short period of time.</s><s>However, it is still unknown whether the recovery is of the endothelial cell disorder itself or a turnover of endothelial cells.</s><s>Further study is therefore required.</s></p><p><s>Syndecan-1 has been used as a marker for glycocalyx injury in several clinical reports. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>It was recently reported that measurement of syndecan-1 levels in patients with sepsis might be useful for identifying those at high risk of organ dysfunction and mortality as well as those who could benefit from therapies targeted at protecting or restoring the glycocalyx. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>herefore, it is surmised that glycocalyx injuries have a relation with human disease.</s><s>Systemic inflammation such as sepsis causes endothelial glycocalyx injuries, fluid leakage from capillaries, and impairment of fluid drainage from the lungs.</s><s>Fluid accumulation in the lungs and decreased surfactant production cause whole air sacs to collapse.</s><s>The collapse of the air sacs and small airways interferes with the process of normal gas exchange.</s><s>Therefore, if glycocalyx disruption could be prevented, ARDS might be attenuated through inhibition of these phenomena.</s><s>The control of endothelial glycocalyx has the potential to mediate a positive therapeutic effect.</s></p></div>
