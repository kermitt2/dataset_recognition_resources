<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: There exist many methods for describing the complex relation between changes of gene expression in molecular pathways or gene ontologies under different experimental conditions.</s><s>Among them, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis seems to be one of the most commonly used (over 10,000 citations).</s><s>An important parameter, which could affect the final result, is the choice of a metric for the ranking of genes.</s><s>Applying a default ranking metric may lead to poor results.</s><s>Methods and results: In this work 28 benchmark data sets were used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positive rate of gene set analysis for 16 different ranking metrics including new proposals.</s><s>Furthermore, the robustness of the chosen methods to sample size was tested.</s><s>Using k-means clustering algorithm a group of four metrics with the highest performance in terms of overall sensitivity, overall false positive rate and computational load was established i.e. absolute value of Moderated Welch Test statistic, Minimum Significant Difference, absolute value of Signal-To-Noise ratio and Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler test statistic.</s><s>In case of false positive rate estimation, all selected ranking metrics were robust with respect to sample size.</s><s>In case of sensitivity, the absolute value of Moderated Welch Test statistic and absolute value of Signal-To-Noise ratio gave stable results, while Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler and Minimum Significant Difference showed better results for larger sample size.</s><s>Finally, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method with all tested ranking metrics was parallelised and implemented in MATLAB, and is available at https://github.com/ZAEDPolSl/MrGSEA.</s><s>Conclusions: Choosing a ranking metric in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis has critical impact on results of pathway enrichment analysis.</s><s>The absolute value of Moderated Welch Test has the best overall sensitivity and Minimum Significant Difference has the best overall specificity of gene set analysis.</s><s>When the number of non-normally distributed genes is high, using Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler test statistic gives better outcomes.</s><s>Also, it finds more enriched pathways than other tested metrics, which may induce new biological discoveries.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>of the cases.</s><s>To overcome these problems, the second generation of gene set analysis methods was proposed in 2003 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and they are known as Functional Class Sorting (FCS).</s><s>Those methods use information about all analysed genes and sort them according to some metric.</s><s>The information from gene ranks is further transformed to pathway level (this process is specific to each algorithm) and statistical significance of each gene set is established.</s><s>Nevertheless, gene sets are analysed independently (like in ORA), and direction of gene regulation according to biological knowledge is not incorporated.</s><s>In literature several FCS methods were proposed, e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, CAMERA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, PLAGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and GSEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>In parallel the third generation of methods (Pathway Topology (PT)-based approaches) was developed in 2004 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In their structure these methods are similar to FCS, but they use pathway topology to compute gene-level statistics.</s><s>In this group methods like NetGSEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, CePa <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> or hybrid approach EnrichmentBrowser <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> were proposed.</s><s>Even though the third generation methods seem to be the most consistent with the complexity of molecular level biology, they also have some limitations.</s><s>The main one is that true pathway topology depends on cell cycle phase, cell types or specific conditions, but this information is nowadays rarely available.</s><s>Additionally, they require much larger computational resources.</s></p><p><s>Despite drawbacks mentioned above, first and second generations methods are still commonly used.</s><s>Among them, GSEA method seems to be the most popular with over 10,000 citations of original articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in Google Scholar (over 1,000 citations only in 2016).</s><s>Researchers apply this procedure to a variety of genomic studies, including large non-coding RNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, microRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> or system biology of complex diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>GSEA was constructed for analysis of gene expression data, however, there are extensions of the algorithm dedicated to deal with single nucleotide polymorphism data e.g.</s><s>GSEA-SNP <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, MAGENTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and i-GSEA4GWAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> or RNA-sequencing data e.g.</s><s>SeqGSEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The first implementation of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis algorithm was created in Java by the authors of the original concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The biggest advantage of the application is a user friendly interface, a couple of different ranking methods and an access to gene set resources from Broad Institute.</s><s>The same functionalities are provided in R package named GSEA-P-R.</s><s>Recently, new implementations appeared.</s><s>In rapidGSEA software suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> they proposed two tools for permutationbased GSEA using parallel computations on CUDA designated GPUs (cudaGSEA) or multi-core CPUs (ompGSEA).</s><s>They introduced a simple gene ranking metric by calculating the local deviations.</s><s>In both implementations it is not possible to use other gene ranking metrics.</s></p><p><s>The GSEA procedure is commonly used by the Javabased application <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, where the main parameter which needs to be set and can affect the final result is a choice of the ranking metric that measures the level of difference in gene expression between phenotypes.</s><s>In the standard Java-based application basic metrics are implemented e.g.: signal-to-noise ratio (S2N), ratio of average expression from two classes (Ratio), T-test statistic (T-test), or the Pearson correlation coefficient for quantitative studies.</s><s>However, researchers used also other gene ranking metrics e.g.</s><s>logarithm transformed p-value from t-test <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the Gaussian z-value corresponding to the one-sided pvalue from the Welch t-test <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, Significance Analysis of Microarray <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>New ranking metrics were used in combination with the pre-ranked GSEA procedure, where gene permutation is performed to obtain the enrichment score distribution.</s><s>However, this type of permutation is not recommended, because it lose gene-gene correlation, so the phenotype sampling is more appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, we present a complex comparison of multiple ranking metrics for GSEA, including ones implemented in standard Java application and novel metrics, that were successfully applied in feature selection of highthroughput data.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of tested ranking metrics, we propose two unique, statistically justified measures which are created by modification of those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The proposed measures are accompanied by computational time, and can be used in any other comparison study.</s><s>Until now, there have been few studies where ranking metrics in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, however here we use a variety of ranks with powerful phenotype permutation, a large collection of data sets and statistical quality measures of gene set analysis.</s><s>Finally, we have implemented GSEA method in MATLAB and named it MrGSEA (MATLAB metric GSEA -https://github.com/ZAEDPolSl/MrGSEA).</s><s>The implementation includes all tested ranking metrics and leaves the possibility to implement new ranking metrics with the most powerful phenotype permutation.</s><s>Additionally, the implementation has parallel computing capabilities.</s><s>All of this can refine and extend the existing Java-based solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> or CUDA-based solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene set enrichment analysis method</head><p><s>The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method proposed by Subramanian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> remains one of the most popular method used for testing possible dis-regulations in pathways (gene sets) due to differences in expression of genes between analysed experimental conditions.</s><s>It has been categorised as a second-generation method, competitive with sample randomisation (more details on the tested hypothesis are available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>).</s><s>The general idea of GSEA method is to test whether the distribution of genes (according to an established ranking metric) in the gene set differs from a uniform distribution, using a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic.</s><s>To establish interesting gene sets the Enrichment Score is calculated as a maximum deviation from zero between hits of genes g into gene set S marked as P hit (Eq. 1) and genes g outside gene set S marked as P miss (Eq.</s><s>2):</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P hit (S, i) = g j ∈ S j ≤ i |r j | N R</formula><p><s>(1)</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P miss (S, i) = g j / ∈ S j ≤ i 1 (N − N H ) (2)</formula><p><s>where N R is a sum of absolute values of ranking metrics for all genes in gene set S, N H is a gene set size, N is a total number of analysed genes and r is a value of ranking metric, representing how strong is the difference in gene expression between experimental groups.</s><s>The i and j are indicators of the position in the sorted list of gene ranks.</s><s>The significance of an observed enrichment score is assessed by a permutation test.</s><s>In GSEA method two types of permutations can be performed: by sample or by gene labels.</s><s>Since only the sample permutation type allows to keep gene correlation structure, which is recommended <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, only this approach is considered in the presented work.</s><s>Finally, to adjust estimated enrichment score for variation in gene set size, the normalised enrichment score is calculated.</s><s>In this study, p-value of normalised enrichment score is used as a measure of pathway enrichment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ranking metrics</head><p><s>We compared 16 ranking metrics divided into two groups.</s></p><p><s>Detailed formulae for all tested metrics are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</s><s>The first group consists of metrics available in standard GSEA Java-based application <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>: signal-tonoise ratio (S2N; the default measure in GSEA), absolute value of signal-to-noise ratio (|S2N|), difference of expression means between classes (Difference), ratio of expression means of two classes (Ratio), log 2 of Ratio (log 2 (Ratio)), and T-test statistic (T-test).</s><s>The second group consists of ranking metrics originating from the field of feature selection and frequently applied for discovery of differentially expressed genes in high-throughput biological experiments.</s><s>First two metrics are based on Moderated Welch Test statistic (MWT and its absolute value, |MWT|), calculated using weighted pooled and unpooled standard errors in the t-test procedure and adjusted by estimation of the gene-level variance across genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Next two ranking metrics use non-parametric test statistics: the Sum of Ranks (SoR) and Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler test statistic (BWS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Both have been used in GSEA before <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to other methods, these metrics make no assumption about the distribution of gene expression data.</s><s>The SoR is based on the sum of ranks for genes belonging to a particular experimental class.</s><s>The BWS test is based on the squared value of the difference between two empirical distribution functions weighted by the respective variance and approximated by average of B statistics for each class.</s><s>Neuhäuser showed that BWS gives a more accurate Type I error control and more power compared to the Wilcoxon test <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Two further metrics are derived from ReliefF algorithm, which for each gene assess a weight (from 1 as the best to -1 as the worst).</s><s>The weight represents the best separation between classes based on nearest neighbor distance estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>To each weight, the tied rank is assigned as a second ReliefF-based metric (ReliefF ranked).</s><s>Also, the weighted average difference method (WAD) and its absolute value (|WAD|) were included.</s><s>According to the authors, WAD gives better sensitivity and specificity in identifying differentially expressed genes and more stable top-rank genes list compared to standard mean difference or fold change <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Second to last of tested ranking metric is the fold change rank ordering statistics (FCROS), which is based on a truncated mean calculated from the matrix of fold changes from pairwise comparison between sample groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, we used the Minimum Significant Difference (MSD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> that is defined as the signed distance of the confidence interval (CI) of the logarithm of fold change (logFC) estimate from no change (zero).</s><s>This can be interpreted as the most pessimistic estimate of logFC which is still within the 95% CI.</s><s>A value of MSD metric shows that in 95% of the cases the log fold change will have at least this magnitude.</s><s>Negative value of MSD indicates that logFC of zero is within the CI.</s><s>Although, our implementation of MSD is parametric, in general the calculation of CI can be achieved in non-parametric framework.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation</head><p><s>The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method was implemented using 64-bit MATLAB R2016a programming environment.</s><s>All ranking metrics tested in the publication are available.</s><s>There is a possibility to use the external ranking metric method by applying an intrinsic MATLAB function.</s><s>For every ranking metric the software calculates the p-value corresponding to a difference in expression between phenotypes by use of permutation test.</s><s>The Enrichment Score distribution can be estimated by permutation of gene labels or phenotypes.</s><s>Additionally, there is a function to create a custom gene set database from an Excel file containing genes grouped into gene sets.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">BWS B1+B2 2 ; B 1 = 1 n1 n1 j=1 R j 1 − n 2 +n 1 n 1 j 2 j (n 1 +1) 1− j (n 1 +1) n 2 (n 2 +n 1 ) n 1 [31, 36] B 2 = 1 n2 n2 i=1 R i 2 − n 2 +n 1 n 2 i 2 i (n2+1) 1− i (n 2 +1) n 1 (n 2 +n 1 ) n 2 ReliefF W − K k=1 D(x,h k ) tK + c =class(x) P(c) 1−P(class(x)) K k=1 D(x,m k ) tK</formula><p><s>and tied rank <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> Results of the enrichment analysis are stored as MATLAB variables, in Excel files and as PNG images.</s></p><p><s>The algorithm was parallelised using the idea of replicated workers.</s><s>Due to the nature of the GSEA method, each thread calculates the enrichment score and its distribution for different gene sets independently.</s><s>Since the number of genes in each gene set is different, which cause divergent computational time, this solution provides the fastest results.</s><s>The number of tasks performed in parallel depends on the number of available processor cores and MATLAB software license (maximum 12 threads with Parallel Computing Toolbox).</s><s>The source code with an example data set and demonstration script can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/ZAEDPolSl/</s><s>MrGSEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p><s>The computational experiment is based on the collection of 28 microarray data sets, where to each of them a target pathway is referred.</s><s>Sixteen GSEA ranking metrics were tested by two scores: i) surrogate sensitivity -a p-value of normalised enrichment score statistic for target pathway (the smaller, the better) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> S1 Note) and ii) false positive rate (FPR) -the percent of false positives found at 5% significance level (the closer to 5%, the better).</s><s>To assess FPR, the original phenotypes of each data set were permuted creating 50 independent data collections.</s><s>To estimate the overall sensitivity of a given ranking metric, the conservative estimator π0 from Storey's method for multiple testing was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>The π0 represents a proportion of truly null tests with the expectation that all p-values will follow uniform distribution, where 1-π0 is the proportion of truly alternative tests.</s><s>To estimate the overall FPR of the ranking metric, the absolute deviation of mean FPR (observed level) from 5% (expected level) was taken.</s><s>Additionally, the computational load of each ranking metric was evaluated.</s><s>Obtained scores (overall sensitivity, overall FPR, computational load) were normalised to one scale, and the k-means clustering procedure with Euclidean distance was used to divide ranking metrics due to total performance in gene sets enrichment.</s><s>The number of clusters in k-means algorithm was set with the use of Dunn index <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, for the best ranking metrics, the robustness to sample size was tested in the following scenario: the largest data set (GSE19188) was randomly divided 30 times into different sample size collections <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr">60</ref>, 80 and 100) in a stratified manner.</s><s>For each scenario, the surrogate sensitivity and FPR of gene set enrichment for a given method was calculated.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Establishing the best ranking metrics</head><p><s>For all ranking metrics, the computational load was calculated as an important measure of practical application of given method (detailed evaluation for each metric and data set is included in Additional file 1).</s><s>To find metrics which have the best overall sensitivity, overall FPR estimation and low computational cost, the k-means clustering approach with Euclidean distance was used.</s><s>The estimators of each score were normalised to range [0, 1] to avoid favoring a single score.</s><s>The Dunn index indicated four clusters as an optimal solution of clustering.</s><s>Results of using k-means with 4 clusters are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The most relevant clusters are the ones where computational load and overall FPR are low, and overall sensitivity is high.</s><s>These three conditions are fulfilled for a cluster 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) with the metrics: |MWT|, MSD, |S2N| and BWS -green colour superiority.</s><s>Out of those four metrics the |MWT| had the highest overall sensitivity, while MSD showed the lowest overall FPR and low computational load on the tested data collection.</s><s>In this group only |S2N| is available in the original GSEA Java-based implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, added as a consequence of results obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s>For other clusters showed in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we can observe  Overall sensitivity is defined as 1 -estimator from Storey's method (the higher, the better).</s><s>Overall false positive rate is defined as an absolute value of the difference between observed and expected false positive rate (the lower, the better) a poor value for at least one of the tested measures (red colour).</s><s>Additionally, the k-means procedure was applied only for overall sensitivity and overall FPR estimators to show another group with the best ranking metrics, when the computational load does not matter (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>As can be observed the |MWT|, |S2N| and BWS are located in a cluster with the best outcomes, however this time kmeans procedure also distinguished two other interesting clusters with weaker scores.</s><s>The first cluster includes Reli-efF metric which has medium FPR estimation and good overall sensitivity; the second cluster includes MSD and ReliefF ranked metrics, with low overall sensitivity but good FPR estimation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robustness to sample size</head><p><s>The four best ranking metrics (|MWT|, MSD, |S2N| and BWS) were tested for robustness of pathway enrichment analysis with respect to number of samples in the analysed data set.</s><s>Both surrogate sensitivity and FPR were assessed for each metric and different sample size (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Two metrics, |MWT| and |S2N| have similar levels of surrogate sensitivity, independent of sample size.</s><s>BWS and MSD metrics show better results for larger sample sizes.</s></p><p><s>In case of BWS it is related with the method of empirical estimation of B statistic.</s><s>In case of MSD, it is caused by the weakness of standard error estimation for calculating the logFC CI.</s><s>In case of FPR, it may be observed that it is constant for all metrics and sample sizes.</s><s>The only exception is observed for |MWT| method, where for extremely low sample size the obtained FPR is higher.</s><s>Analysis of robustness of the ranking metrics to sample size revealed that |MWT| and |S2N| give stable results, but for larger experiments obtained surrogate sensitivity is worse than for BWS and MSD.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Precision in pathway enrichment</head><p><s>Finally, the percentage of enriched pathways at different significance levels was determined.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">5a</ref>, shows average percent of discovered pathways for tested data collection with 95% confidence intervals, while Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref> represents average level of enriched pathways after random permutation of sample labels (false positive estimation).</s><s>As can be seen the</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selected attributes of the best ranking metrics</head><p><s>Three of four best ranking metrics (|S2N|, MWT and MSD in the current implementation) are calculated using arithmetic mean and standard deviation.</s><s>As these are parametric statistics, two assumptions are made: normality of data distribution and absence of outliers.</s><s>In case of gene expression obtained using high-throughput biological techniques the assumption about normality of distributions is often not met and outliers are frequently present.</s><s>Thus, it may lead to reduced power of pathway enrichment analysis.</s><s>The data collection used in this study is characterised by not strongly skewed distributions of gene expression (see Additional file 2), so the described disadvantage of parametric methods is not evident.</s><s>At 0.05 significance level, about 25% genes, on average, has a non-normal distribution, but when we set the significance level to 0.01 this number is reduced to 11%.</s><s>Notably, whether MSD depends on parametric assumptions it depends on the specific implementation.</s><s>On the other hand, the BWS test statistic has no assumption about the distribution of data, which allows to use this metric for every kind of biological data.</s><s>In a group of analysed data sets the proportion of non-normally distributed genes is significantly correlated with gain in overall sensitivity ).</s><s>These findings are similar to the one obtained by Neuhäuser and Senske <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>They also demonstrate that in case of symmetrical distributions BWS has similar power to parametric tests.</s></p><p><s>The GSEA method allows to detect direction of disregulation (up-or down-regulated) in gene sets.</s><s>The result depends on the type of used ranking metric.</s><s>When high positive and low negative values of ranking metric represent differentially expressed genes, we can detect gene sets with mostly up-regulated genes or mostly downregulated genes.</s><s>When the information about direction of gene expression change due to phenotype is missing, GSEA allows only for detection of dis-regulated gene sets (despite the direction of expression difference).</s><s>The second case is stated for all four best ranking metrics.</s><s>These findings are consistent with biological knowledge, where in the same pathway up-and down-regulated genes are observed.</s><s>Nevertheless, in some biological experiments enrichment of pathways with only up-regulated or only down-regulated genes is desirable, thus while using GSEA researchers have to be aware of its properties.</s></p><p><s>A common disadvantage of |S2N| and BWS metrics is that a p-value for each gene, showing a magnitude of statistical difference in expression between phenotypes, can be only estimated using permutation test <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s>As it is known, when the exact p-value is very low, permutation test estimation is very time consuming.</s><s>By using |MWT| and MSD ranking metrics accurate p-values can be obtained without any additional computational cost.</s></p><p><s>Finally, MSD ranking metric required a higher number of permutations (more than 10,000 in our analysis) to correctly estimate p-value for gene set enrichment.</s><s>This phenomenon is caused by existence of negative values of MSD metric indicating non-significant log fold changes.</s><s>When we performed label permutation, the variance of gene expression within phenotypes was increased, which lead to huge increase in the number of genes with negative MSD value (and more pathways with negative normalised enrichment score).</s><s>In GSEA, to calculate a p-value for a given pathway only the positive or negative portion of the normalised enrichment score distribution is used, corresponding to the sign of the observed normalised enrichment score.</s><s>In all cases, when using MSD, the distribution of normalised enrichment score for permuted data consists of a much smaller number of positive values than negative, and thus establishing an adequate p-value for positive NES requires more permutations.</s><s>However, this weakness has also a positive consequence in the form of decreased false positive rate.</s><s>Furthermore, the MSD was defined in a way that allows implementation even in case of complex linear models or contrasts, thus allowing for a greater flexibility.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>With the use of 28 microarray data sets, contrasting results of gene set enrichment for 16 ranking metrics in GSEA algorithm were observed.</s><s>All metrics were tested by statistical measures of sensitivity and FPR with the accompanying of computational load.</s><s>From the group of all tested methods four showed better outcomes, i.e. |MWT|, MSD, |S2N| and BWS.</s><s>Out of tested metrics the best overall sensitivity was observed for |MWT|, while the best overall FPR estimation was obtained by MSD.</s><s>In the group of four best metrics, |MWT|, MSD (in current implementation), and |S2N| are based on parametric estimators and should be carefully used when this assumption is not met.</s><s>BWS shows better outcomes for larger sample size and non-normal gene expression distributions compared to other metrics.</s><s>It also detects more enriched pathways, keeping false discovery at a reasonable level, which may suggest new discoveries.</s><s>We showed that choosing ranking metric does matter in case of GSEA and its role is not negligible.</s><s>Appropriate setting of ranking metric can improve FPR estimation of GSEA method that was criticised in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, it is possible to use any ranking metric, but researchers have to be aware of possible weaknesses presented in this study.</s><s>In the enclosed MATLAB implementation GSEA computations are efficiently parallelised, giving the opportunity to easily modify the scripts to fulfill researcher expectations.</s><s>In comparison to existing implementations MrGSEA offers much higher flexibility and functionality in the form of a large scale of ranking metrics (including own one), usage of custom gene set database and two different types of permutation.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Boxplots of surrogate sensitivity and FPR of gene set analysis.</s><s>Panel a represents the distribution of target pathways enrichment p-value to each metric presented in logarithmic scale -the lower the better; Panel b represents the results of FPR estimation, where the red line represents the expected outcome -the closer to 5% the better</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="6,126.82,493.53,340.36,199.96" type="bitmap" /></figure>
