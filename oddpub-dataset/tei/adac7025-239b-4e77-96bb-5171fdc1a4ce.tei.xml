patients with rheumatoid factor-positive or rheumatoid factor-negative polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis.</s><s>Patients with systemic JIA (sJIA), enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were excluded to acquire a more homogenous patient population and to avoid the effect of differences in approval among the respective drugs; etanercept is approved for ERA and PsA, adalimumab for ERA and tocilizumab for sJIA.</s></p><p><s>Etanercept was approved for polyarticular JIA in 2000, and adalimumab was approved in 2008.</s><s>Therefore, considerably more experience has been gained with etanercept than with adalimumab or tocilizumab.</s><s>Accordingly, etanercept was used much more frequently than either adalimumab or tocilizumab.</s><s>In the Dutch ABC registry, etanercept was also the most frequently prescribed biologic agent for non-systemic JIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>In that study, greater drug experience was the most important factor driving the decision to use etanercept rather than adalimumab.</s><s>Adalimumab was favored by Dutch pediatric rheumatologists for patients who had preceding uveitis.</s><s>Similar findings were obtained in the current BIKER population.</s></p><p><s>For German pediatric rheumatologists, we may speculate that the number of patients starting on etanercept as their first biologic agent is higher because there is prolonged experience with etanercept compared to the other biologic agents.</s><s>Adalimumab was predominantly chosen as the first biologic agent in patients with concomitant uveitis.</s><s>Finally, the relative rarity of using tocilizumab can either be attributed to the fact that first, it is the biologic agent with the least experience of use and second, that currently only the intravenous infusion is approved, which means it can only be used in centers with an infusion facility.</s><s>The decision as to which biologic agent is used is not influenced by a protocol, algorithm, national recommendation or guideline, or by the registry itself.</s><s>Adalimumab was used more frequently than etanercept as a second-line biologic agent but had comparable efficacy in both second-line and first-line users <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There were few other differences among the studied cohorts.</s><s>Patients in the adalimumab or tocilizumab cohorts were older than those in the etanercept cohort, and there were fewer patients with extended oligoarthritis in the tocilizumab cohort.</s><s>A striking difference was observed in use of concomitant MTX, which was much more common in the etanercept cohort, followed by the adalimumab cohort.</s><s>Fewer than 50% of the patients in the tocilizumab cohort received concomitant MTX therapy.</s><s>This observation was surprising because etanercept is approved only for monotherapy, whereas both of the other biologic agents are also approved for combination therapy.</s></p><p><s>Despite these differences, PedACR treatment response rates were comparable for all three biologic agents.</s><s>The majority of patients demonstrated marked improvement after 3 months of treatment.</s><s>The response rates thereafter remained stable or increased further.</s><s>No apparent differences among the three treatment cohorts were noted, in accordance with the

target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</s><s>However, in the most recent clinical trial investigating etanercept, patients with extended oligoarticular JIA experienced a much higher rate of clinical improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There was a small but significant difference in reported absolute disease activity at baseline, as measured by the JADAS10, which was highest in the tocilizumab cohort and lowest in the adalimumab cohort.</s><s>This difference was balanced by the inverse probability of treatment allocation estimated by a generalized propensity score.</s><s>The JADAS score fell significantly in all cohorts after treatment.</s><s>The residual JADAS at the last observation (mean observation time in all cohorts of approximately 1 year) was highest in the etanercept cohort.</s><s>The greatest adjusted mean reduction in the JADAS was observed in the etanercept cohort; in contrast, the greatest observed mean reduction was in the tocilizumab cohort.</s></p><p><s>As tocilizumab may have had a higher influence on the acute phase response via its inhibitory capability on the IL-6 axis, the JADAS10 and the clinical JADAS (cJADAS), which considers only three clinical parameters were compared.</s><s>Interestingly, at baseline 144 of 407 patients (35.4%) in the etanercept cohort and 26 of 74 patients (35.1%) in the tocilizumab cohort had higher classic JADAS than cJADAS.</s><s>Upon treatment (month 3 to 24), 91 of 856 patients (10.6%) in the etanercept cohort and 22 of 187 patients (12.4%) from the tocilizumab cohort had higher classic JADAS than cJADAS.</s><s>Thus, both at baseline and after treatment the results were very much comparable, and direct inhibition of IL-6 seems not to influence the laboratory parameters of the JADAS10 more than TNF inhibition.</s><s>As we used definitions for MDA and remission based on the complete JADAS, the original JADAS10 was preferred over the cJADAS, which considers only three clinical parameters.</s><s>Comparable numbers of patients achieved JADAS remission and JADAS minimal disease activity in a large database study <ref type="bibr"

rates.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the drug survival rates for the three biologic agents were different in this study.</s><s>Whereas etanercept and tocilizumab showed comparable drug survival, significantly more patients discontinued adalimumab.</s><s>The main reason for adalimumab discontinuation was lack of therapeutic response or inefficacy, which differed significantly compared with the discontinuation frequency with etanercept due to inefficacy/lack of therapeutic effect.</s><s>This could have been influenced by the higher proportion of patients on MTX in the etanercept cohort.</s><s>It is possible that Adalimumab in monotherapy could lead to more immunogenicity and secondary loss of efficacy.</s></p><p><s>Remission was the second leading reason for drug discontinuation.</s><s>Significantly fewer patients discontinued tocilizumab than etanercept for reasons of remission.</s><s>This finding is remarkable because the rates of JADAS remission were not different.</s><s>The mean/median duration of treatment with both etanercept and tocilizumab were comparable.</s><s>There were also no differences in the number of patients on prolonged treatment: a quarter of the patients had been treated with etanercept for more than 1.7 years, which was comparable to more than 1.5 years in a quarter of the patients using tocilizumab.</s><s>It is likely that tocilizumab adherence was affected by its more frequent use as a second-line biologic agent compared with etanercept and thus an earlier biologic treatment had failed.</s><s>It can be speculated that in this situation, successful drug treatment likely will not be discontinued.</s></p><p><s>Very few patients discontinued their biologic agent due to intolerance, which suggests that they are not only

limitations.</s></p><p><s>Observational studies of cohorts of unselected patients receiving routine care may allow better comparisons of the drugs used, although the lack of randomization must be considered when interpreting the results.</s><s>In a smaller Dutch observational study of 214 patients with JIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, the use of etanercept and adalimumab was
