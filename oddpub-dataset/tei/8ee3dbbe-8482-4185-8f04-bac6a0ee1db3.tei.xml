bone fractures report a range between 3-15% of patients who develop non-unions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, despite the advanced knowledge about bone healing processes and the continuous development of surgical interventions.</s></p><p><s>A number of cytokines and growth factors play a role in the different phases of bone healing.</s><s>A dysregulation of these factors is expected to be involved in the impairment of bone healing and the formation of non-unions.</s></p><p><s>In general, non-unions can be classified into different active and inactive forms.</s><s>A biologically active and vascularized non-union phenotype is defined as hypertrophic, whereas an atrophic non-union is considered to be relatively inactive and avascular <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>This classification from 1982 still forms the basis for the definition of non-unions but has been refined several times <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>In terms of the atrophic phenotype, however, controversial findings regarding the vascularization status of these non-unions have been published.</s><s>Studies investigated the amount of blood vessels in human atrophic non-unions and healing fractures and found no differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>In animal models with an external fixator stabilizing a bone defect with additional periosteal stripping, blood vessel formation was low after one week but increased more than in the control group after 8 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Other animal studies clearly demonstrated, that a disturbance of angiogenesis during fracture healing leads to an avascular non-union <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>In a clinical study, arteriography was performed on the ipsilateral extremity where an open fracture with a blunt trauma occurred and they found a significantly greater incidence of delayed healing or non-union in patients with arterial occlusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is well known that a number of risk factors influence the healing outcome.</s><s>These may be either patient dependent: age, sex, drugs, smoking and nutrition state, or fracture dependent: mechanical stability, degree of soft tissue trauma, surgical interventions, infections and blood supply <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The search for local biological factors influencing non-union progression in patients is hindered due to the heterogeneity of fractures, presence of patient co-morbidities, and limitations in evaluation methods, which mostly evaluate endpoints.</s><s>Therefore, animal models are necessary to obtain more information regarding the causes and the underlying regulatory processes of healing impairment.</s><s>Several techniques have been described in literature to induce non-unions, ranging from large defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to periosteum cauterization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, induction of ischemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or systemic treatment with vascularization inhibitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Although, a critical size defect is a severe clinical problem, it does not address non-union formation resulting from a fracture in which also severe soft tissue damage occurs.</s><s>In this study we addressed this problem by creating an open osteotomy concomitant with a soft tissue trauma to mimic a hypertrophic non-union.</s><s>Disturbed vascularization is often induced by a large defect together with periosteal stripping <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, the disruption of the blood supply from the outer layer of the bone leads to an increase in vessel formation and therefore does not mimic a long term disturbance of the angiogenesis.</s><s>On the other side, the application of an angiogenesis inhibitor can mimic this type of dysfunction.</s><s>In this study, two clinically relevant non-union models in rats mimicking a hypertrophic and an atrophic non-healing situation were used and compared to normal healing.</s><s>In previous studies, dealing with the establishment of the two non-union models, a time period of 84 days was chosen to confirm the formation of nonunions.</s><s>The change from a closed fracture approach (healing control group) to an open osteotomy approach already led to a pronounced delayed healing with the formation of a hypertrophic non-union after 84 days.</s><s>The fractured bones gained mechanical stability similar or higher than the intact tibiae at days 42 and 84, whereas the tibiae of the osteotomy group never reached similar values <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>At day 10, histomorphometric evaluation revealed higher values for the whole reactive callus, but lower values for the relative bone and cartilage tissue in the osteotomized tibiae.</s><s>To induce an atrophic non-union the angiogenesis inhibitor Fumagillin was locally applied, which resulted in a reduction in callus formation, a disturbed revascularization and a lack of callus bridging in all animals after 84 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Both non-union models showed no healing after 84 days contrary to the fracture group where defect healing was seen after 42 days.</s></p><p><s>To get a deeper understanding about the underlying differences between these non-healing models this study pursued a comprehensive evaluation of the healing phases with regards to mineralization, vascularization and molecular conditions.</s><s>Special attention was paid to important factors of the osteogenic and angiogenic signaling pathways.</s><s>It is well known that both pathways are tightly linked and both play an important role in bone formation and regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>A recent study of Kusumbe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> showed the direct connection of angiogenesis and osteogenesis.</s><s>They found a new vessel type in close contact to bone lining cells, which contained endothelial cells highly positive for CD31+ and Endomucin.</s><s>David et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> reviewed the importance of the BMP pathway in angiogenesis.</s><s>BMPs can induce angiogenesis directly or indirectly by activation of VEGF-A which mainly plays a role in the activation phase as well as in the maturation phase of angiogenesis.</s><s>In addition, VEGF has been shown to regulate not only angiogenesis but also multiple biological processes in endochondral ossification and bone formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Survival and function of chondrocytes is assumed to be regulated by VEGF <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> as well as the recruitment, survival and activity of osteoclasts during the remodeling phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The balance between BMPs and their antagonists appears dysregulated in non-healing fractures <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Until now, no study has investigated both osteogenic and angiogenic pathways in conjunction with different clinically relevant non-healing models.</s><s>In this study a closed fracture approach was used to mimic the normal healing outcome, whereas an open osteotomy led to a hypertrophic phenotype and an additional inhibition of angiogenesis to an atrophic phenotype.</s><s>Gene expression analysis was performed in combination with immunohistochemistry (IHC) to increase the understanding in the factors involved in the healing process as well as to be able to describe the differences between the two models.</s><s>Special attention was paid to the alterations in the callus region with respect to revascularization.</s><s>The application of the polymerizing contrast agent Microfil allowed a three-dimensional analysis of the vessel network of the callus.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The most common long bone lesions are tibia fractures and depending on the anatomical location and the severity of trauma, they can have the highest non-union rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Bone healing processes are well characterized but the question remains as to what happens particularly when patients develop impaired bone healing or a non-union, especially since bone has such a remarkable capacity to regenerate.</s><s>In an attempt to answer this question, three different clinically relevant healing models in rats, mimicking normal healing but also hypertrophic and atrophic non-union, were analyzed.</s></p><p><s>Based on radiographic images, μCT and histology, two important differences were observed in the healing processes in the healing control group versus the hypertrophy group.</s><s>First, hypervascularization was detected in hypertrophic calluses at the beginning of the healing It is known that the development of a hypertrophic callus in animal models is mainly caused be instability of the fixation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and is accompanied by enhanced cartilage formation.</s><s>In this study all tibiae were stabilized in the same manner and the fibulae were broken manually to guarantee the same degree of stability.</s><s>Histomorphometry data revealed higher values of cartilage area in the hypertrophy group at day 7 but lower values at day 14 and 21 compared to the healing control group.</s><s>The phenomenon at the later time points could be explained by small bone fragments (bending wedge) that form during the fracture process (healing control group) stimulating cartilage formation at different parts of the callus.</s><s>A smooth cortical surface, as produced by the osteotomy, provides less stability than the irregular cortical surface after fracture and may account for the early cartilage formation in the hypertrophy group.</s></p><p><s>The vascularization of the callus region was assessed by μCT 3D-imaging.</s><s>At the early healing time point hypertrophic calluses showed a higher blood vessel volume per total callus volume compared to the healing control group.</s><s>This enrichment of vessel volume was caused by a high number of microvessels with small and medium diameters mainly located in the peripheral parts of the periosteal callus, but not in the direct gap region.</s><s>It is well known that the surrounding soft tissue significantly contributes to the blood supply of the fractured bone immediately after the injury and persists until the normal blood circulation is restored <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Taking the different surgical techniques into account the blood supply from an intact connection to the surrounding muscle, like seen after a closed fracture, might stimulate the early fracture healing without the need of extended vessel ingrowth.</s><s>In case of the osteotomy approach early vessel ingrowth is needed due to the reduced blood supply from the surrounding tissue.</s><s>After 42 days the architecture of the vessel network changed towards a well-defined network inside the newly formed bone in both groups.</s><s>In this network an increase in vessels with a medium-sized diameter and an increase in vessel connectivity in both groups were found.</s><s>The hypervascularization had therefore no direct negative effect on the later development of the vessel network inside the bone structures, but might be an indicator for delayed healing processes.</s></p><p><s>At the mRNA level, no differences in expression levels of angiogenic factors occurred at the first two time points (days 3 and 7), although a clear difference in vessel network formation was detectable by angiography between both groups.</s><s>A higher expression of osteogenic but also angiogenic genes was detected at day 14 in the hypertrophy group indicating enhanced healing processes at the osteotomy gap.</s><s>This might be linked to an enhanced availability of progenitor cells resulting from the improved blood supply.</s><s>In contrast, in the healing control group the highest expression of most investigated factors such as Bmp3, Bmp7, Gremlin 1, Dan, Twsg1 as well as Vegfa, Fgf1 and Amotl2 was seen at day 21.</s><s>At that time point resorption of calcified cartilage and osteoblastic recruitment is induced <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>At the end of the analyzed healing period significantly less Bmp4 was expressed in the hypertrophy group as well as Bambi and also a downwards trend of Bmp2 and Twsg1 expression was observed.</s><s>Bmp4 is a factor supporting the later stages of fracture healing and associated to long bone fracture nonunions in patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Taking into account that the healing process occurs by a well-balanced interplay of a multitude of factors stimulating, antagonizing, or compensating each other, it can be speculated that these changes in expression can be sufficient to delay healing.</s></p><p><s>In general, a variety of different scenarios were found in human studies on non-unions.</s><s>For example, lower protein synthesis of BMPs with comparable BMP antagonists was detected in human non-union biopsies when compared to fracture calluses <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>On the contrary, another study by Fajardo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> measured higher expression levels of Bmps as well as of the Bmp antagonists in non-unions than in normal healing situations.</s><s>A third study observed no differences in Bmp expression in delayed healing versus non unions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>The limitation of all these studies was the single time point analysis and the heterogeneous patient cohort.</s><s>Osteotomies in mice stabilized with a non-rigid fixator showed enhanced expression of wnt-and BMP-molecules and their antagonists when compared to a rigid fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>The study of Lienau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> applied an unstable fixation method to induce impaired bone healing in sheep and found different temporal expression patterns of genes regulating blood vessel formation.</s><s>Both studies worked with an unstable fixation technique to induce delayed healing, which was not the case in our study.</s></p><p><s>When comparing the normal healing to the atrophic non-union model the local application of Fumagillin at the early stage of bone healing had not only a negative effect on the long term vascular network formation but also on chondrogenesis.</s><s>A slight reduction of the vessel volume could already be seen at the early time point when compared to the hypertrophy group.</s><s>After 42 days, a significantly lower vessel volume and a lack in connectivity of the vessel network had been manifested in the atrophy group.</s><s>Comparing the late stage of healing to the early one in this group, the vascular thickness histograms showed a reduction in the number of small and medium sized vessels.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, although the atrophic calluses showed a reduction of the reactive callus size, the periosteal woven bone formation was not influenced.</s><s>But the chondrogenesis was highly altered.</s><s>The lack of cartilage development in the atrophy group after 42 days was associated with residual hematoma and formation of fibrous tissue in the gap near regions of the callus.</s><s>A comparable tissue composition was seen in the study of Hausman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> typically in clinical non-unions failing to undergo chondrogenesis.</s></p><p><s>Based on previous in vitro release kinetic studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>, a burst release of the angiogenesis inhibitor during the first hours followed by slow release over several days was expected in our model.</s><s>Fumagillin would thereby have a high influence on the biological processes at the beginning of the healing cascade and in particular endosteal, intracortical and near the gap region but to a lesser extent in the periosteal periphery.</s><s>This would explain the similar hypervascularization in the periphery of the periosteal callus as seen in the hypertrophy group at day 7.</s><s>In contrast, around the gap, Fumagillin diffusion into the surrounding tissue caused a later disturbance of the vessel network formation in combination with a lack of cartilage formation.</s><s>It is therefore not a model mimicking periosteal injuries but rater complications occurring during the fracture healing period.</s><s>Fumagillin is naturally produced by Aspergillus fumigatus having an inhibitory effect on the methionine aminopeptidase type 2 (MetAP2) and downstream processes of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> demonstrated that TNP470 (Fumagillin derivate) leads primarily to a cell cycle arrest in endothelial cells (ECs) but does not affect other non-endothelial cells types.</s><s>Furthermore we have shown that human osteoblast like cells (POBs) are not influenced by this agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>We therefore assume that the changes seen in the atrophy group were associated to altered EC behavior followed by a disturbed vessel formation.</s></p><p><s>RT-PCR results of atrophic calluses showed an attempt of the organism to reverse the inhibition of angiogenesis by significant up-regulation of angiogenic factors such as Vegfa, Angiopoietin 2 and Fgf1 and by trend also Fgf2 starting at day 7 with a continuous increase over time.</s><s>Angpt2 is associated with formation of larger vessels and branching of existing vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>The up-regulation of this factor indicates a high contribution of existing vessel structures from the periosteal region to the blood supply of the callus.</s><s>This goes along with the results of the vessel thickness histogram where mainly small vessels were absent and the 3D vessel network showed only larger connective vessels in the periphery of the callus but not near the gap.</s><s>Interestingly, Vegfa expression was only significantly enhanced at day 7 showing no further up-regulation over time.</s><s>It is known that under hypoxic conditions, occurring during hematoma formation, and later on during cartilage resorption and bone remodeling, Vefga is expressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s>The increased expression at day 7 might therefore be linked to a delay in hematoma degradation in the atrophy group.</s><s>The lack of Vegfa during the later time points might be associated with the absence of cartilage formation and a reduction in activity of endothelial cells induced by Fumagillin treatment.</s><s>In tumorgenicity studies a direct inhibition of VEGF secretion of tumor cells after TNP-470 treatment led to an indirect effect on the proliferation and activity of ECs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>Direct blockage of VEGF production in cells such as chondrocytes or osteocytes was so far not investigated.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, anti-angiogenic regulators such as Angiomotin like 2 (Amotl2) and Thrombospondin 2 (Thbs2) were highly expressed in the atrophy group at day 7 and slightly higher at day 42 compared to the control group.</s><s>At the protein level, an enhanced presence of THBS could be detected in the atrophic calluses at day 42, but no clear differences at day 7.</s><s>Likewise, higher protein synthesis at day 42 was seen for the pro-angiogenic factor ANGPT2.</s><s>ECs, osteoblast precursors as well as maturing and hypertrophic chondrocytes are sources for ANGPT2 synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</s><s>Similar to THBS, occurrence of this protein shifted from the periphery of the callus region at day 7 to parts near the gap after 42 days.</s></p><p><s>The analyzed osteogenic factors (Bmp2, -3, -4 and -7) showed also a dysregulated expression profile in the atrophy group over time.</s><s>The up-regulation at day 14 and 21 as seen in the hypertrophy and the healing control groups could not be detected in atrophic calluses.</s><s>Bmp antagonists such as Gremlin 1 and Dan showed similar down-regulation at that time.</s><s>Notably, Bmp4, Dan, Twsg1, and to a lesser extent Gremlin 1 had higher expression levels in the atrophy group at day 42.</s><s>Other than Dan, all of the up-regulated factors are known regulators of angiogenesis by effecting EC behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>.</s><s>A similar general down-regulation of Bmps but also of their antagonists was demonstrated by Niikura et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, who compared closed femoral fractures with and without periosteal cauterization in rats.</s><s>Interestingly, the same down-regulation of osteogenic factors together with an up-regulation of angiogenic factors resulting in a delayed healing was demonstrated in osteotomized animals treated with nicotine <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</s><s>It is well known that BMPs trigger the formation of bone and cartilage <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and that MSCs that differentiate into the chondrogenic lineage secrete BMPs such as BMP2 and BMP4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</s><s>It was also described that BMP7 better than BMP2 is able to stimulate chondrogenic differentiation in adipose tissue-derived MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</s><s>The lack of chondrogenesis in our atrophy model might therefore be associated with the lower expression levels of osteogenic genes at day 14 and 21.</s></p><p><s>As outlined before, studies on human fracture healing are highly limited and cannot produce standardized and time dependent data of the healing process.</s><s>Especially, information about the changes in tissue composition over time are rare and the source for this knowledge is mainly based on animal studies.</s><s>Nevertheless, animal models are limited by the manipulation necessary to induce a specific phenotype of healing and may therefore not reflect the exact healing situation as seen in the clinic.</s><s>In this study, the open osteotomy in the hypertrophy model mimics an open fracture with a soft tissue trauma which can occur due to accidents.</s><s>The application of the angiogenesis inhibitor Fumagillin is in fact a more artificial intervention but the influence of Fumagillin is restricted to EC proliferation.</s></p><p><s>The surgical intervention in the healing control group is different to the other groups and is meant to mimic normal healing without soft tissue trauma, infection or disturbed angiogenesis but not as a control for the models per se.</s><s>Using a closed fracture in combination with the angiogenesis inhibitor might also lead to the development of an atrophic non-union but this has to be proven by establishing an additional model.</s></p><p><s>Another methodical limitation of this study was the application of the contrast agent Microfil.</s><s>The quality of the perfusion was assessed macroscopically by the yellow staining of larger vessels of the muscle and a uniform yellow coloration of the right hind paw.</s><s>Unperfused vessels cannot be visualized by μCT and a measure of accuracy of the perfusion procedure was not possible.</s><s>Nevertheless, it is a very promising tool to visualize the vasculature as a 3D-network inside the bone or mature vessels.</s><s>However, we observed small islands of contrast agent in the early callus but with no clearly connected vessel network.</s><s>Furthermore, EC and smooth muscle cells of the vessels were destroyed in many cases and we assume that this happened due to the osmotic pressure of the contrast agent.</s><s>This might be a problem for immature vessels to sustain the pressure resulting in disruption of the vessels.</s><s>In addition, the visualization of capillaries was not possible due to the viscosity of the contrast agent necessary to detect it with μCT and the resolution and scanning time necessary to scan the total callus part.</s></p></div>
