<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Persistent Firing Is Expressed by a Physiologically Specific Class of Interneurons.</head><p><s>In our patch-clamp recordings from GAD67-GFP mice we could distinguish between fastspiking (FS) (20.7%, 24 of 116 neurons) and non-fast-spiking (nFS) interneurons (79.3%, 92 of 116 neurons) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref>) based on the strictly different firing behavior of these cell subtypes upon somatic current injection.</s><s>Interneurons were considered as FS if upon saturating somatic current injection they could achieve a firing rate of at least 200 Hz (mean maximal firing rate for FS: 301.33 ± 14.73 Hz).</s><s>The remaining interneurons were considered nFS and their mean maximal firing rate was well below 200 Hz (104.03 ± 2.91 Hz).</s><s>Interestingly we were able to induce persistent firing in a relatively large portion of nFS interneurons (32.6%, 30 of 92 neurons) but only in one out of 24 FS interneurons (4.2%) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref>).</s><s>This finding suggests that persistent firing is very unlikely to occur in FS cells or alternatively it may indicate the existence of a very rare but still functionally distinct neuronal type.</s><s>We decided to not include this single FS, persistent firing cell in further analyses.</s><s>To examine whether the phenomenon of persistent firing was expressed by a specific functional class of layer 2/3 cortical interneurons we further characterized different physiological and morphological properties in three different populations of recorded interneurons: FS, nonpersistent firing (FS-nPF) (20%, 23 of 116 cells), nFS, nonpersistent firing (nFS-nPF) (53%, 62 of 116 cells), and nFS, persistent firing (nFS-PF) (26%, 30 of 116 cells) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and a spike threshold significantly more depolarized ( &lt; 0.05) in comparison with nFS-nPF (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>As a consequence the Δvoltage between resting Vm and spike threshold was significantly larger in the nFS-PF than in the nFS-nPF group ( &lt; 0.01).</s><s>This suggests that nFS-PF interneurons require larger Vm depolarization to transit from a resting into an active state.</s><s>FS interneurons showed intermediate Δvoltage values which did not differ from either of nFS neuronal groups ( &gt; 0.05 for both FS versus nFS-nPF and Fs versus nFS-PF) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(b), Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>nFS-PF interneurons displayed particularly wide somatic APs.</s><s>The spike half-width in nFS-PF interneurons was not only significantly larger than FS interneurons ( &lt; 0.001), which are well described to have very narrow APs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, but also highly significantly larger than nFS-nPF ( &lt; 0.001) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>It remains to be disclosed if the broad spike width observed in PF interneurons can be attributed to the expression of a specific set of voltagedependent K + channels with lower kinetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and whether it may have a causal role in the induction of PF.</s><s>The input resistance did also strongly differ between interneuronal groups.</s><s>nFS-nPF neurons showed a relatively high input resistance; meanwhile nFS-PF cells displayed significantly lower values ( &lt; 0.001), similarly to Fs interneurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(c), Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The reduced input resistance in PF interneurons was not a result of leak currents due to bad recording conditions, since the resting Vm of this neuronal class was not depolarized but even more hyperpolarized than the other neuronal groups.</s><s>All together, these data suggest that much stronger excitatory inputs are needed to drive nFS-PF interneurons above the spike threshold.</s></p><p><s>To better analyse the relation between neuronal input and output we measured the frequency of action potential firing upon a depolarizing somatic current injection of gradually increasing amplitude.</s><s>As expected FS interneurons achieved the highest firing rate (in some cells up to 400 Hz) which was highly significantly different from both nFS-nPF and nFS-PF (from 200 to 850 pA  &lt; 0.001, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(d)</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, nFS-PF interneurons showed a significantly reduced firing compared to nFS-nPF cells at relatively low current injection amplitude (between 150 and 450 pA) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(e)</ref>).</s><s>This resulted in a rightward shift of the firing rate versus current injection curve in persistent firing interneurons compared to nFS-nPF (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(e)).</s><s>Taken together these findings indicate that interneurons displaying persistent firing possess peculiar membrane properties which make them particularly reluctant to synaptic recruitment.</s><s>The activation   <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) suggesting a similar functional excitatory connectivity in these two neuronal populations.</s><s>All together the differences in membrane and firing properties observed between nFS-nPF and nFS-PF cells suggest that the here identified PF interneurons constitute a functional unique neuronal population.</s><s>Future studies should further investigate the cellular mechanisms responsible for these peculiar intrinsic features.</s><s>Biocytin-filling further revealed that nFS-PF displayed specific morphological features.</s><s>nFS-PF neurons always displayed multiple neuronal processes extending from the soma (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(a), bottom).</s><s>Interestingly, we also observed differences in the size of soma of the three populations of interneurons.</s><s>FS interneurons had the largest cell bodies (versus nFS-nPF:  &lt; 0.01; versus nFS-PF:  &lt; 0.001).</s><s>In contrast, the soma size of persistent firing interneurons was the smallest (versus nFS-nPF:  &lt; 0.05) (Figures 4(a)-4(b)).</s><s>One additional feature found exclusively in one out of six persistent firing interneurons, but never in nFS-nPF cells (0/21), was the diffusion of biocytin from one recorded PF cell into nearby located interneurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(c), red channel).</s><s>In this example, the cell pointed by the white arrow was proven to be a PF interneuron.</s><s>This neuron was the only one from which patch-clamp recordings were performed and therefore the only neuron directly filled with biocytin.</s><s>It is conceivable that the two additional biocytin-positive neurons (grey arrow heads) were stained indirectly by the diffusion of biocytin from the recorded neuron via gap-junctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>In the second channel in green, the GFP staining confirmed that all three neurons were GAD67-positive inhibitory neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The two cells indirectly filled with biocytin (grey arrow heads) but not the recorded one (white arrow) were also found to be immunopositive for parvalbumin (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(c), blue channel).</s><s>Since parvalbumin was found to be expressed by FS but never by nFS interneurons (data not shown) it is very likely that the PF, parvalbumin-negative cell, and the two parvalbuminpositive neurons belong to two different neuronal subtypes (nFS-PF and FS-nPF, resp.).</s><s>This result suggests heterologous gap-junctions coupling between nFS-PF and FS-nPF interneurons.</s></p></div>
