four subtypes: SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D.</s><s>SP-A and SP-D appear to have an essential role in host defense mechanisms, whereas SP-B and SP-C are important in lowering surface tension in the lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In previous experiments, we investigated the expression of SPs in rodent neoplastic lung lesions induced by the administration of N-nitrosobis (2-hydroxypropyl) amine (DHPN) via drinking water for 2 weeks and in inflammatory lung lesions induced by a single intratracheal instillation (i.t.) of quartz, a particle known to induce lung inflammation, in male F344/DuCrlCrj (F344) rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>SP-A and SP-D were found to be strongly expressed in alveolar mucus and in macrophages observed in the inflammatory lung lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>In addition, SP-B and SP-C were highly detected in the bronchial/alveolar epithelial cells of the inflammatory lesions as well as in lung hyperplasias and adenomas.</s><s>These results suggested that SP expression was associated with lung tumorigenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Ambroxol hydrochloride (AH), an expectorant drug, is clinically prescribed to stimulate pulmonary surfactant and serous airway secretion, thus enhancing airway ciliary movement and facilitating sputum removal <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>AH treatment has also been reported to regulate SP production <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>The protein and mRNA contents of SP-C increased in alveolar type-II epithelial cells from AH-treated rats.</s><s>AH treatment also resulted in a significant increase in SP-B in whole lung tissue as revealed by enhanced immunostaining of Clara cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Several reports have shown that AH treatment has suppressive effects on pulmonary inflammation and inhibits the progression of inflammation in humans and animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> .</s><s>A suppressive effect of AH on quartz-induced lung inflammation was also demonstrated in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, the anti-inflammatory effect of AH is expected to be associated with reduced oxidative stress or inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>However, no studies to date have examined the effects of AH on chemically induced lung tumors in rodents.</s></p><p><s>Fiber-shaped particles of dipotassium octatitanate (TISMO â ) have been

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present study showed that AH significantly remedied body weight gain and decreased white blood cell counts in a mouse model of TISMO-induced pleural thickening.</s><s>TISMO intrathoracic infusion induced pleural thickening in A/J mice, as shown in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>AH was therefore expected to induce a suppressive effect on pleural thickening caused by TISMO infusion.</s><s>In our previous studies, experiments using rodent models of TISMO-induced pleural lesions imitating pleural mesothelioma were conducted to support the development of treatment modalities for malignant mesothelioma, for which an appropriate animal model is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Fiber-shaped particles such as asbestos have iron as a component and also generate free radicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Although TISMO contains no iron, the TISMO fibers produced a severe reaction, and the accumulation of iron was observed around the infused TISMO fibers using Berlin blue staining in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Thus, iron accumulation was likely to have derived from an endogenous source in the body <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Iron increases oxidant stress, leads to thickening and inflammation of pleurae, and has a potential role in underlying carcinogenic mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In experiment 1, all mice treated with TISMO (Groups 2 and 3) showed histopathological pleural thickening with severe chronic inflammatory changes.</s><s>In Group 2 (TISMOtreated group), TISMO treatment also appeared to induce an increase in peripheral white blood cell counts caused by inflammation.</s><s>In addition, the TISMO-treated groups had lower body weights than the TISMO-untreated group (Group 1) after TISMO administration, likely because of the poor general conditions of the animals arising from acute inflammation.</s><s>The mice in Group 3 (TISMO + 120 ppm AH-treated group) showed a trend toward body weight recovery from Week 10 and demonstrated completely recovery of body weight at Week 13.</s><s>The recovery of body weight in Group 3 appeared to be attributable to an improvement in the poor general condition caused by TISMO because of the effect of AH on inflammatory suppression.</s><s>Furthermore, mice in Group 3 (TISMO + 120 ppm AH-treated group) showed an apparent recovery in white blood cell counts, reaching the same levels as mice in the TISMO-untreated group (Group 1).</s><s>These results suggest that AH exerted a suppressive effect on inflammation, at least with respect to  the increase in peripheral white blood cells induced by the intrathoracic administration of TISMO.</s></p><p><s>Pleural thickening was caused mainly by foreign body granuloma with infused fiber, infiltrated lymphocytes, and fibrosis.</s><s>Although this histopathological finding was noted both in Groups 2 and 3, no significant difference in histopathological incidence of inflammatory lesions and pleural thickness was observed between Groups 2 and 3, regardless of AH treatment.</s><s>However, a suppressive effect of AH was demonstrated histopathologically on quartz-induced lung inflammation in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>These results indicates that the suppressive effects of AH administration on lung inflammation might be observed in the lung parenchyma, not in the pleura, assuming that increased levels of SPs contribute to the suppressive mechanism.</s><s>On the other hand, no significant changes were observed in SP-B and SP-C expression following AH treatment in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, the suppressive effects of AH on lung inflammation might be exerted via mechanisms other than increasing SPs, such as effects on excretion and other processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>In fact, pleural thickening attributable to foreign body granuloma with infused TISMO tended to be decreased in Group 3 compared with Group 2 in this study, indicating that AH had the potential to excrete biological foreign bodies.</s><s>TISMO fibers accumulated inside the cytoplasm of macrophages and foreign-body giant cells, likely having been phagocytized by these cells, and remained in place for prolonged periods.</s><s>Indirect effects of fibers such as the inhibition of phagocytosis by macrophages have been proposed as a candidate mechanism for fiber-induced carcinogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Long multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and long asbestos fibers induce frustrated phagocytosis and granuloma formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Determination of a strategy for the removal of MWCNTs, asbestos, and TISMO may contribute to the prevention of mesothelioma carcinogenesis.</s></p><p><s>The decrease in white blood cell counts in peripheral blood was considered attributable to AH inhibiting inflammatory mediators or oxidative stress released by TISMO.</s><s>In rats with paraquat-induced lung fibrosis, the protective effect of ambroxol was histologically prominent and presumably mediated by its free radical scavenging and antioxidant activity 8 .</s><s>AH has also been reported to suppress the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6, and reactive oxygen species in macrophages derived from rats in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>CD68, which is marker of macrophage was chosen to confirm producer cells of these cytokines in the present experiment.</s><s>However, there was no apparent difference in the expression of IL-1Î², at least in the lung considering the results of immunohistochemistry. Therefore, AH might affect other mediators than IL-1Î² in vivo or have effects on mediators in the peripheral blood.</s><s>In this experiment, TNF-Î± and IL-6-expressing cells were not able to be detected in the lung.</s><s>One of the reasons for this is known to be that it is generally difficult to detect cytokines in a paraffinized specimen by immunohistochemistry because they are immediately secreted from their producer cells after synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Both NNK and DHPN are known lung carcinogens.</s><s>All mice and rats showed adenoma formation in experiments 2 and 3, and adenocarcinomas were also observed in several animals.</s><s>In our previous experiment, SP-B and SP-C were highly expressed in lung hyperplasias and adenomas induced by DHPN in male F344 rats 2 .</s><s>Thus, SPs were expected to be associated with lung tumorigenesis.</s><s>Adenoma multiplicity in Group 2 (NNK + 12 ppm AH-treated group) showed a significant increase compared with that in Group 1 (NNK-treated group), although Group 3 (NNK + 120 ppm AH-treated group) did not show any significant increase in the multiplicities of proliferative lesions as compared with Group 1.</s><s>The increased adenomas were considered to have occurred incidentally, as there was no AH-concentration dependency.</s><s>Therefore, in the present study, no significant changes related to AH treatment were observed in the incidence and multiplicity of proliferative lung lesions.</s><s>These results suggested that SPs did not appear to exert a directly modulatory effect on proliferative lung lesions.</s><s>SPs highly expressed in lung tumors in our previous study may have been the result of proliferation of type II alveolar epithelial cells producing SPs physiologically and may not have been related to the lung tumorigenesis.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, AH suppressed TISMO-induced inflammation and was associated with recovery of body weight loss and decreased peripheral white blood cell counts.</s><s>However, modulatory effects on proliferative lung lesions induced by NNK and DHPN were not identified in the present study.</s><s>Thus, these results suggest that AH potentially exerts antiinflammatory effects but does not have a direct suppressive effect on lung tumorigenesis in rodents.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Body weights of A/J mice in experiment 1.</s><s>A significant decrease in body weight was observed in the TISMO-treated groups (Groups 2 and 3) compared with the untreated group (Group 1) from 2 weeks after TISMO administration.</s><s>Significantly different from Group 1 at (a) p&lt;0.05 (Groups 2 and 3 vs.</s><s>Group 1), (b) p&lt;0.01 (Groups 2 and 3 vs.</s><s>Group 1), and (c) p&lt;0.001 (Group 2 vs. Group 1) and p&lt;0.01 (Group 3 vs.Group 1).</s><s>However, the mice in Group 3 (TISMO + 120 ppm AH-treated group) showed recovery of body weight, and they showed significantly higher body weight values than those of mice in Group 2 (TISMO-treated group) from Weeks 13 to 14.
