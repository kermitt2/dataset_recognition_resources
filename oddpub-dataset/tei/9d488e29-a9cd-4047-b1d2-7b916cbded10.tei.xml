for this interpretation may be derived from evolution: TH stimulates thermogenesis in homeothermy, a feature of mammals.</s><s>Interestingly, the tyrosine motifs in TRβ, which are required for noncanonical PI3K activation by TRβ, are found in all mammalian TRβ ortholog sequences but not in sequences from poikilothermic animals, such as alligator, clawed toad, or zebrafish <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, noncanonical TR signaling may be a recently acquired adaptation in evolution that provides mammals with a novel mechanism by which TH can regulate energy metabolism, body temperature, and activity.</s><s>Development of noncanonical TR signaling relatively late in evolution, long after TRs assumed their canonical role as ligand-dependent transcription factors, may also explain why the physiological effects of canonical and noncanonical TR signaling are so clearly distinct from one another.</s></p><p><s>Negative Regulation of Gene Expression.</s><s>A persisting point of controversy is whether DNA binding of TRs is required for negative regulation of gene expression by TRs.</s><s>TSH elevation in TRβ − and TRβ GS mice clearly demonstrates that, in agreement with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, inhibition of TSH expression in vivo requires DNA binding.</s><s>Results from TRβ GS mice indicate that noncanonical TH action may contribute to negative regulation.</s><s>Scd1 expression in HepG2 cells and in mouse liver is negatively regulated by TH (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</s><s>Compared with WT mice, hepatic Scd1 expression was elevated in TRβ − mice but not in TRβ GS mice.</s><s>Therefore, negative regulation of Scd1 expression in vivo does not require DNA binding of TRβ.</s><s>In microarray studies, however, we did not detect downregulation of Scd1 within 6 h.</s><s>Two explanations seem plausible: Either Scd1 is directly negatively regulated by TH/TRβ without DNA binding by an unknown mechanism that takes longer than 6 h or down-regulation of Scd1 in liver is only a secondary effect in response to noncanonical TRβ effects on metabolism, which also take more than 6 h.</s><s>The fact that, in addition to Scd1, several other genes involved in triglyceride synthesis also were negatively regulated by T 3 suggests the latter.</s><s>Repression of these genes appears to be a coordinated response to reduced substrate availability for triglyceride synthesis, possibly due to increased metabolism.</s><s>Repression of Myh7 appeared to be partially preserved in hearts of TRα GS mice.</s><s>Expression of Myh7 is negatively regulated by miRNA miR-208a, which is encoded by an intronic sequence of Myh6.</s><s>Repression of Myh7 by increased TH concentration is an indirect effect of Myh6 induction and, consequently, miR-208a expression.</s><s>Our interpretation of the difference in Myh7 expression in TRα 0 and TRα GS mice is that the relationship between Myh6 and Myh7 may not be linear.</s><s>However, a partial noncanonical repressive effect of TRαGS cannot be ruled out.</s></p><p><s>Role of Noncanonical PI3K Activation.</s><s>The best-studied noncanonical action of TRβ is rapid activation of PI3K (5-7).</s><s>We therefore studied the TRβ 147F mouse as a control, because in this mouse model the activation of PI3K by TRβ is selectively abrogated.</s><s>In the blood glucose response to T 3 and serum and liver triglyceride concentrations, the phenotype of TRβ 147F mice was similar to that of TRβ − mice, demonstrating that these effects are indeed mediated by TRβ activation of PI3K.</s><s>As insulin also signals via PI3K to decrease blood glucose by increasing the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane, we hypothesize that insulin and noncanonical TRβ signaling converge at the PI3K pathway.</s><s>This mechanism of TRβ action would explain previous observations in which T 3 treatment increased glucose uptake into the thymus in rats independent of protein synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, increased glucose uptake into L6 muscle cells in a PI3K-depentent manner in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, and increased the translocation of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle of rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>TRα also activates signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>, possibly as a short p30 TRα variant that indirectly activates ERK and PI3K after T 3 binding and nitric oxide and cGMP production <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> or by direct protein-protein interaction between TRα and PI3K <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>.</s><s>The noncanonical mechanism by which TRα influences heart rate remains unknown.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, noncanonical, DNA-independent TR signaling contributes significantly to the physiological actions of TH, and these noncanonical actions appear to predominantly regulate energy homeostasis.</s><s>These findings demonstrate that TRα and TRβ mediate both canonical and noncanonical signaling in vivo, establishing a paradigm shift for TH action.</s></p></div>
