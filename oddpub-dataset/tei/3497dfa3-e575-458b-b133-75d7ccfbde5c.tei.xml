<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Significance of the study.</s><s>Currently, patients with hypertension are defined as HF group A 3 despite the absence of signs and symptoms, due to the high risk of developing of the disease.</s><s>Patients with hypertension, even well controlled, without LVH and with normal resting echocardiography, may have symptoms of HF only during exercise, usually in the form of exertional dyspnea <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>The origin of the symptoms of myocardial dysfunction in these groups of patients is still unclear.</s><s>One of the hypotheses involves myocardial stiffness and impaired relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Various markers of LV systolic and diastolic function derived from Doppler echocardiography have been used to predict LV functional capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> .</s><s>However, mitral inflow is dependent on LV relaxation and LA pressure, thus the confounding effects of changes in loading conditions can significantly affect the measurements determined by Doppler recordings of LV filling velocities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> .</s><s>Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) records systolic and diastolic velocities within the myocardium, and has been shown to provide accurate quantification of regional and global LV function <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Studies have shown that HFpEF is characterized by an increase in cardiomyocyte stiffness, but also by production and deposition of extracellular matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> .</s><s>Cardiac fibrosis is difficult to quantify and in this regard more sensitive biomarkers that are easy to measure are very important <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> .</s><s>Therefore we added TDI derived parameters to other standard Doppler echocardiographic measurements and evaluated the levels of selected biochemical biomarkers to find potential predictors of impaired exercise capacity in patients with hypertension.</s></p><p><s>Brief description of results.</s><s>In our study significantly higher concentrations of PIIINP were observed in patients with hypertension with exertional symptoms and in patients with advanced HF compared to the control group, which might suggest that PIIINP may be the first, early biomarker of HF in patients with hypertension.</s><s>It was the only biomarker that essentially differed between control, dyspnea and HF group.</s><s>Other investigated biomarkers showed significant differences only between hypertensive patients with normal resting echocardiography (control and dyspnea groups) and patients with advanced HF.

focused on cardiac function at rest although most of these patients are breathless only on exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> .</s><s>The abnormalities of ventricular function in HFpEF may not be apparent at rest but are more obvious on exercise.</s><s>With the increase in filling pressure early mitral diastolic inflow velocity (E wave) increases with reduced early diastolic annular velocity (wave E').</s><s>The ratio of early mitral diastolic inflow velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/E') correlates with the wedge pressure in the pulmonary artery <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> .</s><s>The TDI of early mitral annulus velocity has been reported to be a relatively preload-independent index of LV relaxation, and the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral inflow velocity to myocardial velocity can be used to estimate LV filling pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> .</s><s>The longitudinal expansion of the LV is reduced and delayed by slower relaxation and not substantially influenced by LA pressure in the presence of diastolic dysfunction.</s><s>Thus, in contrast to E, E' provides a consistent measurement of diastolic dysfunction despite increases in LA pressure.</s><s>The peak rate of LV diastolic filling E is decreased with mild diastolic dysfunction but progressively increased in response to elevation in LA pressure.</s><s>However, the peak E' wave progressively declines with HF worsening, despite increases in LA pressure and LA to LV pressure gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> .</s><s>Thus E' (but not E) accurately reflects the progressive slowing of LV relaxation as HF develops <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> .</s><s>In the study of Ha et al. <ref type="bibr"

with normal LVEF without inducible myocardial ischemia and exaggerated systolic BP response to exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .</s><s>However, these studies did not assess the effect

only on exercise and 29 controls underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography with color TDI.</s><s>At rest, early diastole annular tissue velocity (E') in the group with exertional dyspnea was

multivariate analysis, the index of the E/E9 ratio derived from dividing peak early diastolic mitral inflow velocity by the mitral annular velocity was found to be the most powerful predictor of peak oxygen uptake and the E/E' ratio .7.5 enables the functional limitation to be predicted regardless of the mitral flow profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> .</s><s>The causal relation
