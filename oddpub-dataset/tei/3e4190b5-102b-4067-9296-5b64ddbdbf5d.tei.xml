<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Public health monitoring depends on valid health and disability estimates in the population 65+ years.</s><s>This is hampered by high non-participation rates in this age group.</s><s>There is limited insight into size and direction of potential baseline selection bias.</s><s>Methods: We analyzed baseline non-participation in a register-based random sample of 1481 inner-city residents 65+ years, invited to a health examination survey according to demographics available for the entire sample, self-report information as available and reasons for non-participation.</s><s>One year after recruitment, non-responders were revisited to assess their reasons.</s><s>Results: Five groups defined by participation status were differentiated: participants (N = 299), persons who had died or moved (N = 173), those who declined participation, but answered a short questionnaire (N = 384), those who declined participation and the short questionnaire (N = 324), and non-responders (N = 301).</s><s>The results confirm substantial baseline selection bias with significant underrepresentation of persons 85+ years, persons in residential care or from disadvantaged neighborhoods, with lower education, foreign citizenship, or lower health-related quality of life.</s><s>Finally, reasons for non-participation could be identified for 78 % of all non-participants, including 183 non-responders.</s><s>Conclusion: A diversity in health problems and barriers to participation exists among non-participants.</s><s>Innovative study designs are needed for public health monitoring in aging populations.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>The sample is part of the research project 'Operationalizing Multimorbidity and Autonomy for Health Services Research in Aging Populations' (OMAHA).</s><s>The project was conducted as part of the German collaborative research initiative on health in older populations supported by the Federal Ministry of Research and Education (Germany).</s><s>The project was approved by the local ethics committee at Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin (EA2/ 066/08) and was conducted in compliance with data protection and privacy regulations, as requested by the Federal and Berlin Offices for the Protection of Data.</s><s>All procedures performed were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</s><s>Informed written consent was obtained from all participants.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling frame and participants</head><p><s>As described elsewhere in detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, OMAHA was conducted as a population-based longitudinal epidemiological study of multimorbidity and associated health care needs in an urban population aged 65+ years between January 2009 and January 2011.</s><s>A random sample (N = 2000), stratified by age bands (65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85+ years) and sex was drawn from the official register of residents in Berlin-Mitte on July 15, 2008, including a total of 1481 persons for the main project and 519 for a pilot project.</s><s>The stratified sampling procedure resulted in n = 200 individuals per age band and sex category.</s><s>The drawing probability was higher in older age groups (especially of those 80+ years).</s><s>Therefore, older individuals were oversampled.</s><s>Inclusion criteria were permanent residence in Berlin-Mitte and being 65+ years.</s><s>Individuals who had died, had moved outside of the study area or were continuously absent during the recruitment period were excluded from the study and considered ineligible.</s></p><p><s>Individuals were initially contacted by postal mail including a form to request a brief study description in seven different languages to address major immigrant subgroups in Berlin (Arabic, Croatian, English, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Turkish).</s><s>Participants had the choice of home visits or appointments at the inner-city study center.</s><s>A small monetary incentive (€ 10) plus reimbursement for travel expenses were offered.</s><s>Individuals who did not respond to this invitation were further contacted randomly by personal visits, telephone calls, or reminder letters.</s></p><p><s>Baseline recruitment and assessment were conducted between January and June 2009 by trained and continuously supervised study nurses and a study physician.</s><s>Study procedures included a comprehensive standardized computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI; e.g.</s><s>medical history, instrumental activities of daily living), standardized functional capacity tests and physiological measurements (e. g. grip strength, blood pressure), detailed assessment of currently used medications, and a self-administered questionnaire (e.g.</s><s>health-related behaviors, health care utilization).</s></p><p><s>Individuals who declined baseline participation were asked to answer a short standardized health questionnaire as a self-filled mail survey questionnaire (available in various languages) or via telephone interview.</s><s>Proxy responses were allowed.</s></p><p><s>Three mutually exclusive groups of baseline nonparticipation according to their reachability were differentiated: (a) non-participants with the short questionnaire (NP +), i.e., individuals who declined study participation but completed the short questionnaire; (b) non-participants without the short questionnaire (NP-), i.e., individuals who declined study participation as well as the completion of the questionnaire; and (c) non-respondents (NR), i.e., individuals who could not be reached during the recruitment period and who did not actively decline study participation.</s></p><p><s>To further characterize non-participants at baseline, we assessed reasons for non-participation at two points in time.</s><s>First, during the recruitment period, multiple reasons for non-participation could be specified by either self-report or proxy-reporting through postal, telephone or personal contact.</s><s>Second, between July and September 2010, NR were revisited by a study nurse to retrospectively identify their reasons for non-participation at baseline.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p><s>Register-based information Demographics (age, sex, citizenship) and postal addresses were provided by the official resident register for the total sample.</s><s>Citizenship was categorized into German vs. non-German.</s><s>Postal addresses were checked by internet research for registered residential care (yes/no).</s><s>Postal addresses were considered as being in a deprived neighborhood (yes/no) if the proportion of long-term unemployed (i.e., ≥one year) in the neighborhood was in the highest septile of Berlin's 447 official neighborhoods [i.e.</s><s>≥29.7 %; 29].</s><s>This indicator was not available for four of our 40 neighborhoods.</s><s>The average proportion of long-term unemployment of surrounding neighborhoods was used as an approximation for the missing data.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-report information</head><p><s>Self-report information was used to compare participants and NP+.</s><s>Self-report information for participants was based on the CAPI, except for information on quality of life which was assessed by self-administered questionnaire.</s></p><p><s>Living arrangements was dichotomized into married and living together (yes/no).</s></p><p><s>School education was categorized as &lt;10, 10, or &gt;10 years.</s></p><p><s>Long-standing or chronic disease was assessed with one question from the Minimum European Health Module <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>.</s><s>"Do you have any chronic illness or some longstanding health problem, e.g., diabetes or a heart disease?" (yes/no).</s><s>For participants, chronic diseases were additionally defined as "long-standing illnesses that need continuous treatment and monitoring".</s></p><p><s>Health-related quality of life was assessed by the EQ-5D-3 L of the EuroQol Group <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32]</ref>.</s><s>Five dimensions with a three-answer format determine problems with mobility, self-care, the performing of usual activities, the extent of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.</s><s>A total score was calculated (range: 0-100).</s><s>In addition, answer categories in all five dimensions were dichotomized (yes/no): at least some mobility problems, at least some self-care problems, at least some problems performing usual activities, moderate/extreme pain/discomfort and moderate/extreme anxiety/depression.</s></p><p><s>Polypharmacy was assessed by one or two selfdeveloped questions for NP+ and participants, respectively.</s><s>NP+ were asked "How many different prescribed medications do you take?" (none; 1-3; 4-6; &gt;6).</s><s>Participants were asked "Do you currently (in the last 7 days) take prescribed medications?"</s><s>If response was positive, participants were asked how many medications.</s><s>This information was combined to consider taking ≥4 prescribed medications as an indicator of polypharmacy (yes/no).</s></p><p><s>Need for assistance was assessed by one question modified from the German Ageing Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref>.</s><s>"At the moment, are you dependent on others to cope with everyday life, e.g., for personal hygiene, cleaning, personal and financial organization, because of a chronic illness or some long-standing health problem?"</s><s>For participants, the current need for support was further defined as "in the last seven days".</s></p><p><s>Based on Minder et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, detailed reasons were summarized into a main reason for non-participation in the following hierarchical order: being too healthy, being too ill, other reasons and no interest.</s><s>For example, an individual who reported ill health and limited knowledge of German was categorized as being too ill.</s><s>In contrast, an individual was only categorized as having no interest if no health-related or other reasons were stated.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analyses</head><p><s>Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref> and Stata/SE 12.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref>.</s><s>First, descriptive statistics and 95 % confidence intervals (95 %-CIs) using Wilson's method were calculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Second, two multivariable multinomial regression analyses were applied to determine all group differences for the register-based information using participants (analysis 1) or NP+ (analysis 2) as the reference group.</s><s>Because the sample clustered in 40 different neighborhoods and aggregated data at this level were included in the regression models, adjustments in calculating the standard errors and confidence intervals were required and survey procedures with Taylor linearization and neighborhoods as primary sampling unit were applied in Stata/SE 12.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Third, bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to determine group differences between P and NP+ for each self-reported variable.</s><s>Subjects with missing values were not included in the logistic regression models.</s><s>Relative risk ratios (RRRs) plus 95 %-CIs, and odds ratios (ORs) plus 95 %-CIs are presented for multinomial and logistic regression models, respectively.</s><s>P-values at the 5 % level and lower were considered significant.</s></p></div>

they were also less likely to report at least one chronic disease or polypharmacy.</s><s>One possible explanation for these seemingly contradictory results may be Abbreviations: NP + = non-participants with short questionnaire, i.e., individuals who declined study participation but completed the short questionnaire; NP-= non-participants without the short questionnaire, i.e., individuals who declined study participation and completing the short questionnaire; NR = non-respondents, i.e., individuals who could not be reached during the recruitment period and who did not actively decline study participation a Reasons for non-participation stated during the 2009 recruitment period.</s><s>In 2010, non-respondents were given an opportunity to report retrospectively a reason of non-participation b These reasons were summarized as "other" if there was no indication of being too healthy or ill lower health service utilization among non-participants compared with participants.</s><s>This could reduce the probability to receive a medical diagnosis or treatment despite functional limitations.</s><s>Less education, as in our study, could be an underlying determinant and act as a barrier in health care utilization in this subgroup <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref>.</s><s>More research is needed to explain and verify this finding.</s><s>However, we cannot rule out that measurement and mode effects caused these findings because the wording of the questions on chronic disease and need for support varied slightly between the two groups.</s><s>In addition, participants took part in a brown bag medication review.</s><s>They could have been more aware of their medications intake than NP+.</s><s>NP-and NR belonged more often to disadvantaged groups (non-German citizenship;
