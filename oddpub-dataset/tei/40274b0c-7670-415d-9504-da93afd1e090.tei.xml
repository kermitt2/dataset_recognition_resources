<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Approximately 15 % of children/adolescents living in Germany are overweight or obese <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The increase in the prevalence of obesity results predominantly from multifactorial changes in lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The abundant availability of high refined, caloric foods and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle appears to be responsible for the enormous number of obese children and adults, although a genetic susceptibility to this phenomenon is also well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Obese children present an enormous public health concern since overweight and obesity increase mortality predominantly through co-morbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus later in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> and childhood obesity transfers the risk of these complications into adult life <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>.</s><s>Weight loss is known to improve cardiovascular risk factors and this benefit persists as long as weight reduction is maintained <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Multidisciplinary and behavior-oriented lifestyle interventions constitute the foundation of paediatric obesity therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Several systematic reviews of the treatment of childhood obesity showed clinically meaningful effects of short-term lifestyle interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s>However, almost all patients regained weight after initial successful weight loss.</s></p><p><s>Obviously, obesity is a chronic disease and maintenance of a steady weight after an initial weight loss represents the main challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Studies indicate that several biological factors, such as appetite regulating hormones <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, demographic factors, such as age <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>, psychosocial factors, like maternal depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, treatment-response related factors, such as change in BMI-SDS during the first year of intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and presence of familial obesity and frequent family meals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref> may be predictive for long-term weight maintenance.</s></p><p><s>However, the process of weight regain is also mediated by a coordinated endocrine response, including leptin, ghrelin, thyroxin and numerous other hormones modifying food intake, energy expenditure and physical activity.</s><s>Nonetheless, about 10 to 20 % of individuals do show a sustained body weight reduction after a lifestyle intervention, suggesting that a considerable variability in the quality, dynamics and extent of this endocrine response might exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Overall research on long-term weight change patterns and its predictors among children/adolescents following lifestyle intervention is scarce.</s><s>The main objective in an in-depth and dynamic analysis of the endocrine network counter-balancing weight loss will increase our understanding of the endocrine circuits regulating energy homeostasis and should improve the prediction of successful therapeutic weight reduction.</s><s>In addition, a clinical trial that explores the effectiveness of an intervention programme to specifically maintain a diet induced weight loss is completely missing in a paediatric obesity cohort so far.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, we intended a multidisciplinary clinical research effort called 'Hormonal Regulation of bodyweight Maintain -Study, MAINTAIN' , (DFG/KFO 218/0 with eight projects) including two randomized controlled trials (RCT) in children/adolescents and adults in parallel, investigating the mechanisms of weight maintenance and their relation to a lifestyle intervention.</s><s>The comprehensive study design of this RCT including the oneyear lifestyle intervention called BABELUGA concept applied to the families shall be described here.</s></p><p><s>(note) BABELUGA stands for Berlin Adiposity Therapy Program for children and adolescents and their

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adult weight reduction phase (in comparison to children)</head><p><s>In accordance to the protocol, all adults subjects underwent an initial three-month run-in weight reduction phase (defined by at least 8 % BMI in comparison −0,2 BMI-SDS in children and adolescents).</s><s>To induce an appropriate weight loss, participants were restricted to an intake of 800 kcal per day by a formula diet (Optifast®) for 8 weeks of this three-month period.</s><s>This was combined with weekly nutritional advice sessions, a moderate physical exercise programme and psychological counselling.</s><s>In fact, all participants were instructed to attend twelve 90 min nutritional counselling sessions with a trained dietitian consisting of nutritional advice and cooking classes.</s><s>The physical activity consisted of aqua fitness under the supervision of a physiotherapist and was performed before or after each nutritional counselling session.</s><s>All participants were instructed to further increase their daily physical activity.</s><s>Weight loss and health status was monitored weekly during this period to ensure no adverse effect.</s><s>Compliance with the parameters of the study was controlled by obtaining the number of Optifast® packages used as well as verifying attendance at the weight reduction courses and the physical exercise programme.</s><s>Despite the standardized weight reduction programme, a substantial interindividual variation of weight loss was observed during this period.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomized controlled trail (Intervention)</head><p><s>The RCT part started as soon as participants reached the required weight loss reduction.</s><s>137 entered the randomization phase (T0, 10 did not meet the inclusion criteria, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Reasons for not being randomized were: insufficient weight loss in the residential center or loss of follow-up of participants or parents (drop out 10 participants).</s><s>Participants who fail to reduce their weight returned for usual care in paediatric outpatient obesity clinic.</s><s>The participants were randomized to either the control group or the intervention group.</s></p><p><s>For the randomization eight groups were distinguished in a list: Females and males either pre-pubertal or pubertal and with a BMI-SDS under or over 2,5 (obese or extreme obese) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The words "control" or "intervention" were written in random order on the left side of the list.</s><s>According to time and date participants returned after successful weight-reduction, their names were entered in the list by the responsible member of study team.</s><s>Following the principle of contingency participants were assigned to the group that stood left to their name.</s></p><p><s>Seventy-two participants were randomized into control and 65 into intervention conditions, 53 % of them were female and 47 % male participants.</s><s>The study population characteristics were as followed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The participants assigned to the control group received usual medical care, but no particular programme (as the intervention group throughout the whole year) and only returned to follow-up after one year.</s><s>All study participants agreed to complete 1 or 2 units of exercise/sports every week throughout the study, which had to be documented and signed by the institution that was attended as well as usual sport classes at school.</s><s>All participants were recommended to visit an institution on sports for adipose children based in Berlin, which is a specialised in all-round activity and exercise provider, where overweight and obese children and adolescents (from 5 to 18 years) participate in a playful way.</s><s>They are encouraged to strengthen endurance, coordination muscle-training and flexibility according to the results of a personalised fitness check.</s><s>Additional parental-training were offered as well a nutritional education for children and their families.</s></p><p><s>Randomized participants assigned to the intervention group received the schedule for the following year.</s><s>The intervention programme contained ten interventionmodules throughout a 12 months period, where professional therapists addressed the issue of healthy eating and healthy lifestyle.</s><s>Some (n = 6, 9.2 %) disagreed to group participation.</s><s>We agreed that they should join the quarterly check-ups, otherwise they would have been excluded.</s><s>A very important advantage for group intervention was (different from routine outpatient obesity programmes) that the participants knew each other from the residential weight loss programme.</s><s>The participants met again after completing the programme during these sessions.</s><s>Nevertheless, only 31 % of the families fulfilled the criteria for regular participation (health insurance requires 80 % attendance in group sessions to refund of expenses) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>To our knowledge this is the first paediatric RCT focused on weight maintenance (following weight reduction).</s><s>From the clinical point of view, this part of treatment in obese children, adolescents and their families is even more relevant than the effect of structured weight reduction programmes themselves.</s><s>In general, success in treating obese children and adolescents is limited by the fast weight regain and it is extremely difficult to achieve weight maintenance even in specialized institutions.</s><s>This unfortunate situation has been quantified already in meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>.</s><s>In principle, multi-professional teams and involvement of the family are positively associated with better outcome in these studies.</s><s>In older age (pubertal or post-pubertal) and families with psychosocial problems or low socioeconomic status, the rate of success is significantly lower in relation to younger children without psychosocial problems.</s><s>Aside from these public health aspects, family based therapy of childhood obesity is challenging the healthcare systems, because of an increased lifelong morbidity in this group.</s><s>In the case that children are still obese at the end of their physical development, it is most likely, that obesity will persist throughout life, resulting in a higher rate of comorbidities e. g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.</s><s>Therefore the described research project aims to explore the effects of enhancing the longterm success rate of a multi-professional care in obese children to better maintain an initial weight loss.</s><s>The dynamic of hormonal and metabolic mechanisms counter-balancing sustained weight loss during puberty and adolescence is poorly understood.</s><s>Puberty alone is accompanied by a physiological insulin resistance, especially in girls, shifting the metabolic situation to growth acceleration and anabolism.</s><s>In obese adolescents these conditions are aggravated, resulting in e.g., early menarche in obese girls.</s><s>Therefore, it is expected, that significant weight loss during puberty induces significant counter regulation in order to avoid further weight loss and promote regain.</s><s>Aside from the clinical intervention trial, this research project will also investigate in depth the hormonal and metabolic counter-regulatory effects of weight loss in children for the first time.</s></p><p><s>So far, programmes for obese children and adolescents were conducted as a single intervention, not as a treatment chain like for other chronic diseases in childhood (e.g.</s><s>diabetes, asthma).</s><s>The intensive family based lifestyle intervention during the weight maintenance is still temporary, but could be helpful to avoid weight regain.</s></p><p><s>In summary, major questions remain unclear.</s><s>It is entirely unclear whether a lifestyle intervention is able to shift the set-point of body weight.</s><s>Theoretically the dynamic of regain may differ considerably between individuals.</s><s>Thus, early and late "regainers" with a different hormonal make-up might exist, which has not been investigated yet.</s><s>Finally, it is entirely unclear, whether the hormonal counter-regulation is comparable between children and adults.</s><s>We therefore performed the above described randomized controlled trial in children, adolescents and adults.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 .Fig. 1</head><label>11</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 General study flow chart</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
