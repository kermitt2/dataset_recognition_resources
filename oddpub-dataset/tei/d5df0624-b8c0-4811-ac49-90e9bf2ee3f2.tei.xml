<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activated CD8 + T lymphocytes of acute immune reactions are eliminated by cyclophosphamide</head><p><s>To show that proliferating CD8 + T lymphocytes are eliminated by CyP, we induced a secondary immune reaction to ovalbumin (Ova) in C57BL/6 mice, and treated them with CyP on days 0 and 4 of the reaction, then enumerated antigen-specific CD8 + T lymphocytes on day 7 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>).</s><s>CyP decreased the absolute numbers of B220 + B cells by 60% in the spleen and 80% in the BM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>), demonstrating that CyP was delivered to both organs efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>.</s><s>CD8 + CD44 + memory T cells as such were reduced by 50% in the spleen, but not in the BM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>).</s><s>CD8 + memory T cells of the immune response to Ova were labeled by fluorescent H2K b -SIINFEKL pentamers.</s><s>The frequencies of SIINFEKLbinding CD8 + CD44 + T lymphocytes were reduced in the spleen and BM, in the example displayed by 78% in the spleen and 58.2% in the BM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref>), although less cells were detectable in the BM than in the spleen at this time point.</s><s>Absolute numbers of SIINFEKL-specific CD8 + CD44 + T lymphocytes were reduced from 10.97 × 10 3 (± 3.58 × 10 3 SEM) to 1.01 × 10 3 (± 0.17 × 10 3 SEM), i.e. by 90.79% in the spleen, and from 4.29 × 10 3 (± 0.73 × 10 3 SEM) to 2.20 × 10 3 (± 0.41 × 10 3 SEM), i.e. by 48.73% in the BM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1E</ref>).</s><s>As expected, SIINFEKL-specific CD8 + memory T cells in cell cycle, expressing Ki-67, were eliminated entirely (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1F</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CD8 + memory T cells of the BM are not eliminated by cyclophosphamide</head><p><s>Next, we investigated the proliferation of CD8 + memory T cells in the memory phase of an immune response.</s><s>To this extent, we treated C57BL/6 mice immunized twice with Ova, 3 months after onset of the secondary immune reaction, on days 90, 94, 98, and 102 with CyP, and enumerated their CD8 + memory T cells on day 105 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>).</s><s>Again, we confirmed delivery of CyP to the BM by analyzing the ablation of B220 + B cells, which were significantly reduced by 70% in spleen and 50% in BM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>).</s><s>Numbers of SIINFEKL-specific CD8 + memory T cells in the BM were not significantly affected by CyP, with 1921 (± 234.8 SEM) in CyP treated versus 2113 (± 336.5 SEM) in untreated mice.</s><s>On the other hand, in the spleen, the numbers of SIINFEKL-specific T cells were significantly reduced by 70%, from 1352 (± 210.2 SEM) to 411.5 (± 44.14 SEM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>).</s><s>In the BM, the numbers of CD8 + CD44 + memory T lymphocytes as such were also not affected by the CyP treatment, with 1.31 × 10 6 (± 0.92 × 10 5 SEM) versus 1.23 × 10 6 (± 1.12 × 10 5 SEM) in treated versus untreated animals, respectively.</s><s>In contrast, in the spleen numbers of CD8 + CD44 + memory T cells were significantly reduced by 46% from 1.10 × 10 6 (± 0.59 × 10 5 SEM) to 0.59 × 10 6 (± 0.41 × 10 5 SEM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2D</ref>).</s><s>In the spleen, CyP did reduce the frequency of CD8 + CD44 + Ki-67 + memory T cells from 13.7 (± 1.14 SEM) to 5.7% (± 0.77 SEM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2E and F</ref>).</s><s>Since CyP eliminates about 50% of the cells within 14 days, apparently 80% of the cells eliminated by CyP, i.e. 40% of all cells, had switched from proliferative rest (Ki-67 − ) to proliferation within these 14 days.</s><s>Interestingly, in the BM even cells expressing Ki-67 were not CyP sensitive, i.e. their frequency did not change significantly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2F</ref>).</s><s>The DNA of CD8 + CD44 + memory T cells had efficiently been alkylated by CyP, since stimulating them with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 revealed that they were no longer able to expand (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2G</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Becker et al. had observed prominent proliferation of CD8</head><p><s>+ memory T cells in all tissues, including spleen and BM, after adoptive transfer of splenic CD8 + memory T cells, labeled with CFSE, into naïve mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</s><s>It is interesting to note that some of these splenic CD8 + memory T cells after transfer efficiently homed to all tissues analyzed, and were readily detectable in lung, liver, lymph nodes, BM, and spleen.</s><s>The continued proliferation of these adoptively transferred splenic CD8 + memory T cells over 15 to 25 days in spleen and BM of the recipients is in line with the present finding that some splenic CD8 + memory T cells are maintained by proliferation in vivo.</s><s>The present data also indicate that only 50% of the splenic CD8 + memory T cells are maintained by proliferation.</s><s>Treatment of mice with CyP for 7 or 14 days both reduced the numbers of splenic CD8 + memory T cells by 50% (  and 2D), suggesting that the other 50% are resistant to CyP, i.e. resting in terms of proliferation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks</head><p><s>In summary, the present data show that the BM is a privileged site for the maintenance of CD8 + memory T lymphocytes as cells resting in terms of proliferation.</s><s>Blocking circulation of memory CD8 + T cells with FTY720 also suggests that most if not all BM CD8 + memory T cells are resident, at least for the time of observation.</s><s>The data support the concept of "resting and resident" memory T cells rather than the concept of "cycling and circulating" memory T cells.</s><s>The data also suggest that the reactive immunological memory of patients treated with CyP can be severely impaired.</s><s>Like long-lived memory plasma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21]</ref>, CD8 + memory T cells of the BM are resistant to CyP, in their resting state.</s><s>If reactivated, however, they will not be able to mount an efficient secondary immune response.</s></p></div>
