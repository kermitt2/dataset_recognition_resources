<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technical validation</head><p><s>The GA 2 LEN chamber consists of 2 standard 24-feet-high cubic containers forming a compound of 7.45 m 3 4.90 m 3 2.86 m.</s><s>One container accommodates an office and changing room (A), and the other (B) houses the test chamber itself and the installations for air conditioning (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>When set up, the containers are interlocked, forming an interconnected compound, allowing access to the test chamber through the changing room.</s><s>Even though the GA 2 LEN chamber consists of 2 containers, it can be transported by a single truck equipped with a crane.</s><s>Minimal requirements are necessary for the onsite setup, which requires only external electricity (or a generator), to ensure the GA 2 LEN chamber can be operated at a maximum number of trial sites.</s><s>The test chamber can accommodate up to 9 patients plus a nurse or a doctor, providing chairs that are recommended for a seating time of up to 12 hours, with adjustable footrests and surfaces that can be sanitized.</s><s>Each chair has its own tablet holder.</s><s>The chairs are at fixed positions but can be removed for full cleaning (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The airflow in the test chamber was designed to be as low as possible, meaning not recognizable, at each seating position to not create any adverse reactions because of airflow (eg, feeling of nasal obstruction or eye reddening) but still create sufficient air exchange to keep CO 2 and O 2 at comfortable levels.</s><s>Nevertheless, the air conditioning installed allows the chamber temperature to be adjustable from 158C to 358C, whereas relative humidity levels can be set from 30% to 80% (noncondensing).</s><s>Gas levels, namely oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone, are constantly monitored and recorded.</s><s>The outside air is filtered by using a multistage filter system, removing more than 99% of particles smaller than 1 mm (and all allergens) from the air.</s></p><p><s>Because of the air conditioning capability and the extensive insulation, experiments can be performed at outside temperatures of 2108C to 358C, whereas outside relative humidity can be handled from 20% to 80%.</s><s>The test chamber is monitored by cameras and microphones.</s><s>This allows doctors and nurses to also monitor the patients remotely throughout the test procedure while being located in the office room of the GA 2 LEN chamber.</s><s>If agreed to by signed consent, visual and audio data are also recorded.</s><s>These recordings can be used to validate symptom scores, such as number of sneezes.</s></p><p><s>Because of the limited seating available in the exposure chamber, a fast turnaround time, meaning the time from ending one test until being able to start another test, is necessary to enable several test runs within a day.</s><s>The major issue contributing to the turnaround time is the necessity to run the To reduce the cleaning time, the GA 2 LEN chamber is not flushed with pollen, which would result in pollen sticking to every surface in the room, including the ceiling and walls.</s><s>In the GA 2 LEN chamber pollen is dispersed only where the subjects are seated, and the chamber airflow is designed so that no other surfaces can be reached by the pollen, except the subjects' chairs, tablet holders, the floor directly beneath the subjects, and the subjects themselves.</s><s>Therefore the subjects are required to wear clean-room apparel to minimize the amount of pollen adhering to the patient when leaving the chamber.</s></p><p><s>Wearing clean-room apparel also prevents other aeroallergens from being introduced into the chamber.</s><s>The floor is laid out as a double flooring, and therefore pollen reaching the floor will fall through a metal grid, which makes up the upper floor.</s><s>Pollen falling through the grid will then be either sucked through the exhaust air outlet and then removed by filtering the air or will stick to the lower surface.</s><s>The airflow design in the chamber prevents the pollen from refloating.</s><s>Not only does this approach allow for faster back-to-back testing, it also allows for individualized testing, especially for research purposes, where there are smaller cohorts but multiple differently parametrized exposures.</s><s>The GA 2 LEN chamber dispersal system is designed to have a dedicated particle dispersal unit (PDU) placed above each chair, with its nozzle positioned in a way that the particle concentration in the breathable air of a patient seated underneath is constant in a distinct region.</s><s>This region is thoroughly confined, so that the particles dispersed from 1 PDU are not able to be inhaled by a patient at another seat.</s><s>The height of the chair is adjusted when a patient is seated, so that the nostrils of the patient are at a defined level, which is called the calibrated exposure height.</s><s>Breathable air is defined as the 2 L of air surrounding the upper airway organs during each breath intake.</s><s>Because the patient can move around (not by moving the chair but by moving the upper body), the breathable air is actually defined as an ellipse of 40 cm 3 30 cm around the nose and mouth at calibrated exposure height.</s><s>The PDU takes particles from a blister and disperses these particles through a nozzle.</s><s>A blister in this case is made of 2 sealed stripes with a single-layer (height) particle line in between.</s><s>The width of the line is controlled with narrow margins in the blistering process.</s><s>Before dispersal, each particle is photographed and counted.</s><s>Each image is stored for later quality assurance tasks.</s><s>Because of previous individually performed calibrations, the defined and required particle concentration in the patient's breathable air can be controlled easily by the speed at which the blister is emptied.</s><s>A PDU can generate a particle concentration from 100 particles per cubic meter of breathable air up to 15,000 particles per cubic meter during a time frame of up to 8 hours.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Clinical tests performed in the new GA 2 LEN mobile chamber showed high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.</s><s>Allergic patients had a highly significant response compared with patients exposed to placebo, whereas nonallergic patients showed no response in terms of TNSSs.</s><s>VAS scores observed in our validation study indicate that patients included in this study could be classified as having ''mild-to-moderate rhinitis'' according to the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma Guidelines, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18</ref> as stated by Bousquet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19</ref> This is important because the difference from placebo is generally statistically less pronounced than in severely affected patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref></s><s>TNSSs observed in our study are comparable with those reported by Hohlfeld et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> with the same scoring system and at the same pollen concentration.</s><s>A minimum placebo response was observed in the placeboexposed patients.</s><s>This has been observed before, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and it is well known that the placebo effect is particularly relevant in allergy trials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23</ref></s><s> avoid subjective biases, we assessed the reproducibility in the GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> LEN chamber with subjective and objective parameters, VAS scores and PNIF values, in 2 subsequent visits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref></s><s>VAS scores have been found to correlate with disease severity and to detect the variations of symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis with high sensitivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26</ref></s><s>PNIF measurement is a very effective tool for assessing the severity of congestion in allergic rhinitis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28</ref> and nasal flow has also been evaluated by Krug et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref> for validation of the Fraunhofer chamber.</s><s>In our study both VAS scores and PNIFs showed comparable results between the 2 subsequent exposures.</s><s>Similar results have been observed in the past with stationary chambers.</s><s>Hohlfeld et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> exposed 60 patients with grass pollen allergy to 4000 grass pollen grains/m 3 in the Fraunhofer ECC on 2 occasions during the pollen season, with 2-week intervals.</s><s>TNSSs were highly reproducible between the 2 exposures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref></s><s>Interestingly, VAS scores reported by Hohlfeld et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> at the end of a 4-hour exposure are comparable with VAS scores observed in our study and were also highly reproducible.</s></p><p><s>Krug et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref> still using the Fraunhofer ECC, found comparable results between 5 consecutive exposures evaluating TNSSs, nasal flow rate, nasal secretion, FEV 1 , and peak expiratory flow, with a grass pollen concentration of 8000 grass pollen grains/m 3 for 4 hours.</s><s>In this study a significant but not clinically relevant reduction was observed in the mean FEV1, indicating a priming effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref></s><s>ll these results confirm that symptoms elicited in consecutive exposures in the GA 2 LEN mobile chamber have the same reproducibility of symptoms provoked in the classic stationary EECs.</s><s>In contrast to previous reports, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29</ref> we did not observe any priming effect, with objective end points in 6 patients challenged on 5 consecutive days.</s><s>This can be due to either the small number of studied patients, the shorter exposure, or lower pollen grains exposure compared with the study by Krug et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref> (2 vs 4 hours; 4000 vs 8000 grass pollen grains/m 3 ) or to the lack of a seasonal exposure, which has been deemed relevant in previous publications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29</ref></s><s>e of the key questions regarding EECs is whether symptoms evoked in the chambers are comparable with those observed during seasonal real-life exposure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30</ref></s><s>Two studies addressed this particular point.</s><s>Jacobs et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31</ref> found a strong correlation between nasal and ocular symptoms reported during natural ragweed exposure and those evoked in an EEC.</s><s>By contrast, Hohlfeld et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> found no correlation between the TNSS evoked at the end of a 4-hour grass pollen exposure in the EEC and symptoms registered during the pollen season.</s><s>However, a good correlation was found with the TNSS registered 24 hours after the challenge.</s><s>The authors concluded that TNSSs after 24 hours better reflect the late-phase reactions occurring during natural pollen exposure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19</ref></s><s>Correlation between the symptoms in the chamber and natural allergen exposure suggests that EECs can be used as a surrogate for the natural allergy season exposure in clinical trials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref></s><s>Field pollen allergy clinical trials suffer from some biases, the most important being the variability of the real allergen exposure of every study site and every single subject included in the studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>Seasonal and local variations (humidity, temperature, local specific pollutants, and different concentrations of major allergens in the pollen) can have a big influence on the pollen counts and symptoms.</s><s>Furthermore, real exposure heavily depends on the lifestyle of the subjects (indoor/outdoor) and indoor environmental exposures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>nother problem is the difficulty of correctly defining the pollen season, with its peak and duration being very different from one year to another and differing by locations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>urthermore, the classic inclusion criteria in clinical trials (skin tests, allergen-specific IgE, and clinical history) are not able to distinguish patients with different levels of symptoms, leading to the inclusion of patients with very low symptom scores, another possible bias cause. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31</ref></s><s>Screening in an EEC, as done previously, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> could overcome this issue by guaranteeing minimal symptoms with exposure according to entry criteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref></s><s>or these reasons, although the European Medicines Agency already accepts the use of provocation tests (nasal, bronchial, conjunctival, or exposure chambers) for phase 2 and dose-finding studies in AIT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> the already mentioned European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology position paper on clinical outcomes in AIT considers the EEC a promising vehicle for phase 3 clinical trials in AIT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref></s><s>Actually, a number of controlled phase 3 and 4 studies are ongoing with antiallergic drugs using exposure chambers. <ref type="bibr">12</ref></s><s>Compared with traditional provocation tests, the EEC allows testing of many patients at the same time in a more natural way and, above all, records all of the elicited organ symptoms, as happens in natural exposure.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, there are also important financial issues.</s><s>The high costs of drug development are mainly based on the costs of the clinical trials, and shorter trials are needed.</s><s>The novel EEC technology has a potential to perform trials more efficiently than field trials because less patients need to be included under standardized conditions.</s><s>Unfortunately, very few such chambers exist in the world today, and comparability studies of individual EEC facilities are lacking because of the great geographic distances between individual pollen chambers and the specific technical features of each EEC facility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref></s><s>hese issues make the required multicenter clinical studies very difficult to perform.</s><s>Thus the mobile GA 2 LEN chamber represents a unique and novel solution to explore the biology of diseases of the airways and potential therapeutic interventions using multiple clinical trial sites to ensure the diversity of populations necessary to better define study end points.</s></p></div><figure
