this has been previously reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>These administration data are consistent with phase 3 open-label extension data that support self-administration of icatibant in clinical practice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>Furthermore, a high rate of self-administration is in keeping with the 2011 indication change to allow icatibant self-administration and would suggest IOS patient acceptance of icatibant self-administration.</s><s>This outcome also may be attributed to the effective adoption among the clinical community of the recent international guideline <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and national consensus documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> that promote early treatment.</s><s>The country-specific differences in self-administration vs. HCP administration may be due in part to physician advice, the aforementioned availability of icatibant or combinations thereof.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, in both Spain and Italy, HCPs administered icatibant earlier than patients self-administered.</s><s>This may reflect local practices and deserves closer inspection.</s><s>Overall, despite the difference in time to treatment between self-administration and HCP administration, time to resolution appears similar between countries.</s><s>The reasons for this are unclear and warrant further investigation.</s></p><p><s>The limitations of this analysis are typical of registry-based studies using data derived from patient recall and treatment outcomes that are, in part, reliant on determination of resolution of an attack that may be open to patient interpretation.</s></p></div>
