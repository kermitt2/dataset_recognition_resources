<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IL-27 treatment influences chemokine but not cytokine levels in the peritoneal cavity</head><p><s>To uncover whether the effects of IL-27 are direct or rely on the induction or suppression of other mediators, we analysed cytokine and chemokine levels in the peritoneal lavage by multiplex immunoassay 12 h after zymosan injection with or without pre-treatment with IL-27 (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4 and 5</ref>).</s><s>At this time point, IL-27 levels were already close to the detection limit, suggesting a rapid resorption of the injected cytokine (200 ng).</s></p><p><s>TNFα can be produced by macrophages, NK cells and T cells, but also by neutrophils <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Levels of TNFα were rather low and not significantly decreased upon IL-27 treatment.</s><s>The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17 produced by T cells is strongly regulated by IL-27 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>However, it can also be produced by NK cells and neutrophils.</s><s>In the peritonitis model studied here, values of IL-17 were near the detection limit and the small decline upon IL-27 treatment was not significant.</s><s>High levels were found for the acute-phase cytokine IL-6 that is mainly produced by macrophages; however, levels were not different between the groups.</s></p><p><s>IL-27 is a known inducer of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10 that in turn dampens inflammation and suppresses immune activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>We found only minute levels of IL-10, which were not influenced by IL-27 pre-treatment, suggesting that IL-10 induction is not a major factor.</s><s>Indeed, blocking with anti IL-10 had no effect on the suppressive action of IL-27 (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the unchanged cytokine levels, several chemokines were found to be reduced upon treatment with IL-27 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>KC / CXCL1, a major neutrophil attractant corresponding to the human IL-8, showed significantly reduced levels in the IL-27 treated mice.</s><s>Similarly, MCP-1 / CCL2 was strongly and MIP-1α / CCL3 markedly reduced.</s><s>Weak or no effects were Significant chemokine levels in the blood plasma (12h) were only detectable upon zymosan treatment and mostly one order of magnitude lower (except KC and RANTES) than in the peritoneal lavage; however, IL-27 treatment resulted only in minor, non-significant decreases of KC or MCP-1 levels (S1 Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>Thus, IL-27 treatment causes a rather discrete suppression of some circulating blood chemokines produced upon zymosan-induced inflammation, including the neutrophil-attracting KC.</s><s>It might be mentioned that also the pattern of chemokines produced by in vitro cultured, zymosan-activated peritoneal macrophages is differentially and to a lesser extent influenced by IL-27 (S2 Fig) <ref type="figure">,</ref> suggesting a more complex action of IL-27 on the cellular environment in vivo.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>While the effects of IL-27 have been widely studied for the adaptive immune system, the regulatory role of IL-27 in the innate immune system is poorly understood.</s><s>We investigated the role of IL-27 in sterile peritonitis induced by injection of zymosan into the peritoneal cavity.</s><s>This well described model features all the mechanisms of an acute innate immune reaction, such as massive infiltration of neutrophils to the site of inflammation.</s><s>As expected, we could observe a strong increase in neutrophil numbers in the peritoneal lavage after zymosan injection with a peak at 12 h.</s><s>Interestingly, co-injection of IL-27 with zymosan did not influence the initial increase in neutrophil numbers, however, at later time points we observed a faster decline in neutrophils.</s></p><p><s>As IL-27 might not necessarily directly affect inflammatory cells but act via induction or repression of proteins yet to be synthesized, such as other cytokines, chemokines or inflammation-related adhesion molecules, more time could be required for IL-27 to become effective.</s><s>Indeed, IL-27 treatment 12 h prior to zymosan injection led to a strong reduction in neutrophil numbers in the peritoneal cavity already at the peak of inflammation.</s><s>Thus, IL-27 reduces the number of neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity at the peak of disease after a lag phase of several hours.</s><s>Both applications of IL-27, either prior or simultaneously to the injection of zymosan, were accelerating the drop of neutrophils after the inflammatory peak.</s><s>Whether the faster clearance of neutrophils from the peritoneal cavity indicates a role of IL-27 in the resolution of the inflammatory process <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, e.g. by stimulating their egress or their apoptosis, remains to be analysed.</s></p><p><s>Suppression of neutrophil accumulation in the peritoneal cavity could be due to inhibition of their recruitment from blood into peritoneal cavity, but also by regulation of their supply from the bone marrow.</s><s>As is known, neutrophil numbers in the blood showed a strong increase after induction of peritonitis with a peak at 12h, similar to the increase in the peritoneum.</s><s>Surprisingly, pre-treatment with IL-27 led also to a pronounced reduction in blood neutrophilia at the peak of inflammation.</s><s>Thus, suppression of neutrophil accumulation in the peritoneal cavity is not simply due to inhibition of their extravasation from blood to peritoneum but rather seems to be controlled at the preceding level, the regulation of neutrophil numbers in the circulation.</s><s>It might be mentioned that this early effect is unlikely to be due to an acceleration of the resolution process.</s></p><p><s>Neutrophils are mainly produced and stored in the bone marrow; upon inflammation, increased numbers are released into the circulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>This was also found here: blood levels paralleled the kinetics of neutrophil accumulation in the peritoneum, while frequencies of neutrophils in the bone marrow were concomitantly reduced and later recovered.</s><s>Pre-treatment with IL-27 led to a significantly decreased loss of neutrophils from the bone marrow as early as 4 h after induction of peritonitis.</s><s>This suggests that the diminution both of neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum and of blood levels by IL-27 treatment is caused by a decreased release of the cells from the bone marrow.</s><s>We cannot exclude that IL-27, beyond regulating the exit from the bone marrow, also influences the migration of neutrophils into other organs that have been described as margination sites of neutrophils <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>How IL-27 controls neutrophil release from the bone marrow is not clear so far.</s><s>Inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, known to augment release of neutrophils into the blood stream <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, were not affected by IL-27 treatment under our conditions.</s><s>This is consistent with recent findings of Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> showing that IL-27 treatment does not regulate TNF-levels in human neutrophils.</s></p><p><s>However, marked drops in the level of distinct chemokines in the peritoneal fluid were found here.</s><s>Interestingly, a role of chemokines has also been discussed for the emigration process of leukocytes from the bone marrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>We observed significantly reduced levels of KC, MCP-1 and MIP-1α in the peritoneal exudate at the inflammatory peak for IL-27 treated mice, whereas other chemokines showed no differences.</s><s>Indeed, it has been shown previously that blockade of KC by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) resulted in reduced neutrophil counts both in blood and peritoneal fluid.</s><s>Vice versa, treatment with KC increased the number of neutrophils in blood and lowered their numbers in bone marrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>These findings are reminiscent to findings of another study reporting chemerin-related agents to be effective in blocking neutrophil recruitment while also reducing, albeit less selectively, the levels of several cytokines and chemokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is puzzling, however, that the reduction of KC, MCP-1 or MIP-1α in serum was less clear or not observed.</s><s>Therefore, it remains unclear whether the strong decrease of these chemokines in the peritoneum is responsible for their decreased mobilization from the bone marrow or whether this only contributes to a reduced recruitment into the inflamed site.</s><s>Alternatively, IL-27 might suppress other systemic mediators involved in neutrophil mobilization such as leukotrienes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, or might act directly on constitutive chemokine-or adhesion molecule-regulated trapping of neutrophils in their bone marrow niches.</s></p><p><s>The delay in the biological effects of IL-27 suggests that a direct effect on zymosan-induced chemokine production is not the key mechanism.</s><s>Rather, IL-27 could induce an intermediate suppressive factor, such as IL-10, which was, however, not changed.</s><s>We could not find a change in the expression of the zymosan receptor, TLR2, or of CD11b as one important adhesion molecule of neutrophils under the influence of IL-27 (S3 and S4 Figs).</s><s>Most likely, IL-27 could affect the final maturation and/or migratory activity of neutrophils in the bone marrow and thereby alter the levels of circulating neutrophils a couple of hours later.</s></p><p><s>Thus, the data of this study uncovers a novel mechanism how IL-27 is able to suppress inflammatory reactions by modulating the release of leukocytes from the bone marrow.</s><s>Although we would not exclude additional effects of reduced chemokine levels on the extravasation of neutrophils towards the inflamed peritoneum, decreased neutrophil levels in the blood are sufficient to explain the reduced accumulation in the peritoneal fluid.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this study reveals that IL-27 has a distinct impact on the innate arm of inflammatory responses, which are independent from its well described effects on T cells.</s><s>The results extend our previous findings in an influenza infection model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and suggest that application of IL-27 might represent an interesting therapeutic option to control leukocytemediated immunopathology in infectious or sterile inflammatory diseases.</s><s>In addition, our findings uncover a novel mechanism of anti-inflammatory cytokines by showing that IL-27 is able to suppress inflammatory reactions by stopping the enhanced release of neutrophils from the bone marrow.</s><s>Peritoneal exudate cells were isolated and cultured at a final concentration of 2 x 10 6 cells/ml cRPMI (RPMI 1640 (Gibco 1 ) plus 10% FCS (vol/vol) and
