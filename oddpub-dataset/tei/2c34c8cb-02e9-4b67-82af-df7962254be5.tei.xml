outcome parameters complicate the interpretation of previously reported positive findings.</s><s>Several reasons why our study failed to show differences between active and sham rTMS can be considered.</s><s>The duration of our intervention might account for the negative finding as cognitive performance was tested before and after rTMS within a timeframe of 5 weeks to 3 months (last follow-up at day 105).</s><s>This observation period may have been too short to evaluate changes in cognitive performance.</s><s>A network meta-analysis indicates that in antipsychotic trials, an intervention period of at least 6 months is needed to detect possible changes in cognitive assessments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Furthermore, the effect of practice (eg, exposure, familiarity, procedural learning) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> needs to be taken into consideration.</s><s>Our participants received several testing sessions within 3 months and it is likely that many patients were tested previously in regular clinical care.</s><s>The practice-related increase in cognitive performance in both groups would result in a reduction of the active sham-difference, making it difficult to disentangle an effect of active rTMS.</s><s>The application of cognitive paradigms less sensitive to practice effects such as randomized n-back task with high load (3-back) or a facial recognition task <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> may be more suited to detecting differences between groups.</s><s>On the other hand, there is a clear, consensus-based recommendation concerning cognitive tests to be used in schizophrenia trials, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> and the cognitive domains investigated here as well the tests used have a significant overlap with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery.</s><s>The application of more comprehensive and broader cognitive battery may have resulted in different findings.</s><s>Our assessments cover the main domains of impaired cognition in schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> and we had no rationale for the use of other tests.</s><s>However, the neurocognitive outcome was a secondary outcome and other trials showing a beneficial effect of rTMS on cognition in schizophrenia used higher stimulation frequencies or longer stimulation periods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref></s><s>Both factors may also contribute to the negative finding observed in our trial.</s><s>The study has several limitations.</s><s>As outlined elsewhere, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> focus on less-affected, early episode patients, longer stimulation periods, application of more rTMS stimuli and a higher stimulation frequency may have led to different results.</s><s>At present, there is still no consensus about the optimal stimulation parameters for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and further research is needed.</s><s>From a methodological perspective, our sham condition (45° tilted coil) and the use of the EEG-10/20 system can be discussed as further limitations.</s><s>For sham rTMS, different methods including sham coils not producing any magnetic field, 45°-90° tilted active coils, and active coils placed at noninvolved cortical regions are available. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref></s><s>The 45° tilted coil method was chosen for this study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> as it results in similar skin sensations with substantially reduced biological activity compared with active rTMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> and our analysis of blinding integrity showed that neither patients nor raters were able to distinguish between active and sham rTMS (see Wobrock et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> ).</s><s>We used the EEG-10/20 method to determine the position of the left DLPFC.</s><s>Despite the fact that most studies in the field use the same approach, the application of neuronavigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> or improved F3 localization (eg, BeamF3 heuristic) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39</ref> could have helped to reveal a beneficial effect of active rTMS.</s><s>A coil placement using individual structural or functional images has the potential to reduce the variability within and across subjects, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> but further research is needed to clarify the importance and the cost-effectiveness of such approaches in the context of therapeutic noninvasive brain stimulation.</s><s>More specific limitations relate to the absence of a specific effect of rTMS on general psychopathology and the predominant negative symptoms in our sample.</s><s>Both groups showed an improvement in PANSS, depression ratings, and global functioning, with no between-group differences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s>Correlation analyses could not establish a relationship between symptomatic and cognitive outcome in our sample of severely affected patients suffering from predominant negative symptoms.</s><s>Dependent on the cognitive test, inconsistent correlations between negative symptoms (assessed by PANSS) and cognitive measures were reported, possibly based on the limited assessment of verbal output in the PANSS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Therefore, the use of PANSS might have concealed possible correlations of symptomatic and cognitive outcomes in our trial.</s><s>Although negative symptoms and cognitive deficits show moderate correlations in meta-analyses, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40</ref> and we investigated patients with prominent negative symptoms, the present findings cannot directly be generalized to the wider group of patients with schizophrenia.</s><s>From a statistical perspective, the large SDs across subjects and study sites might explain the lack of significance in the linear mixed models.</s><s>The direction of effect sizes (positive effect size favoring active rTMS; negative effect size favoring sham rTMS; table <ref type="table">2</ref>) of nonsignificant interactions suggests a tendency towards superiority of active rTMS in certain cognitive domains.</s><s>Furthermore, one could only speculate whether the combination of rTMS with other methods to improve cognition in schizophrenia (eg, cognitive remediation) would be more effective than rTMS alone.</s><s>Finally, it remains unclear whether a focus on social cognition rather than on neurocognition would have been a more promising strategy to show a beneficial effect of rTMS in our sample of schizophrenia patients suffering from predominant negative symptoms.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we present the first multicenter, largescale evaluation of 3-week 10-Hz rTMS applied on cognitive symptoms in a sample of well-characterized schizophrenia patients with predominant negative symptoms.</s><s>Although we were not able to reveal a significant difference between active and sham rTMS, analyses of effect sizes indicate that further investigations are warranted.</s><s>More multicenter randomized clinical trials are needed in the field of noninvasive brain stimulation to confirm or to disprove findings from small proof-ofconcept trials.</s><s>Finally, our results are in line with several other negative reports on biological and nonbiological interventions illustrating the difficulty of treating cognitive symptoms in
