association signature of the COBLL1/GRB14 locus is consistent with the observation that its BF% increasing allele is associated with a lower WHR adjBMI , corresponding to a proportionally lower abdominal and higher gluteal fat accumulation and, at nominal significance, with SAT but not with the metabolically more harmful VAT.</s><s>The COBLL1/GRB14 association signature is similar to that of the near-IRS1 locus (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">12 and 13</ref>), and suggest that the beneficial cardiometabolic effects

overlap.</s><s>We identified variants in LD (r 2 40.7, 1000 Genomes Project Pilot, EUR) with each of the 12 GWS-index SNPs and tested for overlap between these variants and elements from regulatory datasets.</s><s>In total, 746 variants at the 12 GWS-index loci were examined for overlap with regulatory elements in 181 data sets (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">18 and 19</ref>) from five tissues (blood, brain, liver, adipose tissue and pancreatic islets).</s><s>These data sets, downloaded from the ENCODE Consortium and Roadmap Epigenomics Projects, identify regions of open chromatin (DNase-seq, FAIRE-seq), histone modification signal enrichment (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K4me2), and transcription factor binding in cell lines and tissues believed to influence BF%.</s><s>When available, we downloaded data processed as a part of the ENCODE Integrative Analysis.</s><s>Roadmap Epigenomics sequencing data were processed with MACS2 and the same irreproducible discovery rate pipeline used in the ENCODE Integrative analysis when multiple data sets were available, or MACS2 alone when only a single replicate was available.</s></p><p><s>Pol2

CRTC1.</s><s>Pol2 binding data uniformly processed as part of the ENCODE Integrative analysis were download for 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines (GM10847, GM12878, GM12891, GM12892, GM15510, GM18505, GM18526, GM18951, GM19099, GM19193).</s><s>We examined the alleles present at these variants in Pol2 ChIP-seq alignment BAM files to determine sample genotypes and compared these with genotypes generated by the 1000 Genomes Project for the same samples.</s><s>For the eight samples also genotyped by the 1000 Genomes Project, genotype calls were 100% concordant.</s><s>Correlation between genotype and Pol2 binding signal at each SNP was calculated in R using a linear model (signalBgenotype).</s></p><p><s>RegulomeDB annotation.</s><s>We further characterized the variants at selected loci using the web-based tool RegulomeDB (http://regulomedb.org/).</s><s>The reference sequence identifiers of variants that overlap two or more regulatory elements in the same tissue were used to conduct the RegulomeDB search.</s></p><p><s>Pathway, network and tissue-enrichment analysis.</s><s>To define pathways, networks and tissue enrichment, we extended the list of genome-wide significant loci to also include loci that showed putative (Po1 Â 10 À 5 ) association with BF% (using the same criteria described above to define independent loci).</s><s>As such loci, represented by 43 index SNPs, were considered for gene prioritization, pathway enrichment (DEPICT, Ingenuity Pathway Analyses), gene relationship analysis (GRAIL) and protein-protein interaction analyses (DAPPLE).</s></p><p><s>Data-driven enrichment prioritized integration for complex traits.</s><s>Details of this method are provided in Pers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref></s><s>DEPICT is designed to systematically identify the most likely causal gene at a given locus, to test gene sets for enrichment for genetic associations, and to identify tissues and cell types in which genes from associated loci are highly expressed.</s></p><p><s>DEPICT assigned genes to the 43 associated loci if the genes resided within the associated LD region (r 2 40.5) of a given associated SNP.</s><s>After merging overlapping regions and discarding regions that mapped within the extended major histocompatibility complex locus, we were left with 42 non-overlapping regions that covered a total of 82 genes.</s><s>We then used DEPICT to test enrichment at these loci for a total of 14,461 reconstituted gene sets, and for 209 tissue and cell type annotations.</s></p><p><s>Ingenuity pathway analyses.</s><s>We used HaploReg v2 (http://www.broadinstitute.</s><s>org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php) and adopted a stringent LD (r 2 40.8 in 1000 Genome phase 1 EUR) to extract all the nearby genes (88 genes in total) of the index SNPs based on both GENCODE and RefSeq.</s><s>For 65 out of them, they were successfully mapped to the Ingenuity Knowledge Base, and those unmapped genes are mainly lincRNA, miRNA, antisense or processed transcript genes derived from GENCODE.</s><s>The 65 genes were incorporated into Ingenuity Canonical pathway enrichment analysis.</s><s>The P values are calculated based on Fisher's right-tailed exact test.</s><s>The default settings were used for Ingenuity Interaction network analysis.</s></p><p><s>Gene relationships among implicated loci.</s><s>The GRAIL was used to examine relationships between genes.</s><s>For each query and seed SNP, we adopted the default methods implemented in GRAIL to extract the genes around each index SNP: that is, (1) we first identified neighboring SNPs in the 3 0 and 5 0 direction in LD (r 2 40.5, CEU HapMap), proceeding outwards in each direction to the nearest recombination hotspots to define an interval region, and extracted all the genes in this interval; (2) if there are no genes in that interval region, the interval is extended an additional 250 kb in either direction.</s><s>The 12 GWS-index SNP regions were input as seed regions, and the regions for the remaining 31 SNPs were input as query regions.</s><s>Connections between genes were inferred from textual relationships based on published scientific text using PubMed abstracts as of December 2006.</s><s>The significant gene similarity was declared based on P GRAIL o0.01.</s></p><p><s>Disease association protein-protein link evaluator.</s><s>The DAPPLE package was used to examine the potential encoded protein-protein interaction evidence for the genes located in the 43 associated loci.</s><s>Genes from 32 of the 43 loci were annotated in the high-confidence pair-wise interaction InWeb database.</s><s>Both the direct and indirect interactions were considered.</s><s>The running settings were 1,000 permutation, common interactor binding degree ¼ 2, and 110 kb upstream and 40 kb downstream to define a gene' residence.</s></p><p><s>Drosophila knockdown experiments.</s><s>Genome-wide screen.</s><s>We first identified all genes within ± 500 kb of the 12 GWS-index SNPs, and subsequently identified the corresponding Drosophila orthologues available in the ensembl orthologue database

crosses of male UAS-RNAi flies from the VDRC and Hsp70-GAL4; Tub-GAL8ts virgins females.</s><s>Two-to-five-dayold males were sorted into groups of 20 and subjected to two 1-h wet heatshocks 4 days apart.</s><s>On the seventh day, flies were picked in groups of eight, manually crushed and sonicated, and the lysates heat-inactivated for 10 min in a thermocycler at 95 °C.</s><s>Centrifuge-cleared supernatants were then used for triglyceride (GPO Trinder, Sigma) and protein (Pierce) determination.</s><s>Triglyceride values from these adult-induced ubiquitous RNAi knockdown individuals were normalized to those obtained in parallel from non-heatshocked progeny from the very same crosses.</s></p><p><s>Targeted follow-up.</s><s>Based on known biology, one to three potential candidate genes within ± 500 kb of the 12 GWS-index SNPs were selected.</s><s>Corresponding Drosophila orthologues were available for 11 loci, but no orthologue exists for FTO (Supplementary Table <ref type="table"

triglyceride assay in the adult, male RNAi flies were crossed with w; tub-gal4 tub-gal80ts/TM6 virgins.</s><s>Progenies were kept in 16 °C until enclosure.</s><s>Adults were transferred to 25 °C for 2

Reagent kit (Thermo Fisher #TR22321) on whole-animal homogenates of groups of three animals.</s><s>Proteins from the same homogenates were measured using the Pierce BCA protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific #23227).</s><s>Triglycerides were normalized by proteins.</s><s>Data were average of three experiments.</s><s>The fractional changes in triglyceride content in adult male flies between
