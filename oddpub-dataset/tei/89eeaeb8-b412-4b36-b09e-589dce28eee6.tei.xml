imaging studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Nguyen et al., 2017)</ref> have revealed a multitude of diverse structural brain changes that result from prenatal alcohol exposure.</s><s>These structural changes include microencephaly, neuronal ectopia, cerebellar hypoplasia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, reductions in gray matter and white matter volumes, altered cortical connectivity, and many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fryer et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>These differences in structural abnormalities are often paralleled by differences in neurological and cognitive deficits, so that ataxia is the most prominent symptom in some affected children, while behavior problems, attention deficit disorder, epilepsy, or learning problems are most notable in others <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boronat et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Glass et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Infante et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>This diversity in outcomes is likely due to several factors.</s><s>Among these are differences in the dose, pattern, and gestational timing of alcohol ingestion, as well as differences in maternal health, nutrition, and co-exposures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bonthius and West, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Shor et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Coles et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gibon and Barker, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Some of these endogenous prosurvival factors can protect developing brain cells against the neurotoxic effects of alcohol <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bonthius et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Boschen and Klintsova, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the expression of these factors and their receptors is genetically determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Zunino et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it is likely that genetic differences among individual fetuses in the timing, magnitude, isoform, and spatial expression of these protective factors underlie some of the inter-individual differences in the pattern of neuropathology observed in people with FASD.</s><s>However, to date, there has been no specific gene identified whose mutation renders one brain region more vulnerable to alcohol-induced injury, while leaving another brain region unaffected.</s></p><p><s>Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is one gene that can protect developing neurons against alcohol toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bonthius et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Karacay et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>The protein product of the nNOS gene (the enzyme, nNOS) exerts its protective effect by catalyzing the production of nitric oxide (NO), thus stimulating the neuroprotective NO-cGMP-PKG pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bonthius et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>However, the nNOS gene is not expressed in all neuronal populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Yuan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jinno and Kosaka, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gotti et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it is possible that neuronal populations lacking nNOS will be particularly vulnerable to alcoholinduced cell death.</s><s>One goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that a neuronal population not expressing nNOS will have more alcohol-induced cell death than a neuronal population that does express the protein.</s></p><p><s>Numerous studies have shown that mouse neurons carrying a null mutation of the nNOS gene (nNOS−/−) have an increased vulnerability to alcohol-induced neuronal death <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bonthius et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Karacay et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>This reflects the fact that those neuronal populations rely upon nNOS for neuroprotection.</s><s>The null mutation of nNOS deprives those neurons of the protective mechanism that they would employ to promote their survival.</s><s>However, because some neuronal populations do not normally express nNOS, null mutation of nNOS should not deprive the non-expressing neurons of neuroprotection and should not affect their survival.</s><s>As a result, nNOS null mutations may greatly increase the vulnerability of some brain regions to alcohol toxicity, while not affecting others, thus potentially providing an example of genotype-dependent patterns of alcohol neuropathology.</s><s>The second goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that null mutation of the nNOS gene will substantially increase the vulnerability of neurons in which nNOS is normally expressed, while having no effect on neurons in which nNOS is not normally expressed.</s></p></div>

cutting of sections-After reaching adulthood (PD 110-122), the mice were weighed, anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, and perfused with paraformaldehyde fixative, as described above.</s><s>The brains were removed and stored in fixative at 4°C for at least 24 hours.</s></p><p><s>The right olfactory bulb and the brain stem were isolated from the rest of the brain to allow stereological cell counts of olfactory bulb granule neurons and neurons of the facial nerve nucleus.</s><s>These particular neuronal populations were chosen for analysis and comparison because of the immunohistochemistry results (shown below) demonstrating that, in wild type animals, granule neurons of the olfactory bulb express nNOS throughout postnatal development, while neurons of the facial nucleus do not express nNOS at any postnatal age.</s></p><p><s>For cryoprotection, the right olfactory bulbs and brain stems were placed in a 30% sucrose solution in phosphate buffer and gently rocked continuously on a rocker table at room temperature for 48 hrs.</s><s>The cryoprotected tissues were positioned on the stage of a freezing microtome and cut exhaustively at 40um.</s><s>The olfactory bulbs were cut in

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This study revealed four important new findings.</s><s>First, neurons of the facial nucleus do not express nNOS, yet they are not more vulnerable to alcohol than olfactory bulb granule cells, which do express nNOS.</s><s>This finding demonstrates that, while nNOS expression is protective against alcohol toxicity, cell populations are not necessarily more vulnerable to alcohol in its absence.</s><s>Second, the mutation of a single gene can substantially impact the regional pattern of neuropathology induced by alcohol within the developing brain.</s><s>This finding may help to explain why certain brain regions are highly affected in some cases of human FAS while different brain regions are affected in others.</s><s>Third, null mutation of the nNOS gene does not increase the vulnerability of all neuronal populations to alcoholinduced cell death.</s><s>In particular, neurons of the facial nerve nucleus are not more susceptible to alcohol toxicity in nNOS−/− mice than in wild type.</s><s>This is the first example of a brain region whose vulnerability to alcohol during development is not enhanced by the deletion of nNOS.</s><s>Fourth, null mutation of the nNOS gene greatly increases the vulnerability of olfactory bulb granule cells to alcohol-induced cell death.</s><s>Following high-dose alcohol exposure, olfactory bulb granule cells have three times greater cell losses in mice deficient for nNOS than in wild type mice.</s><s>This finding expands the list of neuronal populations whose vulnerability to alcohol is enhanced by genetic deficiency of nNOS <ref type="bibr">(Karacay et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bonthius et al., 2015;</ref><ref

populations that do not express nNOS than in cell populations that do express nNOS.</s><s>The facial nucleus was designated as the nNOS-negative population, while the olfactory bulb granule cells were designated as the nNOS-positive population.</s><s>Thus, the hypothesis predicted that, in wild type mice, alcohol-induced cell losses would be greater in the facial nucleus neurons than in the olfactory bulb granule cells.</s><s>However, this was not the case.</s><s>For the wild type mice, cell losses in the facial nucleus were not significantly different from those in the olfactory bulb.</s><s>Therefore, the results did not support the hypothesis that absence of nNOS expression worsens neuronal vulnerability to alcohol in wild type mice.</s></p><p><s>The second principal hypothesis examined in this study was that null mutation of the nNOS gene would worsen alcohol-induced cell losses to a greater extent in cell populations that normally express nNOS than in those that don't.</s><s>This hypothesis predicts that the nNOS null mutation will worsen alcohol-induced cell losses to a greater extent in olfactory bulb granule cells than in facial nerve nucleus neurons.</s><s>The results strongly supported this hypothesis.</s><s>In the olfactory bulb granule cell population, alcohol led to significantly greater percent cell losses in the nNOS−/− mice than in the wild type mice for both alcohol doses.</s><s>In contrast, in the facial nucleus, alcohol-induced cell losses were virtually equivalent in the two genotypes.</s><s>Furthermore, in the nNOS−/− mice that received the high alcohol dose, neuronal losses in the olfactory granule cell population were more than twice as severe as in the facial nucleus.</s><s>Thus, mutation of the nNOS gene worsened the adverse effects of alcohol on the developing brain, but the effect was region-dependent.</s><s>The effect was seen in olfactory bulb granule cells, where nNOS is normally expressed during development, but not in the facial nucleus, where nNOS is not expressed.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the results demonstrated that lack of nNOS does not increase vulnerability to alcohol in a neuronal population in which nNOS is not normally expressed (such as the facial nucleus neurons).</s><s>However, null mutation of nNOS does increase vulnerability to alcohol in neuronal populations in which nNOS is normally expressed (such as the olfactory bulb granule cells).</s></p><p><s>Since the initial descriptions of fetal alcohol syndrome in the 1970s, it has been repeatedly observed that affected
