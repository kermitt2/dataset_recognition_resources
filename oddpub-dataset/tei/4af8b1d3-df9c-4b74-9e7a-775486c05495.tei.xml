<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Probiotic feed supplementation of sows during pregnancy and lactation has been shown to affect the piglets' intestinal microbiota and the mucosal cytokine levels during the suckling period <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</s><s>Early environmental contact and oral uptake of microorganisms excreted with the sow's feces would be one possible explanation for this observation.</s><s>However, an altered composition of the sow milk could also be an additional possibility.</s></p><p><s>Milk has been found to influence the neonate's development through additional factors other than nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and water.</s><s>Milk harbors bacteria, antibacterial substances such as lysozyme and lactoferrin, antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, and hormones which are known to be important for the immune defense and the development of the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of the offspring [reviewed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>].</s><s>Furthermore, milk contains maternal immune cells and epithelial cells.</s><s>It has been shown that maternal lymphoid cells, delivered through milk, cross the piglets' intestinal epithelium and are transported to the mesenteric lymph nodes, where they support the piglets' developing immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>There is evidence to suggest that factors in milk also play a regulatory role in the naïve neonatal immune system.</s><s>Immunological experience with dietary antigens by the sow is likely to be important for tolerance induction in the offspring, and the ability to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria appears to be affected by substances delivered through milk <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, in addition to supporting the piglets' immune system, the immunological components in the milk are also involved in protection of the mammary gland itself.</s><s>The mucosal surface of the lactiferous gland is vulnerable to microbial infections, and increased numbers of immune cells could also indicate acute infection.</s><s>In dairy science, determination of somatic cell counts, defined as all cells other than germ or stem cells originating from the cow, has become the gold standard for milk quality.</s><s>The somatic cell counts recorded for swine milk varies between 2.5 × 10 8 and 5 × 10 9 cells/L, which is considered to be relatively high <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>In cow milk, cell counts above 2 × 10 8 /L indicate bacterial infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>The cellular composition of sow milk has been investigated in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Notably, after the first week of lactation, the majority of cells in the sow mammary secretions are reported to be of epithelial origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>This is in contrast to milk from healthy cows, where 80% of the somatic cells are immune cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</s><s>Although epithelial cells are a major component of pig milk, the function of these cells in the piglets is poorly investigated, and the responsiveness of the sow's mammary epithelial cells to external influences such as probiotic feed supplementation has not been examined.</s></p><p><s>The epithelial cells of the mammary gland of mice express mCD14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, which acts as a co-receptor for the detection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) together with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).</s><s>Furthermore, the milk of mice, humans, horses, and cattle also harbors soluble CD14 (sCD14) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s>Soluble CD14 has been observed to reduce inflammation in the mammary gland and is believed to prevent excessive intestinal inflammation in newborns <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>.</s><s>In vitro, sCD14 induces B-cell growth and differentiation independently of activated T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Fetal IECs express TLR4 and are hyperresponsive to LPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>In mice, sCD14 reduces inflammatory responses by blocking circulating LPS thereby limiting the amount of monocyte-bound LPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>With regard to swine, neither the presence of sCD14 in sow milk nor the expression of mCD14 on the porcine mammary epithelial cell has previously been shown.</s><s>As CD14 expression can be up-regulated by bacterial LPS on macrophages at other mucosal surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, we were interested to know whether the epithelial cells in porcine milk are mCD14 + and whether these cells can be affected by probiotic feed supplementation.</s><s>To address this issue and to investigate whether the expression of CD14 in the sow milk can be affected by probiotic treatment, we performed a feeding trial with Enterococcus faecium and determined the concentration of various nutrients (fat, protein, and lactose), as well as the total somatic cell numbers.</s><s>Using flow cytometry, the proportion of the total leukocytes, the portion of myeloid immune cells, and the percentage of somatic cells lacking the leukocyte common antigen were analyzed in porcine milk samples.</s><s>The pan leukocyte marker CD45 was used to distinguish between immune cells and cells of epithelial origin in the sow milk.</s><s>CD172a (signal regulatory protein alpha) was used to identify myeloid immune cells.</s><s>Furthermore, the expression of CD14 and CD16 on the milk cells was determined, and we investigated sow milk samples for the presence of sCD14 using Western blot and ELISA.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether a competitive binding of LPS in the gut of the piglets is a possible function of the mCD14 + milk cells, we sought to determine whether other CD14 + cells, either IEC or immune cells in the piglets' intestinal tract, could compete for the binding of LPS.</s><s>An in vitro infection assay was used to investigate whether porcine cells can inhibit an infection of enterocytes with Salmonella typhimurium.</s><s>Furthermore, to investigate the impact of milk on the piglets' intestinal immune system, we monitored the development of immune cells in several compartments.</s><s>Due to the fact that the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are in close contact with both, milk components as well as enterocytes and the intestinal microbiota, we hypothesized that these immune cells could possibly be affected either directly or indirectly in response to changes in bacterial colonization.</s><s>We therefore monitored the development of different lymphocyte populations in the piglets' jejunal epithelium, as well as the ileal mesenteric lymph nodes (IL MLN), and the ileal Peyer's patch (IL PP).</s><s>Finally, we performed a correlation analysis of the milk data with immune cell parameters and intestinal cytokine expression levels (mRNA) in the piglets.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of the cell composition in the sow milk revealed unexpectedly high numbers of mCD14-expressing cells. The proportion of macrophages in cell suspensions of sow milk has been reported</head><p><s>Frontiers in Immunology | Mucosal Immunity  to range from 5 to 9% <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>.</s><s>However, in our milk samples of the control group, an average of 41% of somatic cells was found to be positive for mCD14.</s><s>Simultaneous analysis of CD14 and CD45 revealed that most of the mCD14 + cells were negative for CD45 and thus were neither myeloid nor lymphatic cells.</s><s>As mentioned previously, the majority of the cells in the sow mammary secretions are of epithelial origin after the first week of lactation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>As CD14-expressing epithelial cells have been described for the mammary gland of mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, we assumed that the majority of mCD14 + cells in the porcine milk were also of epithelial origin.</s><s>These large, mononuclear CD14 + cells were morphologically clearly distinguishable from small, mononuclear, CD45 + lymphocytic cells or small, polymorphonuclear granulocytes (Figures <ref type="figure">4A-C</ref>; Plots 2-7 in Supplementary Material).</s><s>At the beginning of lactation period (day 7), a considerable amount of immune cells was detected in the sow milk (above 30% in three animals).</s><s>Unfortunately, the portion of the immune cells expressing CD14 was not determined at this time point.</s><s>However, from the 17th day of lactation, the majority of CD14 + cells in the milk are of epithelial origin, since the percentage of immune cells decreased to an average of less than 6%.</s><s>In a dual staining, the existence of the CD45 − /CD14 + cells was verified via both flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>; Plots 8-13 in Supplementary Material).</s></p><p><s>With regard to the possible function of epithelial mCD14, two possibilities appear plausible.</s><s>The attachment of bacteria to cells released into the milk might represent a cleaning function in the lactiferous glands, i.e., a means of removing bacteria to prevent colonization.</s><s>However, these cells could also have another, additional function in the intestinal tract of the offspring.</s><s>We initially suggested that these cells could possibly inhibit the attachment of bacteria to the LPS receptor expressed on IECs of the new borne piglet and thereby reduce the risk of intestinal inflammation during the first weeks in life.</s><s>In the porcine intestinal epithelial IPEC-J2 cell line, the expression and the regulation of TLR4 after infection with an enteric virus has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>In 35-dayold weaned piglets, a very low level of expression in the jejunal tissue has been reported in comparison to the lung and the spleen <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>We determined the occurrence of CD14 on cells isolated from the intestinal epithelium of suckling and weaned piglets and found only CD45 + immune cells expressing mCD14.</s><s>However, based on our determinations, we cannot exclude the expression of mCD14 on IEC.</s><s>This may depend on the translocation of bacteria through the epithelial barrier and/or contact with the basolateral side of the IEC.</s><s>It may also be the case that mCD14 is not expressed at the surface of IEC but that soluble CD14 (sCD14) is secreted by enterocytes.</s><s>Independent of the presence of CD14 in IEC, we detected a considerable fraction of intraepithelial immune cells expressing mCD14 in the piglets.</s><s>From morphological criteria, these cells were probably neutrophils (Plot 24 in Supplementary Material).</s><s>Thus, regardless of variable levels of expression of mCD14 on enterocytes, a competitive function for the mCD14 + cells from www.frontiersin.org</s><s>sow milk for intestinal LPS may be possible, particularly during gut inflammation.</s><s>It should be mentioned that the values for CD14 + epithelial immune cells in piglets aged 14 days showed large variations (7.8-77.2%),</s><s>and the very high numbers of CD14 + immune cells in two of the young piglets were likely symptoms of a gut inflammation.</s><s>The number of investigated piglets per time point (N = 7) was too low to draw conclusions about the physiological levels of CD14 + cells in the intestinal epithelium of piglets.</s></p><p><s>Our results suggest that the CD14 + milk cells may compete with the piglets' immune cells for the binding of LPS.</s><s>An expression of CD14 by enterocytes was not visible.</s><s>To test the hypothesis of a possible competitive binding of bacterial LPS by milk cells, we performed in vitro assays and found that Salmonella indeed binds to milk cells and that the binding interferes with the in vitro infection of enterocytes IPEC-J2 cells.</s><s>Based on these observations, we suggest an impact of CD14 + milk cells on the piglet's bacterial colonization appears possible.</s><s>It has been reported that feeding of E. faecium to sows led to changes in the bacterial colonization of the sows' as well as of the piglets' intestinal tract <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>A carry-over of bacterial populations from the sow to the offspring has been considered to be likely.</s><s>However, the observed changes of bacterial populations in the piglets did not mirror the quantitative composition of the mothers' microbiota.</s><s>Our new results might suggest that the CD14 + cells in the milk may affect the bacterial communities in the offspring.</s><s>The correlations between CD14 + cells in the milk and the immunological parameters in the piglets might have been indirect effects mediated by a shifted micriobiota.</s></p><p><s>Whether membrane-bound CD14 in vivo reaches the intestinal lumen in an intact form is unknown.</s><s>Experiments with human feces showed that sCD14 was absent from the stools of breast-fed infants.</s><s>In vitro digestion analyses suggested that sCD14 is likely to survive the pepsin digestion but is probably destroyed by pancreatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Based on these findings, the authors concluded that the presence of intact sCD14 in breast milk could promote innate immunity only in the low bacterial density lumen of the upper digestive system.</s><s>To date, the existence of mCD14 in the milk of pigs has not been described, and the stability of the protein in the digestive tract of suckling piglets has not been investigated.</s><s>It therefore remains unclear whether the in vitro results reported here reflect a mechanism that is relevant for in vivo conditions.</s></p><p><s>The possible functions of sCD14 remain controversial.</s><s>It has been reported to have a neutralizing, anti-inflammatory role and protect against LPS-induced cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>.</s><s>In our study, an apparent negative correlation between CD14 + cells and IL-8 expression in the jejunal PP of the piglets was not supported statistically.</s><s>The highly interesting possibility of an anti-inflammatory effect therefore remains an open question.</s><s>Whether CD14 is shed from cells in the sow milk before or after the uptake of the milk by the suckling piglets, is not known.</s><s>Tangible evidence for the presence of sCD14 in swine milk is missing in prior studies.</s><s>Using Western blotting, we were unable to detect a protein band reacting with anti-CD14.</s><s>However, this observation does not provide evidence for the absence of sCD14 in the liquid phase of milk; the epitope may be destroyed under denaturing conditions.</s><s>However, results from ELISA assays led us to conclude that sCD14 is likely not present in porcine milk.</s><s>Based on the observation that bile extract did not improve the detection, it appears improbable that CD14 is retained within micelles.</s><s>However, it may not be solved in the buffer used, but rather remains bound to the cell membranes.</s></p><p><s>The fat globules in milk are initially surrounded by cell membrane which is released from the apical side of the mammary cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s><s>When mammary cells are destroyed or membrane-bound globules break down, the CD14 + membrane fragments can be shed into the milk.</s><s>This we consider to be a likely explanation as to why it has not been possible to stain CD14 + mammary epithelial cells in whole milk.</s><s>The membrane-bound globules and membrane fragments may block the anti-CD14 antibody, and the CD14 + cells in the milk are accompanied by an unknown amount of CD14 + membrane fragments.</s><s>These membrane fragments should be the subject of future investigations.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies with E. faecium fed to sows and piglets did not indicate an impact of the probiotic treatments on the histological structure of the jejunum, in terms of changes in the villus length or depth of the crypts.</s><s>However, an impact on the epithelial immune cells, immune-associated gene expression patterns, as well as on the bacterial colonization has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>.</s><s>In the present feeding study, we observed a positive correlation between CD14 + cells in the milk and the frequencies of CD5 + γδ T cells, determined as a percentage of all intraepithelial immune cells (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Knowledge about the function of porcine intraepithelial γδ T cells remains limited.</s><s>Unlike circulating γδ T cells, they express the natural killer receptor, NKG2D, and are therefore suited for recognition of stressed epithelial cells in the gut <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>.</s><s>In experiments with mice, it has been reported that the absolute numbers of intraepithelial γδ T cells are not affected by microbial colonization <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>.</s><s>As we determined the relative amounts within total IEL, it remains possible that CD14 + in fact hampers the increase of IEL other than γδ T cells.</s><s>However, we were unable to identify a significant negative correlation to any other IEL population in our study.</s><s>Another immunological parameter in piglets that was positively correlated with CD14 + milk cells were CD4 + /CD25med cells in the ileal MLN.</s><s>These cells are reported to be activated T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</s><s>This observation may be linked to significantly higher values of IgM + cells in the IL MLN of the same animal group at a later time point.</s></p><p><s>From in vitro studies, it is known that sCD14 in colostrum and milk is a B-cell mitogen.</s><s>Filipp and co-workers have suggested that it may be important for the activation of B cells before full functional helper T cells are generated <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>The mitogenic impact of CD14 on B cells in vivo proposed by those authors may be supported by our animal study.</s><s>The numbers of CD14 + milk cells were positively correlated with the percentages of activated T cells during the early suckling phase and were also positively correlated with the numbers of IgM-expressing B cells in the IL MLN after weaning.</s><s>In a pediatric study, a similar correlation between sCD14 in the colostrum and the numbers of circulating immunoglobulinsecreting cells in 12-month-old children was found <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</s><s>As piglets are born with a relatively immature adaptive immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, this function may be particularly important for this species during the first weeks in life.</s><s>Furthermore, CD14 + milk cells appear to prevent the in vitro infection of the intestinal epithelium with S. typhimurium.</s><s>The stability of mCD14 transferred into the intestinal tract of the piglet on the surface of fat-producing cells is an Frontiers in Immunology | Mucosal Immunity issue that should be addressed in further in vitro and in vivo investigations.</s></p><p><s>From our work, we conclude that high numbers of epithelial cells expressing mCD14 are indeed present in sow milk, and feeding a probiotic strain of E. faecium to sows changes the composition of the sow milk.</s><s>We observed reduced cell numbers and lower percentages of CD14 + cells in the supplemented animal group.</s><s>Furthermore, the reported early influence of E. faecium on the piglets' immunological development appears, at least to a certain extent, to be transferred by the milk.</s><s>In our study, lower numbers of CD14 + cells in the milk of sows fed with E. faecium were correlated with lower numbers of activated T cells and IgM + B cells in the IL MLN of the offspring.</s><s>However, it remains possible that the observed effects and correlations may have been indirect, mediated by a changed bacterial colonization which was less challenging for the immune system of the piglets.</s><s>While our current study does not allow discrimination between these possibilities, future studies may contribute to a better understanding of the role of probiotics, maternal CD14, and piglet health.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Total
