<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>In order to verify whether an excess mortality related to CSDs and DM exists among PWA, we conducted a nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study.</s><s>Study methods, have been extensively described in a previous paper focused on non-AIDS defining cancers among Italian PWA diagnosed between 2006 and 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, this study is part of an investigation on the survival and mortality patterns of Italian PWA, with nationwide coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Data derived from (a) the National AIDS Registry (RAIDS), which collects data on all people newly diagnosed with AIDS in Italy according to the 1993 revised European definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref> (i.e., RAIDS does not include HIV-infected people without AIDS), and (b) the National Register of Causes of Death (RCoD), which collects all death certificates issued in Italy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref> and codes MCoD data, according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision, ICD-10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16]</ref>.</s><s>MCoD data include, for each person deceased in Italy, besides the underlying cause-of-death, all the conditions reported in any field of death certificates coded into ICD-10.</s></p><p><s>RAIDS and RCoD data were linked together for the period 2006-2011.</s><s>The record-linkage was carried out in observance of the current laws, given the inclusion of this investigation in the Italian National Statistical Plan, after clearance of the Italian Data Protection Authority.</s><s>In order to improve linkage effectiveness and to reduce bias, we excluded from this study: (a) the records of PWA living in the provinces of Trento and Bolzano (n = 4), because names/ surnames were not available in RCoD; (b) the records of PWA who were foreign citizens (n = 311), because of the higher frequency of spelling errors in names/surnames and the increased probability of losses at follow-up due to migration (i.e., when they die abroad, neither their death nor their date of last follow-up are reported to RCoD; conversely, when Italian citizens die abroad, their death is always recorded in RCoD).</s><s>The record-linkage was carried out using a validated semi-automated software application that guarantees anonymity and high sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[21]</ref>.</s><s>After the exclusion of false-positive linked records, the correctly matched records between RAIDS and RCoD were considered the 'PWA deaths'; whereas, the RCoD records that were not matched with RAIDS were considered the 'non--PWA deaths' (i.e., deceased people among the general population without AIDS).</s><s>Furthermore, in order to avoid the inclusion of HIV-infected people among 'non-PWA deaths' , also death records reporting any AIDS/HIV-related conditions (i.e., ICD-10 codes B20-B24) were excluded from the 'non-PWA deaths' group.</s></p><p><s>The present analysis was restricted to PWA aged 15-74 years at diagnosis or at death.</s><s>Furthermore, PWA with less than 1-month interval between AIDS diagnosis and death were excluded (because the day of AIDS diagnosis was often missing and in several cases AIDS was diagnosed after death).</s><s>The final analysis included 1229 'PWA deaths' , occurred among 5285 PWA, and 952,019 'non-PWA deaths'.</s></p><p><s>Sex-and age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22]</ref> were calculated as the ratio between the observed number of 'PWA deaths' reporting one specific disease in the death certificate (using MCoD) to the expected number of 'PWA deaths' , estimated on the basis of (a) sex-and age-specific mortality rates among non-PWA multiplied by (b) the person-years at risk among PWA.</s><s>(a) Mortality rates for non-PWA were computed as the ratio between the observed number of 'non-PWA deaths' reporting one specific condition in the death certificate (using MCoD) and the average resident Italian population of same sex and age in the calendar period (after excluding Trento and Bolzano provinces and foreign citizens), as a proxy of person-years at risk of death of non-PWA.</s><s>(b) PWA' person-years at risk of death were calculated from the date of AIDS diagnosis to the date of death, or to December 31st, 2011, whichever came first (PWA who had been diagnosed within 74 years of age but who died thereafter were censored at their 75th birthday).</s><s>Corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using the exact Poisson method, which is appropriate for rare events <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Nonetheless, diseases for which the total number of observed deaths among PWA was below 10 were not reported in tables.</s></p><p><s>Cardiac arrest, ICD-10 code I46, was excluded from the analysis on CSDs because it is considered a 'garbage code' , i.e., a code that should not be indicated in the death certificates as it is just the mode of dying and it is not specifically related to the disease process <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This nationwide, population-based study found a fairly high mortality excess among Italian PWA, in terms of presence in death certificates of a higher than expected frequency of several CSDs and DM, as compared to the general population.</s><s>This excess mortality was particularly high among younger PWA and among those infected through IDU.</s><s>The use of all causes contributing to death, besides the single underlying cause-of-death, was crucial in order to assess and quantify the excess mortality, because it disclosed the contribution of CSDs and DM among the causes of death of PWA.</s><s>Nonetheless, the proportions of death certificates reporting either CSDs or DM were relatively small among PWA, and appeared even less relevant when compared with the same proportions among of non-PWA, for whom CSDs and DM are very common causes of death.</s><s>The use of SMRs allowed to verify that the number of deaths associated with several CSDs and DM among PWA was higher than expected, an information that could not emerge using a comparison between proportions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The magnitude of SMRs was higher than in our previous investigation focused only on DM, myocardial infarction, and chronic ischemic heart diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15]</ref>; it should be noted, however, that those findings were based on the underlying cause-of-death alone (after a manual revision of death certificates).</s><s>To our knowledge,

underlying cause-of-death <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The mortality risk was significantly higher in all age groups up to age 65 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[2]</ref>.</s><s>We also found a particularly elevated excess mortality associated with CSDs and DM among younger PWA, as compared to non-PWA.</s><s>These results are in line with other studies investigating the incidence -not the mortality-of stroke among HIV-positive men <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[13]</ref> and of cardiovascular diseases among HIV-positive women <ref

can be related to the higher prevalence of behavioral  Unfortunately, information on these risk factors was not systematically available in death certificates.</s><s>Therefore, we were not able to disentangle the impact on the mortality of PWA due to AIDS itself or to other risk factors.</s><s>Actually, the previously mentioned risk factors have been shown to have an independent impact on the survival of HIV-infected patients on HAART <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The very elevated SMRs we found among PWA who had been infected via IDU, could be mainly attributable to their exposure to drug addiction and alcohol abuse and to co-morbidities, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Adverse consequences of HAART can also have an important role in this increased mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, HAART can enhance insulin resistance and alter lipid metabolism and may be associated to metabolic syndrome (i.e., a constellation of cardio-metabolic abnormalities, including glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia, DM, abdominal obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref>.</s><s>DM and metabolic syndrome are among the main risk factors for CSDs and a recent meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[9]</ref> reported that people infected with HIV who received HAART had a 4-fold higher odd of developing DM than those HAART naïve.</s><s>Definitely, the increased survival and the growing aging of individuals receiving HAART have a crucial role in the incidence of and mortality for DM and cardiovascular complications.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, cardiovascular complications are significantly more frequent among diabetic patients with HIV compared to non-diabetic ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">29]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, it is worth noting that in 21 PWA, out of 46 (45.7%) with DM and out of 201 (10.4%) with CSDs, both DM and CSDs were mentioned in the death certificate.</s></p><p><s>We have also checked the concurrent presence of other diseases (different from AIDS-defining ones) together with DM and CSD and we have found that they were rarely present at the same time.</s><s>For instance, we investigated the co-presence of non-AIDS-defining cancers, as they share common risk factors (e.g., tobacco smoking) with CSDs and DM.</s><s>We found that, out of 201 PWA death certificates with CSDs, 13 reported also a non-AIDS-defining cancer (i.e., 3 lung, 3 liver, 2 leukemias, 2 Hodgkin's lymphomas, 1 melanoma, 1 pancreas, 1 larynx), and that, out of 46 PWA death certificates with DM, 3 reported also a non-AIDS-defining cancer (i.e., 1 lung, 1 liver, 1 thyroid).</s></p><p><s>One of the major study strengths was the use of MCoD, which allowed to identify diseases that, otherwise, would have been hidden by the use of the underlying cause-of-death among people with HIV/AIDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17]</ref>.</s><s>The recent availability of MCoD data in Italy has allowed to analyze a wide spectrum of conditions classified into ICD-10 codes, thus improving internal and external validity of our study results.</s><s>Furthermore, the accessibility of MCoD data also for non-PWA allowed us to make a direct comparison between the two groups, given the use of the same coding rules for both groups, thus limiting the potential effect of information bias.</s><s>Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that the knowledge of HIV infection status could have affected the reporting of various diseases.</s></p><p><s>Another relevant strength of this study was the completeness of data sources, as both the RAIDS and the RCoD are population-based registries with full coverage of the Italian population.</s><s>A further strength was the high sensitivity of the record-linkage procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[21]</ref>, which allows to amend for spelling errors in names and common errors in dates.</s><s>It should be noted, however, that our study findings cannot Table <ref type="table">4</ref> Observed and expected PWA deaths, with corresponding SMRs, by mode of HIV transmission.</s><s>Italy, 2006-2011 be extended to HIV-infected people without AIDS diagnosis, as they were obtained from the National AIDS Registry, which does not include HIV-only patients.</s><s>As a consequence, SMRs could be different in the case of HIV-infected people at an earlier stage of immunodeficiency for whom the competitive role of AIDS-defining illnesses at death should be null.</s><s>Nonetheless, this study methodology could be of aid for the conduction of similar studies among HIV-infected people and for a comparison of the study findings.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Due to HAART, HIV has become a chronically manageable illness, and our study findings further claim for implementing preventive strategies for chronic diseases, including several CSDs and DM, to reduce not only the incidence but most of all the mortality related to these conditions.</s><s>Primary preventive actions targeted to smoking and alcohol drinking cessation, healthy diet, weight loss, and physical activity can have an impact in improving the survival of HIV-infected people.</s><s>Furthermore, risk factors for CSDs should be regularly assessed in this population, together with screening for the diagnosis of DM, and prompting clinicians to shift to lipid/glucoseneutral HAART regimens, depending on individual metabolic response.</s><s>Finally, as HIV-infected patients with DM are at a particularly high risk of cardiovascular diseases, they should be managed following comprehensive interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Specific care and recommendations should focus on individuals younger than 50 years and on those infected through IDU.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Distribution of 5285 Italian people with AIDS (PWA) and of 1229 PWA who had died between the age of 15 and 74 years, according to selected characteristics at AIDS diagnosis.Italy, 2006Italy,  -2011</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Characteristics at AIDS diagnosis</cell><cell>Total PWA</cell><cell>PWA deaths a</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>N = 5285</cell><cell>N = 1229</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>No. (%)</cell><cell>No.</cell><cell>% of deaths among PWA</cell></row><row><cell>Sex</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Male</cell><cell>4215 (79.8)</cell><cell>992</cell><cell>23.6</cell></row><row><cell>Female</cell><cell>1070 (20.2)</cell><cell>237</cell><cell>22.1</cell></row><row><cell>Age at AIDS diagnosis (years)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>15-39</cell><cell>1566 (29.6)</cell><cell>227</cell><cell>14.5</cell></row><row><cell>40-49</cell><cell>2273 (43.0)</cell><cell>527</cell><cell>23.2</cell></row><row><cell>50-59</cell><cell>976 (18.5)</cell><cell>298</cell><cell>30.5</cell></row><row><cell>60-74</cell><cell>470 (8.9)</cell><cell>177</cell><cell>38.5</cell></row><row><cell>Calendar year at AIDS diagnosis</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>2006-2007</cell><cell>2110 (39.9)</cell><cell>593</cell><cell>28.3</cell></row><row><cell>2008-2009</cell><cell>1780 (33.7)</cell><cell>396</cell><cell>22.3</cell></row><row><cell>2010-2011</cell><cell>1395 (26.4)</cell><cell>240</cell><cell>17.3</cell></row><row><cell>Residence area b</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>North</cell><cell>2808 (53.1)</cell><cell>652</cell><cell>23.3</cell></row><row><cell>Center</cell><cell>1326 (25.1)</cell><cell>278</cell><cell>21.0</cell></row><row><cell>South</cell><cell>1065 (20.2)</cell><cell>273</cell><cell>25.6</cell></row><row><cell>Education (years)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>&lt; 6</cell><cell>593 (11.2)</cell><cell>168</cell><cell>28.3</cell></row><row><cell>6-8</cell><cell>2216 (41.9)</cell><cell>547</cell><cell>24.7</cell></row><row><cell>≥ 9</cell><cell>1601 (30.3)</cell><cell>296</cell><cell>18.5</cell></row><row><cell>Unknown</cell><cell>875 (16.6)</cell><cell>218</cell><cell>25.3</cell></row><row><cell>HIV transmission mode</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Heterosexual intercourse</cell><cell>2093 (39.6)</cell><cell>446</cell><cell>21.5</cell></row><row><cell>Male-to-male sexual intercourse</cell><cell>1316 (24.9)</cell><cell>223</cell><cell>17.0</cell></row><row><cell>Injecting drug use</cell><cell>1533 (29.0)</cell><cell>473</cell><cell>30.9</cell></row><row><cell>Other/undetermined</cell><cell>343 (6.5)</cell><cell>87</cell><cell>25.7</cell></row><row><cell>CD4 (cell count/mm 3 ) b</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>≥ 350</cell><cell>493 (9.3)</cell><cell>97</cell><cell>19.7</cell></row><row><cell>200-349</cell><cell>585 (11.1)</cell><cell>161</cell><cell>27.7</cell></row><row><cell>50-199</cell><cell>1891 (35.8)</cell><cell>449</cell><cell>23.9</cell></row><row><cell>&lt;50</cell><cell>2177 (41.2)</cell><cell>476</cell><cell>21.9</cell></row><row><cell>a Deceased up to 31st Dec 2011</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note><p><s>bThe sum does not add up to the total because of missing values</s></p></note></figure>
