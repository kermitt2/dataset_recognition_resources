7 Hz: P ¼ 0.0002; 9 Hz: P ¼ 0.0002; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), as well as of more broad, 5-10 Hz, theta band frequencies (F 1,323 ¼ 18.88, P ¼ 0.00002; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, see also Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>Control light stimulation was identical to the opsin-activating stimulation, except for that it was delivered through a dummy cable that did not allow the light to penetrate the surface of the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>The exposure to the same amount of light in the environment allowed to control for possible influence of visual stimulation on movement.</s><s>No changes in time of exploration (F 1,244 ¼ 0.37, P ¼ 0.54) and duration of continuous running (F 1,244 ¼ 0.002, P ¼ 0.97) were found during optogenetically entrained theta at 7 and 9 Hz (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>The reduction of running speed was specific for entrainment of theta oscillations as indicated by the lack of effect of stimulation outside the theta band, at 2, 4 or 20 Hz (F 2,84 ¼ 0.07, P ¼ 0.8; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>, see also Supplementary Methods) and of continuous 1 s pulses (F 1,15 ¼ 1.22, P ¼ 0.29; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, as spontaneous hippocampal theta oscillations are associated with locomotor activity, we elicited theta oscillations during immobility to study whether induction of hippocampal theta oscillations can initiate movement.</s><s>Optostimulation induced hippocampal theta oscillations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>), whereas control light stimulation did not (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>).</s><s>Nevertheless, optogenetically induced theta was not associated with higher likelihood of running initiation (w 2 -test, w 2 (1) ¼ 2.33, P ¼ 0.13; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, optogenetic induction of hippocampal theta oscillations did not initiate locomotion in immobile mice.</s></p><p><s>To examine the immediate effect of the optogenetically controlled theta oscillations on locomotion, we measured running speed on optostimulation onset preceded by either running or immobility.</s><s>Irrespective of baseline speed (F 58,58 ¼ 1.12, P ¼ 0.33, repeated-measures analysis of variance), entrainment of theta oscillations locked average running speed to a relatively narrow range, rendering it less variable than during control light stimulation (F 1,102 ¼ 6.59, P ¼ 0.027, Bonferroni test: P ¼ 0.0107; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4h</ref>), or during the prestimulation baseline (Bonferroni test: P ¼ 0.0062).</s><s>Speed variability did not differ between control light stimulation and spontaneous locomotion without light stimulation (F 41,41 ¼ 0.9, P ¼ 0.75; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4i</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, speed variability was lower when theta was optogenetically entrained with high fidelity in comparison with low-fidelity entrainment (Pearson's r ¼ À 0.84, P ¼ 0.0051; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2h,i</ref>).</s><s>Rhythmic optogenetic stimulation at nontheta frequencies (at 2, 4 and 20 Hz) did not change running speed variability (F 1,131 ¼ 0.43, P ¼ 0.51; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4j</ref>), whereas 1 s continuous light pulses even increased it (F 1,15 ¼ 4.67, P ¼ 0.047; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4k</ref>).</s><s>These results indicated that optogenetically entrained theta rhythm stabilized locomotion and prompted identification of hippocampal theta oscillations' parameters, other than oscillations' frequency (7 versus 9 Hz: F 1,248 ¼ 0.82, P ¼ 0.37; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), which regularized running speed.</s></p><p><s>In addition to setting the dominant frequency of theta oscillations, optogenetic entrainment controlled the temporal regularity of the theta rhythm, that is, variability (coefficient of variation (CV)) of frequency and amplitude.</s><s>Optogenetically entraining theta with higher fidelity generated oscillations of more constant frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) and amplitude (Pearson's correlation: r ¼ À 0.84, P ¼ 0.0046; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2i</ref>).</s><s>Further, we examined whether increased regularity of spontaneous theta oscillations is also associated with more regular locomotion speed.</s><s>We grouped epochs of spontaneous theta as well as theta during optogenetic stimulation according to theta amplitude variability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>) and averaged running speed and its variability within theta amplitude variability bins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b,c</ref>).</s><s>Although the proportion of lowamplitude variability epochs was higher for optogenetically entrained theta, spontaneous and optogenetically entrained theta oscillations displayed a similar range of amplitude variability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Less variable theta amplitude was accompanied by a lower running speed variability, both during spontaneous and optogenetically entrained theta (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Running speed also correlated with the amplitude variability of spontaneous theta oscillations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4l</ref>) and with optogenetically induced changes in theta amplitude variability (P ¼ 0.0001; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to these findings in dorsal Hip, theta oscillations in a more ventral part of Hip (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5a,b</ref>) did not display consistent association with locomotion (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5c,d</ref>), in line with reported in rats differences along the septo-temporal axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>All together, these results suggest that the variability of theta oscillation amplitude is a natural parameter, which regulates running speed and its variability during spontaneous theta oscillations as well.</s></p><p><s>To elucidate properties of hippocampal pyramidal cell output associated with more regular theta oscillations, we related changes in the number of spikes emitted near theta peaks or troughs (that is, comparing phase bins with similar excitability) to differences in the LFP amplitudes of respective cycles.</s><s>Half of recorded pyramidal cells changed their firing probability depending on the amplitude difference between theta cycles (Po0.05 for 46% of 55 cells during spontaneous theta and 55% of 22 cells during optogenetically entrained theta;
