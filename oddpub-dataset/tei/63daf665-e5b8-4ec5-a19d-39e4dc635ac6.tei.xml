<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS Trial design</head><p><s>FUNCTION was a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase III trial in which patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to 4 mg/kg TCZ+MTX, 8 mg/kg TCZ+MTX, 8 mg/ kg TCZ+placebo or placebo+MTX.</s><s>The randomisation sequence was stratified by serological status (presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies) and by geographical region.</s><s>TCZ or placebo was administered intravenously every 4 weeks.</s><s>MTX/placebo was initiated at 7.5 mg/week (to accommodate local recommendations of some countries at the time of study design), and was increased to a maximum of 20 mg/week by week 8 in patients with ongoing swollen or tender joints.</s></p><p><s>The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</s><s>All patients provided written informed consent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>Adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severe active RA, classified according to revised 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17</ref> of ≤2 years' duration who had not previously received MTX or biological agents were included.</s><s>Patients with features of poor prognosis were enrolled: inclusion criteria included Disease Activity Score using 28 joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) &gt;3.2, swollen joint count ≥4 (66 joint count), tender joint count ≥6 (68 joint count), ESR ≥28 mm/h or C reactive protein ≥1 mg/dl, positive RF or anti-CCP antibodies or one or more erosion of hands, wrists or feet attributable to RA based on a central radiographic reading.</s><s>Before baseline, DMARDs were withdrawn for appropriate washout periods (see online supplementary appendix).</s><s>Patients could continue treatment with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or oral corticosteroids (≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), provided the doses had been stable for at least 2 or 4 weeks before baseline, respectively, and remained stable throughout the study.</s><s>Patients could withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.</s><s>In addition, withdrawal was recommended for patients who had alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations ≥3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) that was accompanied by total bilirubin &gt;2× ULN; withdrawal was required for patients with ALT or AST elevations &gt;5× ULN.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>FUNCTION is the first trial to examine the effects of inhibiting IL-6 signalling as a first-line therapeutic option for RA.</s><s>The study entry criteria specifically targeted patients with active disease and features of progressive disease (baseline mean DAS28-ESR ranged from 6.6 to 6.7; approximately 90% of enrolled patients were seropositive for RF and/or anti-CCP antibodies), which is the target population for whom early use of intensive therapy, such as with a biological agent, may be appropriate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5</ref></s><s>though the study was not powered to detect differences in treatment effects between the TCZ arms and all doses/regimens of TCZ demonstrated clinical benefit compared with MTX alone, the 8 mg/kg TCZ+MTX group consistently achieved the best outcomes across all efficacy measures.</s><s>For the duration of the 52-week study, the 8 mg/kg TCZ+MTX regimen (the primary comparator) significantly improved clinical outcomes and functional ability (measured by HAQ-DI score) and inhibited joint damage progression compared with the MTX-alone regimen.</s><s>The primary endpoint was met: 45% of 8 mg/kg TCZ +MTX patients achieved DAS28 remission at 24 weeks compared with 15% of placebo+MTX patients.</s><s>Of interest, in contrast to the humanised monoclonal anti-TNF antibody adalimumab, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">18</ref> the addition of MTX to TCZ did not result in TCZ serum levels significantly higher than levels attained with TCZ monotherapy.</s><s>Although the underlying mechanisms that drive serum levels of a biological treatment in the context of combination with MTX versus monotherapy are not fully elucidated, our findings suggest that synergy between IL-6 inhibition and MTX action, rather than higher serum drug levels, drives the higher clinical response observed with TCZ+MTX.</s><s>Exploratory analyses across other disease remission measures (ACR/EULAR Boolean and Index remission, CDAI remission), which were of clinical importance despite their not being validated in a clinical trial setting, also showed that improvement with 8 mg/kg TCZ+MTX was at least equal to improvement with MTX alone.</s><s>Analysis of CDAI remission is of particular interest because this composite disease activity measure does not include an acute-phase reactant, and it demonstrates that control of disease activity in TCZ-treated patients with early RA was independent of the direct pharmacodynamic effect of TCZ in suppressing the synthesis of acute-phase reactant proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">19</ref></s><s>arly radiographic progression contributes to long-term disability, and prevention of structural joint damage is an important therapeutic goal early in and throughout the course of the disease. <ref type="bibr">20 21</ref></s><s>Baseline radiographic joint damage was low in all treatment groups, reflecting the early stage of RA in the study population.</s><s>This finding is consistent with other trials in early RA populations. <ref type="bibr">1 22-24</ref> Throughout 52 weeks, patients treated with TCZ experienced less radiographic progression than patients treated with MTX monotherapy, with the greatest joint damage inhibition in the 8 mg/kg TCZ+MTX group.</s><s>Of note, mTSS progression was low overall, even in the comparator MTX monotherapy arm, as has been observed in other early RA trials.</s></p><p><s>The recommended starting dose for intravenous TCZ in the USA and Canada is 4 mg/kg, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">25</ref> in contrast to 8 mg/kg used in the rest of the world; 8 mg/kg TCZ monotherapy has also demonstrated efficacy in patients with RA. <ref type="bibr">11 15 16</ref> Therefore, it was of interest to evaluate these TCZ dose regimens in the early RA population.</s><s>Both 8 mg/kg TCZ+placebo and 4 mg/kg TCZ +MTX achieved DAS28 and ACR efficacy responses consistently at least equal to those observed with placebo+MTX.</s><s>These regimens also demonstrated suppression of radiographic structural joint damage, with 77% (8 mg/kg TCZ+placebo) and 63% (4 mg/kg TCZ+MTX) relative reduction in mTSS to week 52 compared with rates seen in the MTX+placebo group.</s><s>Numerically greater inhibition in structural joint damage was observed with 8 mg/kg TCZ+MTX than with 8 mg/kg TCZ monotherapy or 4 mg/kg TCZ+MTX.</s><s>Therefore, although 8 mg/kg TCZ+MTX is the most effective treatment, both 4 mg/kg TCZ+MTX and 8 mg/kg TCZ monotherapy represent good alternative treatments for subsets of patients, such as those unable to tolerate MTX or the higher 8 mg/kg dose because of contraindications or adverse reactions.</s></p><p><s>Several other biological agents have proven efficacy in the early RA population.</s><s>Because of differences in study design, comparisons across trials are difficult.</s><s>Nevertheless, TCZ appears to demonstrate benefits in patients with early RA (in regard to DAS28 remission, ACR responses and radiographic endpoints), compared with patients treated with MTX alone, that are generally consistent with those observed in previous studies of biological therapies in similar populations. <ref type="bibr">1 3 22 26</ref></s><s>lthough a number of head-to-head comparison studies of different biological agents have recently been published, <ref type="bibr">15 27</ref> these have generally been performed in patients who have more established RA and who have responded inadequately to previous DMARDs.</s><s>It would be of interest to conduct such studies in more treatment-naive patients with early RA.</s><s>AEs observed in the TCZ groups were consistent with the known safety profile of TCZ; no additional safety signals were observed, and the most frequently reported AE was infection in all TCZ groups and in the placebo+MTX group.</s><s>However, a numerically higher incidence of certain events (infections, malignancies, myocardial infarctions and deaths) was reported in the 4 mg/kg TCZ+MTX group than the other groups.</s><s>Although patients in the 4 mg/kg TCZ+MTX group were marginally older than the other patients, there were no imbalances in any other baseline demographic or disease characteristics.</s><s>The significance of, and reason for, these small numerical differences are unclear.</s><s>1]<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref> Consistent with the known effects of TCZ and of MTX on transaminase levels, more patients in the TCZ+MTX groups than in either monotherapy group experienced ALT elevations, though AST elevations were similar between TCZ+MTX and TCZ monotherapy.</s><s>Importantly, most elevations occurred at a single time point, were not sustained and did not result in any clinical sequelae (no serious hepatic events were reported).</s><s>Thrombocytopenia was similar between TCZ+MTX and TCZ monotherapy groups.</s><s>Consistent with intravenous TCZ dosing, one hypersensitivity reaction was reported in the 4 mg/kg TCZ+MTX group and one was reported in the TCZ monotherapy group.</s><s>Rates of AEs resulting in premature withdrawal in this study ranged from 12% in the 4 mg/kg and TCZ monotherapy arms to 20% in the 8 mg/kg TCZ+MTX arm;

the other TCZ regimens were at least as effective as MTX in improving signs and symptoms and physical function and in inhibiting joint damage.</s><s>These results add to the body of evidence showing the efficacy of TCZ as therapy for patients with RA across several populations, including patients who respond inadequately to DMARDs <ref type="bibr">12-14 16</ref> or to anti-TNF agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">10</ref> and patients who receive TCZ monotherapy because MTX is contraindicated or cannot be tolerated. <ref type="bibr">11 15</ref></s><s>Further observation of these patients, for up to 2 years of blinded treatment, will investigate the maintenance of clinical (HAQ-DI) and radiographic outcomes and the long-term safety of TCZ in patients with early RA and poor prognostic features.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>(−0.28 to −0.06), p=0.0024;
