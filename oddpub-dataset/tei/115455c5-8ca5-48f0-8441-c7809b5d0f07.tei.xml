<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>A 56-year-old patient was brought to our emergency department with profound weakness of his limbs to the point that he was unable to get up from a couch unassisted.</s><s>A day earlier, he had been discharged from a neurology service where he had been because of similar complaints.</s><s>An 8-day workup including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spinal column, blood work, and lumbar puncture had not proved helpful.</s><s>An electromyogram disclosed changes consistent with sensory motor demyelinizing polyneuropathy.</s><s>A nutritional cause for the symptoms was presumed, and with thiamine administration and 8 days of hospital food, there was some improvement.</s><s>Serum electrolyte levels were not evaluated.</s></p><p><s>His medical history disclosed chronic alcohol abuse and degenerative joint disease.</s><s>The patient had been advised to start treatment for hypertension but chose not to do so.</s><s>The blood pressure measurement was 102/66 mm Hg with a heart rate of 76 beats per minute.</s><s>The oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 97%.</s><s>On examination, the patient was awake, oriented, had normal cranial nerve function, and no sensory defects.</s><s>He had profound weakness of upper and lower extremities.</s><s>Heart, lungs, and abdomen were unremarkable.</s><s>There was substantial pedal edema.</s><s>The Diagnosis j Alcohol-associated tubular dysfunction Further workup showed a normal hemogram but revealed profound hypokalemia of 1.5 mmol/l.</s><s>Additional laboratory values are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</s><s>The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, where potassium chloride was given parenterally.</s><s>Although the serum potassium level was 1.8 mmol/l, a 12-lead electrocardiogram disclosed T-wave and axis changes of a nonspecific nature, with a suggestion of a U wave providing an additional clue to the clinical problem.</s><s>Blood gas analysis showed that arterial pH was 7.39, PaO 2 was 92 mm Hg, and PaCO 2 was 24 mm Hg.</s><s>By this time, the sodium level was 137 mmol/l, the potassium level was 3.6 mmol/l, the chloride level was 115 mmol/l, and the bicarbonate level was 14 mmol/l.</s><s>Thus, we were dealing with a non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis.</s><s>The urine pH remained at 7.0 during the entire hospital stay.</s><s>The renin concentration was 13.4 ng/l and the aldosterone level was &lt;37 ng/l.</s><s>The sodium reabsorption was appropriate; however, the tubular absorption of phosphorus was 61% (despite hypophosphatemia).</s><s>We concluded that the high urinary potassium excretion (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>) could not be attributed to aldosterone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Proximal tubular function was probably also not totally in order.</s><s>Our patient had hypophosphatemia and low magnesium values.</s><s>We were not in a position to evaluate these matters in detail. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>We performed ultrasonography, which disclosed normal kidneys but evidence of hepatic fibrosis.</s><s>Echocardiography established marked diastolic dysfunction.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is your diagnosis?</head><p><s>The ability to determine oxygen saturation has led to an unfortunate decrease in blood gas analyses.</s><s>Thus, acid-base disturbances are frequently unrecognized.</s><s>This is of particular importance in patients with hypokalemia in whom this test provides important information regarding the cause of the potassium disorder.</s><s>Most patients with hypokalemia and alcoholism will have metabolic alkalosis with volume contraction after vomiting.</s><s>In contrast, our patient had hypokalemia with distal renal tubular acidosis.</s></p><p><s>De Marchi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> described renal tubular dysfunction in chronic alcohol abuse with subsequent improvement after abstinence.</s><s>They reported a wide range of defects in renal tubular function, with a normal glomerular filtration rate.</s><s>The defects included decreases in the threshold and maximal reabsorptive ability for glucose and in the renal threshold for phosphate excretion in a third of their patients.</s><s>They also reported increases in the fractional excretion of b 2 -microglobulin, uric acid, calcium, and magnesium.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly one quarter of their patients had a defect in tubular acidification, and a few exhibited impaired urinary concentrating ability.</s><s>In the face of metabolic acidosis and a urinary pH of 7.0, our patient excreted sodium at 76 mmol/l, potassium at 30 mmol/l, and chloride at 64 mmol/l, suggesting that ammonium excretion was suboptimal (positive urinary anion gap).</s><s>His phosphate reabsorption was 61% during hypophosphatemia, suggesting proximal tubular dysfunction.</s></p><p><s>We initiated potassium substitution with 120 mmol potassium citrate daily.</s><s>We also began ramipril 10 mg/d and spironolactone 25 mg 3 times daily.</s><s>The patient dropped 10 kg of weight and the edema disappeared.</s><s>At discharge, the sodium level was 138 mmol/l, the potassium level was 3.6 mmol/l, the chloride level was 99 mmol/l, and the bicarbonate level was 23 mmol/l.</s><s>Motor strength was greatly improved.</s><s>The abnormalities of blood chemistry values and renal tubular function improved after 4 weeks of abstinence.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head>Table 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Laboratory values on presentation</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Parameter</cell><cell>Value</cell><cell>Reference range</cell></row><row><cell>Hemoglobin</cell><cell>15.3 g/dl</cell><cell>12.5-17.2</cell></row><row><cell>Creatinine</cell><cell>0.73 mg/dl</cell><cell>0.70-1.20</cell></row><row><cell>Urea nitrogen</cell><cell>12 mg/dl</cell><cell>17-48</cell></row><row><cell>Thyroid-stimulating hormone</cell><cell>2.03 mU/ml</cell><cell>0.27-4.0</cell></row><row><cell>Adrenocorticotropic hormone</cell><cell>20.4 pg/ml</cell><cell>7.2-63</cell></row><row><cell>Creatine kinase</cell><cell>1211 U/l</cell><cell>&lt;190</cell></row><row><cell>Total protein</cell><cell>6.5 g/dl</cell><cell>6.4-8.3</cell></row><row><cell>Albumin</cell><cell>3.4 g/dl</cell><cell>3.5-5.2</cell></row><row><cell>Sodium</cell><cell>145 mmol/l</cell><cell>136-145</cell></row><row><cell>Chloride</cell><cell>111 mmol/l</cell><cell>98-107</cell></row><row><cell>Potassium</cell><cell>1.5 mmol/l</cell><cell>3.4-4.5</cell></row><row><cell>Phosphate</cell><cell>0.44 mmol/l</cell><cell>0.87-1.45</cell></row><row><cell>Magnesium</cell><cell>0.86 mmol/l</cell><cell>0.66-0.99</cell></row><row><cell>Urine pH</cell><cell>7.0</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Urine glucose</cell><cell>Negative</cell><cell>Negative</cell></row><row><cell>Albumin-to-creatinine ratio</cell><cell>13 mg/g</cell><cell>&lt;20</cell></row><row><cell>Urine osmolarity</cell><cell>247 mOsm/l</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Urine sodium</cell><cell>65 mmol/l</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Urine potassium</cell><cell>15 mmol/l</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Urine phosphorus</cell><cell>12.2 mmol/l</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Urine creatinine</cell><cell>52 mg/dl</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
