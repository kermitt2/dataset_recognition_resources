<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Malaria represents a major global health challenge and is estimated to be responsible for ~216 million infections per year resulting in ~655,000 deaths in 2010 (World Malaria Report 2011, http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2011/en/).</s><s>Drug resistance continues to present a major obstacle to control of this disease, leading to the use of combination therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The front line therapy is currently Artemisinin Combination Therapy, but this treatment is now threatened by the emergence of slow responding strains of the parasites <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Hence there is an urgent need to develop novel therapies that target different pathways from those disrupted by current drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, there is great interest in drugs that could be effective against multiple stages of the malaria life cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to prevent development of disease, to control disease pathology, and to prevent transmission from one infected individual to the next.</s></p><p><s>One remarkable aspect of the physiology of malaria parasites is their complete dependence upon glucose uptake and glycolytic metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Because the parasites do not express a mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, they rely completely on glycolysis for glucose catabolism, thus generating only two ATP molecules per glucose.</s><s>The Krebs Cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are not engaged for production of ATP from glucose.</s><s>This inefficient use of glucose forces the parasite to transport large amounts of glucose to sustain viability and thus makes the parasite especially dependent on glucose uptake.</s><s>Hence, inhibiting glucose import from the host's blood may be a novel therapeutic strategy.</s></p><p><s>In 1999 Krishna and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> cloned and functionally expressed the gene for the hexose/glucose transporter PfHT from Plasmodium falciparum.</s><s>This permease is a member of the Facilitative Glucose Transporter or SLC2 family <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>However, PfHT is highly divergent in sequence from all human orthologs, with GLUT1, the most closely related human ortholog, sharing only 28% amino acid identity with PfHT.</s><s>This modest relatedness suggested that it might be possible to identify compounds that inhibit PfHT with high affinity without strongly inhibiting the orthologous human GLUTs.</s><s>Subsequently, the Krishna laboratory demonstrated that the D-glucose analog 3-O-((undec-10-en)-1-yl)-D-glucose, also referred to as compound 3361, was able to selectively inhibit uptake of glucose by PfHT versus human GLUT1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, the K i for glucose uptake by PfHT was 53 μM while no significant inhibition of GLUT1 was observed at a 1 mM concentration of compound 3361.</s><s>Compound 3361 also inhibited growth of intraerythrocytic P. falciparum parasites in vitro with an IC 50 value of 15.7 μM, and it induced a 40% reduction in parasitemia of mice infected with P. berghei parasites when administered at a dose of 25 mg/kg (i.p.) twice daily <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>These results strongly suggested that PfHT provides an essential route for nutrient uptake in blood stream stage parasites.</s></p><p><s>Subsequently, genetic evidence was advanced by two groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> demonstrating the inability to delete the PfHT gene, unless parasites had been first transfected with an episomal copy of the gene to provide complementation.</s><s>These results supported the notion that PfHT is an essential glucose transporter for intraerythrocytic parasites.</s><s>Additionally, studies applying compound 3361 to hepatic stage and ookinetes of P. berghei demonstrated strong inhibition of viability of both these liver and mosquito stages of the malaria life cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, implying that PfHT and its orthologs in other species of malaria are indeed essential in multiple stages of parasite development.</s></p><p><s>As indicated by Krishna and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, these observations suggest that inhibiting the parasite PfHT without impairing function of human SLC2 transporters such as GLUT1 might be a promising strategy for development of drugs.</s><s>Transporters represent the targets for ~13% of currently FDA-approved oral drugs with known targets in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, establishing that permeases are often 'druggable' proteins likely to contain binding pockets for small molecules that are usually unrelated in structure to their natural permeants.</s><s>Although compound 3361 represents one such selective inhibitor, it is not a drug-like compound and is not considered a lead for drug development <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, it is important to identify other non-sugar compounds that selectively inhibit PfHT and might be advanced toward novel therapeutic agents.</s><s>One approach to identifying novel PfHT inhibitors is to screen libraries of drug-like compounds for those that selectively inhibit PfHT with high affinity.</s><s>The challenge in implementing this approach is to develop an assay for transporter function that can be carried out in a high-throughput screening strategy.</s><s>We have previously demonstrated the both PfHT and GLUT1 can be heterologously expressed in a glucose transporter null mutant (Δlmxgt1-3) of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania mexicana, and that these transgenic parasites (Δlmxgt1-3 [pPfHT] or Δlmxgt1-3[pGLUT1]) are auxotrophic for glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>In the current study we have employed a cell proliferation assay, using the DNA-binding dye SYBR Green, to screen two 'focused' libraries of compounds with demonstrated ability to inhibit growth of P. falciparum parasites in vitro.</s><s>The first library is the Tres Cantos antimalarial compound set (TCAMS) that consists of 13,533 compounds (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chemblntd) that inhibit growth of P. falciparum 3D7 intraerythrocytic parasites by 80% at 2 μM concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The second library is the Malaria Box collection of 400 compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> with demonstrated antimalarial activity (http://www.mmv.org/research-development/malaria-box-supporting-information) that was obtained from the Medicines for Malaria Venture.</s><s>Following the primary screen for compounds that inhibited growth of Δlmxgt1-3[pPfHT] transgenic parasites, we applied secondary screens that directly measured glucose uptake to identify the limited subset of primary hits that inhibited growth of this reporter cell line by selectively inhibiting glucose import through PfHT compared to GLUT1.</s><s>This multistep approach identified two compounds that were high affinity inhibitors of PfHT and low affinity inhibitors of GLUT1.</s><s>Analysis of analogs uncovered a third compound with similar properties.</s><s>Additionally, 7 low potency, low selectivity inhibitors of PfHT also emerged.</s><s>These hits provide compounds with potential for drug development against the essential P. falciparum hexose transporter PfHT.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, focused libraries of compounds with demonstrated proliferation inhibitory capacity against P. falciparum

each generated one PfHT selective inhibitor, and characterization of several analogs uncovered another selective inhibitor with 8-fold lower affinity, Compound 13 in which the three methoxy groups of Compound 1 have been replaced by a metacyano group.</s><s>These results warrant further examination of additional Compound 1 analogs to search for additional derivatives of this scaffold that might have higher affinity, increased selectivity, or improved physico-chemical properties as a lead for further drug development.</s></p><p><s>In addition, the initial SAR studies on Compound 1 revealed a range of potencies and specificities for different analogs (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest the possibility that some analogs of other low potency, low specificity inhibitors (Fig <ref type="figure">2</ref>) might emerge as structurally related high potency, high specificity compounds.</s><s>The advantage of this approach is that it could expand the number of scaffolds representing selective inhibitors of PfHT that might be advanced as  <ref type="figure">,</ref> should high affinity selective inhibitors emerge from initial SAR studies.</s><s>In contrast, Compound 7 probably represents a probe-like rather than a drug-like compound, that is, a compound with chemical and structural properties that are not optimal for drug development but may be useful for biochemical analysis.</s><s>Nonetheless, the identification of multiple selective inhibitors of PfHT provides proof of principle that non-substrate analogs can provide potent antagonists that act at sites different from those occupied by substrates.</s></p><p><s>Compound 1 inhibits proliferation of both multi-drug resistant and non-resistant intraerythrocytic P. falciparum with EC 50 values of ~1 μM (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, Compounds 10, 12, and 13, which are all less potent inhibitors of glucose uptake through PfHT, inhibit growth of parasites in vitro with significantly weaker potency.</s><s>The correlation between inhibition of PfHT and growth suppression suggests that Compound 1 may exert its proliferation inhibitory effect through inhibition of PfHT, as anticipated for a compound that impairs the ability of the parasite to acquire an essential nutrient.</s><s>Hence, PfHT is a potential pharmacological target of Compound 1, although rigorous demonstration of this point will require further studies.</s></p><p><s>The in vitro pharmacokinetic and physical properties of Compound 1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) reveal that is has relatively low aqueous solubility and high membrane permeability but also a high percentage of retention in the membrane, when compared to the range of properties for the four control drugs.</s><s>The metabolic stability is relatively low and the intrinsic clearance is relatively high, compared to verapamil.</s><s>The high membrane permeability and low solubility place these compounds in Biopharmaceutics Class II <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and indicates that such compounds would likely require appropriate formulation to provide reasonable oral bioavailability.</s><s>These properties also suggest that for Compound 1 to be progressed toward a potential anti-malarial lead, a medicinal chemistry program would need to focus on decreasing membrane retention and increasing metabolic stability.</s><s>Alternate scaffolds may emerge if any of the analogs of low potency, low specificity PfHT inhibitors exhibit higher potency and specificity toward PfHT.</s><s>This approach could provide multiple scaffolds of diverse structure that could be explored for optimal drug-like properties.</s><s>Overall this study confirms that it is possible to identify high affinity, high selectivity inhibitors of PfHT by screening focused libraries of drug-like compounds that inhibit growth of P. falciparum.</s><s>Similarly, screens of larger unfocused libraries may identify other such PfHT inhibitors that could be optimized subsequently for anti-malarial activity.</s><s>This work further suggests that PfHT may have potential as a novel drug target for control of this pathogen of global importance.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig
