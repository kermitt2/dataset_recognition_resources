_12 months, &lt;12-6 months, and &lt;6 months), validating the Working Formulation.</s><s>The investigators who described the recent prognostic nomogram for metastatic uveal melanoma have not yet provided a comparison of predicted with observed survival times. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>n the building dataset, 73% of patients received chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy, and 10% underwent surgical resection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>In the validation set, these percentages were 67% and 18%, which reflects the participation of 2 OOG centers in which surgery is the preferred approach to metastatic uveal melanoma.</s><s>The Working Formulation predicted survival well when metastases were not resected.</s><s>The observed survival was not associated with stage if they were resected.</s><s>This observation lends further support to the hypothesis that the largest metastases, which typically are resected, often strongly influence survival, especially in oligometastatic disease.</s></p><p><s>The Working Formulation has 4 major limitations.</s><s>First, it is based on data at the time of diagnosis of first metastasis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>It cannot predict survival of patients considered for second-line treatment.</s><s>Second, the mode of imaging was not standardized, and this may have affected measuring of the LDLM and, thus, assignment to stages IVa-IVc.</s><s>Third, another model is clearly needed to predict survival of patients who undergo resection of metastases.</s><s>The Working Formulation will suggest, however, what their survival might be should metastases be managed without surgery.</s><s>Fourth, the Working Formulation categorizes a cohort of patients by predicted survival but it does not precisely predict the fate of a single patient, in particular as regards stage IVb, and it should thus not be used for such a purpose.</s></p><p><s>The Working Formulation also needs further development.</s><s>For example, the survival of patients who have miliary metastases may not be modeled optimally.</s><s>Preliminary data suggest that histopathologic and genetic factors determined from metastases-for example, microvascular density <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and GNA11, GNAQ, and BAP1 mutation status <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> -also influence survival after metastasis and should be considered for refined prognostication in addition to clinical data.</s></p><p><s>Although the paper describing the Working Formulation 3 has been cited over 60 times, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (http://apps.</s><s>webofknowledge.com,</s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> Adoption of either of the 2 now validated systems for staging metastatic uveal melanoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> would largely solve 3 prevalent problems.</s><s>First, investigators fit ad hoc multivariate models, typically by a data-driven, stepwise approach.</s><s>Such models often fit a typically small sample but may not be repeatable.</s><s>Models built from established and validated prognostic factors are preferable.</s><s>Second, investigators plot survival according to single predictors.</s><s>Bias from other factors makes comparisons difficult.</s><s>Third, investigators use no consistent reference categories such as the Working Formulation stages against which to compare survival.</s><s>Many reports on treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma describe patients undergoing regular surveillance and thus likely include predominantly Working Formulation stage IVa metastatic melanomas.</s><s>A median survival exceeding 12 months is then expected rather than suggestive of any therapeutic superiority.</s></p><p><s>We recommend that the validated Working Formulation 3 or the recent prognostic nomogram, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> both of which share performance index, extent of measurable metastases, and liver function tests as their basis for staging, be used for evidence-based, stage-specific reporting of survival of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in prospective studies.</s></p><p><s>FUNDING/SUPPORT: THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE HELSINKI UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RESEARCH FUND (HELSINKI, Finland;
