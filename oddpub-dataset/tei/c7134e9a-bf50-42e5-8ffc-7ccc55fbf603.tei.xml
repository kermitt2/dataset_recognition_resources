<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Different from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fratti et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Vergne et al., 2004b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Via et al., 1997)</ref>, we found that in mouse macrophages, Mtb phagosomes initially follow a conventional maturation pathway, including an early EGFP-Rab5 to EGFP-Rab7 transition followed by dissociation.</s><s>The transient association of EGFP-Rab7 suggests that Mtb faces temporally late endosomal stages during the first hour after infection.</s><s>A similar transient association of Rab7, but not RILP, was observed during infection of macrophages with BCG and Mtb in fixed cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Seto et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sun et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Clearly, because of the slow replication time of Mtb, events occurring after the first hour of infection will be of importance for either Mtb growth or restriction.</s><s>On the other hand, Rab20 remains associated with Mtb phagosomes and mediates membrane influx altering the membrane and generating spacious phagosomes that will fuse with late endocytic compartments.</s><s>The occurrence of tight and spacious Mtb phagosomes are conserved across host species and likely to be relevant in vivo since these spacious phagosomes have been observed in monocytes of TB patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Russell et al., 2002)</ref>, as well as in infected mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Moreira et al., 1997)</ref>, zebrafish <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hosseini et al., 2014)</ref>, and Dyctiostelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barisch et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our results are consistent with a mechanism in which disruption of the close contact between the phagosomal membrane and the bacteria will result in enhanced fusion with late endocytic organelles <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(de Chastellier et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rhoades and Ullrich, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>We propose that tight phagosomes preferentially allow the type VII secretion system to be active and facilitate the access of Mtb to the cytosol.</s><s>Thus, endocytic membrane influx into Mtb phagosomes could be an effective physical mechanism to reduce bacterial secretion via the type VII secretion system, in agreement with original reports in alveolar macrophages showing membrane disruption at the close contacts of the phagosomal membrane with bacilli <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Myrvik et al., 1984)</ref>.</s><s>IFN-g, by enhancing interactions with early endocytic vesicles in a Rab20-dependent manner, restricted Mtb growth arguing that host cells are able to maintain Mtb ''phagosomally trapped'' in a spacious membranous compartment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(MacMicking, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Although the presence of galectin-8 implies that at least a part of the phagosome and/or mycobacteria must be exposed to the cytoplasm, we were unable to identify cytosolic bacteria by conventional electron microscopy during the first 2 days of infections, as reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Behar et al., 2010)</ref> (and data not shown).</s><s>At the early stages of infection, Mtb has not been observed to localize in the cytosol in mouse macrophages, but time-dependent phagosomal membrane damage via ESX-1 and release of bacterial DNA has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Watson et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Our data argue that in mouse macrophages phagosomal membrane damage can occur.</s><s>By increasing the amount of membrane influx into phagosomes, Rab20 contributes to maintaining Mtb in a membrane-bound compartment and reducing the number of phagosomes with cytosolic access <ref type="bibr">(Thurston et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Watson et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>We propose that Mtb in tight phagosomes alters host membranes resulting in local ubiquitination.</s><s>Either host membranes or mycobacterial components will be ubiquitinated and recognized by the selective autophagy machinery.</s><s>However, the contribution of pathogen-induced ubiquitin and p62 networks of membranes to bacterial replication remains to be defined.</s><s>Our data suggest that, in cells lacking Rab20, selective autophagy can be beneficial for Mtb replication.</s><s>Probacterial autophagy has been reported for different bacteria including Mtb <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andersson et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lerena and Colombo, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lerner et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mostowy, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>It is also possible that while autophagic proteins are recruited to Mtb, autophagosome fusion with lysosomes is impaired by this pathogen, as shown previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Espert et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Romagnoli et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Rab20 maintains Mtb phagosomal membrane integrity and hence likely only indirectly plays a role in the recognition of phagosomal membrane damage by selective autophagy.</s><s>The in vivo data suggest that WT Mtb is able to effectively evade the Rab20-dependent targeting to phagolysosomes early, whereas MtbDRD1 is continuously in intact phagosomes and targeted by the Rab20 pathway, leading to growth restriction.</s><s>Moreover, the early in vivo differences argue that Rab20 contributes to the innate immune response to Mtb.</s><s>Our data are in agreement with the requirement of innate antigen-independent IFN-g secretion for early protective immunity against Mtb <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Feng et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kupz et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>The modest differences in bacterial burdens in lungs of Rab20 KO mice are likely due to TB susceptibility being controlled by more than one single trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Flynn, 2006)</ref> and important pathways such as nitric oxide production still being functional in Rab20 KO mice.</s><s>Clearly, Rab20 is part of the host response during human TB because it is specifically upregulated in patients with active disease.</s><s>This finding, together with Rab20 being the only Rab GTPase present in the blood transcriptional signature of TB <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berry et al., 2010)</ref>, argues that Rab20 is likely an important player in human TB.</s><s>Altogether, our findings identify an intracellular pathway of phagosome integrity maintenance that could be important to control bacterial pathogens that access the cytosol of host cells.</s></p></div>
