<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We have examined outcomes in five tertiary centres for carefully selected octogenarian patients with early stage NSCLC.</s><s>We have observed excellent short term outcomes in patients undergoing sub-lobar resection and lobectomy that is consistent with previously published cohorts.</s><s>Those at highest risk of early mortality were patients aged ≥83 years requiring lobectomy, where 120-day mortality was 17%.</s><s>Our findings regarding factors influencing short term and long term survival are otherwise consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(13)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the best long term survival was achieved amongst octogenarians aged &lt;83 with stage I disease who underwent lobectomy.</s><s>The very choice of sub-lobar resection may relate to comorbidity, which then competes with cancer as a risk factor for death.</s><s>Therefore the lower survival rate may just reflect selection bias.</s></p><p><s>Pathologic upstaging to Stage III disease was observed in 10% of patients, consistent with previous studies.</s><s>We have only directly compared long-term outcomes among patients with Stage I NSCLC, as we did not have information regarding adjuvant therapy in patients with Stage II-III NSCLC, making interpretation of outcomes difficult in this group.</s><s>Overall survival of Stage I NSCLC patients was superior for younger (&lt;83 years) patients undergoing lobectomy, as compared to sub-lobar resection.</s><s>Our findings provide significant reassurance that surgical management remains appropriate in carefully selected octogenarian patients with NSCLC.</s><s>Concerningly, a recent large population based study from the UK that examined more than 10,000 cases of NSCLC (8% octogenarian, n=860), found the 90-day mortality in all octogenarians to be close to 11%, a figure much higher than that seen in our study and other smaller series (4).</s><s>Consistent with our findings, this UK study found advanced age to be the most important predictor of early mortality, This article is protected by copyright.</s><s>All rights reserved.</s><s>A likely explanation for the lower mortality seen in our study and amongst other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(13)</ref>, may include cautious patient selection.</s><s>Our findings may indicate that selection processes in tertiary centres with dedicated thoracic oncology departments may be accurate in identification of patients at low risk of poor surgical outcomes, however this retrospective study is not able to elucidate any specific selection criteria to aid clinicians.</s><s>We have not documented patient selection strategies at each centre, though our findings are reassuring that current assessment techniques are appropriate when selecting elderly patients for surgery.</s><s>To optimize patient selection, a better understanding of risk factors for poor outcomes in the elderly is necessary, beyond the standard respiratory function tests.</s></p><p><s>Although we found that octogenarians have some increased surgical risk compared to historical controls(4) this increase does not seem great enough to preclude surgery for NSCLC amongst highly selected elderly patients.</s><s>Increases in morbidity and mortality in octogenarians may be expected due to declining physiological reserve and increased incidence of comorbidity and disability in this population <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16)</ref>.</s><s>Today, Australian men and women aged 85 years can expect to live for a further 6.2 and 7.2 years respectively which is more than 2 years greater than in the early 1990s <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">18)</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Consistent with this significantly increased life expectancy, lung cancer remains the most common cause of death in elderly patients who develop this diagnosis.</s><s>Furthermore, it is important to consider the poor prognosis for patients with NSCLC that do not undergo any treatment.</s><s>Estimated This article is protected by copyright.</s><s>All rights reserved.</s></p><p><s>5-year survival in patients with stage I NSCLC, who do not receive any form of treatment, has been shown to be as low as 7% (19), suggesting any treatment is beneficial even in very elderly patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">20)</ref>.</s><s>We have demonstrated that the survival probability of the resected cohort is the same as the general population matched for age and sex at the time of surgery.</s><s>Our interpretation of this somewhat surprising finding is that the individuals selected for surgery are fitter than the average matched population, and then surgery removes the medium to long term risk of cancer death.</s></p><p><s>Finally we found that those ≥ 83 years had worse short and long term survival outcomes.</s><s>The median age of octogenarians in our sample was 82.6 years, suggesting that it was primarily younger, and therefore potentially healthier, octogenarians that undergo surgery.</s><s>Few studies have looked at whether there are significantly different outcomes in younger versus older octogenarians, but age over 85 years has previously been associated with increased 90-day mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(4)</ref>.</s><s>Further research in this area is necessary to establish if this association holds true, as it might be that acceptable early mortality outcomes are only found in a younger subset of octogenarians.</s></p><p><s>Patient selection is critical in this patient group, and future studies are required to examine specific selection processes to optimize therapeutic outcomes, especially with the advent of effective noninvasive therapies such as stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR).</s><s>However, the very patients that require lobectomy may be anatomically unsuitable for SABR and require conventional fractionated radiotherapy over 6 weeks, with its intendant increased morbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(9)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We are unable to determine the rate of 'elective' versus 'compromise' sub-lobar resection in the ≥83 year group.</s><s>However, given the more favourable outcome, it is possible that when anatomical factors and stage allow, sub-lobar resection should be considered the gold standard procedure in this group.</s></p></div>
