is very likely that time on task (fatigability) compromises this important faculty of cognitive control.</s><s>As mentioned, the strength of fatigue effects however depends on the degree to which tasks engage similar prefrontal regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Within the context of task switching, it has been shown that switching becomes complicated when working memory processes, as opposed to external cues, have to be used to initiate switching processes.</s><s>This is typically the case when subjects have to remember the rules and the time points of rule changes necessary to switch responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref

these also impinge on prefrontal networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>However, there is a multitude of cognitive sub-processes (e.g.</s><s>response reconfiguration processes) and

switching mechanisms are reflected by the N2 and P3 event-related potential (ERP) components: During switching, mechanisms related to the resolution of conflict between simultaneously active

for modulations at the neurophysiological level <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>This is why we observed effects in the RIDE-decomposed data, but not the original ERP data.</s><s>We demonstrated that the S-cluster and the C-cluster do not reflect the interaction observed at the behavioral level.</s><s>This suggests that processes of perceptual gating and attentional selection,

response-based interference processes play an important role in task switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> , especially when there are 'bivalent responses' and overlaps in 'response sets' .</s><s>Bivalent responses occur when identical motor responses are either used in different tasks, or for the same stimulus categories in a task switching experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>This was the case in the current study, as the response categories "numeric", "parity" and "font size" overlapped; i.e. left and right hand responses were required in

type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>This response-related aspect of switching (and switch costs) is referred to as 'response recoding process' <ref

costs, as well as the switching effect in the R-cluster became larger across blocks in the memory-based condition than in the cue-based condition.</s><s>It is possible that with increasing time spent on the memory-based task, the inference between response categories becomes increasingly difficult to dissolve at the level of motor responses, or response recoding.</s><s>It has been suggested that response recoding processes are likely to be triggered by the response itself and therefore occur quite late during information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>In line with this, the effects observed in the R-cluster data occur ~700 ms after target stimulus presentation and thus in the time range of the RTs.</s><s>This underlines the interpretation that the modulations seen in the R-cluster may reflect response recoding processes.</s><s>Yet, modulations of response recoding processes only happen when working memory processes are used to guide switching.</s><s>The sLORETA analysis suggests that such modulations of the R-cluster were due to modulations of neuronal activity in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG; BA10) (contrast: block 1 &lt; block 3).</s><s>Previous results using fMRI suggest that response recoding processes are associated with the right lateral prefrontal cortex during task switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>Such lateral prefrontal regions have also been shown to be important in response inhibition processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref

fatigue effects are mainly observed in the memory-based condition is because working memory and response recoding processes put high demands on neural processes in prefrontal networks, presumably the right middle frontal gyrus, and that this ultimately makes these prefrontal neural processes susceptible to time-on-task (fatigability) effects.</s><s>Importantly, this interpretation is completely in line with assumptions of the opportunity cost model on fatigue effects by Kurzban et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>According to this account, opportunity costs leading to declines in task performance with increasing "time-on-task" are particularly high when the involved cognitive processes rely on prefrontal networks.</s><s>Since there are capacity limitations to the number of computational operations that the prefrontal cortex can engage in at any given time, there are large opportunity costs to performing tasks recruiting the prefrontal cortex.</s><s>Yet, this also implies that the degree to which performance is affected depends on the degree to which the tasks engage similar prefrontal regions 3 .</s><s>Given this theoretical background, it seems reasonable that response recoding processes associated with prefrontal structures are only affected when working memory demands are increased, as switching and working memory processes presumably recruit overlapping areas in the lateral prefrontal cortex.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the study investigated the boundary conditions of fatigability effects on cognitive flexibility.</s><s>The behavioral results show that task switching is affected by TOT effects, mainly when working memory processes are needed to control task switching.</s><s>On a neurophysiological level, this effect could only be observed after accounting for intra-individual variability in the data.</s><s>The neurophysiological data suggests that during task switching, fatigability specifically affects response recoding processes that are associated with functions of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG; BA10).</s><s>The results underline the propositions of the opportunity cost model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , which states that fatigability affects functions of the prefrontal cortex and that the degree to which performance is affected depends on the degree to which the tasks engage similar prefrontal regions -in this case working memory and task switching mechanisms.</s><s>Our findings provide new insights into the neurophysiological underpinnings on TOT effects underlying cognitive flexibility.</s><s>TOT effects are strongly associated to fatigability effects occurring in a wide range of chronic diseases like MS and IBD.</s></p></div>
