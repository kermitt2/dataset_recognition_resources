<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>The study was performed in two university hospitals in Switzerland (Lausanne and Basel) between January 2006 and May 2010.</s><s>Patients older than 18 years of age who presented in the emergency department with clinical suspicion of joint sepsis, defined as the occurrence of acute signs of inflammation of the native joint (redness, warmth, effusion or pain), were prospectively included.</s><s>Demographic, clinical, laboratory and microbiology data were collected using a standardised case report form.</s><s>The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating study centres.</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition</head><p><s>The diagnoses of septic arthritis and non-septic arthritis were made by experienced rheumatologists or orthopaedic surgeons.</s><s>Septic arthritis was diagnosed by considering the finding of acute arthritis together with findings such as positive Gram stain, positive culture of synovial fluid and positive blood culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Non-septic arthritis was diagnosed by using serological tests, polarisation microscopy, histopathology and imaging according to standard rheumatologic and orthopaedic practice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specimen collection</head><p><s>Synovial fluid was aspirated by the rheumatologist or orthopaedic surgeon using a standardised aseptic technique.</s><s>One millilitre of the fluid was immediately transferred into a 4-ml microcalorimetry vial pre-filled with 2 ml of tryptic soy broth.</s><s>The remaining fluid was transferred into a native vial for Gram stain and culture, and, whenever possible, into an EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) tube for the determination of leucocyte counts.</s><s>In addition, two to three pairs of blood cultures were collected in all patients with temperature &gt;38 °C before any antibiotic treatment was started.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard microbiology methods</head><p><s>A quantity of 0.1 ml of synovial fluid was inoculated on agar plates and incubated aerobically for 5 days with 5 % CO 2 and anaerobically for 7 days at 37 °C.</s><s>In addition, 0.5 ml of synovial fluid was inoculated in thioglycolate broth and the residual volume was inoculated into a BacT/ALERT anaerobic blood culture bottle (bioMérieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France) and incubated for 7 days.</s><s>Blood culture bottle pairs were placed into the BacT/Alert 3D blood culture instrument and incubated for 5 days or until they signalled positive for growth.</s><s>Signal-positive bottles were handled according to standard laboratory protocols for identification.</s><s>Identification was performed using standard biochemical microbiological techniques or Microflex LT MALDI-TOF (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microcalorimetry</head><p><s>Ampoules inoculated with 1 ml of synovial fluid were inserted into an isothermal microcalorimeter equipped with 48 measuring channels (thermal activity monitor, model 3102 TAM III; TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA), first in the equilibration position for 15 min to reach 37 °C and then for another 30 min to obtain an accurate measurement of heat flow.</s><s>Heat production was then measured continuously and expressed as heat flow over time in microwatts (μW).</s><s>The sensitivity of the microcalorimeter provided by the manufacturer was 0.225 μW t.</s></p><p><s>The detection time was defined as the time from the insertion of an ampoule into the microcalorimeter until exponential growth produced a rising heat flow rate signal and a heat flow 10 μW (i.e.</s><s>40 times the effective sensitivity of the calorimeters) above the lowest point of the power-time curve was observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The readers of the microcalorimetry results were blinded to the clinical and other laboratory results of the patients.</s><s>No repeated reading to assess the reproducibility of microcalorimetry was performed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>The mean along with the standard deviation (SD) for variables were calculated.</s><s>A 2 × 2 contingency table was used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of microcalorimetry compared to the diagnosis of septic arthritis.</s><s>Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables of synovial fluid and blood (i.e.</s><s>positivity of Gram stain, microcalorimetry and blood culture) of septic and non-septic arthritis patients.</s><s>Continuous synovial fluid variables (i.e.</s><s>leucocyte count and percentage of neutrophils) of septic arthritis were compared with those of non-septic arthritis using the Mann-Whitney Utest, since Shapiro-Wilk tests did not show normal distributions of these variables.</s><s>Differences were considered to be statistically significant when the p-value was &lt;0.05.</s><s>All analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We showed that microcalorimetry of synovial fluid has excellent performance and can be used to differentiate septic from non-septic arthritis.</s><s>Microcalorimetry also provides faster results than conventional cultures of synovial fluid or blood.</s><s>The results of the present study were obtained within 8 h.</s><s>When handling and data analysis were included, the results will be obtained in no more than 9 h.</s><s>This is comparable to a recent study where microcalorimetry can detect ∼10 5 colonyforming units (CFU)/ml of bacteria in artificial urine within 7 h (including the preparation and data processing time) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Because it can provide rapid results <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, microcalorimetry will have benefit in conditions where fast differentiation between infectious and non-infectious causes of a disease is important, for example in differentiating septic from nonseptic arthritis.</s><s>The excellent specificity and high specificity of microcalorimetry in diagnosing septic arthritis as shown in this study can help the clinician in making a decision for the treatment.</s><s>Its high specificity of 99 % means that, in case of positive results, we can be 99 % sure that there is septic arthritis.</s><s>Consequently, arthroscopic lavage and antimicrobial treatment can be started.</s><s>The sensitivity of microcalorimetry of 89 % however, which means that septic arthritis cannot be excluded with negative calorimetry results.</s><s>Efforts on increasing the sensitivity of microcalorimetry in the clinical setting is ongoing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In the setting of septic arthritis, the sensitivity may be increased by using a larger volume of synovial fluid and supplemented growth media.</s><s>We found one false-positive microcalorimetry result in the present study.</s><s>It was perhaps caused by contamination, as the culture of medium grew a typical skin bacterium (Corynebacterium spp.).</s><s>One falsenegative microcalorimetry result was also not diagnosed by synovial fluid culture and by Gram stain, but with blood culture only (Streptococcus mitis).</s><s>The patient with this false-negative microcalorimetry received antibiotics before joint aspiration.</s></p><p><s>Our study is the first on the use of microcalorimetry in the diagnosis of septic arthritis; therefore, no comparison with other studies is possible.</s><s>We recently showed that microcalorimetry of sonication fluid increases the accuracy and, most importantly, led to faster diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>At present, the obstacles for widespread clinical use of microcalorimetry are the technical aspects (e.g.</s><s>size of the instruments) and the price.</s><s>Once these aspects are improved, the microcalorimeter can soon be a standard method in clinical microbiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the potential of microcalorimetry in antimicrobial susceptibility testing has recently been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Braissant and colleagues showed an excellent correlation between microcalorimetry and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the automated system VITEK® 2 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The results of the studies show promise that microcalorimetry can be used to guide antibiotic therapy in septic arthritis.</s><s>Another novel diagnostic method that has been evaluated for its improvement in the sensitivity of microbial detection in synovial fluid of septic arthritis is polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</s><s>The results of these studies were inconclusive.</s><s>Yang and co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> used a real-time PCR assay and showed a sensitivity and specificity of 95 and 97 %, respectively, compared with bacterial culture of synovial fluid.</s><s>However, in another study, Bonilla and co-workers showed that only 10 of 16 septic arthritis (sensitivity of 63 %) were detected correctly <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are several limitations of this study.</s><s>Firstly, only a small number of patients with septic arthritis were included in this study.</s><s>Yet, with this small number, this study can already show the significant difference of microcalorimetry results between septic and non-septic arthritis patients.</s><s>Secondly, the bacteria in the synovial fluid culture were not enumerated and we could not investigate the relation between the bacterial count and the microcalorimetry detection time.</s><s>However, another study has shown that microcalorimetry can detect bacteria as low as 1 CFU/ml <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and we have shown the inverse relation between CFU and the time to positivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we reported the potential role of microcalorimetry in diagnosing septic arthritis.</s><s>Microcalorimetry can be used for the accurate and rapid diagnosis of septic arthritis.</s><s>It has the potential to prompt early initiation of joint lavage and, consequently, lead to improved outcome of septic arthritis,</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>cFig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Heat flow curves of patients with septic arthritis.</s><s>The microorganisms mentioned are bacteria found on synovial fluid culture</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,51.08,526.96,238.02,164.86" type="bitmap" /></figure>
