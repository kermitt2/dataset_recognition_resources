<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sick leave and hospitalisation</head><p><s>The proportion of employed patients with at least one episode of sick leave due to AS within 12 months declined from 44% (2000) to 29% (2012).</s><s>This was accompanied by a reduced mean number of days on sick leave per year from 70 to 60 days in patients with episodes of sick leave.</s><s>Taking all employed patients as a denominator, the days on sick leave per person declined from 21.4 (2000) to 10.4 (2012).</s></p><p><s>While the annual incidence of inpatient treatment remained stable with about 10-12% of all patients across the years, the annual cumulative duration of hospitalisation decreased from 22 days in 2000 to 16 days in 2012.</s><s>This trend accounts for a decline in per capita annual hospital days from 2.3 to 1.4 days for all patients.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In the past century, pharmacotherapeutic options for patients with AS were limited to NSAIDs and sDMARDs, with the latter having no proven efficacy on the clinical manifestation of axial inflammation. <ref type="bibr">12 24</ref></s><s>The introduction of biological therapies enlarged the pharmacotherapeutic armamentum, with strong evidence for clinical and functional efficacy of TNFi in patients with AS. <ref type="bibr">12 25</ref> While these treatments have successively entered routine care during the past decade, real-life data describing trends in drug treatment and clinical outcomes in patients with AS are scarce.</s><s>Our national database enables us to investigate large samples of patients with AS for over more than a decade, enrolled annually by a stable setting of rheumatological hospital outpatient centres and private practices in Germany.</s><s>We observed that the proportion of patients with AS treated with TNFi increased to more than 50%.</s><s>This reflects that in Germany, while patients with AS in the population are mainly treated by general practitioners or orthopaedic surgeons, those with the most severe disease are referred to rheumatologists, often because of the indication for biological treatment.</s><s>It has to be noted that patients with AS in the national database were reported in almost equal shares by tertiary care centres and private practices, while specialised care in rheumatology was about 75% practice-based. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>Considering the TNFi prescription rates of 43% in private practices and of 60% in tertiary care centres in 2012-reflecting the more severely ill patients in tertiary hospital centres-the adjusted estimate of total prescription rates of TNFi to patients with AS in German rheumatology would be 47%.</s><s>Extrapolation from these numbers to the total prescription rates of TNFi for AS in Germany is not possible since data are lacking on the proportion of patients in the population treated by rheumatologists.</s><s>In any case, the prescription rate for AS in the population will be far lower.</s><s>In parallel with the increase in TNFi prescription, the use of sDMARDs and glucocorticoids decreased.</s><s>In accordance with the current ASAS/EULAR recommendations on the management of AS, <ref type="bibr">12 27</ref> NSAIDs are used as the first choice treatment, and they have been prescribed increasingly in combination with TNFi therapy.</s></p><p><s>AS leads to impaired spinal mobility which, together with pain, stiffness and fatigue, decreases patients' ability to perform daily activities and it may severely impair quality of life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>Longer disease duration and increasing age are associated with decreased functioning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>lthough the majority of patients in our database have longstanding AS and are aged around 50, patientreported outcomes and physical function improved over the years.</s><s>According to German statutory pension insurance data from 2000 to 2012, rehabilitation measures  were reduced by one-third, most significantly in men with AS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Although the hospitalisation rate is stable, the mean duration of inpatient treatment decreased from 3 to 2 weeks.</s><s>This decrease may be attributable to better treatment options but may also be due to changes in the reimbursement system for hospitals in Germany during this time period.</s><s>Data from a randomised trial of adalimumab in patients with AS revealed that improvements in quality of life and the physical consequences associated with AS have a direct relationship with a patient's ability to work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s>In a literature review of studies from the 1980s and 1990s, in European cohorts with comparable disease duration but 7-9 years younger age on average, rates of disability retirement between 15% and 36% were reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>Since AS typically begins in early adulthood, structural spine damage, pain and disability affect the patients' working ability and quality of life in a pervasive manner. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>In our data, despite increasing disease duration, early retirement rates decreased from 19% to 14%, and in male patients down to 12%.</s><s>A current analysis of German health insurance data shows a stronger decrease in the incidence of work disability pensions because of AS rather than because of all non-rheumatic diseases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>A positive impact on all workrelated outcomes was seen for treatment with biologics in AS in a recent systematic review, yet statistical significance was not met, most likely due to methodological limitations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>Improved working ability is also suggested in our data by the continuous trend across most age groups, approaching employment rates of the general population.</s><s>Sick leave rates among employed patients decreased by 15%, accompanied by a notable reduction of the duration of sick leave episodes.</s></p><p><s>The study has a number of limitations.</s><s>First, with regard to disease outcomes, our analyses were limited to global physician and patient assessments since no information on structural damage is collected in the framework of the national database.</s><s>We did not show changes in AS-specific indices such as BASMI, BASDAI or BASFI, since they were introduced in the national database in 2007 only and, therefore, are not available for the entire period of interest.</s><s>Second, it is not possible to transfer our results to the general population with AS in Germany.</s><s>Patients with AS are typically referred to a rheumatologist by their general practitioner or orthopaedic surgeon if standard care is not sufficient and changes in treatment, including biological therapy, are necessary.</s><s>In addition, we may have underestimated the overall improvements over time since patients with good treatment response are less likely to return to the rheumatologist.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, despite these limitations, we were able to demonstrate that routine rheumatological care of patients with AS has changed tremendously during the past decade, mainly driven by the introduction of TNF inhibitors.</s><s>At the same time, disease control and patient-reported outcomes remarkably improved, also reflected in reduced healthcare utilisation and increasing participation in the labour market.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>et al.</s><s>RMD Open
