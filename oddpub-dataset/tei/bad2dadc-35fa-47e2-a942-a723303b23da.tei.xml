exposure to daylight (without seasonal differences) than younger participants; this is likely related to working hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we found that the photopic baseline pupil size was larger in winter, even in the younger subgroup (&lt;60 years; n = 6): again, this finding contradicts our previous study <ref type="bibr"

first glance, this might suggest that pupil size can mechanistically influence the magnitude of pupil light response simply because of a greater photon flux reaching the retina in eyes with larger pupils.</s><s>Indeed, Nissen et al. showed a significant difference in PIPR (defined as post-stimulus pupil area under the curve) obtained from the same blue light presented to a pharmacologically dilated pupil vs. a pharmacologically contracted pupil <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(79)</ref>.</s><s>However, the seasonal difference in the baseline photopic pupil size in our participants was quite small (mean difference 0.7 mm) and it did not approach the large difference in pupil size as obtained from pharmacologically manipulated pupils.</s><s>Thus, an anisocoria less than 1 mm would not be expected to sufficiently explain the seasonal difference in PIPR.</s><s>Joyce et al. confirmed that normalizing pupil metrics to baseline size, as we have done in calculating relative pupil size, eliminates an anisocoria effect of PIPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(80)</ref>.</s><s>It is more likely that this seasonal variation of the light-adapted baseline pupil size is an independent
