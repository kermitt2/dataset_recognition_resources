decreased <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , however, to our knowledge the ability of HDL particles from ESRD patients to function in overall RCT has not been investigated thus far.</s><s>In the present study we used in addition to in vitro studies an in vivo approach to directly measure RCT from macrophages to feces <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Our data thereby add a reduction in the RCT functionality of HDL to pathophysiological concepts of increased CVD in patients with reduced kidney function and uremia.</s></p><p><s>An interesting question is the underlying pathophysiology and therefore the mechanistic basis for the oxidative modifications observed in this study within HDL apolipoproteins in ESRD.</s><s>It is established that ESRD patients display a proinflammatory state and suffer from an increased oxidative stress burden <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> .</s><s>Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme expressed by macrophages and neutrophils that is released in response to proinflammatory stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, plasma levels of MPO have been shown to be significantly increased in patients with ESRD and also to be a predictor of mortality in hemodialysis patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>MPO has been previously demonstrated to cause oxidative modifications of HDL apolipoproteins that might impact their functionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Hypochloric acid (HOCl) can mimic MPO-induced oxidation in vitro.</s><s>By modifiying HDL from healthy controls with HOCl we were able to replicate the functional deficits displayed by ESRD-HDL, namely a decreased efficacy in promoting cholesterol efflux as well as a reduced ability to deliver cholesterol to cells via SR-BI.</s><s>These data provide an additional line of evidence that MPO might play a key role in causing the decreased functionality of HDL in ESRD and that MPO might therefore represent an interesting target for pharmacological inhibition in ESRD patients.</s></p><p><s>Testing HDL functionality in addition to measuring mass HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels is an emerging concept in the field of HDL research <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> .</s><s>However, although multiple potentially beneficial effects have been described for HDL <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , there are limitations for the clinical setting, since reliable and reproducible assays to test these functions are lacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Thus far, several dysfunctionalities were ascribed to HDL from ESRD patients.</s><s>It was reported that ESRD is less effective in protecting LDL against copper mediated oxidation in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>These data could be interpreted as a further indication that HDL from ESRD patients is already oxidized to a substantial extent and therefore cannot properly fulfil anti-oxidative functions.</s><s>Furthermore, a decreased functionality of HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux has been demonstrated in ESRD patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Regarding testing properties related to RCT in vitro our data suggest that also assays addressing selective uptake through SR-BI from given HDL preparations might be valuable, since this also represents a key step for effective RCT that might be differentially affected compared with cholesterol efflux.</s></p><p><s>For a balanced interpretation of our results the following points should be taken into account.</s><s>(i) We demonstrate that ESRD-HDL is dysfunctional in mediating RCT in wild-type mice.</s><s>RCT in mice largely depends on HDL and the HDL selective uptake receptor SR-BI.</s><s>In contrast, in humans RCT is mainly based on the LDL receptor mediating hepatic cholesterol uptake following transfer of cholesteryl esters out of HDL into apoB-containing lipoproteins by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which is not expressed in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Although ESRD-HDL apparently has a decreased interaction with several relevant components of the HDL metabolism system, it remains to be formally established that also in humans ESRD-HDL is defective in mediating in vivo RCT.</s><s>(ii) In addition, we focussed in our in vitro studies on the classical RCT pathway, investigating macrophage efflux and hepatic uptake.</s><s>We did not assess a contribution of transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE) to RCT, which might also have relevance here <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>In previous work, we estimated the contribution of TICE to RCT to be around 30% under baseline conditions in wild-type mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , while others found higher values <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>However, results from lipoprotein kinetic studies indicate that HDL does not represent the lipoprotein subclass that donates cholesterol to the TICE pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , at least not directly.</s><s>In a system expressing CETP such as humans, this contribution might be higher, but this questions remains to be experimentally answered.</s><s>(iii) Furthermore, the patient and the control group differed in several aspects other than the presence/absence of ESRD such as diabetes, smoking or use of lipid lowering medication and we cannot formally exclude that these differences impact the results.</s><s>However, there were no differences within the ESRD group between either smokers/non-smokers, diabetic/non-diabetic patients and patients with or without lipid lowering medication (data not shown).</s><s>Furthermore, also the results for cholesterol efflux as well as selective uptake were not different between ESRD patients displaying all additional risk factors combined (smoking, diabetes, lipid lowering medication) and those without, while each ESRD group differed significantly from controls (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>These data indicate that the presence of ESRD might have a substantially stronger effect on the impairment of HDL function than any of these potential confounders.</s><s>Also, none of the conclusions changed when the smokers were excluded from analysis (data not shown).</s><s>(iv) The design of our study does not enable us to draw a firm conclusion, if the observed differences in HDL function are due to the hemodialysis treatment or the presence of ESRD.</s><s>Future studies including patients with ESRD naïve to hemodialysis are warranted to address this issue.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our data demonstrate that HDL from ESRD patients is extensively oxidatively modified and displays reduced efficacy in key protective functions related to CVD, namely promoting (i) cellular cholesterol efflux, (ii) SR-BI-mediated cholesterol delivery and (iii) overall functional RCT in vivo.</s><s>These results might have major implications to explain the excessive increase in CVD risk in uremic patients.</s></p></div>
