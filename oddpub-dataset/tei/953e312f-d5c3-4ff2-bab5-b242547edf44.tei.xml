icatibant counteracts this activity by inhibiting the bradykinin receptor.</s></p><p><s>The results also revealed some surprising information concerning the use of icatibant plus add-on medications to treat attacks.</s><s>Although attenuated androgens and antifibrinolytics are not recommended for the treatment of acute attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, approximately 3% of total attacks were treated with these medications following dosing with icatibant.</s><s>Of the 56 attacks that were treated with icatibant plus on-demand androgens, 34 (60.7%)</s><s>attacks occurred while androgens were also used for LTP, suggesting that if icatibant were determined to be insufficient for resolving an attack, patients simply resorted to readily available treatments for rescue.</s><s>The remaining 22 attacks that were treated with on-demand androgens occurred without LTP; these attacks were reported by 11 patients, and may reflect a lack of knowledge on the part of the patients or physicians regarding selection of appropriate treatments for acute attacks.</s><s>Androgens might also be used as a form of short-term prophylaxis to reduce the chance of occurrence of a later attack (for example prior to traveling or a dental procedure).</s></p><p><s>Some limitations of this study should be noted.</s><s>Although the data suggest that the attack rate while using C1-INH, androgens, or tranexamic acid for LTP was similar and that LTP was effective in reducing the attack rate of patients with severe disease to the same rate as patients with less severe disease, this was not a randomized trial in which patients were randomly assigned to receive LTP, and adherence to LTP treatment was not monitored.</s><s>The goal of this analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of icatibant in treating breakthrough attacks, rather than to compare different LTP options.</s><s>Data confirming disease severity prior to initiation of prophylactic treatment were also not available as a baseline comparison.</s><s>In addition, the C1-INH treatment group was relatively small.</s><s>Thus, these data cannot be used to evaluate the effectiveness of LTP or to compare the various LTP treatments.</s><s>The small number of C1-INH users in the database population does reflect our clinical experience in that very few patients use C1-INH at the recommended dose of 1000 U every 3-4 days; instead, doses and regimens are often adjusted according to individual patients' responses.</s><s>Thus it is difficult to fully assess the impact of C1-INH in comparison to other LTP treatments.</s><s>In addition, C1-INH is indicated for both LTP and the treatment of acute attacks, and patients who use C1-INH for LTP often use it to treat breakthrough attacks as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>As this analysis only includes attacks treated with icatibant, it is possible that some attacks were treated with C1-INH or other medications instead of icatibant, thus the true number of attacks with and without LTP could potentially be higher than reported here.</s><s>Information on attacks that were treated with medications other than icatibant is not included in IOS.</s><s>Of the 121 breakthrough attacks that occurred while on prophylaxis with C1-INH, 20 attacks were treated with rescue medication, and C1-INH was used exclusively for all 20 attacks.</s><s>This further emphasizes the high frequency of C1-INH use for both prophylaxis and acute treatment indications.</s></p></div>
