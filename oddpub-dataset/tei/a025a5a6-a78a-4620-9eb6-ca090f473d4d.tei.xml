<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>AI is a disease with still unknown pathogenesis and inadequate therapeutic options.</s><s>It destructs axillary, inguinal, gluteal, and perianal regions of very young people, causing profound pain, large amounts of purulent and malodorous exudate, and metabolic alterations, and results in reduced quality of life, social isolation, and diminished life expectancy.</s><s>Evidence for pathogenetically relevant molecules that at the same time are useful as blood biomarkers for more exact quantification of AI disease severity may facilitate the development of novel therapies for these patients.</s><s>The results demonstrated in this manuscript suggest that MMP8 is such a molecule.</s><s>We show a strong upregulation of MMP8 in AI lesion compared to skin from healthy controls and psoriasis patients.</s><s>MMP8 is mainly produced by neutrophilic granulocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and this very well matches the observed strong dermal infiltration of Al lesions by neutrophils and the large purulent exudates in these patients.</s><s>In contrast, neutrophilic infiltration is limited to epidermal Munro's microabscesses in psoriasis, and purulence exudates are absent in this disease.</s><s>Regarding MMP8 production, we additionally demonstrated that TNF- is a potent inductor of MMP8 in neutrophilic granulocytes and, moreover, exerts this effect also on fibroblasts.</s><s>Accordingly, there was a strong positive correlation between MMP8 and TNF- blood levels.</s><s>It is possible that bacterial products induce TNF- production in lesional monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophilic granulocytes and contribute to elevated MMP8 expression.</s></p><p><s>The major substrate of MMP8 is the collagen type 1 that forms large collagen fibers in most connective tissues, including the dermis, giving these tissues rigidity and elasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>We assume that degradation of this extracellular matrix component by MMP8 in AI lesions might lead to the development of skin cavities (abscesses and draining sinus tracts), as very recently demonstrated for cavities developing in lung tissue during human pulmonary tuberculosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Due to the lack of cutaneous MMP8 expression in psoriatic lesions, abscesses and draining sinus tracts are absent in psoriasis.</s></p><p><s>In the last part of our study we demonstrated that the high lesional MMP8 levels in AI were accompanied by elevated MMP8 blood levels.</s><s>Importantly, these levels positively correlated with disease activity, in particular with their inflammatory components.</s><s>We suggest that MMP8 blood quantification should be incorporated in future clinical trials.</s><s>The currently used methods for evaluating the disease activity are often time-consuming (especially with Sartorius' grading system) and undoubtedly subjective; deviations commonly occur when assessment is conducted by different physicians and centers.</s><s>What is currently needed are laboratory parameters useful for accurate AI staging, for decision of the therapeutic regimen, and for assessment of treatment efficacy.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, our study also revealed an association between MMP8 and metabolic alterations in AI patients.</s><s>In fact, MMP8 blood levels negatively correlated with HDLcholesterol, an antiatherogenic lipid.</s><s>Accordingly, Salminen at al. described that MMP8 affects the structure and antiatherogenic function of apolipoprotein (apo)A-I, the main protein component of HDL particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Proteolytic modification of apoA-I by MMP8 has been found to impair the first steps of reverse cholesterol transport, leading to increased accumulation of cholesterol in blood vessel walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, we observed a strong positive correlation between MMP8 and resistin blood levels.</s><s>There is quite clear evidence that resistin plays an important role in atherosclerosis.</s><s>It stimulates proinflammatory cytokine expression in human monocytic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and increases adhesion molecule expression and chemokine production by endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, leading to immune cell extravasation and development of atherosclerotic plaques.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our results demonstrate the strong presence of MMP8 in skin lesions and blood of AI patients and suggest the pathogenetic involvement of this molecule in skin and systemic alterations observed in AI patients.</s><s>Moreover, we propose the use of MMP8 as biomarker for AI disease activity.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Lesional AI Skin.</s><s>The mechanisms associated with the development and progression of AI lesions (Figure1(a)) are still enigmatic.</s><s>To identify potential key players in these processes, we first individually quantified the expression of a broad range of immune</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
