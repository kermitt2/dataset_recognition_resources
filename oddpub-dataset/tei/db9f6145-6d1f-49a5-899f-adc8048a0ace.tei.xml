<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study revealed the promotive activity of androgens on cellular proliferation, adult neurogenesis, and the production of GnRH3 neurons, partly via adult neurogenesis, in the female tilapia brain.</s><s>Since testosterone, the major androgen in mammals and birds <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> , can be converted to estradiol by aromatase, it is difficult to discern the effects of testosterone from that of estradiol in these animals.</s><s>Importantly, 11-KT is a non-aromatizable androgen and the most potent natural androgen in teleosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> and helped identify effects of androgen on mature female tilapia in this study.</s><s>A previous study by our group has shown that 11-KT and methyltestosterone, but not estradiol, increased the number of GnRH3 neurons in female tilapia, suggesting the promotive role of androgen in the proliferation and/or differentiation of GnRH3 neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Immunostaining with PCNA antibody revealed that 11-KT treatment had a positive effect on cellular proliferation in the brain.</s><s>BrdU-tracing combined with Hu-immunostaining suggested that 11-KT induced adult neurogenesis in mature females.</s><s>On the other hand, BrdU-tracing combined with GFAP-immunostaining indicated that 11-KT treatment did not stimulate the production of newly-generated ventricular radial glial cells, which are regarded as progenitor cells in the adult fish brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> .</s><s>Although they are mostly transient in developing mammals, radial glial cells are maintained in the adult central nervous system of fish, and serve as guides for migrating neurons as well as the major source of neural and glial precursor cells [for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> ].</s><s>Perez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> have reported that PCNA-positive cells correspond to GFAP-positive radial glial cells in fish <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> .</s><s>These radial glial cells in fish are reported to express steroid receptors including androgen receptors, and are directly targeted by steroids <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .</s><s>Thus, combined with our present results, it is indicated that 11-KT may have induced mitosis of radial glia cells (PCNA-positive cells) which produced newly-generated neurons (Hu-and BrdU-double labelled cells) but not newly-generated radial glial cells (GFAP-and BrdU-double labelled cells).</s></p><p><s>In addition, based on BrdU-tracing combined with GnRH3-immunostaining, 11-KT

resulted from adult neurogenesis.</s><s>However, since the GnRH3-and BrdU-double labelled cells were only a small part of GnRH3 neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>), it is a

neurons in some vertebrates can be generated in certain conditions, like lesions or hormonal treatments such as androgen exposure.</s></p><p><s>Tilapia have distinct sexual dimorphism in the number of GnRH3 neurons; mature males have more GnRH3 neurons than mature females <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Multiple studies have reported sex differences in GnRH3 neurons or gnrh3

slightly higher in females than males, although no sex differences in the total area of gnrh3 expression were detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> .</s><s>In tilapia, other than courtship behaviours, sexual reproductive behaviours were clearly different between the sexes; males exhibited nest building and aggressive behaviours, whereas in females maternal oral egg incubation was observed.</s><s>It is reported that GnRH3 is a potent neuromodulator of male reproductive behaviours in tilapia <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Thus, the strong neuromodulatory role of GnRH3 neurons on the male-specific reproductive behaviours is related to the large population of GnRH3 neurons in male tilapia and the promotive effect of 11-KT on them.</s><s>In addition, we confirmed that the expression level of GnRH3 mRNA was also increased by 11-KT treatment.</s><s>Among the gonadal hormones, estradiol has been recognized as a major modulator of adult neurogenesis due
