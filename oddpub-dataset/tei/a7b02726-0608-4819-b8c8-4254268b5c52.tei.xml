(2015)</ref> proposed a novel "resource-control" theory to combine both "resource" <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Smallwood and Schooler, 2006)</ref> and "control-failure" (McVay and <ref type="bibr">Kane, 2010)</ref> theories of mind wandering to explain performance decrements over time.</s><s>They suggested that as executive control fades over time, resource distribution favors mind wandering, which, in turn, decreases performance.</s><s>Consistent with this view, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Thomson et al. (2014)</ref> recently found that the cost of mind wandering not only decreases overall performance in a high-demand task overall but is also associated with a decrease in accuracy over time in both low-and high-demand tasks.</s><s>This is consistent with the levels-of-inattention hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Schad et al., 2012)</ref> suggesting that increased time on task can not only induce mental shifts from task-performance to mind wandering, but can also alter the nature of the mind wandering state by eliciting deeper levels of mind wandering or inattention.</s></p><p><s>To assess the effect of everyday activities during a break on working memory performance, we chose three common break activities: Eyes-open resting was compared to listening to music and playing a video game.</s><s>We specifically chose these three break activities in our study because they are often used in empirical studies and they are popular and widespread in everyday life <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jaušovec et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bavelier et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dewar et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Restful breaks have been found to be one of the most effective interventions connected to improving working memory performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ross et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Helton and Russell, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lim et al. (2013)</ref> found that improvement of task performance after a break may also depend on individual differences in the ability to best make use of break opportunities.</s><s>Resource theory implies that the ability of an intervention to afford performance recovery is higher if there is little overlap between the intervention and the specific processing resources of the primary task.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Helton and Russell (2015)</ref> found that visuospatial task performance was best after a "complete rest" break in comparison to the four other break interventions, which consisted of either (1) continuing performance of the visuospatial task or alternately engagement with (2) an alphanumeric letter detection task, (3) a spatial memory task or (4) a verbal memory task.</s></p><p><s>Music has been linked to aspects of cognitive performance by the so called "Mozart Effect, " where short-term listening to classical music significantly enhanced spatial reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rauscher et al., 1993)</ref>.</s><s>However, this effect is highly controversial: More recent research suggests that beneficial effects of music are mediated by mood, arousal and musical preference, rather than being a discrete and unique effect of the musical qualities of classical music <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Thompson et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Koelsch, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Video games have been linked to enhancement in a wide variety of perceptual, attentional, and cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boot et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Eichenbaum et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>For example, expert video game players often outperform non-players on working memory tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boot et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Meanwhile, video games have been associated with a variety of negative outcomes: Gaming in general has been found to be able to induce physiological stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hébert et al., 2005)</ref>, and the sound of a video game can disturb the players' concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lipscomb and Zehnder, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bavelier et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The positive or negative effect of video game playing on cognitive performance can depend on the types of video games played <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barlett et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boot et al. (2008)</ref> found that playing a highly complex strategy game can improve executive control and memory more than playing an action or a puzzle game.</s><s>Playing violent video games, on the other hand, was shown to decrease the ability to exert executive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barlett et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>So far, research has rarely explored the effects of video games interleaved with working memory tasks, though a few studies have already found an effect on explicit memory performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dewar et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tang, 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We expected gaming and music to have a differential effect on working memory performance compared to rest via their effects on mind wandering.</s><s>We hypothesized that different breaks may have different effects on working memory function over time and we investigated a previous suggestion that such differences could be linked to mind wandering <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Thomson et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Daily Mind Wandering and Self-reported Ability to Concentrate</head><p><s>To investigate the effects of mind wandering, we tested if the self-report DMW questionnaire and the two VAS questions for self-reported ability to concentrate (i.e., the ability to concentrate during the task and thoughts about the task during the break) would contribute to the significant interaction between block and break activity (game vs. rest) in the 3-back task performance.</s><s>We found a significant three-way interaction between break activity (game vs. rest), block and self-reported DMW, β = −2.7,</s><s>t = −1.96,</s><s>p = 0.05, showing that the impairment of task performance over time after gaming was particularly prominent in subjects scoring high in DMW (p = 0.002), but was not significant in those scoring low in DMW (p = 0.06; see in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, we found a significant three-way interaction involving subjects' ability to concentrate on the task after the break, β = 3.6, t = 2.7, p = 0.007, indicating a larger decline of task performance over time after gaming in less concentrated subjects (p = 0.02; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>).</s><s>However, the respective interaction involving the extent to which subjects thought about the task during the break was not significant, β = −1.8,</s><s>t = −0.81,</s><s>p = 0.42, indicating that thinking about the n-back task during the break did not significantly influence performance on the n-back task.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, exploratory data analysis showed that the neuropsychological test scores did neither correlate significantly with DMW (all ps &gt; 0.32, correlation with SVF: p = 0.32), nor with self-reported ability to concentrate (all ps &gt; 0.12, correlation with SVF: p = 0.12).</s></p><p><s>Importantly, we also tested whether individual's DMW was related to the self-reported ability to concentrate on the n-back task (measured via the VAS), and indeed found that higher levels of mind wandering were associated with lower self-reported ability to concentrate (Pearson r = −0.301,</s><s>p &lt; 0.05, one-tailed), suggesting that both measures tap into related aspects of mind wandering and self-reported ability to concentrate.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>We investigated whether break activities used in daily life (i.e., wakeful resting, listening to music, and playing a video game) interact with working memory performance in young adults.</s><s>We found that a short period of passive eyes-open resting trendwise enhanced overall task performance as compared to passively listening to music.</s><s>Actively playing a video game, to the contrary, had no influence on overall task performance.</s><s>Our main finding is a differential effect of active gaming as compared to passive eyes-open resting and listening to music on the time course of working memory performance, in that after gaming subjects showed a gradual decrease of the memory performance over the course of the task compared to the two other break conditions.</s><s>Interestingly, this effect was associated with increased DMW and decreased self-reported ability to concentrate.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Task Performance is Better After Rest as Compared to Music</head><p><s>When looking at the overall effect of wakeful resting, listening to music and gaming, task performance after eyes-open resting was trendwise better compared to listening to music, hypothetically because subjects also thought more about the task during open eyes resting than during listening to music.</s><s>Consistent with the resource allocation theory, our result partially supports the hypothesis that rest is the most efficient replenishment of a common executive resource <ref type="bibr">(Helton and</ref><ref type="bibr">Russell, 2011, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, however, effects of break activities on overall task performance were weak, and not significant.</s><s>This observation suggests that break activities may not strongly affect overall working memory performance on the n-back task.</s><s>Instead, working memory performance seems to be relatively robust against such break activities at a global level.</s><s>Interestingly, however, we found more subtle changes of task-performance across the time course of the task.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gradual Performance Decline After Gaming</head><p><s>After subjects played the "Angry Birds" game, their task performance gradually declined over the course of the 3-back task, compared to task performance after eyes-open resting and listening to music.</s><s>Video gaming has been found to be reliably associated with an enhancement of visual attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bavelier et al., 2011)</ref> and increased visual attention induced by gaming may have helped subjects to better maintain task-relevant information at the beginning of the n-back task.</s><s>Thus subjects started out with a stronger task performance after gaming, which gradually decreased over time.</s><s>In support of this interpretation, immediately after every n-back task session, subjects reported that subjectively they had less ability to concentrate on the task after playing a video game as compared to listening to music, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</s><s>This may reflect a gradual depletion of cognitive resources that are necessary for working memory performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Helton and Russell, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, we found that this gradual performance decline after gaming was closely related to mind wandering: it was strongest in individuals with a high propensity to mind wander in their daily life, and in those individuals with low levels of self-reported ability to concentrate.</s><s>This result is consistent with previous reports of enhanced frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Thomson et al., 2014)</ref> and deeper levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Schad et al., 2012)</ref> of mind wandering after prolonged task execution and with the "resource-control" framework of mind wandering <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Thomson et al., 2015)</ref>, suggesting that executive control over the content of thoughts is impaired after prolonged task execution, leading to intrusions of task-unrelated thoughts.</s><s>In the present study, mind wandering mediated a performance decline specifically after playing computer games, but not after resting or listening to music.</s><s>Based on resource-control theory, computer gaming may effectively represent performance of an external task even during the break, involving continued engagement of executive resources and their continued depletion over time, leading to mind-wandering-induced performance deficits.</s><s>Listening to music or resting, to the contrary, should effectively interrupt ) daily mind wandering (DMW) scores on 3-back task performance after game, music and rest, respectively.</s><s>Subjects' self-reported DMW score was ranked higher vs. lower than median (N = 26/35: six subjects' data in the median was removed).</s><s>(B) The effect of high-(N = 17) vs. low-self-reported ability to concentrate (N = 17) scores on 3-back task performance after game, music and rest, respectively.</s><s>Subjects' self-reported ability to concentrate (i.e., the ability to concentrate on the task after the three break conditions), was ranked higher vs. lower than median (N = 34/35: one subject's data, in the median was removed).</s></p><p><s>external task-performance, allowing thoughts to wander, and may thus support recovery of executive resources.</s><s>In summary, the results show that mind wandering and reduced self-reported ability to concentrate may contribute to declining performance in high working memory load conditions after spending time with video games rather than music or rest during learning breaks.</s></p><p><s>It is possible that the effects of video gaming on the decrement of working memory performance over time are due to its influence on subjects' emotional states.</s><s>Differing from listening to music and eyes-open resting, the "Angry Birds" game is designed to use sensory and emotional features to draw players' attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kim and Lee, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>For instance, subjects hear the "bang" and "laughing" sound every time when they hit the target during gaming.</s><s>Such emotional cues might let subjects engage more in playing the "Angry Birds" game compared to other two break activities and also to the n-back task.</s><s>Upon resumption of the nback task after gaming, subjects may have felt somewhat bored and may have had difficulties to allocate their attention to the task.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Choi et al. (2013)</ref> found that emotional state interacts with working memory performance.</s><s>To support this interpretation of our current results, it would be necessary to measure emotional states during breaks in future studies.</s></p><p><s>As an interesting possibility, prolonged task execution and depletion of executive resources may not only increase the propensity for mind wandering, but may also lead to increasingly deeper levels of mind wandering <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Schad et al., 2012)</ref> after playing computer games compared to resting or listening to music, and may cause the mind to wander more deeply.</s><s>Future research assessing different levels of inattention (e.g., via the sustained attention to stimulus task; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Schad et al., 2012)</ref> will be needed to investigate this possibility empirically.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the 3-back task, we did not find significant differential learning effects of task performance in the less demanding 2-back task, which might be because in a young adult population, this 2-back task is approximately the level of difficulty that can be done rather well and that does not maximally strain available resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chooi and Thompson, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Our and other studies have also encountered ceiling effects with the 2-back <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mylius et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Future studies will have to detail performance over longer periods of time following different break activities.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>The observed effects of breaks on the n-back working memory task were found in young, well-educated subjects.</s><s>Other types of music or games, e.g., self-selected <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cassidy and Macdonald, 2009)</ref>, may result in different findings.</s><s>We aimed at maximizing the ecological validity of the break conditions.</s><s>Thus, future research will be needed to pinpoint the precise mechanisms by which eyes-open resting, listening to music, and gaming might exert their effects on working memory via cognitive processes like depletion of resources or of cognitive control.</s><s>In our study, we found no break effect on overall task performance, suggesting that n-back performance by itself was not significantly changed by different break activities.</s><s>However, our findings that gaming leads to a continuous decrement in task performance, which was related to both distal and proximal measures of mind wandering, is consistent with previous research findings of continuous performance decline due to mind wandering <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Thomson et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The current conclusions must remain tentative due to the lack of an overall effect as well as our limited sample size and power to detect more subtle effects of mind wandering or self-reported ability to concentrate.</s><s>For a more comprehensive understanding and vigorous testing of this issue, future studies are needed to illuminate the nature of the interplay between break activities, mind wandering, and task performance.</s><s>In order to not disturb subjects' engagement with respective break activities, we have obtained the selfreport measures of mind wandering and self-reported ability to concentrate retroactively.</s><s>However, it may be preferable to use real-time experience sampling, such as the thinking content scale of the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire (DSSQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Matthews et al., 2002)</ref>, self-catch task-unrelated thought and intermittent thought probes <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Smallwood and Schooler, 2015)</ref> during breaks and the n-back task.</s><s>We also did not use questionnaires to evaluate subjects' emotional state by considering both emotional arousal and valence at the same time <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Choi et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Contributions of emotional state will have to be validated by reliable physiological and behavioral data in future studies, which could also include measures of physiology (e.g., heart rate and skin conductance).</s></p></div>
