<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The purpose of this study was to investigate the employment status and job burden of patients with CH.</s><s>The main findings of this study were follows: 1) more patients were self-employed and less were employees in the CH group than in the other groups; 2) patients with CH had a 8.26× increased risk of having difficulties at work and a 15.12× increased risk of requiring sick leave compared with headache-free controls after adjusting for age, sex, and depression, anxiety, and stress levels; 3) and, in the CH group, the patients requiring sick leave were younger at CH onset and had more severe pain than those who did not require sick leave.</s></p><p><s>We found that patients with CH are more frequently self-employed than controls.</s><s>This is consistent with the previous studies about the condition of CH <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>One study reported that a greater proportion of patients with CH work full-time compared to controls without headaches; however, there was a high ratio of male patients with CH in that study, which may have biased the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>There was no difference in working time, weekly working hours, or job satisfaction between the CH group and age-sex matched controls.</s><s>The clustering of severe and painful attacks may influence patterns of employment and require greater personal responsibility; however, the reasons behind or the consequences of this pattern could not be clarified with this cross-sectional study setting.</s></p><p><s>In this study, 84.8% of patients with CH complained of difficulties in working life and over one third reported reductions in productivity and low participation.</s><s>The rate of sick leave requirement in patients with CH was reported at 29.6% in Denmark, 68% in the US, and 39.4% in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>The cultural environment and socioeconomic status may influence the sick leave rate, and 39.4% of patients with CH had 10× higher sick leave rates than controls.</s><s>Solomon et al. found that patients with CH had significantly lower rates of social activity compared with patients with migraines, in line with our findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Indirect costs from work disability and lower participation caused by CH impose a significant socioeconomic burden on patients and society <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, panic attacks, or suicidal ideation are prevalent and severe in patients with CH, especially during cluster periods or chronic CH <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Similar to the findings of previous studies, patients with CH in our study complained of higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress when compared with patients with migraine or TTH and controls.</s><s>We found higher PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PSS-4 scores in patients with CH; however, after adjustment for these confounding variables, CH still increased the risk of having difficulties at work and sick leave.</s><s>This result was similar to that of a previous study that found an association between severe and persistent migraines and increased risk of work disabilities, after adjusting for mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>This is the first study to analyze predictors of sick leave among patients with CH.</s><s>Our subgroup analysis of CH showed that sick leave was significantly associated with a younger age at CH onset, pain severity, diurnal periodicity during the daytime.</s><s>Although the significance of younger age at CH onset was decreased with multivariable logistic analysis, the association between younger age at onset and increased risk for sick leave suggested that the headaches in this subgroup started before they had the opportunity to secure meaningful employment and thus these patients were more disabled by their condition when they started working and/or less able to adapt to the working environment.</s></p><p><s>This study has several limitations.</s><s>First, the degree of occupational satisfaction, sick leave, and reductions in productivity were not examined using a scale.</s><s>These data were collected by questionnaire;
