<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INtRoDUCtIoN</head><p><s>In summer 2012, a 40-year-old sighted male patient was referred to our center, because of a suspected misalignment between his biological clock and the external light-dark (LD) cycle.</s><s>He reported to suffer from daily lapses of sleep on-and offset with a self-calculated free-running circadian rhythm of more than 25 h.</s><s>The trained electro-engineer presented with an unusual set of circumstances preceding the onset of the symptoms: in 2009, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma (Stage IVA).</s><s>He was treated with a standardized regimen of multiple courses of polychemotherapy (ABVD regimen: adriamycin 50 mg/ bleomycin 20 mg/vinblastine 10 mg/dacarbazine 750 mg; four cycles ABVD, four cycles AVD).</s><s>Luckily, the patient responded well and is still in full remission.</s><s>However, during the oncological treatment, he progressively began suffering from tiredness and inattentiveness during the day and noticed a gradual shift of his sleep-wake rhythm to later hours.</s><s>After completing the treatment, he remained unemployed and could therefore freely organize his daily schedule according to his preferred activity and sleeping times, which he managed to do using a calendar app on his smartphone.</s><s>At the time of the consultation, he had experienced a free-running rhythm for more than 3 years, did not suffer from any social disability arising from the symptoms, and reported physical and psychological wellbeing, apart from a difficulty in concentrating and a lack of attention during wakefulness.</s></p><p><s>Subjective measures of the patient's daytime sleepiness were assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (1) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (2), which both did not show any pathological findings (ESS = 0/24, PSQI daytime sleepiness -subscore = 2/3).</s><s>In particular, the ESS score was 0 of 24 points (pathological &gt; 10 points); however, the patient remarked to actually experience fatigue with inattentiveness and lack of concentration, rather than actual daytime sleepiness.</s></p><p><s>To quantify the described symptoms, we conducted multiple standard tests used for the assessment of circadian sleep-wake disorders, including non-dominant wrist actigraphy recordings with activity storage in 1-min intervals over 5 months (Actiwatch, Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd., UK), serial melatonin measurements in saliva samples collected in 1-3 h intervals across 24-48 h (Salivettes, Sarstedt AG, Switzerland; direct double-antibody immunoassay, sensitivity of 0.2 pg/ml, Bühlmann Laboratories AG, Allschwil/Switzerland), an in-lab melatonin suppression test by bright light (Daylight, Uplift Technologies, Canada; 10,000 lux measured on eyelevel, 20 cm distance to the light source), and polysomnography (PSG; Vitaport-3 digital recorder and Vitaport sleep scoring software, TEMEC Instruments BV, Kerkrade, Netherlands).</s></p><p><s>We also analyzed the patient's circadian rhythm at the molecular level by measuring the circadian period (tau) of clock gene transcription in cultivated fibroblasts isolated from five skin biopsies.</s><s>In this technique, a mouse Bmal1 promoter, which drives the expression of a luciferase gene, is introduced into the fibroblasts by lentiviral transfection.</s><s>After synchronization with dexamethasone, tau is calculated from the circadian bioluminescence of the cell cultures.</s><s>The in vitro analysis was conducted in every detail as described in the work of Pagani and colleagues, to which we refer for further information <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>While the results from the PSG were within the normal range (five NREM-REM cycles with slightly increased fragmentation due to short wake periods, sleep efficiency = 82% at 9 h time in bed, and normal proportions of sleep stages), the actigraphy recording showed a free-running sleep-wake rhythm with a phase length (tau) of 25.27 h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The melatonin profiles showed a similar free-running rhythm, synchronous to the observed sleep-wake cycle, however, with a prolonged mean phase angle of 3.38 ± 2.27 h between melatonin onset and sleep onset.</s><s>The melatonin suppression test by bright light (10,000 lux, see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) showed a normal response of the physiological LD-mediated melatonin release from the pineal gland.</s><s>The analysis of tau in fibroblasts confirmed our in vivo measurement and showed an even longer tau in vitro (=25.6 h) than in vivo.</s></p><p><s>Based on the collected data, we confirmed the diagnosis of N24HSWD and decided for a therapeutic approach based on melatonin administration (0.5-0.75 mg) in the evening, combined with bright light therapy (10,000 lux for 30 min) in the morning.</s></p><p><s>The combination of melatonin, morning light therapy, and regular wake-up times (set with an alarm clock) during the first week of treatment led to an apparent stabilization of sleep offset in the morning.</s><s>However, sleep onset still followed the original free-running rhythm with consecutive delays every day (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The profile of melatonin secretion was also unaffected by the treatment and remained non-entrained.</s><s>Unfortunately, the patient had to stop taking melatonin after only 4 days because it triggered severe headaches.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the applied therapeutic intervention was unable to resynchronize the free-running rhythm of the patient.</s><s>Nevertheless, he decided to continue with morning light therapy after getting up, because he experienced improved attentiveness and concentration during wakefulness.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DIsCUssIoN</head><p><s>Over the course of the past decades, several case reports about sighted patients suffering from N24HSWD have been published, but

onset and the cancer treatment could lead the argument in two possible directions: first of all, since the patients' endogenous cycle length prior to the treatment is unknown, it is possible that he always had a rather long tau and the loss of a structured daily life just uncovered the free-running rhythm.</s><s>One could even argue that the chronic misalignment of his internal tau with the external LD cycle in the sense of a "social jet lag" predisposed him to the development of the lymphoma in the first place -epidemiological studies point to a close relationship between alterations of

<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>.</s><s>The more potent action of CRY1 in slowing the clock is also attenuated by CRY2, demonstrating separate roles of the two proteins within the core clock mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The amplitude of circadian oscillation as another discrete clock property is associated with the vulnerability of the system to resetting stimuli in a directly proportional manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</s><s>A mutation of CLOCK in mice has been shown to dampen the amplitude of the circadian oscillation, causing phenotypes to exhibit a greater susceptibility to light as a zeitgeber than wild type <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, neuropeptides regulating the internal synchronization of the SCN neurons and alterations of upstream <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51)</ref> and downstream mechanisms (52) seem to be involved.</s><s>In humans, the amplitude of the oscillation shows considerable interindividual differences as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, our patients' reluctance to various and even combined attempts to shift the circadian phase could be an expression of a comparably strong circadian oscillation, independent of the extreme cycle length and thus explaining the observed treatment failure.</s><s>Are there other options left to achieve entrainment?</s><s>First of all, headaches caused by melatonin administration are a common side effect, which habituate during the course of the treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it could be a justified to wait for the headaches to subside, especially since some case studies report a delayed treatment response to melatonin <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, the use of more MT2-selective melatonin receptor agonists (20) could prove superior in the phase-shifting abilities compared to melatonin, with a theoretically reduced propensity to cause side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56)</ref>.</s><s>Second, light therapy was conducted for only 30 min in the morning -a longer, more intense therapy could have had the desired effect, particularly when one assumes that our patient expressed a comparatively strong circadian rhythm.</s><s>Finally, based on recent research which points to a greater plasticity of the cycle length than previously thought (57), the third possibility would be to gradually change the period length in a laboratory setting and slowly entrain it to a ~24-h LD cycle.</s></p><p><s>The exact cause of the N24HSWD in the presented case remains hard to pinpoint and subjects to speculation.</s><s>However, considering the physiology of the circadian cycle, the complexity of steps, and the influencing factors involved, a single cause seems questionable.</s><s>The conclusion for treatment options in this case and in general must therefore be to apply a multimodal therapy concept with a combination of the above-mentioned strategies adapted to the most likely causing factor.</s><s>Nevertheless, randomized controlled trials studying the optimal combination of the established strategies and incorporation of new therapeutic approaches would be vital to finally establish a treatment consensus for N24HSWD in sighted patients.</s></p></div>
