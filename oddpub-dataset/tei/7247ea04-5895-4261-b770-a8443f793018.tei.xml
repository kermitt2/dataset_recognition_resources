<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p><s>MOOD-HF was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted at 16 tertiary medical centers in Germany.</s><s>Study design information has been reported, <ref type="bibr">16</ref> and the full study protocol appears in Supplement 2. The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee at each study site.</s><s>All participants provided written informed consent prior to inclusion in the study.</s><s>Patients were not compensated for study participation except for travel expenses.</s><s>The trial was conducted according to the guideline for good clinical practice <ref type="bibr">17</ref> and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 2002. <ref type="bibr">18</ref></s><s>The principal investigators oversaw the conduct of the trial and data analysis.</s><s>The trial was reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring committee.</s><s>The eMethods in Supplement 1 provides more details.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population</head><p><s>Adult attendees at heart failure outpatient clinics with an established diagnosis of heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 45% documented within the last 3 months were screened for depression using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). <ref type="bibr">19</ref></s><s>Those with a score of 12 points or higher (or ≥9 points by protocol amendment on June 30, 2011; Supplement 2) underwent a Structured Clinical Interview 20 based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (German version of the Fourth Edition; DSM-IV) (SCID) with a psychiatrist or psychosomatic specialist, which was scheduled at least 2 weeks later to exclude transient mood swings (eMethods in Supplement 1).</s><s>Patients diagnosed with current major depression according to DSM-IV criteria 21 during the SCID were then invited to participate in MOOD-HF and asked to provide signed informed consent.</s><s>Other inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported previously <ref type="bibr">16</ref> (and appear in the eMethods).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Treatments and Follow-up</head><p><s>The study design is shown schematically in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either escitalopram (10-20 mg once daily) or matching placebo for up to 24 months in addition to optimal heart failure care.</s><s>Randomization strata were age, sex, depression severity, and time since the last hospitalization (eMethods).</s><s>The starting dose was 5 mg once daily, increasing to 10 mg/d and 20 mg/d after 3 and 6 weeks; slower uptitration was permitted for tolerability reasons.</s><s>The dose at 12 weeks was considered the maintenance dose.</s><s>From December 5, 2011, the maximum dose was limited to 10 mg/d in patients aged 65 years or older based on the pharmaceutical manufacturer's recommendation.</s></p><p><s>Tolerance-guided uptitration of heart failure pharmacotherapy <ref type="bibr">22</ref> and patient counseling and empowerment (with modules addressing heart failure signs and symptoms, lifestyle modifications, drug adherence, self-care, and selfsupervision skills) occurred in parallel during telephone contacts and personal visits using previously reported effective care strategies. <ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">24</ref></s><s>Maintenance therapy and the clinical status of patients were evaluated every 6 months.</s></p><p><s>After the final visit, patients were tapered off study medication and underwent a psychiatric closeout examination to clarify the need for continued antidepressant pharmacotherapy.</s><s>The first patient was randomized on March 11, 2009, and the last on February 24, 2014.</s><s>Final patient follow-up took place on September 2, 2014.</s></p><p><s>Psychometric and medical safety assessments were performed at each follow-up visit (eMethods in Supplement 1).</s><s>Cardiologists used the 10-item Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 25 to assess depression.</s><s>Each item of the 10-item MADRS yields a score of 0 to 6 resulting in an overall score from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating more severe depression.</s><s>Commonly used cutoff ranges are 0 to 6, normal; 7 to 19, mild depression; 20 to 34, moderate depression; and greater than 34, severe depression. <ref type="bibr">26</ref></s><s>Additional safety measures included weekly telephone monitoring of depressive symptoms and cardiac status during uptitration, and then bimonthly monitoring.</s><s>Specialized nurses applied the 2-item PHQ 27 during telephone calls, and immediately involved a psychiatrist or psychosomatic specialist if he/she suspected significant worsening of depression or suicidal ideations.</s><s>Prescription of open-label antidepressant therapy was permitted only after consultation with the psychiatric core laboratory.</s><s>After database closure, serum escitalopram levels were measured 28 from serial serum samples stored at -80°C (eMethods).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study End Points</head><p><s>The primary efficacy outcome was time to a first event of the composite of all-cause death or hospitalization (excluding planned hospitalization for noncardiac causes).</s><s>Prespecified psychometric secondary outcomes included the MADRS sum score 25 at 12 weeks, anxiety as assessed with the 7-item PHQ for generalized anxiety disorder, 29 and health-related quality of life (assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]). <ref type="bibr">30</ref></s><s>Other prespecified secondary outcomes were time-to-event variables as the individual components of the primary outcome, time to cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, escitalopram serum levels, heart failure pharmacotherapy, and parameters describing heart failure severity, cardiac status, and safety.</s><s>In addition, various subgroup analyses of the primary outcome were performed.</s></p><p><s>Adjudication of time-to-event outcomes was performed by an independent end point adjudication committee using prespecified criteria.</s><s>Committee members were blinded to initial treatment assignment and had no information on whether patients were taking study medication, taking an open-label antidepressant therapy, or not taking antidepressant drugs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size</head><p><s>We estimated an annual rate for the primary outcome of 36% with placebo, and hypothesized a 25% relative reduction in primary outcome events with escitalopram, corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) of ln(0.73)/ln(0.64)</s><s>= 0.705 (eMethods in Supplement 1).</s><s>Accordingly, 257 adjudicated end points were required to achieve 80% power with a type I error of .05.</s><s>Total event rates after recruitment of 240 patients indicated a considerably higher than anticipated hospitalization rate (60%).</s><s>Therefore, we recalculated that data for 414 patients (instead of the planned 700 18 ) would be sufficient to achieve 80% power while also maintaining the HR (protocol amendment of August 6, 2012; eMethods).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Early Termination</head><p><s>On February 28, 2014, the steering committee stopped enrollment based on futility after a recommendation from the data and safety monitoring committee.</s><s>The decision was made during the regular data review process and not based on a prespecified futility rule.</s><s>After that date, the next scheduled appointment constituted the final study visit for patients who had participated in MOOD-HF for at least 6 months.</s><s>Patients with shorter study participation continued until completing 6 months.</s><s>Follow-up was completed on September 2, 2014.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>The full statistical analysis plan appears in Supplement 3. Analyses were performed on a modified intention-to-treat basis, which included all patients who took at least 1 dose of study medication.</s><s>Baseline characteristics were summarized as mean and standard deviation (median and interquartile ranges if appropriate) for continuous variables and as counts (percentages) for categorical variables.</s></p><p><s>Time-to-event end points were analyzed by Cox regression.</s><s>Results are presented as HRs with 95% CIs.</s><s>Analyses were performed for each end point, both unadjusted and after adjusting for stratification at randomization.</s><s>The prespecified primary hypothesis test was the adjusted modified intention-to-treat analysis of all-cause death and hospitalization.</s><s>Kaplan-Meier time-to-event curves were generated.</s><s>Changes in MADRS sum scores from baseline to 12 weeks were assessed by analysis of covariance.</s><s>Generalized estimating equations were used for repeated measurement analyses of all consecutive MADRS assessments.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of covariance and ordinal or binary logistic regression models were used to analyze other quantitative ordinal and binary outcomes as appropriate.</s><s>In each of these models, the follow-up measurement was the dependent variable, and treatment group and the respective baseline variable were predictors.</s><s>For each of the tests, the binary subgroup variable and subgroup × treatment interaction term was added to the Cox model used in the primary analysis.</s><s>Subgroup HRs and 95% CIs are reported from these models in which the respective subgroup category was defined as the reference category.</s><s>P values for the interaction terms were reported (null hypothesis was equal HRs in the subgroups).</s><s>Analyses of serious adverse event frequencies were adjusted for time alive and under observation.</s><s>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23 (IBM Corp).</s><s>Significance tests were 2-sided.</s><s>P values &lt;.05 were defined as statistically significant.</s></p></div>

modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed, which excluded 4 patients who were randomized but did not take at least 1 dose of study medication.</s><s>These results are similar to those of the Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> both of which enrolled patients with coronary disease and depression and found no beneficial effects with 6 months of antidepressant treatment.</s><s>Although the efficacy of escitalopram for treating primary depression is considered superior to that of sertraline, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and although the treatment duration in the current trial was extended to 24 months compared with only 12 weeks in the SADHART-CHF trial, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> treatment with escitalopram had no beneficial effect in our patients who were diagnosed as having a major depressive disorder according to the DSM-IV but had baseline MADRS scores indicative of only mild to moderate depression. <ref type="bibr">26</ref></s><s>o our knowledge, this study was the first to investigate the composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalization in a population with heart failure treated with escitalopram.</s><s>Although the trial was terminated early, mean treatment duration was more than 18 months in each group, and the results are based on a sizable number of adjudicated outcome events.</s><s>Furthermore, the lack of overlap between the HR for the primary end point in the trial and the HR used in the sample size calculation suggests that if escitalopram did have any therapeutic efficacy, this effect was significantly smaller than the effect postulated in the trial hypothesis.</s></p><p><s>The concordant changes in MADRS and PHQ-9 sum scores observed in both groups in this study are in line with SADHART-CHF, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> but are

target="#b15">[14]</ref> in whom SSRI therapy was (compared with placebo) associated with significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms.</s><s>Given that escitalopram levels were always in the therapeutic range 28 in our study, the results are likely to indicate an absence of therapeutic efficacy.</s><s>In addition, the exploratory analysis suggested that remission or improvement of depressive symptoms was not associated with better clinical outcomes.</s><s>Therefore, the incidence rates of the composite primary outcome appeared to be independent of the response to escitalopram or placebo.</s><s>Contrary to expectations, other exploratory analysis findings showed that the frequency of the primary composite outcome might even increase with escitalopram treatment in patients with heart failure in whom higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression.</s></p><p><s>These observations support the concept of alternative pathophysiological mechanisms for mood disorders in somatic illnesses, with depressive symptoms less responsive or, as in both SADHART-CHF <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> and our study, unresponsive to sertraline or escitalopram.</s><s>Placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants tended to exclude patients with severe somatic illnesses.</s><s>These observations suggest that the efficacy results of these studies may not necessarily be transferable to all individuals in whom antidepressants are prescribed in clinical practice.</s></p><p><s>4]<ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> In this study, mortality rates were low in both groups, particularly compared with those reported from SADHART-CHF, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> and within the range reported from the Heart Failure-A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) study or the Patient-Centered Disease Management for Heart Failure trial, which both enrolled unselected patients with or without depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">37</ref></s><s>n contrast, hospitalization rates in this study were high, possibly as a result of recruiting patients from heart failure outpatient clinics at tertiary care centers, the majority of whom had experienced at least 1 hospitalization for heart failure during the year before randomization and were thus at high risk of recurrent adverse outcomes. <ref type="bibr">22</ref></s><s>We found in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">38</ref> evaluating enhanced heart failure care (similar to that offered to all participants in MOOD-HF) that even though mortality decreased significantly more in patients who were depressed compared with those who were not depressed, hospitalization rates remained comparably high.</s><s>Possible mechanisms by which mortality could have been reduced include (1) tolerance-guided uptitration of heart failure medication, (2) practical training in self-care, and (3) regular monitoring of treatment adherence by nurses specialized in the care of patients with heart failure.</s><s>Interestingly, the psychosocial support provided in the SADHART-CHF study did not appear to be associated with comparable clinical effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref></s><s>ore recently, Freedland et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">39</ref> demonstrated that integrative cognitive behavior therapy effectively improved depression in a younger population with heart failure, but not self-care and physical functioning.</s><s>This finding is remarkable in view of the present and previous <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref>  SSRI therapy and the Patient-Centered Disease Management for Heart Failure study, in which multidisciplinary patientcentered disease management did not improve patient health status; however, mortality was lower and mood improved more in participants who were depressed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">36</ref></s><s>Telephone-based collaborative care strategies have been shown to enhance healthrelated quality of life, physical functioning, and mood symptoms in patients with cardiovascular disease and heart failure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">40</ref></s><s>iven that sample size and observation time were limited in most of these trials, clinical outcomes could not be studied and the type and intensity of the interventions varied.</s><s>More research is needed to identify efficacious combinations of care modules for patients with depression and heart failure.</s><s>Currently available evidence suggests that a good approach could be to combine classic collaborative disease management strategies to optimize heart failure pharmacotherapy, selfsupervision, and drug adherence with physical training, which reduced mortality and depression in the HF-ACTION trial, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">37</ref> and with cognitive behavior therapy, which favorably affects patients with depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">39</ref></s><s>dverse effects at the initiation of SSRI therapy 11 led to higher early withdrawal rates in patients in the escitalopram group in our study; however, overall tolerability was comparable between groups.</s><s>There were no between-group differences in additional safety parameters.</s><s>However, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a greater risk of primary outcome events in patients in the escitalopram group who were older or had more severe heart failure, depressive symptoms, or cognitive impairment.</s><s>In an exploratory analysis, increasingly higher event rates were observed with increasing baseline MADRS scores in patients treated with escitalopram.</s><s>Furthermore, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels decreased more slowly while patients were taking escitalopram, left ventricular cavity size did not decrease as it did in patients in the placebo group, and there was a trend toward lower health-related quality of life as assessed by the KCCQ.</s><s>Interpretation of these secondary and exploratory findings requires great caution, but the possibility of unfavorable effects with longer-term escitalopram therapy on cardiac status and health-related quality of life cannot be ruled out.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>An important limitation of this study is its lack of generalizability.</s><s>Numerous patients were not randomized because of contraindications, ethnicity was predominantly white, and all study centers were located in Germany.</s><s>Furthermore, patients seen at heart failure outpatient clinics of tertiary care centers typically belong to a higher risk category, but at the same time receive the best possible heart failure care. <ref type="bibr">22</ref></s><s>In addition, many patients could not be randomized because of contraindications, and only patients with heart failure and reduced LVEF were eligible.</s><s>Therefore, these results cannot be extended beyond the patient population studied.</s></p><p><s>The results also do not provide information on the use of escitalopram in important subgroups that have been identified as being particularly resistant to antidepressant pharmacotherapy, such as women, black adults, and older persons (aged ≥65 years).</s><s>Excellent adherence in patients in the escitalopram group suggests that they may also have been particularly motivated to follow other treatment recommendations.</s><s>Furthermore, our study did not assess escitalopram alone.</s><s>Participants likely benefited from the enhanced heart failure care provided in both treatment groups.</s></p><p><s>There were also extensive safety measures incorporated into the trial design, such as psychometric and medical assessments at each visit, telephone monitoring, and psychiatric or psychosomatic expertise (readily available on request).</s><s>All of these, plus the allowance for open-label antidepressant therapy and unscheduled psychiatric consultations in the study protocol, could have blunted between-group differences in outcomes by diminishing treatment effects.</s><s>However, the consultation rates and the proportion of patients taking openlabel antidepressants were low and similar in patients in the escitalopram and placebo groups.</s><s>In addition, it seems possible that both groups in this study showed regression to the mean (ie, their depressive symptoms improved without any treatment).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>In patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and depression, 18 months of treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo did not significantly reduce allcause mortality or hospitalization, and there was no significant improvement in depression.</s><s>These findings do not support the use of escitalopram in patients with chronic systolic heart failure and depression.</s></p></div>
