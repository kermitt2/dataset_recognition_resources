<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inhibition of TACR1 signaling inhibits cell growth and leads to increased cell death</head><p><s>To inquire whether TACR1 signaling leads to increased proliferative capacity in neuroblastoma cells, we treated IMR5 cells, which express high levels of TACR1 as well as high levels of p-SRC, with the TACR1 ligand, substance P. Treatment with substance P increased the relative number of viable IMR5 cells over time in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), suggesting that TACR1 activity might be required for IMR5 cell survival.</s><s>To assess the effect of TACR1 inhibition on neuroblastoma cell viability, we treated cells in vitro with the water soluble aprepitant analog, fosaprepitant, and assessed cell viability relative to untreated control cultures in MTT assays.</s><s>All neuroblastoma cell lines tested exhibited a concentration-dependent reduction in cell viability in response to TACR1 inhibition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref> and 2C), although sensitivity varied strongly among cell lines.</s><s>While untransformed fibroblasts tolerated high concentrations of fosaprepitant (IC50 = 44 μM), only 0.85 μM fosaprepitant was needed to induce 50% growth inhibition (IC50) in SK-N-AS cells, indicating a specific effect on malignant cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B and 2C</ref>).</s><s>In addition to assessing cell viability, we investigated proliferative capacity directly by measuring BrdU incorporation in 3 cell lines after fosaprepitant treatment in comparison to untreated control cultures.</s><s>Cells lines were selected that expressed different levels of TACR1 and p-SRC and that spanned the fosaprepitant sensitivity range identified by assessing cell viability, namely SK-N-AS (highly sensitive), IMR5 (intermediately sensitive) and SY5Y (relatively insensitive).</s><s>BrdU incorporation was significantly suppressed after fosaprepitant treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the most pronounced reduction in BrdU incorporation occurred in IMR5 cells, which express the highest TACR1 and p-SRC levels of the 3 cell lines whereas SY5Y cells expressing low levels of TACR1 and p-SRC showed relative resistance to fosaprepitant treatment.</s><s>We next assessed whether fosaprepitant treatment also induced cell death by measuring the relative amount of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments in cells treated with fosaprepitant compared to untreated control cells.</s><s>Fosaprepitant treatment significantly increased the relative amount of histone-associated DNA in all 3 neuroblastoma cell lines tested, indicating that fosaprepitant induces cell death (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</s><s>Again, IMR5 cells showed the most pronounced increase in cell death, suggesting that fosaprepitant effects on neuroblastoma cells might be dependent on TACR1 signaling activity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inhibition of TACR1 signaling leads to increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest depending on the cellular context</head><p><s>Considering the differential anti-tumoral effects of fosaprepitant on different neuroblastoma cell lines, we set out to assess the cellular mechanisms responsible for the antitumoral activity of fosaprepitant.</s><s>To assess whether cells were dying by apoptosis, we flow cytometrically assessed cell surface expression of annexin V in all three cell lines after treatment with fosaprepitant.</s><s>Fosaprepitant treatment significantly increased both the fraction of apoptotic and pre-apoptotic in IMR5 and SK-N-AS cells but not in SY5Y cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>To assess whether the differential response of IMR5 and SY5Y cells was due to kinetic differences in cell proliferation, we monitored real-time cell growth using xCelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>We observed that fosaprepitant led to a decrease in IMR5 cell numbers within 48 h after treatment, consistent with induction of cell death, whereas SY5Y cells grew exponentially with only modestly decreased growth rates at high fosaprepitant doses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>To examine the underlying cellular processes occurring in cells treated with fosaprepitant, we assessed the cell cycle distribution of cells treated with fosaprepitant.</s><s>Consistent with our observation of increased cell death and apoptosis in IMR5 and SK-N-AS cells, the fraction of IMR5 and SK-N-AS cells in sub-G1 increased after treatment with fosaprepitant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>In SY5Y cells on the other hand, we observed an increase in the fraction of cells in G2M phase, consistent with reduced induction of apoptosis/cell death (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>As observed before, only minimal changes in the cell cycle distribution of non-transformed fibroblasts were observed after fosaprepitant treatment.</s><s>To test whether the effect of fosaprepitant on IMR5 cells were specifically due to TACR1 inhibition, competition experiments with the TACR1 agonist, substance P were carried out.</s><s>IMR5 cells were incubated with 100 nM or 500 nM substance P 1h before fosaprepitant treatment to saturate cell surface receptors.</s><s>When incubated with substance P we observed a &gt; 1.8 fold increase in the relative number of viable cells after fosaprepitant treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s><s>However, even 500 nM substance P was not able to reverse the effects of fosaprepitant in IMR5 cell lines to the full extent.</s><s>This is consistent with the previously described higher binding efficiency of fosaprepitant to TACR1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>The partial reversibility of fosaprepitant-induced growth inhibition by nanomolar substance P concentrations as well as the differential activity of fosaprepitant on IMR5 and SY5Y cells suggests selective targeting of TACR1 by fosaprepitant.</s><s>The antiproliferative effects of fosaprepitant are largely selective for transformed cells, suggesting that off-target effects or general cytotoxicity in treated patients should be low.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TACR1 inhibition disrupts oncogenic gene expression signatures and induces gene sets associated with apoptosis</head><p><s>To gain further insight into the molecular basis for antitumor effects observed in vitro from fosaprepitant treatment, we analyzed gene expression in IMR5 cells following treatment with increasing concentrations of fosaprepitant or control.</s><s>A clear dose-repose was apparent in expression profiles indicating a specific molecular mechanism underlying these expression changes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>Known oncogenes such as MYB and AURB were among the top downregulated genes following treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>To reveal potential novel downstream targets of TACR1 in neuroblastoma cells and understand the mechanisms through which TACR1 inhibition leads to apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, we interrogated our gene expression data with published, validated gene signatures to assess statistically significant enrichment by GSEA.</s><s>Consistent with the phenotypic changes observed in neuroblastoma cells treated with fosaprepitant (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 and 3</ref>), the top 20 upregulated gene sets in IMR5 cells treated with fosaprepitant represented either pathways involved in apoptosis or cell  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>To identify common downstream effectors of TACR1 signaling, we searched for known regulons in the genes repressed after fosaprepitant treatment, and detected a significant enrichment of motifs bound by the E2F2 transcription factor (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>This suggests E2F2 as a downstream target of TACR1.</s><s>Consistent with this hypothesis, E2F2 itself was repressed in a dose-dependent manner after fosaprepitant treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>).</s><s>Genes upregulated by fosaprepitant were also searched for regulons, and were enriched for TP53-binding motifs (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>TP53 expression was only slightly increased by fosaprepitant in IMR5 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4D</ref>, not significant), suggesting changes in TP53 activity rather than TP53 levels.</s><s>Our analyses therefore suggests that TACR1 inhibition in neuroblastoma cells represses E2F2 and induces the pro-apoptotic TP53 pathway, indicating that E2F2 and TP53 may be downstream targets of TACR1 signaling.</s><s>To test whether transcriptional changes translated into significant protein expression changes, we assessed AURB expression in cells treated with fosaprepitant or control.</s><s>Consistent with the significant reduction in AURB mRNA expression, we observed a significant reduction of AURB protein in IMR5 and SK-N-AS cells following fosaprepitant treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>).</s><s>Previously published data suggested that SRC signaling is critical for the pro-tumoral activity of TACR1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>We therefore tested the effect of TACR1 inhibition on SRC phosphorylation and expression in IMR5, SY5Y and SK-N-AS cells.</s><s>P-SRC expression decreased significantly after 48 hours of fosaprepitant treatment in IMR5 and SK-N-AS cells whereas p-SRC did not decrease significantly in SY5Y cells, that in IMR5 and SK-N-AS cells TACR1 signals at least in part through SRC activation/phosphorylation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C-4F</ref>).</s><s>Collectively, our results suggest that the antitumor effects induced by fosaprepitant in neuroblastoma cells may be due, at least in part, to decreased SRC phosphorylation leading to downstream E2F2 repression and that apoptosis might be induced via activation of pro-apoptotic TP53 signaling.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fosaprepitant treatment lowers tumor burden in a human neuroblastoma xenograft mouse model</head><p><s>Having observed a robust, selective and specific antitumor effect in vitro, we analyzed the effect of TACR1 antagonist fosaprepitant in an in vivo model to test whether fosaprepitant could be useful in a clinically relevant context.</s><s>Xenograft tumors were established subcutaneously from IMR5 cells in nude mice.</s><s>Mice were randomly separated into control and treatment groups (n = 7) and subsequently intraperitoneally injected with 60 mg fosaprepitant/kg body weight/day or with dimeglumine as vehicle control.</s><s>Consistent with previous reports, fosaprepitant was well tolerated by the mice and produced no significant side effects during the 14 days of treatment.</s><s>Treatment with fosaprepitant significantly delayed xenograft tumor growth (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A and 5B</ref>) In contrast to our in vitro observations, fosaprepitant was not able to stop tumor growth, suggesting reduced in vivo pharmacologic activity of fosaprepitant.</s><s>To test whether fosaprepitant was able to induce apoptosis in IMR5 xenografts, we assessed cleaved caspase-3 expression in three tumors treated with fosaprepitant or vehicle control.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with the decreased anti-tumoral effects in vivo compared to in vitro, cleaved caspase-3 expression was only slightly increased in tumor treated with fosaprepitant compared to vehicle treated controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C and 5D</ref>).</s><s>Our results support that inhibiting TACR1 with the antagonist, fosaprepitant, provides a therapeutic effect in a mouse model of neuroblastoma, and present fosaprepitant as a possible clinical avenue for patients with neuroblastomas with high-level TACR1 expression.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pretreatment with fosaprepitant synergizes with cytotoxic chemotherapy in neuroblastoma cells</head><p><s>Considering the non-curative in vivo antitumoral activity of fosaprepitant observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>), we decided to test whether combination treatment of fosaprepitant with cytotoxic agents could lead to greater anti-tumoral effects in neuroblastoma cells.</s><s>To test this, we treated IMR5 cells with Doxorubicin and Etoposide, two established chemotherapeutic agents in use for patients with neuroblastoma.</s><s>We tested co-treatment of IMR5 cells with a chemotherapeutic agent and fosaprepitant for 48 hours as well as pre-or posttreatment of fosaprepitant for 24 hours after/before 24 hours of treatment with a cytotoxic agent.</s><s>Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with fosaprepitant before both Etoposide and Doxorubicin treatment showed synergistic anti-tumoral effects as evidenced by combinatorial indices (CI) below 1, indicating that fosaprepitant treatment leads to a relative sensitization of neuroblastoma cells to cytotoxic agents  <ref type="table">of</ref> transcription factors that bind to the motifs enriched among the genes up-and down-regulated upon administration of a low dose of the TACR1 antagonist to the IMR-5 cells (NES, normalized enrichment score, # targets, the number of merged targets found by numerous motifs, # motifs).</s><s>www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget</s><s>(Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A and 6B</ref>).</s><s>Co-treatment as well as postchemotherapy treatment of cells with fosaprepitant, however, did not increase the antitumoral activity of these agents.</s><s>These results indicate that scheduling of combination treatment with fosaprepitant and cytotoxic agents has significant effects on their antitumoral activity, which may be of clinical importance for patients receiving these agents.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Here we show that human neuroblastoma cell lines express TACR1 and that blocking TACR1 activity using fosaprepitant robustly

levels of TACR1 and its downstream target p-SRC, i.e. exhibiting high TACR1 activity.</s><s>Consistent with this, we also observed a more pronounced induction of cell death/apoptosis in cells expressing high levels of TACR1 and p-SRC, whereas cells expressing low levels of TACR1 and p-SRC underwent cell cycle arrest rather than cell death.</s><s>TACR1 agonist substance P partially restored neuroblastoma cell viability, consistent with on target activity of fosaprepitant and in line with the previously reported stronger binding affinity of fosaprepitant to TACR1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Based on our data as well as previous reports, we conclude that the antitumoral activity of fosaprepitant is, indeed, due to selective TACR1 inhibition, and that TACR1 expression as well as SRC phosphorylation in primary neuroblastoma samples may be predictive for fosaprepitant sensitivity.</s><s>Together, our data extends previous knowledge about the mitogenic role of TACR1 in neuroblastoma and establishes TACR1 as a novel therapeutic target for neuroblastoma.</s></p><p><s>There are only a few reports about the molecular functions of TACR1 and substance P in

on these previously described targets downstream of TACR1 in neuroblastoma cells.</s><s>Similar to previous reports in other tumor entities, we detected decreased SRC phosphorylation following TACR1 inhibition, indicating that in neuroblastoma TACR1 might at least in part signal through SRC.</s><s>Consistent with decreased SRC signaling, expression of MYB, AURKB and PCNA was repressed in global gene profiles and genes involved in apoptosis (i.e.</s><s>FAS) were upregulated.</s><s>Global expression profiling also identified E2F2 and genes highly enriched for E2F2 binding sites to be repressed.</s><s>The dose dependency of fosaprepitant-induced gene expression changes suggests these are on-target effects.</s><s>Genes containing TP53 binding motifs were also dose-dependently increased following TACR1 inhibition indicating that TACR1 signaling might directly affect TP53 pathway activity.</s><s>Our global expression profiling also implicated TACR1 in control of cell cycle progression and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, with TACR1 inhibition driving the cell towards apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.</s><s>This is in line with our observation that cells treated with fosaprepitant undergo apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and is consistent with previous reports showing that TACR1 signaling plays important roles in controlling cell proliferation of various cell types, for review see Datar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>It is still not entirely clear how TACR1 signaling affects these pathways.</s><s>Previous reports and our current data, however, support the direct involvement of TACR1 signaling in regulating the E2F/TP53 signaling in neuroblastoma cells at least in part through activation of SRC.</s></p><p><s>TACR1 antagonists have been previously described to have in vivo antitumoral activity against glioma and breast cancer xenografts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, we observed that intraperitoneal application of fosaprepitant in mice harboring neuroblastoma xenografts reduced tumor burden.</s><s>Previous reports together with our current data suggest that fosaprepitant can exert significant therapeutic effects in vivo.</s><s>However, the antitumor effect observed in our model as well as in previous reports was not curative, suggesting that higher fosaprepitant doses may be necessary to more efficiently combat the tumor.</s><s>Alternatively, combining TACR1 antagonists with other therapeutic agents may also enhance antitumor efficacy.</s><s>Considerable synergism between fosaprepitant and cytotoxic agents currently used in patients with neuroblastomas has been reported for osteosarcoma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, we observed that fosaprepitant treatment synergized with doxorubicin and etoposide in neuroblastoma cells.</s><s>Interestingly only pretreatment of cells with fosaprepitant followed by treatment with cytotoxic agents showed considerable synergy, indicating that fosaprepitant might sensitize cells to cytotoxic agents.</s><s>This suggests that fosaprepitant might prime cells for apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents, which is consistent with our observation that TP53 signaling was increased by fosaprepitant treatment and that TP53 signaling is required for cytotoxic agent-induced cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Considering that TP53 as well as AURB were induced by fosaprepitant treatment in our experiments, agents activating or stabilizing TP53 as well as AURB kinase inhibitors may also act synergistically with TACR1 inhibitors in neuroblastoma.</s></p><p><s>Intravenous administration of 115 mg fosaprepitant in patients results in peak concentrations of 5 µM circulating in blood and doses of up to 1000 mg have been administered to adults without significant side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, fosaprepitant has been successfully used as an antiemetic in combination with cytotoxic agents such as carboplatin without significant side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Based on this, we believe that administering fosaprepitant to patients in parallel with chemotherapeutic agents currently used for first-line therapy of neuroblastoma should be well tolerated.</s><s>Considering we observed IC 50 concentrations ranging between 0.85 µM and 21.09 µM for neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro, fosaprepitant may have a therapeutic index in patients with neuroblastoma.</s><s>In summary, the anti-neuroblastoma activity observed in our mouse model and the previously reported good pharmacological properties in patients suggest that fosaprepitant has the potential to generate a measurable response in combination with current treatment regimens in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, and thus, should be considered for entry into clinical testing.</s></p></div>
