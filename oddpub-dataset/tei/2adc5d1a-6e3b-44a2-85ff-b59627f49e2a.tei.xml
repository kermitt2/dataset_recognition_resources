<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection and study variables</head><p><s>The modifiable risk factors were defined according to recommendations of the ESC 2012 guideline <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>As part of a general self-administered health questionnaire, daily smoking was assessed with several questions.</s><s>Physical activity within a usual week was also assessed within this questionnaire and defined as low when &lt; 2.5 h physical activity/ week <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and physical inactive when no physical activity was reported.</s><s>A semi-quantitative self-administered food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the frequency and portion size of 53 food items for a reference period of the past four weeks.</s><s>The number of servings of fruit (fresh and cooked) and vegetable (fresh and cooked vegetable, legumes) and servings of fish (cold fish and fish as a hot meal) per day were calculated by combining the frequency of consumption and the usual portion size.</s><s>Low fruit intake was defined as &lt; 2 portions fruit per day, low vegetable intake as &lt; 2 portions vegetable per day and low fish intake as &lt; 1 portion fish per week.</s><s>Quantity of alcohol intake was calculated by summing the alcohol content of consumed beer, non-alcoholic beer (still containing minute alcohol amounts), wine, spirits <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and cocktails (assuming one cocktail to contain 15.0 g of alcohol <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</s><s>High alcohol consumption was defined as &gt; 10 g alcohol per day in women and &gt; 20 g alcohol per day in men.</s><s>Since zero alcohol consumption has been related to increased cardiovascular risk and mortality, a separate category was defined as alcohol intake of 0 g/day <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Body weight was measured with an electronic scale and body height was measured using a portable stadiometer.</s><s>The body mass index (BMI) was calculated as BMI [kg/m 2 ] = body weight [kg]/body height 2 [m].</s><s>A BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 was defined as overweight and a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 was defined as obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Three sitting blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken after a five-minute rest on the right arm following a standardized protocol with an automated oscillometric device (Datascope Accutorr Plus) and the prevalence of BP above ≥ 140 mmHg systolic or above ≥ 90 mmHg diastolic was determined using the mean of the second and third BP measurements.</s><s>Total cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) were measured using an enzymatic assay (Architect ci8200, Abbott, Germany).</s><s>Elevated TC was defined as a value ≥ 5.0 mmol/l (190 mg/dl) and an additional cut-off of 6.2 mmol/l (240 mg/dl) was included based on previous guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Non-HDL was calculated by subtracting HDL from TC.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The results of this cross-sectional analysis of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in adults in Germany suggest that, for the vast majority of adults in Germany, there is a high prevention potential for all of the behavioural risk factors investigated in this study: daily smoking, insufficient fruit, vegetable and fish consumption, high alcohol intake, insufficient physical activity and overweight.</s><s>Almost 85 % of adults aged 40-79 years have at least one of these risk factors, with 45 % having a combination of two or more risk factors.</s></p><p><s>Studies on CVD risk factors in different countries are often difficult to compare due to differences in the specific combinations and definitions of the risk factors that were assessed.</s><s>In the United States adherence to five healthy behavioural factors (including fruit and vegetable consumption, regular exercise, healthy weight, alcohol consumption and smoking) in 40 to 74 year olds was as low as 8 % in 2006 and had decreased from 15 % in 1988 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>A recent analysis from Italy on six cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, low fruit/vegetable consumption, obesity/overweight, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes) found that 90 % of the study population had more than one and 84 % had between two and five risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For BP and TC, we report prevalences of elevated, i.e., uncontrolled values as measured in our study.</s><s>These prevalences do not include controlled hypertension or controlled hypercholesterolemia.</s><s>It is encouraging that the target BP (&lt;140 mmHg systolic and &lt; 90 mmHg diastolic) was reached by almost 80 % of the participants but this proportion may be lower among severely ill patient groups.</s><s>For comparison, in the SHARE survey the more stringent targets of &lt; 140/90 mmHg in general and &lt; 130/80 mmHg for patients with co-morbidities or high CV risk were reached by less than 60 % of general practice patients and by less than half of patients treated by cardiologists/ internists <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>The joint ESC 2012 guideline targets for hyperlipidaemia are mainly based on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels.</s><s>We used TC and non-HDL since fasting level LDL data were not available for a sufficient number of participants.</s><s>However, TC and non-HDL are established markers for increased cardiovascular risk and are independent of fasting time <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>.</s><s>The TC targets were more often reached by the CHD or stroke group than by the group without CHD or stroke, which is similar to previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and most likely reflects more intensive lipid-lowering therapy among people with prior CHD or stroke.</s><s>However, almost 90 % of the CHD or stroke group exceeded the stringent non-HDL target.</s><s>Except for physical inactivity, prevalence of behavioural risk factors was higher among men.</s><s>Other studies found similar results concerning physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>, BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and fruit and vegetable intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Possible reasons include gender-specific cultural norms relating to lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> and gender-specific responses to lifestyle.</s><s>Higher prevalences for most modifiable risk factors were found among the age group 60-79 years compared to the younger group.</s><s>This indicates the need for preventive interventions at early life stages, because the risk of CVD increases with the duration of risk factor exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The strengths of our study include the large nationwide sample of community-dwelling adults, the highly standardized measurements and the detailed questionnaires.</s><s>The most important limitation is that severely ill and institutionalized men and women were mainly not included in the study which may have led to an underestimation of the risk factor proportions and to the rather low stroke and CHD prevalence.</s><s>Equally important, the group without prior CHD or stroke includes individuals in all risk categories including high risk.</s><s>It is a heterogeneous group which is not in the main focus of the paper.</s><s>Therefore, the main finding is that uncontrolled risk factors are currently still highly prevalent both in the overall group (general population) and in the group with prior CHD or stroke, a clearly high-risk group likely to be aware of this high risk.</s><s>A further limitation is the self-reported diagnosis of hypertension and dyslipidaemia which may have led to an underestimation of the prevalence of these diseases.</s><s>However, information on prior diagnosis was used only to calculate awareness of elevated BP and elevated TC.</s></p><p><s>The risk factors in this analysis are all among the top risk factors contributing to the Global Burden of Disease both 1990 and 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>It is never too late for improvements in behavioural risk factors, as illustrated by a 35 % reduction of CVD events in 4 years in adults aged 45 years and older who switched to a healthy lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Clearly, to individuals and to treating physicians it may appear more intuitive to put effort into lifestyle changes and enrol in prevention interventions in high-risk situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> where the number-needed-totreat to prevent an event is low.</s><s>However, population benefits are larger if healthy lifestyles are adopted early on in order to prevent or delay hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity and chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>.</s><s>Action is required both at the health care system and societal level.</s><s>Individuals may need treatment, but more often they need knowledge, motivation and accessible, convenient and attractive opportunities for improved lifestyle.</s><s>For example, health education through mass media has been shown to be cost-effective to limit CVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>The key to population-wide risk factor changes is clearly a combination of personal and non-personal interventions.</s></p></div>
