<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In summary, in none of the five sets of electrophysiological experiments presented in this study we observed changes between WT and KO animals in glutamatergic transmission as a result of altered synaptic drive.</s><s>Our results appear to contradict previous in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , ex vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> and in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> experiments, which might be due to different methodological approaches.</s><s>However, we effectively controlled for the validity of our KO model and carefully exercised different protocols to confirm our findings.</s></p><p><s>The finding of no discernible phenotype might be due to two possibilities 53 : (i) the intrinsic feature of genetic robustness in actin binding proteins enables genetic buffering by alternative pathways or functional complementation of other genes, or (ii) the abnormal phenotype will only become evident under specific conditions, for example ageing, disease or stress.</s></p><p><s>The lack of phenotypic changes in glutamatergic synaptic hippocampal synapses of DBN KO mice is possibly caused by compensatory mechanisms as functional redundancy and overlapping functions have been reported for several actin binding proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s></p><p><s>It is worth speculating that under certain conditions, the loss of DBN cannot be compensated, unmasking a specific DBN KO phenotype.</s><s>In this regard, cellular stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> or aging might render the dendritic spine vulnerable to the loss of the actin binding protein DBN.</s><s>However, at this point, our results support the idea that DBN deficiency alone is not sufficient in causing synaptic dysfunction.</s></p></div>
