patient presented with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.</s><s>Leukemic blasts were CD20-positive.</s><s>Conventional karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of BM cells revealed the presence of an unbalanced der(19)t(1;19)(q23;p13) translocation and isochromosome i(9q).</s><s>The patient received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone induction and consolidation therapy, followed by an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant from a matched unrelated donor while in the first complete remission (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was negative for t(1;19) cells before transplant.</s><s>The first relapse occurred at 2 years and 4 months after the initial transplantation.</s><s>Cytogenetic analysis showed a t(1;19), i(9q) karyotype.</s><s>The patient received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone induction therapy that resulted in a complete morphological remission, but with minimal residual disease detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization.</s><s>The patient was consolidated with clofarabine, cytarabine and etoposide before a second allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.</s><s>After 18 months, the patient again relapsed, with karyotype analyses indicating further clonal evolution.</s><s>The patient achieved a complete remission after receiving a combination of fludarabine, cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG) therapy, but minimal residual disease was detected by immunophenotyping.</s><s>He then received a 14-week course of consolidation therapy with dasatinib (25-50 mg daily) and pegylated interferon α (30 μg/week).</s><s>Due to cytopenias, the treatment was not administered continuously.</s><s>The minimal residual disease level remained stable during the treatment until disease progression.</s><s>FLAG therapy was restarted with no response.</s><s>The patient died at 5 years and 5 months after the initial diagnosis.</s></p><p><s>Ex vivo drug-sensitivity testing reveals several active targeted agents for relapsed TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL To identify novel treatment options for relapsed TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL, we assessed the ex vivo sensitivity of BM mononuclear cells from the index patient against a panel of 302 small molecule inhibitors.</s><s>The cells were highly sensitive to many targeted agents compared with other samples analyzed under similar conditions.</s><s>Identified sensitivities included PI3K inhibitors, PI3K/mTOR dual kinase inhibitors, ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors, rapalogs, bromodomain (BET) inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors and corticosteroids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s><s>Compared with the first profiled relapse sample 668_1, the later sample 668_4 was less sensitive to most drugs, indicating that drug-resistant clones were selected as the disease progressed.</s><s>Interestingly, although sensitivity was reduced for most drugs, the sensitivity to BET inhibitor I-BET151 or the histone deacetylase inhibitors mocetinostat and entinostat did not change (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Ibrutinib and dasatinib have previously been suggested to be effective against TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALLs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>The cells from the first relapse sample (668_1) were sensitive to ibrutinib and had sensitivity comparable to cells from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>However, the later relapse sample (668_4) lost sensitivity to ibrutinib (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Compared with other patient samples tested, the cells from both relapse samples of the TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL patient exhibited average sensitivity to dasatinib (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>This was in contrast to cells from a blast-crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (BC-CML) patient, which were highly sensitive to dasatinib (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>TCF3-PBX1 ALLs are sensitive to the PI3K-delta inhibitor idelalisib Both relapse samples of the TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL index patient were highly sensitive to idelalisib (CAL-101, GS-1101).</s><s>The samples exhibited similar sensitivity as a CLL sample, which was used as a positive control for idelalisib sensitivity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Although cells from the later relapse sample were slightly less sensitive to idelalisib compared with the earlier sample, the cells remained highly sensitive compared with other hematological tumors and healthy controls.</s><s>Notably, the index patient cells were among the most sensitive to idelalisib compared with other hematological tumors (n = 112) and healthy bone marrow controls (n = 13; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine whether idelalisib sensitivity is common to all BCP-ALL or specific for TCF3-PBX1 positive BCP-ALL, we assessed the sensitivity of both TCF3-PBX1 positive and negative BCP-ALL cell lines.</s><s>We found that two of three TCF3-PBX1 positive cell lines tested, Kasumi-2 and RCH-ACV, were sensitive to idelalisib; whereas the three TCF3-PBX1 negative cell lines tested were insensitive.</s><s>The TCF3-PBX1 positive line 697, which lacked sensitivity to idelalisib, harbors an oncogenic NRAS p.G12D mutation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> potentially affecting idelalisib response.</s></p><p><s>We also tested sensitivity to BET, histone deacetylase and BCL2 inhibitors as well as to temsirolimus and ruxolitinib in the same cell lines.</s><s>However, we did not observe a consistent difference in sensitivity to these

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Using an unbiased, drug-sensitivity profiling assay, we found that leukemic blasts from a TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL index patient obtained at relapse were highly sensitive to the p110δ inhibitor idelalisib.</s><s>The cells from the index patient were the most sensitive to idelalisib out of a cohort of hematological tumors, although they were obtained from a heavily treated relapsed patient.</s><s>At the time  of the index patient's relapse idelalisib was not yet approved for clinical use.</s><s>By testing of BCP-ALL cell lines, we found that two of three TCF3-PBX1 positive cell lines were sensitive to idelalisib, whereas TCF3-PBX1 negative cell lines were insensitive.</s><s>The idelalisib insensitive TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL cell line 697 harbors an activating NRAS mutation, which may cause resistance to p110δ inhibition.</s><s>An earlier study showed pre-BCR-positive ALLs to exhibit sensitivity to idelalisib in vitro. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>Our results with patient samples and cell lines suggest that most TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALLs are highly sensitive to idelalisib, and provide additional data to support a mechanistic rationale for the use of idelalisib in this group of patients.</s></p><p><s>The target of idelalisib is p110δ encoded by the PIK3CD gene.</s><s>Previously, PIK3CD was identified as a regulatory target of TCF3-PBX1 along with pre-B-cell receptor genes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>In agreement with these results, we observed high levels of PIK3CD expression in cells from the TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL index patient.</s><s>We also found that the TCF3-PBX1 protein binds to two experimentally characterized PIK3CD promoter regions that have been shown to drive high PIK3CD expression in leukocytes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>The ability of TCF3-PBX1 to directly regulate expression of the idelalisib target p110δ provides important supportive evidence for the use of this drug in TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL patients.</s></p><p><s>The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib, which inhibits both BTK and SRC kinases in addition to other kinases, have been suggested to be effective against TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALLs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Dasatinib sensitivity of cells from the index patient was similar to what has been reported previously for TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref></s><s>Notably, cells from the index patient exhibited substantially lower sensitivity to dasatinib compared with the sensitivity of cells from a BC-CML patient.</s><s>The patient received low-dose dasatinib (25-50 mg daily) with interferon for 14 weeks, but this combination could not be administered continuously due to the development of cytopenias and eventually failed to prevent relapse.</s><s>As the affinity of dasatinib is lower for targets in the pre-BCR pathway than for BCR-ABL, the dose required for effective inhibition of pre-BCR signaling is likely to be higher than doses used in CML.</s><s>However, the high dasatinib doses required may be challenging to administer in the relapse setting due to toxicity.</s><s>The cells from the first relapse sample of the TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL patient were sensitive to ibrutinib, but had lost sensitivity in the final relapse indicating that pre-B-cell receptor positive BCP-ALLs can overcome BTK inhibition.</s></p><p><s>CXCR4 is the cell surface receptor for CXCL12, a chemokine that is produced by bone marrow stromal cells.</s><s>Adhesion of leukemia cells to stromal cells through CXCR4/CXCL12 causes adhesion-mediated drug resistance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref></s><s>Leukemia cells from the index patient obtained at relapse expressed very high levels of CXCR4 in contrast to diagnostic phase TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALLs, which did not show similar overexpression.</s><s>However, chromatinimmunoprecipitation-sequencing results revealed that TCF3-PBX1 binds to enhancer elements upstream of the CXCR4 gene, indicating that TCF3-PBX1 does participate in the regulation of CXCR4 expression in cells with this fusion.</s><s>Overexpression of CXCR4 was observed at relapse, thus, TCF3-PBX1 alone may not be sufficient to cause aberrant CXCR4 expression, and that in addition to TCF3-PBX1, other alterations may be required.</s><s>In breast cancer cells, p53 represses CXCR4 expression and TP53 mutations cause upregulation of CXCR4 expression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref></s><s>Therefore, the TP53 mutations acquired at relapse in the index patient cells could have contributed to the upregulation of CXCR4.</s><s>However, we were unable to obtain RNA from the diagnostic phase sample that lacked TP53 mutations to test whether CXCR4 expression was associated with the acquisition of these mutations, and additional studies are needed to investigate this hypothesis.</s><s>Nevertheless, our results suggest that upregulation of CXCR4 is a mechanism of therapy resistance in relapsed TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL.</s><s>Similar observations have been made in BCP-ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> as well as pediatric AML, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> and provide a rationale for targeting CXCR4 either by direct antagonists such as plerixafor <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> or by downstream inhibitors of CXCR4 signaling such as dasatinib. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s>n CLL, idelalisib inhibits chemokine receptor signaling in leukemia cells causing mobilization of leukemia cells into the bloodstream, which manifests clinically as transient lymphocytosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref></s><s>In vitro, idelalisib has been shown to reduce chemotaxis of CLL cells towards CXCL12. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref></s><s>Furthermore, PI3K inhibitors have been shown to inhibit CXCR4 signaling in CLL cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref></s><s>These observations suggest that in CLL, the efficacy of idelalisib is in part owing to inhibition of CXCR4 signaling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref></s><s>XCR4/CXCL12 interactions retain B-cell precursors in the bone marrow niche created by CXCL12 expressing stromal cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref></s><s>In analogy to what has been observed in CLL, idelalisib is likely to block CXCR4 signaling via p110δ in TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL causing disruption of stromal cell contacts and mobilization of leukemia cells into the blood.</s><s>Lymphocytosis resulting from mobilization of leukemia cells should be evaluated in future in vivo studies.</s><s>Mobilized leukemia cells are more sensitive to chemotherapy, and idelalisib may, therefore, be an effective drug for overcoming the therapy resistance caused by CXCR4.</s></p><p><s>Drug-sensitivity profiling also showed good efficacy of mTOR inhibitors towards cells from the index patient.</s><s>This is in contrast to previous in vitro drug-testing study on TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALLs that did not show mTOR inhibitor sensitivity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> suggesting our observations were specific for the index patient.</s><s>MTOR mutations have been shown to cause constitutive activation of mTOR kinase and to induce sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors in cell lines and in patient samples. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref></s><s>Our results suggest that the MTOR p. M1724_Q1725insV mutation present in the index patient cells may have contributed to the high sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, on the basis of our results, idelalisib shows promise as a treatment for TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL.</s><s>Idelalisib (Zydelig, Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA) has been approved as a second-line treatment for CLL, follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref></s><s>Similar to what has been observed in these diseases, the majority of human TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALLs depend on pre-B-cell receptor signaling.</s><s>Idelalisib is a highly specific inhibitor of the p110δ, which is the primary PI3K isoform in B cells, and is expressed mainly by hematopoietic cells.</s><s>As a result of this specificity, idelalisib has a relatively benign toxicity profile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> which makes it a promising option for treating patients with TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Clinical timeline of TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL index patient 668 with treatment, sampling and analysis history.</s><s>Allo-HSCT, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,321.39,577.36,228.02,125.52" type="bitmap" /></figure>
