<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Ovarian Cancer Patients' Understanding of Terminology.</head><p><s>The results of this study demonstrate that there are some terms that patients with ovarian cancer are familiar with; however there are others that are not well understood (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Within the study, participants were able to confidently describe the terms "quality of life," "side effects," and "treatment," while terms such as "remission," "progressionfree survival," "surveillance," and "maintenance therapy" were less understood.</s></p><p><s>The importance of clarity around the term remission is particularly important with ovarian cancer patients as approximately 70% of women will experience an eventual recurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Fear of recurrence during remission is also a significant concern among ovarian cancer patients and one that to date has not been sufficiently addressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Of particular concern to women is the anxiety associated with fear of recurrence.</s><s>One study reported that 61% of women have an increased level of anxiety when tested for CA-125 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> while a second study reported that 62.5% of women have a high to extreme level of anxiety at checkups <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>It follows then that easing fear of recurrence during remission may increase QoL, which is also consistent with the results of this study where women noted that excellent QoL during remission included not having to worry about cancer recurrence.</s></p><p><s>The majority of women within our study had not heard of the term "progression-free survival"; however when prompted to describe what they thought it meant, most women equated PFS to being in remission.</s><s>During remission, participants' expectations of QoL were good to excellent.</s><s>This suggests that while the term PFS is not well understood, it is valued in the context of remission and is associated with QoL.</s></p><p><s>PFS is becoming increasingly important as a clinical trial endpoint in ovarian cancer and there are significant discussions in relation to how this translates into decisions about access to affordable therapeutics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Given the focus that governments in particular place on patient engagement in the decision-making process, it is important to acknowledge that where discussions are driven by the term "progression-free survival," patients may not understand the term and therefore may not be able to engage in a meaningful way.</s><s>To address this, community engagement efforts in health policy should focus on questions that encourage the community members to articulate what they value and/or expect from treatments, rather than being driven by technical terminology.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Ovarian Cancer Patients' Expectations.</head><p><s>The participants in our study demonstrated a clear difference in expectations of quality of life during treatment compared to times of remission.</s><s>During times of treatment, there was a general expectation that QoL would be poor to good; however during times of remission, there was a general expectation that life would be good to excellent.</s><s>There was also a relationship between expectations during remission and disease progression, specifically that as disease progressed, the expectation of quality of life during remission decreased.</s><s>This is consistent with a large study that observed QoL of over 3000 patients across different stages of disease.</s><s>The study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ferrell et al. (2005)</ref> found a significant variance in QoL according to stage; QoL for those with early stage disease had better QoL compared to those with late stage disease where QoL was largely influenced by fear of recurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>There are however limitations in comparing QoL between early and late stage disease as the majority of women are diagnosed with late stage ovarian cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and quantifying the value that women place on QoL, particularly in times of remission, is challenging given that many QoL studies are conducted during times of treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A recent online study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Coleman et al. (2013)</ref> asked ovarian cancer patients to quantify the minimum benefit in PFS that a therapy would have for it to be valuable.</s><s>The majority of participants selected 5 or more months, and when asked to tradeoff overall survival with toxicity compared to PFS without toxicity, 44% of participants chose the latter while 37% found neither acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In our study we found that the minimum length of time that participants stated a treatment would be valuable with both mild or moderate to severe side effects was 6 months.</s><s>It is important to note the difference in terminology used in both studies; the Coleman study used the term "toxicity," whereas our study referred to "side effects."</s><s>This may in part account for the difference in results.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Decision-Making and Patient Preference.</head><p><s>It is acknowledged that the decision-making process regarding treatment is complex.</s><s>Stage of disease, type of diagnosis (primary or recurring), management of symptoms, and quality of life are all contributing factors that influence treatment decisions between patients and clinicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The results of our study are aligned with those of a previous study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ziebland et al. (2006)</ref> that investigated different approaches to decision-making with ovarian cancer patients.</s><s>The authors observed that the majority of women with primary ovarian cancer diagnoses were dependent on their doctors to recommend treatment options with the best possible outcome of a cure, as they knew little about the disease or treatments available <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>A second study demonstrated that women with recurring disease are more likely to be involved in decision-making process but still felt overwhelmed by the decision-making process itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>In general, the more information that is presented to women, particularly in relation to how to manage possible side effects and/or improve psychological autonomy, the more confident they are in their decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and involvement in decision-making is associated with better quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, as observed in our study and the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ziebland et al. (2006)</ref>, some women stated that they could not always recall being actively involved in decisions; several women felt that there were no real decisions to make or had their physicians decide on treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As noted previously, fear of recurrence or metastasis is a significant concern for ovarian cancer patients and is a significant consideration in relation to decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The need to present patients with available options has been documented in a number of studies, particularly in relation to decision-satisfaction and reducing anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>An important observation in our study was that during times of remission, there was little difference between preferences between maintenance therapy and surveillance; however participants that stated a preference for surveillance also noted that this is based on their current situation and/or that no alternative was available and/or no alternative was offered.</s></p><p><s>We were unable to identify any other studies that specifically asked women about preference for surveillance or maintenance therapy.</s><s>There are however studies that investigated QoL with participants undergoing treatment or surveillance.</s><s>An Australian study investigated the impact on QoL when chemotherapy is administered to women with platinumresistant, recurrent disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The authors reported that QoL neither increased or decreased; that is, the overall QoL of participants was maintained.</s><s>In a Canadian study, QoL was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and OV28) as well as an investigatordeveloped questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>A subfactor analysis of the 102 participants indicated that there were no significant variations in overall global quality of life and functional scales between those who were undergoing surveillance (46%) and those with active disease (54%).</s><s>The results of our study and previous studies therefore suggest that the decision to commence maintenance therapy or surveillance therapy has less impact on QoL than being informed and presented with the option to choose.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Limitations.</head><p><s>The study size of 40 participants is relatively small; however, given the intensity of the structured interviews, scientific merit can be met in small study populations, even those that do not reach traditional conditions for statistical power, and legitimate sample sizes can be made for cost and feasibility reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, as was the case in this study.</s></p><p><s>It is also important to note that with any study that relies on self-selection, there is always the potential for bias.</s><s>The main risk is that the participants who choose to be involved in a study may not represent the target population, which may be viewed as a limitation to this study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p><s>In the absence of patient insights such as those reported in this study, decision-makers are left to make assumptions about the value women place on access to therapeutics and the values that they would like to see included in the decisionmaking process.</s></p><p><s>This study demonstrated that ovarian cancer patients equate PFS with being in remission and that patients expect QoL during that time to be good to excellent.</s><s>Women in this study described excellent QoL as feeling positive and happy and not worrying about cancer, feeling fit and healthy without side effects, and being able to live life as they did before their diagnosis, including the absence of fear of progression or recurrence.</s><s>It is therefore suggested that there is a strong relationship between PFS and QoL.</s><s>While it is difficult to quantify QoL and further research is needed, the results of this study suggest that the minimum time that women with ovarian cancer value, in relation to PFS and therefore QoL, is approximately six months.</s></p><p><s>While there were few differences between treatment decision-making during times of treatment and times of remission, there was a distinct difference in the expectation and experience of QoL during the different time points.</s><s>This suggests that additional mechanisms and options are needed to reduce the gap between the current experience of women with ovarian cancer and what they expect from treatment options.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the terminologies used to describe things such as PFS, maintenance therapy, and surveillance, all of which are increasingly important in both clinical, research, and policy decision-making, are not well understood by patients.</s><s>It is important to acknowledge this and ensure that appropriate language and mechanism are used so that their experience can be valued in research and in the decision-making process.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1: Expectations of disease progression.Participants were asked what length of time they expected their disease to remain stable with treatment under different conditions (mild side effects or moderate to severe side effects).</s><s>Overall the most commonly stated expectation was that the cancer would be stable between six and 12 months.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
