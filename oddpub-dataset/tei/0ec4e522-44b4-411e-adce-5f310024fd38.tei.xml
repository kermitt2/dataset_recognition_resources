X-ray scattering analysis with large-area Raman imaging, backscattered electron microscopy, histopathology, and microcomputed tomography to characterize HA in mouse models of advanced breast cancer in

remnant metaphyseal trabecular bone.</s><s>Interestingly, in a model of localized breast cancer, metaphyseal HA nanocrystals were also smaller and less perfect than in corresponding bone in disease-free controls.</s><s>Collectively, these results suggest that skeletal sites prone to tumor cell dissemination contain less-mature HA (i.e., smaller, less-perfect, and less-oriented crystals) and that primary tumors can further increase HA immaturity even before secondary tumor formation, mimicking alterations present during tibial metastasis.</s><s>Engineered tumor models recapitulating

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>In Tibiae of Healthy Mice, HA Nanocrystals Are More Immature in Regions Prone to Metastasis.</s><s>In experimental mouse models of breast cancer bone metastasis, the tibia is a common site of secondary tumor formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>.</s><s>Within the tibia, disseminated cancer cells appear to preferentially localize to the metaphysis rather than the diaphysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>, a phenomenon that has been attributed to specific cellular properties of metaphyseal blood vessels and an enrichment of chemoattractants <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>What is unclear, however, is whether the physical nature of bone mineral also varies between the metaphysis, which is largely comprised of trabecular bone, and the diaphysis, which is primarily dense cortical bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>To address this question, we applied laboratory-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>) to establish a baseline of differences in HA nanocrystal thickness and orientation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) between metaphyseal and diaphyseal bone in the tibiae of disease-free mice.</s><s>We observed that mineral crystals in the metaphysis were significantly thinner (indicated by decreased T-parameter) and less oriented (indicated by decreased ρ-parameter) than those in the diaphysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 B-D</ref>).</s><s>In fact, crystals that were thinner were also less oriented (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), suggesting that the development of HA thickness and orientation occur in parallel.</s><s>Our results are in strong agreement with previous studies that identified HA nanostructural heterogeneity in murine long bones <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>.</s><s>The relative immaturity of metaphyseal HA crystals is consistent with their close proximity to the ossification center and the high turnover rate of metaphyseal trabecular bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>As breast cancer cells can adhere and proliferate better on smaller and less-perfect HA nanoparticles (13), the detected differences in metaphyseal versus diaphyseal HA nanostructure may be functionally relevant to the preferential metastatic tumor cell colonization of the proximal tibia.</s></p><p><s>Metastasis Initiation in the Proximal Tibial Metaphysis Alters the Bone ECM.</s><s>We next performed a multiscale characterization of tibial metastasis to identify tumor-mediated changes of bone ECM in these sites.</s><s>To achieve bone metastasis, we injected luciferase-expressing BoM1-2287 breast cancer cells, a bone metastatic subpopulation of the MDA-MB-231 cell line <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, into the left ventricle of the mouse heart.</s><s>As expected, this approach resulted in the reliable formation of macrometastasis in the proximal tibiae of immunocompromised BALB/c nude mice after 5 wk (21) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>).</s><s>μCT scans (Fig. <ref type="figure">3 A and C</ref>), Movat's pentachrome staining (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> B and D and Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>), and BSE images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>) revealed massive degradation of metaphyseal trabecular bone.</s><s>Viewed at these length scales, macrometastatic outgrowths were largely contained in the metaphysis, did not occur in the epiphysis (Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>), and left diaphyseal cortical bone unaffected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>).</s><s>Growth plate integrity was severely compromised in bone metastasis versus control samples, as suggested by the presence of fibrous tissue (25) rather than the organized arrays of chondrocyte  columns (Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>).</s><s>These observations support the possibility that disseminated tumor cells preferentially entered the tibiae through sinusoidal vessels supplying the metaphyseal trabecular bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and that the growth plate acted as a barrier preventing tumor cell advancement to the epiphysis.</s></p><p><s>We were specifically interested in characterizing the compositional and structural properties of tumor-interfacing bone remnants of what was once a mesh of metaphyseal trabecular bone (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3 and S4</ref>).</s><s>To this end, we used large-area Raman imaging to compare the chemical signatures of trabecular bone proximal (i.e., the epiphysis) and distal (i.e., the metaphysis) to the growth plate in control and metastasis conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure">3  E-J</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, in both control and tumor-bearing tibiae we observed that the intensity of the PO 4 v1 peak (960 cm −1 ) was comparable between the metaphysis and the epiphysis (Fig. <ref type="figure">3 F  and I</ref>).</s><s>This result suggests that the immediate presence of a tumor has little effect on the mineral content of the remaining bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, we found pronounced spectral differences in the amide I peak (1,677 cm −1 ), a proxy for collagen type I content <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, between the metaphysis and epiphysis of metastasisassociated bones (Fig. <ref type="figure">3 I and J</ref>).</s><s>Because the intensity of the amide I peak is polarization-dependent and may be affected by polarization orientation of the incident beam, we also assessed the intensity of the polarization-independent amide III peak (1,256 cm −1 ) (26, 27), which exhibited a concomitant decrease (Fig. <ref type="figure">S5B</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, the amide I and III peaks were virtually unaffected in the tibial metaphysis of control mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> F and G and Fig. <ref type="figure">S5A</ref>).</s><s>Hence, a significant increase in the phosphate-to-amide (PO 4 / Amide I) ratio (P &lt; 0.05) was observed in the bone metastasis condition versus the control condition (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s><s>Collectively, these data suggest a decrease in collagen relative to mineral content within bone that is in physical contact with the secondary tumor.</s></p><p><s>While the mineral content in the remnant bone tissue may have not been affected by the immediate presence of a tumor (Fig. <ref type="figure">3I</ref> and Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4 and S6B</ref>), bone mineral nanostructure may still have been impacted <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>.</s><s>As such, we were also interested in assessing changes in HA nanostructure within metastasis-associated bone remnants.</s><s>Targeting these bone remnants with X-ray scattering techniques proved technically infeasible, however.</s><s>As an alternative, we derived mineral crystallinity-a measure of HA nanocrystal maturity-from the inverse of the Raman PO 4 v1 peak FWHM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>.</s><s>This parameter positively correlates with the stoichiometric perfection and length of the crystallites along the c axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, we found that mineral crystallinity in the bone remnants was markedly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in the bone metastasis

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Interactions between breast cancer cells and the bone microenvironment are critical to the pathogenesis of skeletal metastases,

malignancy.</s><s>Using a combination of high-resolution analytical techniques to characterize tibiae from mouse models of bone metastatic and localized breast cancer, we show that the nanostructure of HA crystals varies between anatomical regions that are more and less prone to metastatic colonization, and that primary tumors may reinforce these variations even before metastatic outgrowth.</s></p><p><s>The observation that breast cancer cells preferentially colonize the proximal tibial metaphysis may have broader pathological relevance.</s><s>Adjacent to a secondary ossification center and enriched with trabecular bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, the tibial metaphysis of young mice can exemplify a distinct anatomical site of high bone turnover (i.e., resorption of old bone followed by formation of new bone).</s><s>Clinicians have long observed preferential metastatic localization to sites of active remodeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, such as the trabecular bone-rich pelvis and spinal vertebral bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</s><s>As the nanostructure of human and murine bone mineral is similar (5, 10), it is likely that HA crystals in these metabolically more active human skeletal sites are also more immature.</s><s>Future studies will need to confirm this possibility and assess the functional role of HA materials properties in driving secondary tumor formation in these sites.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, our SAXS/WAXS and Raman data point to a potential mammary tumor-mediated increase of local osteogenesis in the initial trabecular network before secondary tumor formation.</s><s>This finding supports experimental evidence by others that primary tumors can activate premetastatic remodeling of the bone, and that these changes ultimately promote metastatic dissemination <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>.</s><s>While these previous studies of mammary tumor-mediated changes focused on bone cell activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> and circulating markers of bone collagen remodeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, our data now additionally suggest that structural changes occur in the mineral phase of bone.</s><s>More specifically, we observed a decrease in mineral nanocrystal size in the metaphyseal bone tissue bordering the growth plate.</s><s>Since these changes occurred at a bone growth front, these data indicate that a localized mammary tumor may be affecting the mineralization of new matrix.</s><s>In bone, the deposition of HA results from a thermodynamically driven cascade that may involve the initial formation of disordered, less stable nanoparticulate phases that become more crystalline and increase in size as they progress to the final mineral phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>.</s><s>As such, a mammary tumor could conceivably decrease general mineral maturity by releasing factors that stimulate osteogenic cells to increase their production of new bone (Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>), which typically consists of smaller, less-perfect and less-oriented HA crystals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, the physiological maturation of bone mineral could also be directly inhibited by soluble factors secreted by the mammary tumor.</s><s>The glycoprotein osteopontin is a potential candidate, as it is highly expressed by the BoM1-2287 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> used in this study and is known to inhibit the growth of HA mineral <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, changes in HA nanostructure may have been due to mammary tumor-mediated effects on the longitudinal bone growth of the young mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> used in our studies.</s><s>However, given the similarities in growth plate thicknesses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2D</ref>) and trabecular network properties (Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref> A and B) between control tibiae and mammary tumorassociated tibiae, the metabolic program of growth plate chondrocytes and the consequent rate of endochondral ossification <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> appear to be unaffected by the primary tumors.</s><s>Taken together, our results suggest that the primary mammary tumor could induce the formation of less-mature bone mineral in the absence of a secondary tumor, likely without changing overall skeletal growth.</s></p><p><s>Premetastatic, primary tumor-mediated changes in nanoscale bone mineral properties may be an underappreciated mechanism that could play a role in the initial establishment and survival of a secondary tumor colony in the bone.</s><s>Because metastatic breast cancer cells exhibit increased proliferation and adhesion on smaller and less-perfect HA nanocrystals ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), these early-stage changes of bone mineral may promote the initial seeding and survival of disseminated tumor cells.</s><s>Furthermore, the deposition of a more immature mineral phase that is more susceptible to osteolytic degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref> could facilitate the vicious cycle of bone metastasis, thus promoting tumor outgrowth.</s><s>Complemented by our previous work suggesting that nanoscale HA materials properties can influence breast cancer malignant progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, we propose a modified view of the vicious cycle of bone metastasis in which HA materials properties are functionally linked with the pathogenesis of breast cancer bone metastasis (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Detailed in vivo studies will be needed to conclusively define the functional consequences of our observations.</s><s>Nevertheless, our results bring to light that nanostructural parameters of the bone metastatic site are currently underappreciated but should be considered when studying the microenvironmental complexities that influence bone metastasis.</s></p><p><s>While others have previously reported that breast cancer can remotely engender bone destruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>, we now further advance this field of work by quantifying tumor-mediated changes in HA nanostructure in skeletal locations associated with metastasis.</s><s>The findings here may inform future therapeutic strategies.</s><s>For instance, adjuvant prescription of antiresorptive drugs such as bisphosphonates (BPs) is currently largely palliative and does not improve patient survival rate (1).</s><s>BPs, which are taken up by boneresorbing osteoclasts, localize to mineralized tissue by selectively binding to HA <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>As molecular simulation studies show that BP-HA binding energies are dependent on HA nanocrystal size <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, BP therapeutic efficacy may be affected by tumor-induced changes in HA nanostructure.</s><s>Understanding how nanoscale variations in HA structure affect BP binding may aid the development of derivatives and protein conjugates (42) that are more effective in the treatment of bone metastasis.</s></p><p><s>Although limited by sample throughput, X-ray scattering analysis and large-area Raman imaging generate position-resolved information on the micro-to nanoscales that can be combined with a host of other techniques to provide a comprehensive assessment of bone materials properties in a variety of pathological contexts.</s><s>Thus, similar approaches to the one described in this paper can be used to assess bone nanostructure in animal models of other cancers (e.g., prostate and Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Proposed functional relationship between HA mineral characteristics and breast cancer bone metastasis.</s><s>In mice, breast cancer cells typically colonize the metaphysis in the metabolically active proximal tibia.</s><s>We show that mineral in metaphyseal bone (A) is less mature (i.e., smaller, less-perfect, and less-oriented) relative to other skeletal locations (B) not prone to initiation of metastasis.</s><s>Because previous in vitro findings show that tumor cells preferentially adhere to less-mature crystals, we propose that this difference in mineral properties may be functionally relevant to the establishment of a tumor colony (C).</s><s>The metastasized tumor cells can then disrupt typical bone remodeling processes (D) to result in the aberrant activity of bone cells and the increased release of tumor-recruiting soluble factors (E).</s><s>Furthermore, breast cancer cells located within primary tumors can stimulate bone remodeling by secreting circulating factors (F) that enhance local osteogenesis and, thus, alter the composition and structure of the bone ECM.</s><s>Here, we propose that these premetastatic changes lead to the deposition of a less-mature mineral phase (G) which may be essential in driving the vicious cycle of osteolytic bone metastasis.</s></p><p><s>lung) that also metastasize to bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>Insights from these analyses will inform the design of biomimetic culture systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref> and high-throughput screening platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> to investigate the functional role of HA mineral in bone metastasis as well as the development of tissue-engineered tumor models that recapitulate the bone microenvironment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, future work will also need to consider the effect of changing bone mineral properties in the context of the intimately associated collagen fibrils and adhesive proteins enriched in the metastatic site.</s><s>Interdisciplinary collaborations between the fields of biomaterials, cancer biology, and oncology will be key to this promising new field of work in which materials science approaches will play an important role.</s></p></div>
