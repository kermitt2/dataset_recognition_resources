<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>The Cognitive Style Questionnaire is a valuable tool for the assessment of hopeless cognitive styles in depression research, with predictive power in longitudinal studies.</s><s>However, it is very burdensome to administer.</s><s>Even the short form is still long, and neither this nor the original version exist in validated German translations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>The questionnaire was translated from English to German, back-translated and commented on by clinicians.</s><s>The reliability, factor structure and external validity of an online form of the questionnaire were examined on 214 participants.</s><s>External validity was measured on a subset of 90 subjects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The resulting CSQ-SF-D had good to excellent reliability, both across items and subscales, and similar external validity to the original English version.</s><s>The internality subscale appeared less robust than other subscales.</s><s>A detailed analysis of individual item performance suggests that stable results could be achieved with a very short form (CSQ-VSF-D) including only 27 of the 72 items.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Translation</head><p><s>Four independent translations into German by native German speakers proficient in English were obtained.</s><s>Three of these were clinically qualified (two psychiatrists, one psychologist).</s><s>These were used to construct a first version of the questionnaire by the authors.</s><s>This first version was commented on by four further, independent psychiatrists who were native German speakers fluent in English.</s><s>These also had access to the original English version.</s><s>Comments were included by QH to form the second version.</s><s>This was then sent to a native English speaker proficient in German for backtranslation, and the backtranslation compared to the English original by two further native speakers.</s><s>These comments were again considered by QH and only minor further changes implemented.</s></p><p><s>During the translation, we altered two items to make them more applicable to general populations rather than student populations.</s><s>The setting of items 2 and 6 was changed to a continuing education setting rather than a university or school setting.</s><s>To reduce response set bias, we attempted to stay close to the original version by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> and did not formulate the questions according to a rigid schema.</s></p><p><s>The questions in the final version of the questionnaire are reproduced in the appendix.</s><s>These questions were implemented as an online version using LimeSurvey (www.limesurvey.org).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Test population</head><p><s>Subjects were recruited through email adverts through the University of Zürich recruitment system (UAST).</s><s>The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Kantonale Ethikkommission Zurich).</s><s>After providing informed consent, 214 subjects filled in the short version of CSQ questionnaire online via a customized version of LimeSurvey.</s><s>Of these, 206 were complete.</s><s>Subjects additionally reported measures of obsessive-compulsive traits (PADUA-Inventory Washington State University Revision (PI-WSUR); <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>, German translation: University Clinic Bonn (2002)) as well as impulsivity (Barrat Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11); Original: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>, German translation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A subset of 90 participants took part in a follow-up study.</s><s>For this convenience subset the following additional questionnaires were acquired: the German version of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ-D, Original: <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref>, German Translation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15]</ref>), Sensitivity to Punishment and Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16]</ref>), Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref>), Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS-D, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[18]</ref>, German Translation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>), Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (IDS-SR30, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>) and Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[21]</ref>, German Translation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22]</ref>).</s><s>In addition, these subjects performed learning and decision-making tasks aimed at assessing processes underlying obsessive and compulsive symptoms in healthy participants.</s><s>These are not reported here as we had no a priori hypotheses about their relationship with CSQ measures; and as it would detract from the focus of the paper, which is the establishment and validation of the CSQ in German.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Analysis</head><p><s>All analyses were performed using Matlab 8.4.0.150421 (R2014b).</s><s>Analyses were performed on individual items; on the five pre-defined subscales (internality, items 1 and 6; globality, items 2 and 7; stability, items 3 and 8; negative consequences, item 4; self-worth, items 5 and 9 of each scenario), and on the scenarios.</s></p><p><s>Cronbach α was calculated across items, across subscales and across scenarios to measure internal reliability of the scores.</s><s>Pearson's correlations were measured between subscales and with the total scores.</s></p><p><s>We performed a principal component analysis (PCA) without preprocessing of the data (by computing the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix).</s><s>Variance explained was measured as the normalised eigenvalue.</s><s>PCAs were performed on individual items, on subscales and on scenarios.</s></p><p><s>In addition to PCA, we also performed a factor analysis using the function factoran.m.</s><s>BIC scores were computed as follows:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">BIC k ¼ À2L þ ðjk þ j À kðk À 1Þ 2 Þ log<label>ðNÞ</label></formula><p><s>where L is the total likelihood, k the number of factors in the model, j the dimensionality of each subject's data (j = 72 for factor analyses on individual items, and j = 5 for factor analyses across subscales) and N the number of subjects.</s><s>We additionally examined the linear correlation of each individual item, subscale and scenario with the total score.</s><s>The linear correlation factors were then ordered.</s><s>We assessed the correlation of the sum across the n most correlated items, subscales or scenarios with the total scores to look at how many items were necessary to reach a correlation of 0.95.</s><s>This was performed once in the entire dataset, and once in two random partitions of the datasets.</s><s>Finally, the ordering of the items/subscales/scenarios in the half datasets and the dataset were compared.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p><s>The full set of final items is displayed in S1 File.</s><s>The full data is contained in S2 File.</s><s>As in the original, total scores could range from 72 to 360.</s><s>206 full answer sets were collected.</s><s>Sample characteristics are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, and the correlations between the five subscales internality, globality, stability, self-worth, negative consequences and the total scores are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</s><s>As can be seen, the internality score was both less correlated with the other scores, and also less correlated with the total score.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Item-based measures</head><p><s>Overall, when considering the sum of all individual items, Cronbach's α indicated excellent reliability (α = 0.91), and a principal component analysis suggested the existence of one single underlying factor (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) explaining 17% of the variance.</s><s>The factor loadings were spread evenly (all but 5 items loading positively), suggesting that variation was best captured by the total score.</s><s>The factor analysis also indicated the best fit contained only one hidden factor (BIC = 817 for one factor compared to 1191 for two factors).</s></p><p><s>Given that the CSQ-SF-D measured a single underlying dimension, rather equally across items, and that the extremely high reliability indicated possible redundancy, we examined how individual items predicted the total score.</s><s>To do so, we measured the linear correlation between each item and the total score.</s><s>We then asked how well one could predict the total score by incrementally including items that individually correlated most strongly with the total score.</s><s>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> shows the results of this analysis.</s><s>The best-performing item (number 61, item 7 in scenario 6) on its own had a correlation of 0.6 with the total score.</s><s>As more items are included, the correlation with the total score increases rapidly, reaching 0.95 when around 27-30 of the 72 items are included.</s><s>This was true when doing the analysis in the entire dataset (thick blue line), and remained stable when repeating the analysis in the two halves of the dataset (thin lines).</s><s>The rankings inferred in each of the two halves of the dataset were also highly correlated (Fig 1D <ref type="figure">, inset</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The 27 most informative items (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) were distributed across scenarios 2-7, with no item from scenario 1 or 8.</s><s>They were also spread across all the subscales (7 items measuring globality; 7 items measuring stability; 10 items measuring self-worth and 3 items measuring negative consequences) except for internality, of which no item was amongst the top 27.</s></p><p><s>The 27 items could also be used to estimate the separate subscales (other than internality).</s><s>The correlation between the globality score measured on the full dataset and measured with the Component structure of the CSQ-SF-D.</s><s>A-D: PCA results: variance explained (normalised eigenvalues) across individual items (A), across the five subscales (B), across the eight scenarios (C) and across the reduced set of 27 items for the very short form (E).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Subscales</head><p><s>Subscales and total variability were also reliably related (α = 0.78), which is very similar to the results of the English version <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</s><s>When considering how individual items related to the subscales, Cronbach's α ranged from good (α = 0.82 for self-worth) to poor (α = 0.48 for internality).</s><s>A PCA across components also indicated the existence of a single underlying factor explaining 65% of the variance (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>The subscales all loaded positively on the main component (loadings between 0.13 and 0.69).</s><s>A factor analysis across the subscales also indicated the existence of a single underlying factor (BIC = 53.4 for one vs BIC = 74.6 for two factors).</s></p><p><s>We repeated the analysis from Fig 1D using subscales instead of individual items.</s><s>Fig 1E shows that the most informative subscale was 'negative consequences', followed by 'globality' and 'stability'.</s><s>These three together resulted in a summed score that had a high correlation (0.92) with the total score.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Scenarios</head><p><s>The reliability across scenarios was good (α = 0.86).</s><s>Principal component analysis again indicated the presence of one single underlying factor (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) explaining 53% of the variance.</s><s>All scenarios loaded positively (range 0.18-0.44)</s><s>onto this main eigenvector.</s></p><p><s>Repeating the analysis of Fig 1D, a correlation of 0.95 with the total score could be achieved by including scenarios 3, 5, 8, 2 and 7.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">External validity</head><p><s>As a measure of external validity, we collected additional measures in a convenience subset of 90 subjects (see methods).</s><s>Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR 30; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>).</s><s>Table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows that there were significant correlations with all subscales of the CSQ-SF-D, with the highest correlation being observed for the total score.</s><s>Again, the internality subscale differed from the other subscales and had a smaller correlation with depressive symptomatology.</s><s>A similar pattern is observed for correlation with state and trait anxiety (measured with the Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety (STAI) questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, CSQ-SF-D subscales and total scores correlated positively with punishment sensitivity, but not with reward sensitivity measured via the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16]</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, though, there was no correlation between punishment on the SPSRQ and the CSF-SF-D subscale 'negative consequences'.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p><s>We here provide a German of the short version of the Cognitive Style Questionnaire (CSQ-SF) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> with a validation.</s><s>The translation included back-translation and was performed by multiple qualified clinicians fluent in both English and German.</s><s>In order to render the questionnaire outside the university setting, two items were slightly modified to a continuing education rather than a university/school setting.</s><s>The resulting German version has similar overall measures of reliability and also measures one single underlying factor.</s></p><p><s>The resulting scale has an internal reliability of α = 0.91 comparable to that of the English version with an α = 0.85.</s><s>The German and English versions also have a similar factor structure, with one dominant dimension loading positively on most items; on all subscales; and on all scenarios.</s><s>The first factor explained numerically the same amount (65%) of the variance in the five subscales of the English and the translated German version.</s></p><p><s>When examining the various components of the questionnaire, the measure of internality appears less robust than the others.</s><s>This is again akin to the results in the 11 and 13-item versions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, though in the 8-item version that forms the basis of the current translation this appeared to be less the case.</s></p><p><s>The CSF-SF-D has reasonable external validity in terms of correlations with depressive and anxiety symptoms.</s><s>It also correlated with punishment sensitivity on the SPSRQ, but not with reward sensitivity.</s><s>Again, the internality subscale appeared to also have less external validity in being less correlated with any of the external measures.</s><s>The measures of external validity are comparable between the German and the original English versions.</s><s>The correlation between the English CSQ-SF and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Anxiety and Depression scales were 0.38 and 0.28, respectively.</s><s>Here, we find correlations with STAI state and trait anxiety measures of 0.49 and 0.47, and with total scores of the IDS-SR-30, a measure of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref> of 0.46.</s><s>Note that while these values are not directly comparable as we did not acquire the HADS, they do nevertheless speak to the question of external validity in a comparable manner.</s></p><p><s>Given that the scores were clearly well captured by a single dimension, we again raised the question whether it could be further simplified.</s><s>Our item-based analysis suggested that a very Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Correlation between total score and subscales with external measures of depression (IDS-SR 30), state and trait anxiety (STAI-S and STAI-T) and reward and punishment sensitivity.</s><s>Total CSQ-SF-D scores are highly significantly correlated with measures of anxiety, depression and punishment sensitivity, but not reward sensitivity.</s><s>Boldface indicates significant Pearson's linear correlations.</s><s>short form (henceforth CSQ-VSF-D) with only 27 items yield very similar results to the short form both in terms of total score, factor structure and subscales.</s><s>The CSQ-VSF-D removes two (1-'Imagine you are getting along badly with your parents' and 8 -'Imagine you are unhappy') entirely and no longer measures the internality subscale.</s><s>It is also provided in the appendix and remains to be validated separately.</s></p></div>
