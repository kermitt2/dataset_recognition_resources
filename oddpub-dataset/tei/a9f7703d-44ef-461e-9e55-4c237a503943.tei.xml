<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objective In the general population, the incidence of stroke is increased following other serious events and hospitalisation.</s><s>We investigated the impact of serious adverse events on the risk of stroke in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (rA), taking risk factors and treatment into account.</s><s>Methods Using data of the German biologics register rABBIt (rheumatoid Arthritis: observation of Biologic therapy) with 12354 patients with rA, incidence rates (Irs) and risk factors for stroke were investigated using multistate and Cox proportional hazard models.</s><s>In addition, in a nested case-control study, all patients with stroke were matched 1:2 to patients with identical baseline risk profile and analysed using a shared frailty model.</s><s>results during follow-up, 166 strokes were reported.</s><s>the overall Ir was 3.2/1000 patient-years (pY) (95% CI 2.7 to 3.7).</s><s>It was higher after a serious adverse event (Ir: 9.0 (7.3 to 11.0)), particularly within 30 days after the event (Ir: 94.9 (72.6 to 121.9)).</s><s>the adjusted Cox model showed increased risks of age per 5 years (Hr: 1.4 (1.3 to 1.5)), hyperlipoproteinaemia (Hr: 1.6 (1.0 to 2.5)) and smoking (Hr: 1.9 (1.3 to 2.6)).</s><s>the risk decreased with better physical function (Hr: 0.9 (0.8 to 0.96)).</s><s>In the case-control study, 163 patients were matched to 326 controls.</s><s>Major risk factors for stroke were untreated cardiovascular disease (Hr: 3.3 (1.5 to 7.2)) and serious infections (Hr:4.4</s><s>(1.6 to 12.5)) or other serious adverse events (Hr: 2.6 (1.4 to 4.8)).</s><s>Conclusions Incident adverse events, in particular serious infections, and insufficient treatment of cardiovascular diseases are independent drivers of the risk of stroke.</s><s>physicians should be aware that patients who experience a serious event are at increased risk of subsequent stroke.</s></p></div>

association between markers of inflammation and disease activity with the incidence of stroke persisted in our study only in unadjusted analyses.</s><s>This is in contrast to findings for myocardial infarction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">28</ref></s><s>However, it implies the possibility of an SAE-driven elevation of inflammation markers.</s><s>In the cause-specific model, which estimates the risk for stroke without the influence of SAEs, the estimator of logCRP was non-significant (HR 1.1 (95% CI 0.9 to 1.5)) not supporting the idea of CRP as a risk factor for stroke.</s></p><p><s>Our study has several strengths and limitations.</s><s>The large RABBIT cohort with well-monitored follow-up data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">16</ref> enabled us to analyse patients with similar baseline risk for incident stroke, using a nested case-control design.</s><s>Stroke is a slowly evolving event, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">37</ref> and controls were required to have a minimum observation time corresponding to their matching case.</s><s>Requesting the same observation time as matching criteria is a limitation of the study design too, which may imply a selection bias of patients with better controlled disease and less frequent SAEs.</s><s>This peculiarity may bias the cumulative incidence of strokes after the development of SAEs.</s><s>Therefore, we omitted this criterion in a sensitivity analysis which confirmed the findings of the main analysis (data not shown).</s><s>A remaining limitation of shared frailty models rests with the lack of diagnostic tools
