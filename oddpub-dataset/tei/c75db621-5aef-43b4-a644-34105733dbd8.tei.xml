<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Our study has limitations.</s><s>All of our CIP patients featured concomitant critical illness myopathy, which may have influenced excitability results in motor axons.</s><s>However, since conditioning currents applied in stimulus-response and current-threshold relationships and TE assessments would not be sensed by the innervated muscle fibers, these data should not have been affected by concomitant myopathy.</s><s>Due to the explorative and non-confirmatory study design, we avoid to report a post hoc power analysis in the paper, as recommended by Hoenig and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>We confirmed previous in vitro findings in vivo, showing that inactivation of motor axon voltage-gated Na+ channels is the primary contributor of muscle weakness in CIP patients.</s><s>Additionally, we provided evidence that abnormal membrane depolarization in motor axons is a general finding in ICU patients corresponding to illness severity.</s><s>Moreover, we observed a paradoxical membrane depolarization related to K+ equilibrium that could be related to intracellular acidosis; however, this still needs to be evaluated in future studies.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Study flow chart</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,155.68,96.27,283.87,278.93" type="bitmap" /></figure>
