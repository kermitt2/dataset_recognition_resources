planning; volition; if-then plans; goal striving; cues-to-action</s></p><p><s>There has been a proliferation of theory and research using planning-based interventions to change health-related behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gollwitzer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hagger &amp; Luszczynska, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Much of this research has been driven by the evidence of a disparity between individuals' reports of positive intentions committing them to a course of action and their actual behavioural enactment in health contexts, colloquially referred to as the intentionbehaviour 'gap' <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Orbell &amp;

Sheeran, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>However, there is recognition that a substantial number of individuals are motivated to engage in health behaviour and form goal intentions to do so, but fail to carry out those intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gollwitzer, Sheeran, Michalski, &amp; Seifert, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Rhodes &amp; Dickau, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>These individuals are often referred to as 'inclined abstainers' <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Orbell &amp;

Sheeran, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Webb &amp; Sheeran, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>This has led to increased focus on the processes by which intentions are enacted.</s></p><p><s>A number of social psychological theories and models have proposed that the enactment of intentions occurs at a separate 'stage' or 'phase' to intention formation and it is processes in this stage that determine the extent to which intentions are converted into action <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hagger &amp;

how best to reinforce cue-response strength; best practice in specifying if-then components), guidance on testing the effects of moderators of planning interventions (identifying intrapersonal factors as moderators; identifying the effect of language and mode of delivery; type of response), recommendations on the social aspects of planning (use of collaborative and dyadic planning; conditions and populations for which collaborative and dyadic planning are most effective; mechanisms underpinning collaborative and dyadic planning), necessary considerations of the preconditions that may moderate the effectiveness of planning (investigate the mediators of pre-planning; contextual factors that favour pre-planning; developing implementation intentions for individuals with low incentives and low self-efficacy to change), and recommendations on investigating how people use plans (fidelity of planning interventions; conducting process evaluations linking plans with other intervention techniques; examining combinations and sequences of planning interventions with other intervention techniques).</s></p><p><s>The only recommendation that did not receive high endorsement was the proposal that researchers should integrate content-free pre-planning interventions to turn individuals into 'expert' planners.</s><s>The lower level of agreement (68%) highlights the issue as one which is potentially controversial or where views were somewhat divergent.</s><s>Much of the debate on this issue was focused on whether pre-planning interventions should be 'content' free or whether the content should be guided or prompted by the researcher or practitioner facilitating the pre-planning intervention.</s><s>The general view was that eliciting individuals' personal rationales and obstacles in pre-planning interventions may be more effective as they provide person-centred reasons for developing future plans rather than externally referenced reasons which may receive lower endorsement by the individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Adriaanse et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Verhoeven et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However, as planning interventions tend to be as effective when imposed by the researcher or practitioner <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Armitage, 2009)</ref> and individuals may not have the ability to identify appropriate cues, barriers or obstacles, some felt that researcher-or practitioner-driven pre-planning interventions would be at least as, if not more, effective in developing planning expertise.</s><s>Without research directly testing these effects, these opposing views are speculative and based on the Expert Group's current opinion derived from existing data, and further research that examines pre-planning conditions that compare effectiveness of planning using researcher or practitioner versus personal rationales and obstacles is encouraged.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the current position statement and recommendations are the result of rigorous discussions of research on planning interventions conducted over the last three decades, including studies conducted by members of the Expert Group (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Adriaanse et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bélanger-Gravel et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Carraro &amp;

broader audiences.</s><s>Although the group comprised a number of doctoral students and early-career researchers, many were at the forefront of developing innovative designs and interventions as demonstrated by their publication records reviewed a priori by the Synergy Committee and lead facilitators.</s><s>In addition, the nominal groups method adopted was effective in developing and exchanging ideas within the group context and also provided a clear method to demonstrate the level of consensus among participants.</s><s>In addition, the content of the position statement was vetted and approved by all authors in advance, providing further evidence of consent.</s></p><p><s>We also acknowledge a number of limitations of the current nominal groups approach.</s><s>The adoption of RAM as an alternative approach may have allowed for the development of more specific practice recommendations based on strong evidence for effectiveness, analyses of potential harms, and chosen objective outcomes.</s><s>However, that the nominal group approach was considered a good fit for the expert group discussion based on the state of the existing evidence.</s><s>The approach has advantages in promoting the generation and exchange of ideas and demonstrating consensus among group members on broad issues with respect to planning.</s><s>The decision to select this approach over other methods (such as the RAM) was based on the facilitators' evaluation of the quality of existing evidence and extent of disagreement in the existing literature in terms of definitions, mechanisms, and outcomes.</s><s>The nominal group approach, as well as other consensus approaches such as the RAM, may be criticised on the grounds that the results obtained may vary depending on the composition of the panel.</s><s>Evidence-based recommendations suggest that experts should be sufficiently representative of the disciplines relevant to the subject matter under discussion.</s><s>However, the current group was considered to have sufficient diversity to warrant adoption of these methods (see Appendix A).</s></p><p><s>We also acknowledge that the current position statement and discussions of the expert group represent the views and opinions of the group.</s><s>While there is an acknowledgement that expert groups, provided their membership sufficiently covers the subject areas and has sufficient externally verified levels of expertise, are effective in developing consensus among group members and identifying pressing priorities for future research, the current statement should be acknowledged as one that reflects opinion.</s><s>The current statement should, therefore, neither be viewed as definitive nor comprehensive.</s><s>Instead, it should be viewed as a starting point and catalyst for future investigation in a field experiencing rapid expansion and intensity of research as investigators seek to discover the potential and diversity, limits and boundary conditions, of implementation intention and planning interventions.</s><s>The expert group has highlighted some prominent areas in need of research, but we also stress our recommendations are but one source of information for potential recommendations for future research directions.</s><s>Our intention was not to limit the diversity of research in the field of implementation intentions nor confine researchers to a narrow set of topics.</s><s>We recognise that other research priorities exist and encourage researchers to pursue high-quality, methodologically rigorous research on implementation intention and planning interventions that advance current thinking and knowledge.</s></p><p><s>There may have been a number of priority areas that were not discussed or identified during the course of the discussions.</s><s>For example, a priority area that was not discussed by the expert group but implied by its findings is the need for a rigorous systematic review of implementation intentions and planning interventions in health contexts adopting universally-approved guidelines and methods for search, inclusion, quality and synthesis (e.g.</s><s>Cochrane Collaboration, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, PRISMA).</s><s>While there are reviews and syntheses that have adopted strong methods and criteria, they have tended to be confined to particular health behaviours such as physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bélanger-Gravel et al., 2013)</ref> and healthy eating <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Adriaanse et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The expanding literature on implementation intention and planning interventions in health behaviour makes such a review timely and would permit subgroup analyses that would enable the issues identified in the current article to be addressed empirically rather than through consensus among experts.</s><s>In addition, we also acknowledge the need for researchers examining effects of planning interventions to adhere to 'open science' principles (Open Science Collaboration, 2015) such as the need for pre-registration of trials using planning techniques and the submission of data for secondary analyses to allay the potential for publication bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Pashler &amp; Harris, 2012)</ref> and dubious practices that limit scientific progress and contribution such as 'p-hacking' <ref
