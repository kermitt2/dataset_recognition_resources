<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endoscopic Lung Volume Reduction (ELVR)</head><p><s>! ELVR is a term for minimally invasive, bronchoscopy-assisted LVR procedures and currently includes both reversible therapies in the sense of one-way endobronchial valves and irreversible procedures such as the endobronchial application of hot steam and endobronchial coils.</s><s>Contraindications for ELVR, as defined in most studies, are active nicotine abuse, cardiovascular diseases with special emphasis on pulmonary hypertension, chronic infections of the lower airways, malignant tumors and psychosocial contraindications.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Occlusive Endobronchial Valves (EBV)</head><p><s>! Clinical trials involving reversible endobronchial valves as minimally invasive LVR therapy commenced in 2003 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>.</s><s>The advantage of these valves is that they can be removed entirely in the event of complications, e. g. (rare) retention pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.</s><s>On the other hand, EBV are not permanently anchored and can become dislocated from the force of coughing, and can even be coughed out.</s><s>Made of the technical alloy nitinol and silicone, the occlusive valves are anchored in lobular or segmental bronchi via a bronchoscopic guide catheter.</s><s>A "oneway mechanism" is designed to cause isolated atelectasis in the target area distal to the valve <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Correctly implanted valves open during expiration to allow the air to flow out of the areas of the lung distal to the valve.</s><s>EBV are also designed to allow mucus, in addition to respiratory air, to escape from the downstream areas of the lungs to thereby decrease the risk of downstream pulmonary infections.</s><s>During inspiration, the valve then closes to block the flow of respiratory air into the treated lobes, thereby successively reducing their volume.</s><s>It is therefore necessary to always occlude an entire lobe, since intralobular segments are normally ventilated collaterally and such collateral ventilation would otherwise prevent atelectasis.</s></p><p><s>• " Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the method of action of the endobronchial valves during inspiration and expiration using diagrams and bronchoscopic images taken in vivo.</s><s>There are essentially two manufacturing companies currently competing on the international market.</s><s>The Zephyr valves from the US company Pulmonx typically feature a type of "duckbill mechanism", while the Spiration valves from the Japanese manufacturer Olympus employ a miniumbrella design.</s><s>The first clinical cooperation studies with Olympus were based on the idea of creating incomplete bronchial occlusion with the goal of being able to contain peri-interventional complications.</s><s>This was not achieved, however, since the patients, while initially reporting subjective respiratory improvement, exhibited a drop in FEV 1 to below baseline during follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</s><s>In a

target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The complete occlusion of a selected lobe is now the goal of each ELVR using EBV.</s><s>Although frequent, peri-interventional complications of EBV implantation are rarely fatal.</s><s>In the "VENT" study (endobronchial valve for emphysema palliation trial) Sciurba et al. observed a significant increase in COPD exacerbations and pneumonia, hemoptysis and pneumothorax <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, the incidence of post-interventional pneumothorax was primarily underestimated in the "VENT" study at 4.2 %, with more current publications estimating a risk of roughly 20 % for patients treated with EBV [6].</s><s>This can be attributed particularly to the improved patient selection in the mean- time, since the risk of post-interventional pneumothorax increases due to the hyperinflation of the untreated neighboring lobe among other factors when there is a rapid loss of volume in the target lobe owing to the hyperinflation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>While post-interventional pneumothorax following EBV implantation is a frequent complication according to these studies, it has no long-term negative impact on FEV 1 and quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>In any case, the relevant frequency of peri-interventional pneumothorax following EBV implantation necessitates post-interventional monitoring, a hospital stay of at least 48 hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> and radiological follow-up.</s><s>Patients developing complete atelectasis following EBV therapy exhibit significantly better trends in terms of physical activity and spirometrically measurable lung function <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the appearance of complete atelectasis appears to be the main criterion for improved survival following ELVR with EBV <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Hopkinson et al. ascertained 6year survival rates following EBV implantation of 100 % and 43 % for subgroups with and without complete atelectasis, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>However, there are currently no large randomized controlled studies concerning long-term survival following EBV implantation.</s><s>The research community is therefore hoping that the "LIVE" study (a long term follow up investigation of endobronchial valves in emphysema), which is currently seeking to be the first long-term observation over a period of 5 years, will gather pioneering results.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Irreversible ELVR methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>!</head><p><s>What all irreversible ELVR methods have in common is that, unlike with EBV, which can be removed bronchoscopically, there is no going back once performed.</s><s>Additionally, it cannot be absolutely assumed that foreign material introduced will remain anchored in place, given that the lungs move as a result of respiratory excursion.</s><s>Although rare, complications resulting from material dislocations can be serious, since the pulmonary and bronchial structures can be perforated and even penetrated.</s><s>Because long-term results for all methods are currently still unavailable, it is not yet possible to make any predictions whatsoever on the carcinogenicity of ELVR therapies.</s><s>Endobronchial coils (LVRC, Lung Volume Reduction Coils) are introduced bronchoscopically and contract in helical formation upon being released, causing a mechanical contraction of the treated region of the lung.</s><s>Their principle of application is highly promising, given that they have an immediate effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>It is clearly a disadvantage that implantation of the foreign bodies measuring up to 20 cm long cannot be re- garded as a reversible procedure.</s><s>In addition, their length and shape would appear to make the induction of electrical currents a possibility, even though the manufacturer claims the coils are "MR-compatible".</s><s>This could at least have an impact on thoracic MRI.</s><s>Published in 2013, "RESET" was the first randomized controlled study.</s><s>While it showed 23 patients following LVRC to have significantly better clinical results than the control group undergoing conservative therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, pneumothorax, infections and COPD exacerbations were observed more frequently.</s><s>Larger, valid studies are primarily still in progress.</s><s>Nevertheless, the rate of peri-interventional complications is apparently comparable with that of EBV <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>While there is less knowledge about therapy with coils than about that with EBV, it constitutes the sole approved ELVR method when ELVR with EBV is not an option due to the presence of "collateral ventilation" (CV, see below).</s><s>It is possible that LVRC may see increasingly wider user once the results of the currently ongoing, controlled randomized "RE-NEW" study are available.</s><s>Known as thermoablation (BTVA, Bronchoscopic Thermal Vapor Ablation), the scalding of lung parenchyma using bronchoscopically administered steam serves to in induce an inflammatory response to thereby achieve LVR through the subsequent scarring and fibrotic shrinkage of the treated area of the lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The onset of effect is therefore delayed compared to the other ELVR procedures, with maximum effect not appearing until after 8 to 12 weeks.</s><s>In two prospective uncontrolled studies, Snell et al. (SGRQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref> reported therapeutic success similar to that achieved with EBV, specifically a volume reduction of the target area by up to 48 % and a significant improvement of lung function and quality of life (SGRQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>.</s><s>A typical post-interventional complication of BTVA is an overreaching inflammation accompanied by flu-like symptoms.</s><s>However, Gompelmann et al. reported highly promising cases of success, particularly in patients with increased post-interventional symptoms, since the severity of the inflammatory reaction appears to correlate with clinical success <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>A wait-andsee approach is needed for this method still being tested.</s><s>The currently ongoing "StepUp" study, which will be the first controlled randomized study for this method, could provide further insights The endobronchial administration of synthetic polymers (PLVR, Polymeric Lung Volume Reduction) is intended to induce a reduction in lung volume through the mechanical "adhesion" of the treated areas of the lungs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s><s>While these so-called Sealants have yielded overall good therapeutic results comparable to those of EBV, severe pneumonia and death were observed more frequently with this therapy.</s><s>In addition, the majority of patients exhibited peri-interventional flu-like symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, and the time between the onset of effect and measureable therapeutic success took longer than EBV, requiring 6 -12 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</s><s>In the meantime, the active substance AeriSeal (Aeris Therapeutics Inc., USA) is no longer commercially available.</s><s>It remains to be seen whether this method will be readopted in the future.</s><s>Through the use of bronchoscopically implanted, drugcoated bypass stents (synonym "bronchial fenestration", Broncus Technologies, USA) extra-anatomical shunts were made between emphysematous lung areas and the bronchial system, thereby facilitating ventilation and volume reduction of the treated areas of the lungs.</s><s>Although this method initially showed highly promising clinical improvements, the "EASE" study (exhale airway stents for emphysema) documented no long-term clinical success and this method has since been abandoned <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</s><s>The failure of this approach is attributed primarily to the occlusion of the stent resulting from granulation tissue and stent dislocations.</s></p><p><s>Special imaging methods for pulmonary emphysema !</s><s>High-resolution computed tomography is the long-established imaging method of choice for detecting pulmonary emphysema <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s><s>It is significantly more sensitive than conventional radiography, which rarely detects subclinical forms of emphysema <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, thin-slice CT usually allows pulmonary emphysema to be clearly differentiated from key differential diagnoses.</s><s>Unlike pulmonary emphysema, cystic pulmonary diseases such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis or lymphangioleiomyomatosis typically involve hypodense lesions defined by visible walls.</s><s>The advantages for thoracic diagnostics presented by three-dimensional volumetric datasets that can be reformatted on the spatial planes were already described in the mid-1990 s <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> By enabling the entire lungs to be examined in a single breathing pause for the first time, the growth of multiple detector computed tomography (MDCT) represented a technical breakthrough for thoracic diagnostics.</s><s>Considerable amounts of image data are generated with MDCT.</s><s>Visually comparing multiple examinations is extremely laborious and time-consuming, particularly in the case of diffuse pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary emphysema.</s><s>Quantitative CT (qCT) should enable the use of time-saving, automated analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>It can allow the objective and reproducible assessment of clinical follow-up examinations and scientific studies, thereby offering considerable advantages over descriptive image evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> As MDCT continued to gain prevalence, volumetric datasets with isotropic voxels became increasingly available, which constitute the basis of qCT.</s><s>Since then, researchers around the world have been studying the automated segmentation of the lower airways <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> and quantitative analysis of the lung parenchyma [4, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref>.</s><s>With qCT, areas of the lungs with increased air content and consecutively reduced density can be quantified and presented graphically based on the HU values of the voxels.</s><s>The different techniques of (semi)automatic segmentation and analysis of lung parenchyma have been thoroughly described in multiple studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref>.</s><s>The analytic methods common today are mostly threshold value-based, i. e. all voxels below a threshold value are viewed as emphysematous lung parenchyma <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</s><s>The specific threshold value of the emphysema, i. e. that value at which the volumes with lower CT density than emphysematous lung tissue are defined, is primarily set between -910 HU <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> and -950 HU <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>.</s><s>The so-called pixel index is defined as the portion in percent (%) that the voxels below the threshold value constitute of the voxels of the entire pulmonary volume and is also referred to as "emphysema score" when used to emphysema.</s><s>• " Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows a graphic representation of the distribution of the "emphysematous voxels" within the lungs shown in semitransparent view.</s><s>The 15 th percentile of median lung density is considered to be another important parameter (PD15) <ref type="bibr">[42, 45 -47]</ref>.</s><s>It is ascertained by plotting the density values of all pulmonary voxels in a histogram showing frequency distributions.</s><s>The advantage it has over pixel index (or emphysema score) is that it is affected very little by changes in lung volume, as can be caused by fibrotic processes, for example.</s><s>Several authors argue that this parameter is thus more suitable for longitudinal studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>.</s><s>According to method employed, however, both parameters depend considerably on examination technique, reconstruction parameters and the inspiration depth of the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>The introduction of subsequent volume correction while factoring in the particular quantified lung volume can, however, reduce the influence of changing inspiration depths and increase the reproducibility of these parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48]</ref>.</s><s>A clinically robust software must function not only on healthy lungs, but must also accurately detect pathological and iatrogenic changes in pulmonary anatomy.</s><s>Precise segmentation of the tracheobronchial system is helpful, since respiratory air contained in the bronchia can otherwise be falsely interpreted as emphysema volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.</s><s>For this purpose, most methods employ a region-growing procedure starting from an initial point in the trachea, as described by Selle et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>, and then subtract the volume of the air-filled airways.</s><s>Other factors influencing qCT are patient age, inspiration depth during examination and technical parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>.</s><s>Because there were no suitable software solutions in the early 2000 s, the first clinical studies on ELVR employed only a visual evaluation for selecting a suitable target lobe for the minimally invasive therapy.</s><s>To our knowledge there</s></p><p><s>has not yet been a study definitively proving a clinical advantage of an existing software-supported evaluation.</s><s>However, the use of lobe-separated volumetry and emphysema analysis in planning therapy prior to ELVR is now technically possible and is seeing increased use in clinical studies.</s><s>A lobe-separated volumetry and emphysema analysis can currently be performed only following prior detection of the lobe margins, since the individual lobes are separate from one another and must be analyzed as separate volumes.</s><s>The first simple methods for automatically detecting and segmenting the lobe margins relied exclusively on the CT density of the individual voxels in the volumetric data sets to detect the contours of fissures directly.</s><s>However, this is considerably complicated by the expansion, incompleteness or full absence of fissures <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s>Pulmonary diseases can influence the appearance of fissures in a wide variety of ways.</s><s>In addition, adjacent space occupations, atelectasis and emphysematous areas can cause additional problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s>For such reasons, these early programs yielded primarily unsatisfactory results and required time-consuming manual corrections.</s><s>Modern methods are therefore based on the principle of avoiding any dependency on the existence and visibility of fissures <ref type="bibr"

is usually sufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>In their current article examining 96 patients with emphysema, Van Rikxoort et al. compare the results of automated segmentation of fissures performed  by modern software versus a visual consensus read performed by three experienced radiologists, likewise finding acceptable agreement <ref type="bibr"

prove its effectiveness, it could render the previous approaches obsolete.</s><s>Several major CT equipment manufactures now offer software solutions for CT volumetry and quantification of

lungs exhibiting air trapping in the expiration series <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> are more poorly ventilated due to the bronchial obstruction during expiration.</s><s>For optimized automated CT volumetry, it is expedient to resort to "soft" kernels given the associated image noise and "hard" kernels for visual analysis of the lobe fissures given the superior image contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>.</s><s>For CT volumetry, certain examinations must generally be performed using non-contrast methods to prevent, for one, changes in density resulting from the contrast medium containing iodine.</s><s>Discontinuous CT examinations with incomplete datasets are unsuited for CT volumetry and quantifying emphysema and should no longer be used for these indications.</s><s>Current literature is nearly devoid of binding recommendations on the CT radiation dose to be used.</s><s>In most existing studies, however, examination protocols with high tube voltage (generally 120 kV) were implemented.</s><s>When performing evaluation prior to potential LVR, malignant pulmonary tumors that frequently appear in COPD patients must be excluded.</s><s>Insofar as an evaluation CT reveals suspicious intrapulmonary space occupations, therapy must be postponed and a follow-up examination must be performed after adequate time has elapsed.</s><s>The obscuring of a malignant tumor by post-interventional dystelectases must be avoided by all means.</s><s>Even more difficult is the detection of pathologies of the tracheobronchial system, which are likewise frequently observed in COPD patients and, in many cases, can be more clinically serious than emphysema.</s><s>For example, bronchopathy with severe tracheobronchial collapse can be easily overlooked in CT or (rigid) bronchoscopic exams.</s><s>Targeted flexible bronchoscopy or a dynamic 4D-CT scan performed under continuous respiration may confirm a diagnosis of this type <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>.</s><s>Post-interventional follow-up examinations using medical imaging following LVR are extremely important.</s><s>Radiographic and CT examinations are able to rule out complications such as pneumothorax, pneumonia and material dislocations in treated patients.</s><s>Quantitative CT allows changes in volume in the treated area of the lung to be reproducibly and validly monitored, with measureable target lobe volume reduction (TLVR) having become the most important parameter.</s><s>Improved clinical function, however, is the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of a lung volume reduction procedure.</s><s>In most studies, this clinical success is tested and documented using the 6-minute walk distance test [6MWD], spirometric lung function test parameters (in particular FEV 1 ) and questionnaires such as the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) or other suitable methods.</s><s>As of this time, quantifying CT volumetry has only served to provide objectivation of therapy monitoring in studies and does not constitute a clinical standard.</s><s>Insofar as EBV have been implanted, it is additionally necessary to monitor their position given the fact that respiratory excursion and heavy coughing can cause the valves to loosen and become dislocated.</s><s>In this case it is also necessary to thoroughly evaluate the contralateral lung, since it is quite possible for a coughed out valve to be aspirated into the contralateral side.</s><s>Finally, it is necessary to identify any valves that are correctly located yet displaced by mucus and subsequently verify these findings bronchoscopically, since these valves may not be functioning and may a focus of infection ( • " Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>).</s><s>If defective valves are identified, the attending pulmonologist must be notified so that a repositioning or replacement can be performed.</s><s>As another imaging method, perfusion MRI has provided highly promising results in experimental studies.</s><s>Ley-Zaporozhan et al. observed, for example, a "high correlation" between parenchymal destruction detected by CT and reduced perfusion in perfusion MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.</s><s>However, this method currently has no relevant significance in routine clinical practice.</s><s>While classic ventilation/perfusions-scintigraphy as a nuclear medicine method can detect diffuse abnormalities of peripheral pulmonary vascularization, it is substantially limited in terms of spatial resolution.</s><s>The considerable improvements achieved in computer-based CT image data a- nalysis has significantly reduced the relevance of scintigraphy in recent years.</s><s>As a functional examination, however, scintigraphy continues to be warranted even after the introduction of qCT when searching for heterogeneously distributed and especially hyperventilated areas of the lungs, since it can display very likely local differences an can aid in therapy planning when compared against CT.</s><s>Today, scintigraphy is used to decide whether LVR is justified.</s><s>In addition, the wide availability of this examination method is certainly an advantage.</s><s>Ventilation/perfusion-SPECT (V/P single-photon emission computed tomography) is known as a method for diagnosing pulmonary embolisms, among other conditions.</s><s>V/P-SPECT was also used in multiple studies to detect and grade pulmonary emphysema <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr"

populations have confirmed the normal incompleteness of the minor right fissure.</s><s>IF therefore is not the exception and cannot be regarded as pathological.</s><s>The frequency of IF in emphysema patients is approximately the same as that of the healthy population.</s><s>Van Rikxoort et al. ascertained, for example using automated CT analysis of the fissures, the respective frequencies of IF in 96 emphysema patients to be 33 % (left fissure), 51 % (major right fissure) and 85 % (minor right fissure) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>.</s><s>IF is present if CT shows &lt; 90 % of

better clinical results in patients with complete fissures and heterogeneous, lobe-focused pulmonary emphysema <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>A complete fissure therefore appears to

justifiably point out that, given the continued lack of any long-term studies and the relevant complication rates, ELVR with EBV is still an experimental therapy method outside evidence-based guidelines, and therefore demands an extremely critical indication procedure and should not be employed lightly.</s><s>Despite the state of research still being insufficient in many regards, particularly concerning post-interventional long-term survival, a relatively high number of patients are currently being treated with ELVR techniques in Germany.</s><s>This is due to the fact that

that all segments of a pulmonary lobe be closed.</s><s>In addition, the presence of CV must be evaluated prior to the implantation of endobronchial valves.</s><s>This can be performed either by means of bronchoscopic function testing with the Chartis system or through visual analysis of the completeness of pulmonary fissures in preinterventional CT exams.</s><s>Both methods have proven themselves independently of one another in multiple studies and, in the few comparative studies, have yielded equivalent results in terms of predicting the success of therapy.</s><s>An automated evaluation of the completeness of fissures, which would save both time and resources, would be desirable.</s><s>Currently, however, this method does not function robustly and is used only in an experimental capacity.</s><s>Medical imaging following LVR is extremely important.</s><s>Radiographic and CT examinations are usually able to reliably identify immediately peri-interventional complications such as pneumothorax, pneumonia and material dislocations.</s><s>Another round of imaging would appear to be expedient following an appropriate interval for each individual method and as soon as the onset of therapy can be assumed.</s><s>CT can detect late complications typical for the procedures, such as air fistulae and suture insufficiency with LVRS, ventilation dislocation with EBV, material rupture with LVRC and prolonged inflammatory reactions with BTVA.</s><s>Quantitative CT facilitates objectivation of the volume reduction in the target lobe, thus allowing comparison with the development of
