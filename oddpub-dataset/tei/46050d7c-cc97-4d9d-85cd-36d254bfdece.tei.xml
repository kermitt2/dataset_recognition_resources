<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objective this report aims to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics (pK) and efficacy of subcutaneous golimumab in active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyJIA).</s><s>Methods In this three-part randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled withdrawal trial, all patients received open-label golimumab (30 mg/m 2 of body surface area; maximum: 50 mg/dose) every 4 weeks together with weekly methotrexate during part 1 (weeks 0-16).</s><s>patients with at least 30% improvement per American College of rheumatology Criteria for JIA (JIA ACr30) in part 1 entered the double-blinded part 2 (weeks 16-48) after 1:1 randomisation to continue golimumab or start placebo.</s><s>In part 3, golimumab was continued or could be restarted as in part 1. the primary outcome was JIA flares in part 2; secondary outcomes included JIA ACr50/70/90 responses, clinical remission, pK and safety.</s><s>results Among 173 patients with polyJIA enrolled, 89.0% (154/173) had a JIA ACr30 response and 79.2%/65.9%/36.4% demonstrated JIA ACr50/70/90 responses in part 1.</s><s>At week 48, the primary endpoint was not met as treatment groups had comparable JIA flare rates (golimumab vs placebo: 32/78=41% vs 36/76=47%; p=0.41), and rates of clinical remission were comparable (golimumab vs placebo: 10/78=12.8%</s><s>vs 9/76=11.8%).</s><s>Adverse event and serious adverse event rates were similar in the treatment groups during part 2. Injection site reactions occurred with &lt;1% of all injections.</s><s>pK analysis confirmed adequate golimumab dosing for polyJIA.</s><s>Conclusion Although the primary endpoint was not met, golimumab resulted in rapid, clinically meaningful, improvement in children with active polyJIA.</s><s>Golimumab was well tolerated, and no unexpected safety events occurred.</s></p></div>
