high relevance in cancer invasion and metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>In parallel to the classical analysis of CM, we also investigated the ER/Golgi fraction, representing the path of proteins on their way to be secreted <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>As recently demonstrated and also shown in our analysis, this latter method is of lower enrichment efficiency for bona fide secreted proteins in comparison to the analysis of CM, nevertheless, it can provide new information and highly complementary results to the latter (CM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Even though one cannot rule out the possibility that some of the observed differences (or overlaps) between protein identifications from different fractions may reflect sub-optimal enrichment and/ or differences in starting protein amounts (e.g. 5 μ g for CE, 3.5 μ g for ER/Golgi and 3.75 μ g for CM analyzed by LC-MS/MS -Methods), the overall specificity of the employed techniques is supported by the Signal IP analysis   and respective analysis of protein abundance per fraction (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the overall enrichment efficiency in our study is in line with previously published reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> using various BCa cell line models.</s><s>A high overlap between the reported identifications in our study and the existing literature was observed, further supporting the validity of the reported findings.</s><s>Specifically, our shotgun analysis enabled detection of the majority (at least 69%) of proteins identified in previous proteomics studies of total cell proteome from T24M vs. T24 31 and T24T vs. T24 30 cells.</s><s>Along the same lines, the majority of proteins previously identified in CM from T24M and/or T24 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> were also found in our analysis.</s><s>These multiple existing studies serve as reference points, nevertheless their findings remain disparate and any potential added value from the parallel proteomic analysis of different cell compartments can be assessed with moderate confidence only.</s></p><p><s>As the first step in this direction, and to establish the relevance of each individual proteomics dataset, we evaluated our main findings in the context of the existing literature.</s><s>We used a manually curated database of features (genes, transcripts, proteins) associated with BCa invasion/ progression (BcCluster) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Importantly, BcCluster lists molecules highlighted from studies with sample size of at least 50, suggesting a high validity of the collected features.</s><s>The second dataset contains the list of the BCa-associated molecules retrieved using the GLAD4U <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> tool, without any sample size selection criteria.</s><s>The two datasets appear to be highly complementary, with an overlap of 179 features, (corresponding to over 25% of features from each literature set), further supporting the assumption that these two approaches provide a good and comprehensive reflection of the current knowledge.</s><s>It should be noted, that these literature data used as reference in our study include entries reported from different -omics (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics) as well as non-omics (e.g.</s><s>immunohistochemistry) studies, apparently collected under different applied methodologies.</s><s>Investigation of the inter-laboratory variability reflected in these databases would be out of the realm of this study, nevertheless it is expected that this exists.</s><s>Even though the latter clearly compromises comparability of different studies, on a positive note, it may also be used as a means to increase confidence in individual findings, based on their detection in multiple studies and under different protocols.</s><s>Along these lines, multiple observed protein changes included in the individual datasets (CE, ER/Golgi, CM) had already been reported in the context of BCa invasion/ progression or metastasis.</s><s>Independently of the source of literature data, as aforementioned (Results), overlap ranged from approximately 7 to 15% depending on the applied proteomics strategy.</s></p><p><s>Taking this one step further, an integration of -omics datasets from different molecular levels (proteomicstranscriptomics) was also performed.</s><s>For almost all proteins identified by LC-MS/MS, we were able to obtain the corresponding mRNA, which strongly supports the reliability of the protein identification process.</s><s>Even though, in general a moderate correlation between mRNA and protein expression is reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> , the regulation trend was well supported by the transcriptomic analysis for many of the differentially expressed proteins (210 out of 614 (34%); notably for 344 transcripts a &gt;1.5-fold change was not reached, whereas only 57 exhibited opposite trend of expression in the T24M vs T24 cells).</s><s>It should be noted that the presented transcriptomic analysis has some limitations, mostly as a result of the high costs of the next generation sequencing analysis, resulting in a low number of analysed samples (n = 2 per cell line) hampering the application of proper statistical analysis.</s></p><p><s>Through the application of transcriptomics, which complements but also verifies proteomics findings, an increase in the number (from 89 up to 253) of cross-validated features obtained in the three individual proteomics experiments could be achieved.</s></p><p><s>The reliability of these latter "cross-validated" proteins was further evaluated in the context of available literature.</s><s>An improvement in the agreement with existing literature data is observed (as described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>), indicating the applicability and value of such a multi-omics approach to verify large scale proteomics data.</s><s>Of these 253 features, 33 (13.0%</s><s>BcCluster) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> or 40 (15.8%</s><s>Glad4U) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> have been associated with BCa/ BCa invasion or metastasis.</s><s>This corresponds to approximately a 5% increase in the overlapping features when compared with the respective overlap of all 614 differentially abundant proteins, identified across the three proteomics experiments.</s><s>This increase appears to be significant, considering that the "verified" dataset consists of a lower number of proteins (253) compared to the combined "all differentially expressed proteins" dataset (614).</s><s>In other words, the presented strategy facilitates shortlisting more confident findings, which currently range from the small number (regularly less than 10) of verified findings via typical targeted analysis, to the whole list of differentially expressed features per omics experiment (regularly prone to many false positives).</s><s>The described cross-omics comparison offers the valuable intermediate step between these two extremes, allowing to maximize extraction of features of increased confidence for their further use as input data in systems biology approaches.</s></p><p><s>As an example in this direction, pathway analysis was conducted.</s><s>IL-8 signaling was selected, as being predicted (at high significance levels) to be affected based on all, literature mined datasets as well as individual proteomics datasets (CE, ER/Golgi and CM).</s><s>As presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the integrative analysis of -omics data provided a fairly comprehensive molecular phenotype underlying the pleiotropic effects of IL-8 function: The up-regulation of IL-8 in the T24M cells was associated with an up-regulation of matrix metalloproteases (MMP2), implicated in tumor invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , as well as VEGFC and ICAM1, factors implicated in angiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the overexpression of MMP2 was accompanied by the down regulation of TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 (identified in CM analysis), further supporting the activation of MMPs in the context of BCa invasion.</s><s>Even more: data integration from the different preparation methods (CE, ER/Golgi, CM) links disparate observations revealing events in cases not associated with BCa yet.</s><s>As shown on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, formation of chemosynapse is predicted based on the observed proteomics changes (involvement of VASP, LASP-1), with anticipated impact on focal adhesion and cell migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>In addition, interestingly, involvement of PLD3, a non-classical member (as it lacks lipase activity) of the phospholipase D family of enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> is predicted.</s><s>PLD enzymes have been implicated as key components of HRAS signaling in cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> -with, notably, HRAS also detected at different levels in T24M versus T24 cells, based on the proteomics analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>In addition, PLD3 has been recently shown to be involved in hypoxia-induced lipid metabolism in colorectal cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> , suggesting collectively, that it merits further investigation in BCa.</s><s>In parallel to these effects, IL-8 signaling also occurs through G protein coupled receptors, specifically in our system, through Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma-12 (GNG12), not studied in BCa yet.</s><s>Impacts on regulation of calcium channels are expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>Of note, some calcium channels were found at differential levels in the T24M versus T24 cells based on the proteomics analysis e.g.</s><s>Plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase 1 (CE and ER/Golgi), Calcium-binding mitochondrial carrier protein SCaMC-1 (CE)-Supplementary Dataset S2.</s></p><p><s>Collectively, through the proposed combined analysis of multiple cellular fractions and molecular levels, these multi-level pleiotropic effects of IL-8 previously described in different publications (reviewed by Waugh et al) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> can be better reflected at the molecular level, encompassing changes at the extracellular space (e.g.</s><s>IL-8 differential abundance), all the way to the nucleus (e.g.</s><s>changes on Bax; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>There is no doubt that multiple missing links still exist nevertheless, such an approach obviously increases coverage (hence confidence), but also facilitates definition of targets for further verification.</s><s>To better explain this point, the example of the VASP, a protein involved in cytoskeleton remodeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> and not yet associated with BCa was provided.</s><s>Being differentially expressed in the ER/Golgi fraction (only), VASP was not included in the shortlisted proteins (i.e. the 253 cross-verified findings).</s><s>Nevertheless, based on its biological relevance to the IL-8 pathway, the chances that this finding from the ER/Golgi analysis was not a false association increased.</s><s>Indeed, by using western blot analysis, our preliminary results further supported the down-regulation of VASP in muscle invasive BCa, a finding which we currently further investigate.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our study collectively shows that comparative and in parallel analysis of multiple -omics (in our case: proteins identified in CE, ER/Golgi and CM and also at a different omics level -transcriptomics) has added value on two very important aspects; it can improve proteome coverage and fill missing links, through the complementarity of different techniques.</s><s>Even more, it can increase validity of individual observations, by cross-omics correlations, facilitating prioritization of findings and ultimately knowledge extraction.</s><s>Considering the general low statistical power of individual -omics investigations (high number of variables, small sample sizes) such a cross-omics and platform analysis appears a safe way forward particularly towards development of disease molecular models based on valid experimental observations.</s></p></div>
