<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach</head><p><s>We developed a method to reconstruct and visualize complex pedigree structures for any given number of individuals that is based on likelihood ratios of different models of relationship types for any combination of two samples (dyad).</s><s>For any possible dyad we test the following models of kinship: The different degrees of relationship reflect the expected values for the proportion of the genome that is shared between two individuals.</s><s>This can also be expressed by the coefficient of relationship which defines the probability that an allele at an arbitrary locus in the genome originates from the same common ancestor <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Wright, 1922)</ref>.</s><s>For instance, we would expect that a parent and a child as well as siblings share 50% of their genetic material and thus the same coefficient of relationships.</s><s>In second order relationships as e.g. in a grandparent-grandchild, or uncle-nephew dyad only 25% of the alleles are identical by descent (IBD), in an outbred population.</s><s>On the contrary, in highly inbred populations and consanguineous marriages the expected coefficients of relationship of 0.5 and 0.25 may deviate upwards substantially.</s><s>In the following we will also use the coefficient of relationship to discriminate between different degrees of kinship and refer to parent-child and full siblings as first-order relationship and classify half-siblings, grandparentgrandchild and aunt/uncle-nephew/niece as second-order relationships.</s><s>Additionally we are defining the model technical/biological replicates to identify samples that have a relationship coefficient close to 1, which is either the case if the same sample has been processed twice or if two samples are from identical twins.</s><s>For each possible dyad all these models are tested and compared to a null hypothesis that assumes the individuals are unrelated, which is explained in more detail in the next section.</s><s>The computation of the probabilities of all hypotheses requires knowledge about the expected allele frequencies in a population.</s><s>In this work, if an allele was observed at least once in the 1000 genomes project <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Altshuler et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) we use the respective frequency.</s><s>The most likely relatedness class is then identified by the largest likelihood ratio among all hypotheses for one dyad.</s><s>We provide a tool for our algorithm that works on genotype data presented in VCF format <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Danecek et al., 2011)</ref> and that generates an intermediate output that we refer to as extended ped format: for each individual the most likely relationships to the remaining individuals are recorded.</s><s>In addition to mother and father, also children and sibling relationships are listed (see Supplementary Materials).</s><s>An R Script takes the predicted classes of relationship as input and visualizes the result in a pedigree graph.</s><s>We tested our method on family exome data from the 1000 genomes project (referred to as 1KG data in the following), as well as on in-house data.</s><s>For the systematic analysis of performance at different degrees of inbreeding as well as increasing degrees of error rates we also simulated samples based on sequencing data from real individuals.</s><s>The java application, as well as the visualizing R script, is integrated in GeneTalk <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kamphans et al., 2013)</ref>, and also available as a standalone application at www.gene-talk.de/vcf2ped.</s><s>We analyzed the performance of our approach for a decreasing number of exomic and genomic markers.</s><s>For exomic markers that are mostly unlinked we achieved high accuracy for all relationships (first and second order) with a minimum of 10 000 markers.</s><s>The same accuracy can be achieved with a comparable number of genomic markers when randomly distributed over the genome (data not shown).</s></p></div>

A similar kinship coefficient is also the reason why the LR values for parent-child and full siblings are nearly on the same level for the comparisons LRðH 3 ; H 0 Þ and LRðH 2 ; H 0 Þ.</s><s>This leads to the overall rule: the discriminatory power to distinguish between different hypotheses gets lower if the underlying assumed relationship types become more similar.</s></p><p><s>Especially with increasing error rates the identification of identical twins/technical replicates becomes more difficult as the expected kinship coefficient of one drop.</s><s>Although all simulated replicates form a distinct cluster in the comparison of LRðH 1 ; H 0 Þ in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, there are three dyads (*) that yield a LR &lt; 0. These false classifications can be avoided if the error rate e is adjusted appropriately.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Precision depends on the number of markers and heterozygosity</head><p><s>We analyzed the effect of the number of variants on the precision of the classification process by reducing the amount of markers.</s></p><p><s>Besides restricting to smaller randomly chosen subsets we also studied the performance for subsets of loci with high heterozygosity.</s><s>Such subsets are more similar to the markers used in SNP-arrays and allow a comparison with existing tools.</s><s>Heterozygosity is defined as h ¼ 1 À P n f 2 n and relates to the information content of a marker.</s><s>The average heterozygosity of a SNV in our exome data was 0.3.</s><s>In contrast most existing tools use polymorphic sites with considerably larger h.</s><s>The positive predictive value (precision) of parent-child and full sibling comparisons starts to drop when using &lt;500 randomly selected markers (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>The correct assignment of secondorder relationships requires substantially more markers for a comparable precision.</s><s>However, the performance for the second-order classifications is good for whole exome sequencing data comprising several thousands of variants.</s><s>Only a reduction to fewer loci, as encountered in gene panels, will lead to an excess of false positive predictions and therefore to lower precision values.</s><s>Especially the number of unrelated dyads that are erroneously classified as secondorder increases.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that increasing the heterozygosity of these small marker sets might improve the precision.</s><s>When choosing only loci with a heterozygosity above average, the precision for all relationship models increased (unfilled shapes in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>This is in good agreement with the results from other studies that achieved a high precision for predictions that were based on markers with high information content <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Epstein et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>The most polymorphic site accessible via exome sequencing is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) cluster on chromosome 6 with more than 15 000 different alleles known up to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Robinson et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Recently, bioinformatics tools became available that allow HLA typing from exome data and can be used additionally to rule out relatedness in questionable dyads <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Szolek et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However, a general comparison between the predictive power of multiple biallelic markers such as most SNVs and a single polymorphic marker such as the HLA shows that the discriminatory power is limited: Assuming equal likelihoods Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Comparison of the mean likelihood ratio LR per position for different relationships between pairs of individuals (dyads).</s><s>The likelihood for all relationship models H i versus the null hypothesis (not related) were computed for all dyads from the 1000 genomes project and additional family data.</s><s>LRs of all dyads that are not related are depicted as background distribution (gray violin plots) whereas dyads with a relationship are illustrated as circles.</s><s>The true relationship is color-coded and maximazes the LR for the correct hypothesis.</s><s>Exemplarily this is shown for a dyad of each relationship (crosses).</s><s>However, misclassifications can occur especially in replicate identification for low-quality samples with a high genotyping error rate (orange asterix) (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)</s></p><p><s>for all alleles, the information content, IC ¼ À P n f n log 10 f n , of 10 unlinked biallelic markers (n ¼ 2) would be comparable to the IC of the HLA locus (n ¼ 15 000).</s></p><p><s>The contributions of the different genotype combinations to the log-likelihood ratios also depend on the heterozygosity.</s><s>For instance in LRðH 3 ;

(2014)</ref>.</s><s>As expected, the simulated offspring with closely related parents show higher individual inbreeding coefficients.</s><s>These higher inbreeding factors correlate with lower likelihood ratios between relationship models of the same order, such as parent-child versus siblings (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>When using entire exome data sets a correct classification was still possible for all tested cases, even for families with a high degree of consanguinity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p><s>In this work, we analyzed the performance of reconstructing family structures with genotype data that become available in NGS studies, including rare variants.</s><s>We were able to derive pedigrees with high precision for publicly available samples of families, as well as for inhouse data, even for as little as a few hundred markers.</s><s>Our method is based on comparisons between likelihood ratios for different kinship classes and-as expected-the closer the coefficients of relationship were between two models, the more difficult it became to differentiate between them.</s><s>The most challenging discrimination is between unrelated individuals in a highly inbred population and samples that are related by second-order relationship.</s><s>So far highly polymorphic marker loci such as microsatellites have been used in paternity testing and to detect distant relationships.</s><s>However, ancestry can also effectively be identified with the use of rare and family specific single nucleotide variants.</s><s>We observed the biggest variance in likelihood ratios for all dyads for the comparison of the hypothesis H 3 , H 0 (parent-child $ unrelated).</s><s>One drawback of our approach is that different quality levels of the data are not considered.</s><s>We simulated technical replicates with a high error rate by decreasing the coverage per base in the alignments and studied the influence on the classification process.</s><s>Some replicates with a large difference in coverage and quality were misclassified as full siblings instead of technical replicates, as visualized in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (violet dots for LRðH 1 ; H 2 Þ).</s><s>With decreasing coverage, the error rates-especially for heterozygous calls-increase.</s><s>However, the site-specific error probabilities that are reported by standard genotype callers are usually vastly underestimated for rare variants.</s><s>Allegedly small error rates pose a problem especially in the identification of replicates.</s><s>Another approach to estimate genotyping errors on exome variant lists, that also considers allele frequencies from population studies, reported a mean genotyping error rate of e ¼ 0.001 as more accurate for most current exomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Heinrich et al., 2013)</ref>.This error rate also yielded the best performance in our tests and is therefore suggested as a default setting.</s><s>The consequences of an unsuitable choice of this parameter on the likelihood ratios are discussed in more detail in the supporting information.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we have shown that genotype data from NGS studies can also be used to deduce pedigree information with high precision.</s><s>Our approach doesn't require any additional generation of data and will thus be easy to integrate into existing analysis pipelines.</s><s>This will help to identify sample mix-ups at an early stage and improve the overall quality in the diagnostic procedure.</s></p></div>
