<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Role of the periosteum in magnesium-induced bone formation</head><p><s>We first used a nonfractured femur model to confirm the osteogenic effect of magnesium.</s><s>We surgically implanted either a 99.99%-pure magnesium rod or, as a control, a stainless steel rod into the medullary cavity of the intact femur in rats.</s><s>At week 2 after surgery, µXray fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-d</ref>) and scanning electron microscopy (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e-h</ref>) revealed a remarkably higher magnesium concentration in the cortical bone and bone-periosteum junction of the magnesium-implanted femora, as compared to that of the controls, which suggests the diffusion of magnesium from the implant across the bone toward the periosteum.</s><s>Meanwhile, H&amp;E staining and calcein labeling showed a substantially larger amount of new bone formation, mainly at the peripheral cortex, in magnesium-implanted femora, as compared to the controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Micro-computed tomography (CT) measurements confirmed significantly higher total bone tissue volume (TV), high-density bone volume (BV) and ρ-moment of inertia (ρMOI) in magnesium-implanted femora, as compared to that in controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To evaluate the role of the periosteum in magnesium-induced new-bone formation, we surgically removed the periosteum when magnesium rods were implanted.</s><s>As a result, new bone was no longer formed at regions where the periosteum had been removed successfully, and was instead found only at peripheral cortex that contained residual periosteum, as shown by both radiographs and micro-CT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CGRP is involved in magnesium-induced bone formation</head><p><s>To test the possible role of sensory nerves in the periosteum in the osteogenic effect of magnesium, we destroyed the sensory nerves by injecting high-dose capsaicin into the dorsal spine in rats, as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Consequently, the degree of magnesium-induced new-bone formation was significantly lower than that in the group without capsaicin treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d,e</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, similarly to the effect of implanted magnesium rods, the injection of MgCl 2 (10 mM in a volume of 100 µl, daily for 3 d) directly at one side of the L3-L5 lumbar spine also induced new bone formation at the peripheral cortex of the ipsilateral femur (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>In magnesium-implanted femora at week 2 after surgery, immunofluorescence staining showed abundant CGRP in peripheral cortical bone, whereas in controls, only scattered CGRP labeling was found (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>ELISA analysis showed that the concentration of CGRP in bone tissues was higher after magnesium implantation, which peaked at day 4 with a value eight-fold higher than the controls, and was lower at day 7 and 14, as compared to day 4, but the values were still two-fold higher than the controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>In addition, at week 2 after surgery, substantially higher expression of CGRP was also found in L4 DRGs in rats with magnesium implantation, as compared to the controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also measured the concentrations of other sensory neuropeptides, including substance P, neurokinins and galanin, in implanted femora, given that beneficial effects on bone healing have also been reported for these <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>ELISA analysis showed that the concentration of substance P was higher by approximately one-fold at day 4, whereas neurokinin K and galanin were not notably different after magnesium implantation, as compared to the control group (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that CGRP might be the predominant neuropeptide contributing to magnesium-induced bone formation.</s><s>To test this idea, we injected BIBN4096BS (BIBN, 750 µg/ml in a volume of 100 µl, every other day), a CGRPreceptor antagonist, into rat femora in conjunction with magnesium implantation, which resulted in substantially lower TV and BV values in magnesium-implanted femora than in the

present study has provided compelling evidence from findings both in vitro and in vivo for a contribution of magnesium to the robust promotion of bone formation and enhancement of fracture healing with the underlying mechanisms elucidated.</s><s>To a great extent, the beneficial effects of magnesium are mediated by CGRP, a neuropeptide released from the sensory neuronal endings in the periosteum of the long-bone shaft.</s><s>Although it has long been known that the central nervous system has an important role in the regulation of bone formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> , the exact role of sensory nerves in this process has remained elusive.</s><s>Here a previously unrecognized CGRPmediated cross-talk pathway between peripheral nerves and PDSCs has been identified as a major mechanism underlying magnesium-induced bone formation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A few points from our findings support the involvement of CGRP sensory nerves in the beneficial effects of magnesium.</s><s>First, magnesium-induced bone formation was largely reduced by destroying the sensory nerves or by removal of the periosteum, where a large number of sensory nerves exist.</s><s>Second, magnesium induced abundant expression of neuron-derived CGRP in the newly formed bone.</s><s>Studies on DRG neuronal cultures suggest that such an effect of Mg 2+ on CGRP occurs through (i) MAGT1-and TRPM7-mediated Mg 2+ -entry into neurons and (ii) Mg 2+ -facilitated CGRP-vesicle aggregation at synapses, probably by promoting actin polymerization.</s><s>Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of the CGRP receptor in vivo or the silencing of its related genes (Calcrl or Ramp1) attenuated the new bone formation induced by magnesium implants (magnesium rod or Mg-IMN), whereas overexpression of Calcrl or Ramp1 in vivo enhanced the beneficial effects of magnesium implants.</s><s>Of note, in addition to constituting the CGRP receptor with RAMP1, CALCRL can also be co-expressed with RAMP2 to form a receptor for amylin, which is known to inhibit bone resorption <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>However, gene manipulation of Calcrl or Ramp1 showed similar effects on Mg-induced bone formation, which suggests the involvement of CGRP instead of amylin.</s><s>Moreover, in isolated PDSCs, the key cell type involved in osteogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , CGRP promoted osteogenic differentiation through CGRP-receptor-coupled cAMP activation of CREB1 and SP7, transcription factors essential to osteogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>Of note, our results both in vitro and in vivo suggest that CGRP or magnesium implant only upregulates SP7 but not RUNX2, another downstream target of CREB1 important for osteogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , which suggests the specific activation of CREB1 and SP7, leading to osteogenic differentiation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d</ref>).</s><s>Further study is required to understand why RUNX2 is not responsive to magnesium or CGRP and whether other reported CREB1-regulated pathways (for example, BMP2, Wnt/β-catenin) are involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Taken together, these results are consistent with previous

type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s><s>Sensory nerves secrete CGRP and promote callus formation and bone remodeling, whereas a lack of CGRP + nerve fibers leads to delayed union or nonunion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, the presently identified role of magnesium in promoting CGRP-mediated osteogenesis has suggested its therapeutic implication in the repair of osteoporotic bone fracture or other bone diseases.</s><s>Nevertheless, whether a magnesium implant or CGRP influences other cell types, such as chondrocytes, to contribute to osteogenesis awaits further investigation.</s><s>It would also be important to test whether systemic administration of magnesium (such as oral pills) would promote CGRP mobilization and thus be a potential nutraceutical method for bone disorders.</s></p><p><s>A progression of the present study would be the development of a Mg-IMN system to provide both mechanical support and osteogenic benefits for repairing long-bone fracture.</s><s>It is known that closed-bone fracture is commonly seen in patients with osteoporosis, the socalled low-energy osteoporotic fractures.</s><s>As a proof-of-concept experiment, we used a closed-fracture model where the injury is limited to the fractured bone, with no injury to the periosteum.</s><s>In addition, Mg-IMN was implanted with the drilled holes adjacent to the fracture line, ensuring that the released Mg 2+ is delivered mostly to the wound.</s><s>As expected, higher magnesium content was detected in peripheral fracture callus in the Mg-IMN group than in the IMN group.</s><s>The way in which the released Mg 2+ is transported to the periosteal region can be explained by the diameter of Mg 2+ (&lt;300 pm) being much smaller than that of Harversian's or Volkmann's canals within the cortical bone (in microscale level), as reported in our earlier study <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s><s>In addition, Mg 2+ might diffuse through the fracture gaps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The outcome seen here with Mg-IMN treatment is promising.</s><s>First, Mg-IMN accelerated bone remodeling, as indicated by significant increases in callus, BV and the ratio of xylenol/ calcein osteoid staining at an early stage (week 4).</s><s>Second, mechanical strength is improved by Mg-IMN.</s><s>At week 12, although the xylenol/calcein staining ratio is lower in the Mg-IMN group than in the IMN group, probably owing to the completion of bone remodeling, a higher BMD and better lamellar bone morphology were achieved with Mg-IMN treatment, indicating greater mechanical strength than that achieved with IMN treatment.</s><s>This result is also consistent with a previous report showing better alignment of matrix collagen in Mg 2+treated cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> .</s><s>Of note, in the present study, new bone is formed mainly in the periosteal region, which, even with a small-scale increase in BV, might translate into substantial improvement in biomechanical properties (that is, bending or torsional strength), as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, biomechanical testing confirmed a much stronger mechanical property of the bone in the Mg-IMN group at the end of experimental time frame (that is, at week 12 after implantation).</s><s>In addition, the pain levels in rats with Mg-IMN treatment showed no difference relative to controls, which suggests the suitability of Mg-IMN for clinical uses.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the present study has revealed a CGRP-involved mechanism that underlies the osteogenic effects of magnesium-based implant.</s><s>An innovative Mg-IMN system has been developed and has shown therapeutic potential for bone injuries, in particular, for the commonly seen low-energy osteoporotic fracture.</s><s>With the development of specific cell or tissue targeting systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> , it might also be possible to deliver Mg 2+ or
