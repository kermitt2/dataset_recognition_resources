<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This cross-sectional survey represents the first assessment of antimicrobial prescription practices for prophylaxis in pediatric patients hospitalized worldwide.</s><s>The majority of prescriptions was for medical prophylaxis (73.4%), with only one quarter for surgical prophylaxis.</s><s>This rate was even higher in infants &lt;30 days of age (ie, 83.5%).</s><s>Among those, the 3 main indications-medical prophylaxis, prophylaxis for neonatal risk factors, and prophylaxis for maternal risk factors-accounted for 73.3% of all prescriptions (data not shown).</s><s>For half of the medical prophylaxis prescriptions in neonates (ie, 50.4%), broad-spectrum antibiotics were used (data not shown).</s><s>Despite our study's lack of regarding the specific indications for medical prophylaxis, this high rate cannot be considered evidence-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The high rate of prophylactic prescribing is similar to data shown by the 2008 European Surveillance of Antibiotic Consumption (ESAC) PPS study, which included 32 pediatric departments in 21 European countries and analyzed systemic antimicrobial prescriptions from 1799 children <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The ESAC study showed that in 171 cases, antimicrobials were given for prophylaxis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[14]</ref>, and in 66% of cases, a medical prophylaxis was the indication <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[14]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, there was a higher prevalence of medical prophylaxis in Western Europe, Australia, and North America.</s><s>This overrepresentation is likely due to the greater number of patients admitted to highly specialized tertiary-care pediatric hospitals that provide care to those with oncological or other complex underlying diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Regarding medical prophylaxis, oncological diseases were the most common underlying conditions in children ≥30 days of age.</s><s>These and other variations in practice among the regions may be explained by disparities among hospital care systems as well as by the patient case-mix in the different parts of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[15]</ref>.</s><s>In comparison to the ESAC PPS 2008 study, our study showed a lower rate of parenteral administration (46.6% vs 62.5% in 2008) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[14]</ref>.</s><s>More importantly, however, the ESAC PPS study reported route of administration at a patient level, whereas our data were based on a prescription level.</s><s>For this reason, meaningful trends cannot be deduced from comparing the two.</s><s>GARPEC (Global Antimicrobial Resistance, Prescribing, and Efficacy Among Neonates and Children) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[16]</ref>, the global follow-up study of ARPEC, will use the same PPS method.</s><s>In the future, this will

conducted among European hospitals only <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The high rate of combination therapy in our study was observed for both medical (38.9%) and prophylaxis (28.8%), with the latter percentage clearly indicating inappropriate usage.</s><s>Multiple studies in adults have shown that antibiotic combinations do not provide additional coverage and do no result in lower rates of postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">6]</ref>.</s><s>According to a study by Tamma et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[17]</ref>, even in pediatric patients with Gram-negative sepsis-a high-mortality disease-combination antibiotic therapy did not translate into a survival benefit.</s><s>Both the ASHP report and World Health Organization (WHO)'s global guidelines state that for most surgical procedures, a single-agent regimen (eg, a first-generation cephalosporin) is the preferred option <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">18]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the lack of clinical benefits offered by combination therapies, these therapies have numerous potential negative ramifications, including drug interactions, the need for drug monitoring, increased costs, and additional side effects.</s></p><p><s>The second quality indicator is the high rate of prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing worldwide.</s><s>In our study, this accounted for half the cases of both medical and surgical prophylaxis.</s><s>This prescription pattern was particularly notable in Asia (for both indications) and in Western Europe (for surgical prophylaxis).</s><s>In Asia, colonization and infection rates with multiresistant organisms are the highest in the world-a fact that may explain the higher use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in this region <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics itself is associated with an increased risk of antimicrobial resistance [1].</s><s>This is particularly true for third-and fourth-generation cephalosporins as well as for fluoroquinolones <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The third performance indicator is the prolonged (&gt;24 hour) duration of surgical prophylaxis.</s><s>In our study, 80% of surgical patients-including infants &lt;30 days as well as children ≥30 days of age-received surgical prophylaxis for &gt;1 day.</s><s>The new WHO guidelines on prevention of SSIs strongly recommend against prolonging surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) beyond a single dose due to the lack of benefit in reducing SSIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[18]</ref>.</s><s>According to WHO, prolongation should only be considered in cardiac, vascular, and orthognatic surgery for a period of up to 24 hours.</s><s>However, the quality of evidence demonstrating a beneficial effect is low to very low <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, our study protocol did not include questions about the type of surgery associated with SAP.</s><s>Although extended therapy does not decrease the risk of postsurgical infections, its prolonged use is in fact associated with adverse events and antimicrobial resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is important to recognize limitations of our study.</s><s>The study design is cross-sectional and provides a snapshot of antimicrobial prescribing practices at the hospital level.</s><s>Participation was voluntary and the researcher did not receive payment.</s><s>Both of these factors could lead to a participation bias whereby primarily highly motivated parties participated in the survey.</s><s>However, how this bias might influence the observed rates is unclear.</s><s>There are no generally accepted consensus definitions of medical prophylaxis.</s><s>For this reason, definitions of prophylaxis were not preset in the study protocol.</s><s>There is a clear overlap between medical prophylaxis for maternal or neonatal risk, early empiric therapy, and then prolonging antibiotic therapy in high-risk babies in settings with a very high prevalence of hospital-acquired infection.</s><s>However, it is clear that a consensus definition of medical prophylaxis is needed for research purposes.</s><s>Training of researchers collecting hospital data was not performed in person; rather, it was done by means of an online training tool, a frequently asked questions list, and a helpdesk.</s><s>Therefore, data accountability cannot be independently validated.</s><s>Nevertheless, data were subjected to inconsistency checking, with requests for clarification directed towards participating centers when needed.</s><s>Despite the large number of patients included in the study, it should be noted that tertiary care hospitals were overrepresented.</s><s>For this reason, the generalizability of the data for other types of pediatric hospitals cannot be guaranteed.</s><s>Moreover, geographic regions outside Europe were underrepresented.</s><s>Accordingly, findings are only representative for the hospitals captured.</s><s>Finally, but crucially, we were hampered in our determination of whether or not antibiotic classes were used appropriately by the fact that indications for prophylaxis were not specifically collected with the survey.</s></p><p><s>Although acknowledging the above limitations, we nevertheless believe our study contains several unique strengths.</s><s>The survey was global and hospitals from 41 countries participated.</s><s>A large number of patients (3400 prescriptions for prophylaxis) were eligible and included in the current analysis.</s><s>The study used a standardized protocol, which ensured uniformity of data and of conclusions to be drawn from it.</s><s>Such a standardized method facilitates comparisons among hospitals and countries, while also paving the way for longitudinal analyses when the survey becomes repeated <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the PPS method easily can be used to test the efficacy of interventions deployed for the purpose of improving prophylactic antimicrobial prescribing practices.</s><s>Finally, the PPS method may provide a vital tool for initiating and evaluating interventions that are part of an antibiotic stewardship program.</s><s>The survey method is inexpensive and therefore also feasible in resource-limited countries.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>Our study is the first PPS on prescription practices for systemic antimicrobial agents used for surgical and medical prophylaxis for pediatric patients hospitalized worldwide, and it reveals several potential targets for quality improvements.</s><s>We conclude that the following interventions are needed: (1) reduce the high rate of antimicrobial combination prescriptions, especially in medical prophylaxis; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(2)</ref> limit the high rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic usage; and (3) combat the extended duration of surgical prophylaxis.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpids/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jpids/piy019/4939181 by Universiteit Antwerpen user on 26 April 2019 for prophylactic purposes in 63.3% of patients (1420 of 2242), a combination of 2 antimicrobials in 25.7% (576 of 2242), and 3 or more agents in 11.0% (246 of 2242).</s><s>A combination of 2 or more antimicrobials was more commonly prescribed in medical prophylaxis (38.9% [615 of 1582]) than in surgical prophylaxis (28.8% [183 of 636]; risk ratio [RR], 1.391; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.199-1.613).</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
