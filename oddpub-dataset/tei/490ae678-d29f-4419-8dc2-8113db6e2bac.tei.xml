Tarr, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, objects may be represented analytically (meaning that attributes such as parts and their spatial relations are independent from each other) and stored as more abstract collections of generalized three-dimensional (3-D) parts, which allow the identification of an object from any 2-D image, and therefore independently of viewpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Biederman, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hummel &amp;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Priming effects were computed as the differences in log-transformed suppression times between the unprimed baseline condition and the four priming conditions.</s><s>To test our hypotheses, we ran two types of analyses.</s><s>First, to test whether these priming effects were significantly greater than zero, one-tailed onesample t tests were conducted separately for each priming condition.</s><s>As can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, in the main analysis the priming effects were significant for attended-intact, t(29) ¼ 6.40, p , 0.001, d ¼ 1.17; for attended-split, t(29) ¼ 4.90, p , 0.001, d ¼ 0.89; for unattended-intact, t(29) ¼ 3.10, p ¼ 0.002, d ¼ 0.57; and for unattended-split, t(29) ¼ 2.63, p ¼ 0.007, d ¼ 0.48.</s><s>Thus, the presentation of a visible prime that was related to the target presented under CFS resulted in shorter suppression times relative to the unprimed condition.</s><s>This priming effect on the conscious detection of intact objects occurred even when the primes were split and unattended.</s></p><p><s>The auxiliary analysis on the trials with successful prime identification analysis yielded a similar pattern of results.</s><s>One-tailed one-sample t tests revealed significant priming effects for attended-intact, t(28) ¼ 5.95, p , 0.001, d ¼ 1.10; for attended-split, t(28) ¼ 5.40, p , 0.001, d ¼ 1.00; for unattended-intact, t(28) ¼ 2.89, p ¼ 0.004, d ¼ 0.54; and for unattended-split, t(28) ¼ 2.63, p ¼ 0.033, d ¼ 0.36.</s></p><p><s>Second, we analyzed these priming effects using a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors prime attention (attended, unattended) and prime intactness (intact, split).</s><s>Only the main effect of attention was significant, F(1, 29) ¼ 21.07, p , 0.001, g p 2 ¼ 0.42, with larger priming effects for attended primes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The main effect of prime intactness did not reach significance, F(1, 29) ¼ 2.34, p ¼ 0.137, g p 2 ¼ 0.08, meaning that intact and split primes were similarly effective in facilitating access to awareness for intact target objects under CFS.</s><s>The interaction between attention and intactness did not approach significance, F(1, 29) ¼ 1.55, p ¼ 0.223, g p 2 ¼ 0.05, indicating that attention enhanced priming effects from intact and split objects to a similar extent.</s></p><p><s>The auxiliary analysis, including only the trials with successful prime identification, confirmed these findings.</s><s>There was only a significant main effect of attention, F(1, 28) ¼ 26.54, p , 0.001, g p 2 ¼ 0.49, but no significant main effect of prime intactness, F(1, 28) ¼ 1.04, p ¼ 0.316, g p 2 ¼ 0.04, and no significant interaction, F(1, 28) ¼ 0.27, p ¼ 0.610, g p 2 ¼ 0.01.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The current study was designed to test whether highlevel object representations facilitate the simple detection of an object and whether object detection relies on perceptual mechanisms similar to those previously found to underlie object recognition.</s><s>For this, we measured priming effects on the conscious detection of objects using a b-CFS procedure.</s><s>Relative to an unprimed baseline condition, suppression times for objects that were preceded by a related prime were significantly shorter.</s><s>The general advantage of primed stimuli compared to nonprimed stimuli in overcoming CFS is in line with recent studies that found shorter suppression times for primed stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Costello et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lupyan &amp; Ward, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>To establish what kind of object representation could mediate such facilitation, we manipulated visual attention and object intactness, that is, the holistic configuration of an object, according to the hybrid model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hummel (2001)</ref>.</s><s>When an object received spatial attention, it greatly enhanced the priming effect measured as facilitated access to awareness.</s><s>The strong effect of attention on priming is consistent with work showing that the beneficial effect of prior target-related information on visual awareness is not only driven by passive, bottomup stimulus processing, but also strongly modulated by the observer's top-down set <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gayet et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, however, compared to the unprimed baseline, even unattended primes reliably boosted access to awareness.</s><s>These reliable priming effects for unattended primes indicate that object detection does not necessarily involve high-level part-based object processing, as such analytic object representations require attention to bind parts into coherent objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hummel &amp; Biederman, 1992)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, priming effects did not depend on object intactness, neither for attended nor for unattended primes.</s><s>That is, awareness of a target presented in the common intact view was similarly facilitated by the same intact prime and by a horizontally split prime.</s><s>Thus, the part-whole configuration of the prime, which is partially distorted in split objects, is not crucial for priming of object detection to occur, suggesting that object detection is less dependent on holistic representations than object identification.</s><s>Together, these findings are further evidence that the processes leading to detection of objects are at least partly different from those needed for object recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mack &amp; Palmeri, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, our data indicate that the simple detection of objects relies on representations of object features rather than analytic or holistic high-level representations.</s></p><p><s>The approach of the current study was also motivated by the hybrid model of object recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hummel, 2001)</ref> according to which the recognition of attended objects involves both analytic and holistic representations, whereas the recognition of unattended objects involves holistic representations only.</s><s>This central tenet of the hybrid theory is supported by evidence from studies on priming of object recognition that used the same attention and part-whole configuration manipulations as in the present experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Thoma &amp; Henson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thoma et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Because splitting at least partially disrupts the holistic match between the prime and the target, split primes are thought to facilitate target recognition only through an analytic, part-based representation.</s><s>Indeed, for object recognition, priming effects from intact objects are larger than from split objects, indicating an additional contribution from holistic object representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Thoma et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>In the present object detection experiment, by contrast, access to awareness was facilitated to a similar extent by intact and split primes.</s><s>The absence of an advantage for intact primes suggests that holistic object processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bülthoff &amp; Edelman, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Edelman &amp; Intrator, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tarr, 1995)</ref> that is partially disrupted by split images plays little role in the initial detection of an object.</s><s>This is consistent with evidence from b-CFS studies showing that stimulus inversion (i.e., rotating the image by 1808, thereby distorting the spatial configuration) has little influence on the detection of familiar objects from a wide range of categories (with the exception of human faces and bodies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Stein et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the perceptual mechanisms underlying the detection of many familiar objects seem fairly robust to changes in part-whole configuration.</s></p><p><s>In principle, these findings could well be explained by analytic, part-based object representations that are robust to view changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Biederman, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hummel &amp; Biederman, 1992)</ref>.</s><s>However, the literature on object recognition suggests that such analytic representations require attention, because split objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Thoma et al., 2004)</ref> as well as rotated images <ref type="bibr">(Thoma et al., 2007)</ref> prime the recognition of intact targets only when they are attended.</s><s>In fact, in the present experiment the priming effects from attended objects were considerably larger than from unattended objects.</s><s>Nevertheless, object representations based on (attention-dependent) structural descriptions cannot be the only mechanism involved in object detection, as we found that even unattended split objects facilitated access to awareness for a related intact target.</s><s>Although this attention manipulation has been shown to successfully draw attentional resources to the spatially cued prime and away from the unattended, ignored prime (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thoma et al., 2004)</ref> this approach does not necessarily allow us to fully exclude occasional ''slippage'' of attention to the ignored prime.</s><s>Previous studies sought to account for a possible influence of slippage.</s><s>For example, the study by <ref type="bibr">Thoma and Davidoff (2006, experiment 1)</ref> used catch trials in which subjects were asked to name the unattended prime: None of the 26 observers could correctly name the unattended prime.</s><s>Previously, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Stankiewicz, Hummel, and Cooper (1998)</ref> showed with this paradigm that unattended objects prime themselves in a probe display when shown in the same orientation but not in a mirror-image version of itself.</s><s>This priming result could not be expected if attentional slippage was assumed.</s><s>In addition, in an fMRI study using the same attentional and view (splitting) manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Thoma and Henson (2011)</ref> found no significant repetition suppression effects for unattended objects in object responsive lateral occipital cortex.</s><s>We thus deem it highly unlikely that occasional slippage of attention in prime trials to the unattended object can account for our data.</s></p><p><s>Thus, attention-dependent analytic object representations are unlikely to fully account for priming of object detection.</s><s>How, then, could we characterize the perceptual mechanism underlying the initial detection of objects?</s><s>One possibility is that priming from unattended objects relies on a representation of a ''shapeless bundle of features'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wolfe &amp; Bennett, 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wolfe and Horowitz (2004)</ref> suggest that a number of features may be processed in parallel and pre-attentively in order to guide attention to then allow binding and recognition.</s><s>An attention-related amplification of such simple representations of object features may account for the additive effect of attention observed in the present experiments.</s><s>Whereas this simple feature representation seems sufficient for the conscious detection of an object in the visual field, identification, naming, and more elaborate object processing demand higher-level object representations.</s></p><p><s>We studied these perceptual mechanisms underlying conscious object detection by recording the duration of perceptual suppression under CFS.</s><s>While we here interpret differences in suppression times simply as reflecting differences in detection sensitivity, a number of previous studies have implemented the b-CFS paradigm to study unconscious processing under interocular suppression (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Costello et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jiang et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stein, Senju, Peelen, &amp;

Sterzer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stein &amp; Sterzer, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, mere differences in conscious detection could, in principle, be regarded as evidence that stimuli were processed differentially before they were detected, that is, unconsciously <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dijksterhuis &amp; Aarts, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gaillard et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>While this inferential step has some face validity, it is neither commonly made nor generally accepted in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Labiouse, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Only paradigms in which stimuli are rendered permanently invisible are currently considered as providing unequivocal evidence for unconscious processing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sterzer, Stein, Ludwig, Rothkirch, &amp;

Peelen, 2013</ref>; for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Peelen &amp; Kastner, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the initial detection of objects can be strongly influenced by prior visual information on the object, and this influence does not seem to require highlevel analytic or holistic representations of the primed object, and most likely not even representations of 3-D parts.</s><s>Whatever the exact nature of the features driving the priming for detection, it is intriguing that even unattended objects induced significant priming.</s><s>Apart from providing insights into the format of visual object representations mediating simple detection, priming effects from unattended objects also rule out that the effects obtained with the present paradigm were due only to conceptual or name priming, which most likely contributed to priming from spatially attended objects.</s><s>It is unlikely, however, that covert naming can fully account for priming from attended objects.</s><s>Even for object-naming tasks, the dominant mechanism underlying the priming effect has been shown to be perceptual in nature, whereas name priming exhibited only a comparably small effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Thoma et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, previous work on object recognition using a similar priming paradigm has also shown that participants are not conscious of the identity of unattended objects in the prime display <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Thoma &amp; Davidoff, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>This raises the possibility that featurebased object representations that govern visual priming of object detection do not need to make contact with higher-level processes involved in object recognition and naming.</s><s>Future work could directly test whether these priming effects can be obtained in the complete absence of prime awareness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barbot &amp; Kouider, 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the current data show for the first time that spatially unattended primes can facilitate awareness of objects under CFS.</s><s>In addition, our findings indicate that the processes underlying priming of object detection are different from those for object recognition, as the former are equivalent for nonholistic part configurations.</s><s>Rather than relying on complex holistic and part-based object representations, the initial detection of an object seems to involve representations of basic object features that can be established pre-attentively but are strongly boosted by voluntary spatial attention.</s><s>Future research will have to establish in more detail whether the locus of the priming resides in the representation of simple low-level features, the surfaces of an object, or its volumetric parts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hummel &amp;
