reference BMI of the patients in the present study was within the usual range reported in clinical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Mean leptin levels of 1.2 ng/mL of our patients (although data were not normally distributed) were comparable to concentrations reported in previous studies (range: 0.9-5.6 ng/mL; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>).</s><s>Yet, it is to be noted that comparisons of absolute levels with other studies is difficult as different methods (ELISA, RIA) and kits of different vendors (Linco, Phoenix, DSL Systems, Millipore, Mediagnost), as well as lot-to-lot differences of the same kit might greatly influence the peptide levels measured.</s><s>In line with these differences, the standard curves differ by factors up to 100.</s><s>The linear detection range of the assay used in our study was 0.06-4 ng/mL, indicating that the mean leptin levels were in the middle of this curve.</s></p><p><s>Evaluating the degree of PA of the patients assessed in the present study in comparison with previous studies in AN is also complicated.</s><s>PA at the start of hospitalization is increased in many, but not in all individuals with AN <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>.</s><s>So far, most studies on PA have relied on nurses' or therapists' assessment.</s><s>As patients' self-reported PA did not correlate with measured PA, subjective PA assessment in AN should be interpreted with caution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Few studies have objectively quantified increased PA in AN using accelerometry (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Some of these studies applied simple pedometers, which are limited in distinguishing whether the subject really was physically inactive or whether the pedometer was not worn, thus introducing a potential bias.</s><s>This issue might be of particular importance in AN patients who are known to exercise in secret due to their fear of having their activity restricted.</s><s>In a previous study using accelerometry in patients with AN, nine out of 51 measurements were not included in the analysis due to long periods of inactivity, which indicated Actiwatch™ misuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The advantage of the SenseWear™ armband is that data recording is initiated and stopped by contact of its heat flux sensor with the skin, enabling one to analyze on-body time and to discard measurements if the band were not worn.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Compared to normal weight or obese outpatients <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>, the hospitalized AN patients in the present study were, with an average of 12,841 ± 6408 steps, far more physically active.</s><s>We are aware of only two previous studies reporting on the number of steps assessed with the SenseWear™ armband in AN patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30]</ref>.</s><s>In one of these earlier studies, the number of steps recorded was similar between 53 hospitalized AN patients and non-hospitalized controls (AN: 8563 ± 5080; controls: 9638 ± 2983, p = 0.184) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The other study measured PA at the end of 20 weeks of inpatient treatment in 32 weight-recovered AN patients who showed between 12,347 and 17,775 steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>.</s><s>A commonly-used or accepted cut-off for high/low PA in AN does not (yet) exist.</s><s>On average, during the three days of PA assessment, intensive exercise was recorded for just a few minutes in the patients under investigation, which is similar to a recorded time of 217 seconds of moderate and vigorous PA of between three and six METs in a previous study on adult and hospitalized AN patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The patients in the present study were allowed to move freely in the ward, as was the case in patients described in the study by El Ghoch and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref> (information available on author request).</s><s>This is different from other treatment programs for AN patients, which commonly restrict any form of PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, for better interpretation and comparison between studies, future research on this topic should include information about whether or not PA was restricted as part of the treatment program.</s><s>In both previous studies and in the present study using SenseWear™, AN patients displayed a high range of steps.</s><s>Taken together, the patient sample in the present study displayed on average low leptin and high physical activity compared with previous studies, as well as high individual variability of activity levels within our group.</s></p><p><s>Leptin is a hormone predominantly secreted by adipocytes and circulating at levels proportionate to the amount of adipose tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, low leptin levels in AN can be explained by reduced body fat.</s><s>Percent fat mass explains more variance in leptin levels than BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, in the present study, the association was closer between leptin and fat mass than and BMI.</s><s>Although not significantly associated in our study, also fat-free mass should always be considered, as the contribution of fat free-mass to BMI is higher in AN compared to normal weight subjects.</s><s>Leptin might play a critical physiological role in the regulation of neuroendocrine systems during starvation, and low circulating levels are hypothesized to cause an increase in PA.</s><s>However, the main finding of the present study was the lack of a simple and linear association of leptin and PA as measured by steps per day, which is in contrast to several previous studies.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr"

the relationship between leptin and PA in AN.</s><s>Few studies have specifically reported on the association of leptin and PA in adult AN patients, showing both an association <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, as well as a lack thereof <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Hyperactivity related to hypoleptinemia in AN might be a complex phenomenon, as both neurobiological factors and deliberate attempts to lose weight by over-exercising seem to coexist <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, ethnicity affects leptin levels in lean and obese subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19]</ref>.</s><s>Although the enrolment of Caucasian subjects can be assumed for all studies listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, ethnicity was not specified in these studies.</s><s>In the present study, only Caucasian subjects were included.</s><s>Future studies should therefore investigate the alterations of leptin levels under the conditions of AN in different ethnic groups.</s></p><p><s>In addition, the relative contribution of these multiple underlying mechanisms is likely to differ according to the stage of the disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>.</s><s>In line with this view, the association of leptin and PA over time during the recovery from AN was shown to be dynamic; more specifically, a negative association at baseline changed into a positive correlation during the recovery process <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, there was a slight trend towards higher PA in patients with higher BMI, which might indicate that at a higher BMI, the patients' health allows them to be more physically active.</s><s>Moreover, age and duration of illness have been suggested as modulating factors of the association of leptin and PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The duration of illness was significantly higher in highly active patients than in patients with low activity, and highly active patients had an earlier age of illness onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>In theory, the time course could be as follows: at an early stage of starvation, neurobiological factors, as reflected by decreasing leptin levels, may be of importance to increase food-searching behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The resulting "agitated restlessness" might persist during the early course of the disease, but at some point, no longer apply if starvation persists.</s><s>This shift might be due to an adaptation to low peripheral leptin levels in chronically ill and older patients, with their activity levels no longer being influenced by leptin <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>When starvation progresses even further, formerly increased activity could turn into lethargy and weakness at very low BMI in the later stages of starvation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Currently, the findings from different studies on the relationship between leptin and PA are inconsistent.</s><s>While our study cannot resolve these existing controversies, we took a first step towards dissecting the influence of various moderators on the association of leptin and PA in AN.</s><s>Exploratory analyses applying a complex and non-linear model including potential moderators and interactions yielded promising results for the following moderators: age, BMI, duration of disease, AN subtype and intake of sedating medication.</s><s>Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the small sample size for such analyses and the potential for overfitting limit the conclusions that can be drawn from these initial findings.</s></p><p><s>A differentiated understanding of increased PA as a fundamental symptom of AN has the potential to improve therapeutic options.</s><s>First, in some patients and treatment phases, increased PA seems to be a neurobiological consequence of starvation, rather than being a conscious attempt of patients to lose weight or representing noncompliance with treatment.</s><s>Second, the administration of leptin in an acute state of illness to reduce "uncontrollable" hyperactivity has been suggested for the treatment of humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28]</ref>, provided that specific precautions are taken.</s><s>Evidently, the metabolic and nutritional situation of the leptin-treated patient needs to be monitored closely due to the possible increase in resting energy expenditure and energy needs.</s><s>For a long time, leptin administration in clinical human trials seemed unlikely.</s><s>Recently, leptin administration received approval for the treatment of lipodystrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>, making it more likely that leptin administration in patients with AN could follow in the near future.</s><s>According to the data presented here, an evidence-based procedure should first be developed to identify individual patients and treatment phases where leptin administration can be beneficial.</s><s>Patients exercising mainly to pursue thinness might be less likely to benefit from this treatment.</s><s>Therefore, next to biological determinants of PA described in our study, clinical and research assessment should also include eating disorder-specific psychopathology related to hyperactivity.</s></p><p><s>There was a significant association of recumbent time and number of steps (p = 0.043) in our study population.</s><s>Whether a low number of steps results invariably from the fact that during recumbent time no steps can be taken, or whether high recumbent time could be a sign of physical weakness or serve as a marker of low motor restlessness remains unclear.</s><s>We are not aware of any studies that objectively assessed sedentary behavior in patients with AN, which therefore remains to be uncovered further.</s><s>In obesity, adverse metabolic effects of sedentary behavior have been established <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>, and therapeutic options target the reduction of sedentary time to improve cardiometabolic health <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The findings of this study need to be interpreted within its limitations.</s><s>First, with 61 subjects, the samples size of this study was still too small for valid subgroup analyses to build a sound, non-linear model, which should be attempted in future studies.</s><s>Second, we focused on the assessment of steps as a marker for PA.</s><s>However, it seems likely that hyperactivity in AN can manifest in several forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, such as high intensity exercise, which was negligible in the present study, or a more subtle, but constant "motor restlessness".</s><s>While there is the need to assess PA using objective techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, it is remarkable that the present and the only other study that used accelerometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> did not find an association of PA and leptin.</s><s>Inconsistent results regarding the association of leptin and PA in AN could therefore be of methodological origin.</s><s>Judged from the present study, it can further be questioned if the number of steps per day is a suitable marker for altered PA in AN.</s><s>However, another study provided evidence that the number of steps assessed at the end of treatment predicted the resumption of menses at one-year follow-up in patients with AN <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>, pointing towards the utility of steps as a clinical-biological marker.</s><s>Further work is needed to determine how motor restlessness (as opposed to PA) can best be measured and quantified with accelerometric devices.</s><s>Third, we allowed the patients to take off the band for a maximum of 2.5 h/day, i.e., to take a shower or in the case of feeling discomfort by the elastic band.</s><s>While the average wearing time was 98% (range: 91-100%) of the total time, we cannot exclude the possibility that during part of or the entire remaining 2% (range: 0-9%), the patients could have been highly active.</s><s>On the other hand, we consider the technology used in the present study to be the best available method due to its heat sensors and the ability to detect how long the band was actually worn.</s><s>Fourth, we used BIA to assess body fat, which is an easy to use technique, but its accuracy in patients with AN is reduced compared to the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the present study was limited by the fact that it did not include data from a healthy control group.</s><s>However, usually healthy controls cannot be assessed under the same conditions in a hospital setting and subjected to an eating disorder program, which makes a comparison of PA in patients versus healthy controls difficult.</s><s>However, a control group should be included in future studies using an outpatient setting.</s></p></div>
