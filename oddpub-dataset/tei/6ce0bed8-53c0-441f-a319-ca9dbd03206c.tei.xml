mRNA.</s><s>Forced expression of miR-199a-3p leads to a decrease in PAK4 mRNA and protein levels through decreased mRNA stability.</s><s>Although not investigated in this study, it may also be possible that miR-199a-3p affects PAK4 translation.</s><s>Finally, this downregulation of PAK4 results in decreased transcription of CD1 which contributes to impaired cellular proliferation.</s><s>Although overexpression of miR-199a-3p and downregulation of PAK4 may affect proliferation through other mechanisms not evaluated in this study, our findings support an important role for CD1 in mediating the observed decreased proliferation.</s></p><p><s>In previous histopathologic studies, CD1 has been found to be overexpressed in 40-70% of esophageal cancer cases analyzed

are more pronounced than the differences in miR-199a-3p levels, suggesting that smaller changes in miR levels may result in more marked changes in target mRNA expression.</s></p><p><s>Studies such as these highlight the potential of miR analysis to identify new targets with potential therapeutic value in specific malignancies.</s><s>This is especially true for PAK4, as small molecule inhibitors of
