<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Cellular senescence is a stress-responsive cell-cycle arrest program that terminates the further expansion of (pre-)malignant cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Key signalling components of the senescence machinery, such as p16INK4a, p21CIP1 and p53, as well as trimethylation of lysine 9 at histone H3 (H3K9me3), also operate as critical regulators of stem-cell functions (which are collectively termed 'stemness') <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>In cancer cells, a gain of stemness may have profound implications for tumour aggressiveness and clinical outcome.</s><s>Here we investigated whether chemotherapy-induced senescence could change stem cell-related properties of malignant cells.</s><s>Gene expression and functional analyses comparing senescent and non-senescent B-cell lymphomas from Eμ-Myc transgenic mice revealed substantial upregulation of an adult tissue stem-cell signature, activated Wnt signalling, and distinct stem-cell markers in senescence.</s><s>Using genetically switchable models of senescence targeting H3K9me3 or p53 to mimic spontaneous escape from the arrested condition, we found that cells released from senescence re-entered the cell cycle with strongly enhanced and Wnt-dependent clonogenic growth potential compared to virtually identical populations that had been equally exposed to chemotherapy but had never been senescent.</s><s>In vivo, these previously senescent cells presented with a much higher tumour initiation potential.</s><s>Notably, the temporary enforcement of senescence in p53-regulatable models of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia was found to reprogram non-stem bulk leukaemia cells into self-renewing, leukaemia-initiating stem cells.</s><s>Our data, which are further supported by consistent results in human cancer cell lines and primary samples of human haematological malignancies, reveal that senescence-associated stemness is an unexpected, cell autonomous feature that exerts its detrimental, highly aggressive growth potential upon escape from cell-cycle blockade, and is enriched in relapse tumours.</s><s>These findings have profound implications for cancer therapy, and provide new mechanistic insights into the plasticity of cancer cells.</s></p><p><s>Cellular senescence, which is implemented in response to severe cellular insults such as oncogenic activation or chemotherapeutic DNA damage, is a failsafe program that protects organismic integrity by excluding potentially harmful cells from further expansion <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , and also has a physiological function in tissue homeostasis during organ development <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Senescence has been shown to cancel the pro-tumorigenic potential of Ras-/Raf-driven (pre-)cancerous lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> , and to contribute to the outcome of anticancer chemotherapy in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Notably, stem-cell functions, collectively referred to as 'stemness' <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , and senescence

of various tissue types, including melanocytes, colon mucosa and breast epithelial cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g</ref>).</s><s>Hence, cancer cells of mouse and human origin acquire novel stem-cell features upon entering cellular senescence.</s></p><p><s>To test whether senescence-associated stemness (SAS) translates into different tumour behaviour upon release from the division block, we generated switchable model systems (using 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible essential senescence mediators Suv39h1 or p53) that can enter full-featured senescence with increased levels of stem cell-related transcripts and proteins only when exposed to both 4-OHT and ADR (Fig. <ref type="figure"

analyses revealed that senescent cells resumed sustainable proliferation within a few days; that is, they became first double positive for the retained fluorescencebased senescence marker (a vital stain) and 5-ethynyl-2′ -deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, indicating restarted DNA synthesis (with the proliferation-repressive H3K9me3 mark gradually vanishing), before SA-β -gal activity was eventually lost and S-phase activity fully regained (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d-g</ref>).</s><s>Therefore senescence is, in principle, a reversible condition, which becomes evident when essential senescence maintenance genes are no longer expressed.</s><s>Importantly, serial replatings in colony formation experiments of such previously senescent cells led to significantly more colonies compared to the aliquot of never senescent cells of the same lymphoma treated with the same dose of chemotherapy, reflecting the now unleashed stemness properties acquired as a latent program during senescence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a, b</ref>).</s><s>The enhanced colony-founding potential of previously senescent cells was stable over an extended observation period of up to 100 days (reflecting 14 serial replatings; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were obtained with p53-ERTAM as another inducible senescence gatekeeper; with γ -irradiation as an alternative senescence trigger; with ADR-exposed human lymphoma cell lines; and with colon cancer cells representing a solid, epithelial cancer type (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a-f</ref>).</s><s>It is noteworthy that previously senescent cells typically retained the ability to re-enter TIS when re-exposed to 4-OHT and ADR, indicating that no selection for senescence compromising mutations occurred in previously senescent cells (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3g</ref>).</s><s>Previously, an instructive, non-cell-autonomous role has been attributed to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP; reviewed in

most compelling and consistent interpretation of the observations presented.</s></p><p><s>Enrichment assays between matched pairs of never senescent versus previously senescent lymphomas confirmed the higher growth competitiveness of previously senescent lymphomas both in vitro and in vivo (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2h</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, in vivo tumour initiation experiments found previously senescent lymphomas produced malignancies at much lower transplanted cell numbers in immune-competent recipient mice when compared to never senescent lymphomas (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, the SAS program exerts its detrimental effect on tumour initiation upon release from TIS, thereby unmasking an unexpected tumour-promoting capability of the senescence program.</s></p><p><s>To test which key stemness pathways drive SAS, we used GSEA in ADR-exposed control;Bcl2 versus Suv39h1−;Bcl2 lymphomas for numerous gene sets related to Notch, Hedgehog, and canonical and noncanonical Wnt signalling.</s><s>Canonical Wnt and, to some extent, Notch signalling, appeared to be significantly enriched in TIS (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5a, b</ref>).</s><s>Because Wnt signalling plays a central role in stem-cell renewal in many tissues including the haematopoietic compartment, induces Notch signalling, and is required for cancer stem cell development in haematological malignancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , we considered activation of the Wnt cascade as the putative driver behind the newly acquired stemness features in TIS lymphomas.</s><s>Indeed, we detected enhanced, predominantly nuclear expression and transcriptional activation of β-catenin in control;Bcl2 but not in Suv39h1−;Bcl2 lymphomas, as well as in TIS-capable human cancer cell lines after ADR treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5c,  d</ref>).</s><s>Independent of Wnt ligand-receptor stimulation, we identified inhibition of the β-catenin degradationpromoting glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) via activated MEK-MAPK and PI3K-Akt signallingwhich is typically upregulated in senescence20-as the cell-autonomous driver of the Wnt program (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>The implementation of the Wnt program was further promoted by epigenetically permissive remodelling at promoters of stem-cell-and Wnt signalling-related genes in previously senescent as compared to never senescent cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>).</s><s>Accordingly, we found that the increased colony-forming potential of previously senescent lymphoma or colon cancer cells was dependent on Wnt signalling, as genetic or pharmacological disruption of the Wnt-β-catenin cascade-without preventing TIS or profoundly affecting cell viability-neutralized the higher clonogenicity of previously senescent cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a-d</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to the never senescent cell population, a rarely dividing and strongly β-catenin-expressing subpopulation was detectable in the previously senescent cells only, and maintained at a stable steady state, explaining the lastingly enhanced colony-forming potential of previously senescent compared to never senescent cells (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>Consistently, the biology of the previously senescent state translated into shortened survival when previously senescent and never senescent cells were propagated in mice, whereas exposure to Wnt inhibitors in vivo or stable lymphoma cell transduction with a construct expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against Ctnnb1 (which encodes β-catenin) improved the poor long-term outcome of mice harbouring previously senescent lymphomas (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7b, e, f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Importantly, cell cycle re-entry out of TIS-as a prerequisite to exert stem-cell potential-is not limited to conditional, switchable systems, but may, as a rare event, spontaneously occur in control;Bcl2 lymphomas, as demonstrated by the emergence of EdU-co-positive cells out of a solely SA-β-gal-positive senescent cell population (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>Given their stem-cell potential, we postulated that βcatenin positive previously senescent cells might be enriched in lymphomas that progressed after chemotherapy.</s><s>Hence, when comparing primary control;Bcl2 lymphomas before therapy with the same individual lymphomas that had relapsed after exposure to senescence-inducing cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in vivo 8 , we found a much higher fraction of cells positive for nuclear β-catenin in relapse lymphomas that also presented with higher expression levels of Wnt target genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e, f, left</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, longitudinally matched biopsy pairs from the same individual patients diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) before chemotherapy and at disease recurrence revealed significantly more nuclear β-catenin-positive tumour cells in the previously chemotherapy-exposed, re-emerging samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref>, right), further supporting a link between activated Wnt signalling in relapsed tumours and senescence-related tumour cell reprogramming.</s><s>Taken together, TIS-associated stemness reflects a Wnt-governed capability that is stably maintained in a reprogrammed, hierarchically organized subpopulation of post-senescent tumour cells and critically associated with tumour progression and treatment failure.</s></p><p><s>As presumably applying to various human tumours including aggressive lymphomas, Eμ -Myc transgenic mouse lymphomas do not originate from a distinct fraction of cancer stem cells, because almost all lymphoma cells possess tumour-initiating potential in this model <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Consequently, next we asked whether cellular senescence might account for the reprogramming of non-stem tumour cells into cancer stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , in tumour types in which the tumour-initiating capacity is confined to a rare subpopulation.</s><s>We isolated a non-self-renewing population of leukaemia cells from a mouse model of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) driven by oncogenic KrasG12D and conditional inactivation of p53 via a doxycycline-controlled shRNA (shp53)23 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10a</ref>).</s><s>ADR exposure induced senescence in the majority of non-stem leukaemia cells only if p53 expression was not cancelled (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a, top</ref>).</s><s>This group exhibited a significant conversion to Kit+Sca1+ cells, indicative of putative leukaemia stem cells (P = 0.02, compared to ADR-exposed but p53-deficient cells; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>, middle), and higher expression of stem-cell-related transcripts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>, bottom).</s><s>Upon release from TIS by knockdown of p53, these leukaemia cells resumed proliferation (thereby becoming previously senescent cells), and formed significantly more colonies as compared to their equally ADR-treated never senescent leukaemia counterparts that remained p53-inactive throughout the experiment (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10b</ref>).</s><s>As reported for TIS lymphomas, cells with nuclear β-catenin expression were almost exclusively detectable in the senescent leukaemia cell population, and Wnt inhibitors completely neutralized the increased colony formation potential of their previously senescent progeny (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10c, d</ref>).</s><s>Most importantly, almost all samples of previously senescent cells-and nearly none of the samples of never senescent cells-initiated leukaemias in recipient mice (P = 0.0275, comparing previously senescent and never senescent groups); as expected, all Lin− transplants gave rise to leukaemias (P &lt; 0.001, comparing Lin− and never senescent groups; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b, c</ref>).</s><s>Notably, and further adding to SAS in oncogene-induced senescent colon mucosa cells or melanocytes (compare with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>), TIS reprogramming is not restricted to cells of lymphoid origin, as demonstrated for an acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) mouse model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , culture established human AML cells, and primary human leukaemic blast samples obtained at diagnosis from patients with AML (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10e-l</ref>).</s><s>Thus, cellular senescence is not only associated with additional stem-cell features in tumour cells with pre-existing self-renewal capability, but also catalyses the cell-autonomous reprogramming of non-stem bulk tumour cells of lymphoid and non-lymphoid origin into de novo cancer stem cells.</s></p><p><s>We present here an unexpected cell-intrinsic link between the senescence program and the acquisition of self-renewing properties, which we postulate serves as a physiological rescue mechanism in development and tissue homeostasis.</s><s>We and others have observed that senescence not only occurs in critically stressed cells, but also may spread to adjacent cells via SASP components in a paracrine fashion (ref.</s><s>25; J.R.D. and C.A.S., unpublished observations).</s><s>We propose that nature equipped normal cells with a latent SAS capacity (compare with Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g</ref>) to counter the imminent loss of an entire tissue compartment due to pro-apoptotic and pro-senescent stresses: in rare cells spontaneously re-entering the cell cycle when threatening stresses no longer apply, SAS may become a tissue-replenishing principle.</s><s>In a neoplastic context, cellular senescence-particularly in tumour cells with apoptotic defects-appears to be primarily a beneficial response by keeping tumour growth in check.</s><s>However, post-senescent cells with 'hijacked' SAS exert their detrimental potential at relapse by driving a much more aggressive growth phenotype.</s><s>Therefore, pharmacological strategies to specifically eliminate senescent cells before a fraction of them may implement their acquired stemness capacity become, as previously reported by us regarding cancer <ref
