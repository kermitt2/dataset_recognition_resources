<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Breast cancer is a malignant condition starting in the breast cells.</s><s>Although it is thought to be a disease typical in women, about 1% of all breast cancers appears in men <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</s><s>While it occurs in men aged 65 years on average, its incidence shows a peak at the ages of 68-71 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>.</s><s>It has been reported men perceive that breast cancer is an illness that occurs mainly later in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>In Britain, 350-400 men can be diagnosed as breast cancer every year <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>According to data from International Association of Cancer Records, breast cancer is responsible for 0.37% of all cancers in men <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>Turkey Cancer Statistics reported that, the age-standardized breast cancer rate distribution in males is 0.8 in 2014 (World Standard Population, 100,000 people) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>It has been reported in the literature that the incidence of male breast cancer is increasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>.</s><s>However males had lower risk factor awareness than women across breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Based on data from American National Cancer Institute, Stang and Thomsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> reported that the incidence of breast cancer decreased in women but increased in men.</s><s>It is also noted that the incidence increased from 0.86 to 1.8 for every 100.000</s><s>men <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The most important risk factor for male breast cancer is hormonal changes.</s><s>Among them are changes in estrogen and testosterone.</s><s>In a study in Sweden in 1988, the risk was found to increase by eight times in men working in manufacture of estrogen containing cream and soap.</s><s>The strongest condition related to breast cancer is Klinefelter syndrome.</s><s>In this syndrome, one X chromosome is added to XY chromosomes available in males and causes an increase in breast cancer risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</s><s>Obesity is another important risk factor since it increases estrogen-testosterone levels in males.</s><s>It is stated that breast cancer risk rises by two fold in males with a body mass index of 30 and higher.</s><s>Other risk factors are exposure to radiation, exposure to long-term high temperatures and hereditary transmission.</s><s>It has been reported that 5-30% of all male breast cancer cases have a family history of breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since male breast cancer is a rare tumor and can be mistaken for other conditions such as gynecomastia, there can be a delay in its recognition and can have an advanced stage when diagnosed.</s><s>This has a negative effect on its prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>.</s><s>The rate of survival is lower in males with breast cancer than in females.</s><s>Five-year survival recorded in Britain is 80.8% in males and 86.6% in females <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>Delayed diagnosis of breast cancer in males has been attributed to their disregard for symptoms and lack of knowledge about the issue in the society <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the public awareness should be raised and people should be informed about male breast cancer in order to prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment.</s><s>Awareness of symptoms of the disease and elimination of waste of time in referral to hospital will increase rates of early diagnosis.</s><s>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (12) recommends breast self-examination (BSE) as a primary prevention method and clinical breast examination (CBE) twice a year for males at risk of breast cancer.</s><s>Not only women but also men should carry out a breast self-examination minimum once a month at the age of 18 years onwards.</s><s>However, according to research, males do not have sufficient information about breast selfexamination and believe that this examination and the disease are common among females <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14)</ref>.</s><s>The main reason for this is that brochures and education and counseling programs about breast cancer are directed towards women rather than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16)</ref>.</s><s>However, in view of an increase in the male breast cancer incidence, it is clear that breast self-examination is important for males.</s><s>It is stated that this examination is a reasonable and practical method for early diagnosis of breast cancer in developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>Expressing specific steps in this examination in a clear and understandable way plays an important role in its acceptance and implementation.</s><s>Al-Naggar and Al-Naggar (11) created Male Breast Self-Examination (MBSE) composed of two sections and ten steps illustrated by pictures.</s><s>The MBSE is a simple early detection method which can be made easily by men.</s><s>There have not been any studies on breast self-examination or a practical instrument to be used in early diagnosis of breast cancer in Turkish men.</s><s>It will be useful to adapt an instrument directed towards promotion of breast self-examination and to spread its use in order to achieve primary prevention of male breast cancer in Turkey.</s><s>Therefore, the aim of this study was to adapt MBSE into Turkish and to test its validity and reliability.</s></p></div>
