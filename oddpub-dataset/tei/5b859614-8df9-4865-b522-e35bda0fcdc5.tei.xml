<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The African naked mole-rats' (Heterocephalus glaber) social and subterranean lifestyle generates a hypoxic niche.</s><s>Under experimental conditions naked mole-rats tolerate hours of extreme hypoxia and survive 18 minutes of total oxygen deprivation (anoxia) without apparent injury.</s><s>During anoxia the naked mole-rat switches to anaerobic metabolism fueled by fructose which is actively accumulated and metabolized to lactate in the brain.</s><s>Global expression of the GLUT5 fructose transporter and high levels of ketohexokinase (KHK) were identified as molecular signatures of fructose metabolism.</s><s>Fructose-driven glycolytic respiration in naked mole-rat tissues avoids feedback inhibition of glycolysis via phosphofructokinase, supporting viability.</s><s>The metabolic rewiring of glycolysis can circumvent the normally lethal effects of oxygen-deprivation a mechanism that could be harnessed to minimize hypoxic damage in human disease.</s></p></div>

of 10mM glucose in the buffer with 10mM fructose (normoxic conditions).</s><s>With fructose as the sole available sugar, fEPSP amplitude declined steadily, but at different rates in mouse and naked

partially recovered in mouse slices (2-way ANOVA p&lt;0.05) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3A</ref>).</s><s>We also asked if fructose could be used to fuel the isolated beating heart.</s><s>Naked mole-rat or mouse hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing glucose that was then switched to fructose for two periods of 60 min.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the LVDP of the naked mole-rat hearts remained stable during both fructose switches, whereas in the mouse heart LVDP was reduced during both fructose exposures, the latter was significantly different from the naked mole-rat (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, fructose can replace glucose as an energy source in the naked mole-rat brain and heart.</s></p><p><s>Glucose is metabolized via phosphofructokinase (PFK), a rate-limiting step subject to feedback inhibition via allosteric binding of ATP, low pH and downstream intermediates (21-23) (Fig. <ref type="figure"

metabolic flux analysis to measure the incorporation of fructose derived carbons into glycolytic intermediates in hypoxic brain slices.</s><s>Acutely isolated brain slices were incubated in media in which glucose was rapidly replaced with the stable isotope 13 C 6 -D-fructose (10mM) and kept at 32 o C under conditions where oxygen levels were 5% <ref type="bibr"

glycolytic intermediates in both species (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A-H</ref>), but the incorporation of fructose-derived carbons was both faster and larger in naked molerat compared to mouse (between 2 and 5 fold), and this was true for intermediates like dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glycerol-3-phosphate (Glyc-3-P) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B,H</ref>), but also for glycolytic end-products like pyruvate and lactate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D,G</ref>).</s><s>There was also increased fructose-derived carbon incorporation into citrate in the naked mole-rat (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The naked mole-rat has evolved the ability to use fructose to fuel vital organs like heart and brain under near
