<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key results</head><p><s>This prevalence study showed that nearly every resident in institutional long-term care is affected by at least one dermatological disease.</s><s>In total, 60 dermatological diseases were diagnosed, which was unexpectedly high.</s><s>The highest prevalence was observed for xerosis cutis followed by tinea unguium, seborrheic keratosis, androgenetic alopecia, IAD and tinea pedis.</s><s>Only few bivariate associations have been detected between skin diseases and demographic and other characteristics.</s><s>In the majority, the strengths of associations were small.</s><s>Male sex was strongly associated with androgenetic alopecia, tinea pedis and actinic keratosis.</s><s>A university qualification may be protective against xerosis cutis.</s><s>Increasing age leads to increased risks of seborrheic keratosis and intertrigo and to decreased risks of having seborrheic dermatitis.</s><s>Overall, the Barthel Index and the duration of residency seem to be unrelated to the occurrence of skin diseases in this population.</s><s>limitations Although three additional long-term care facilities were included, the anticipated sample size of n=280 was not achieved.</s><s>In total, n=559/811 residents living in the institutional long-term care at the time of data collection did not responded, which may had led to a possible selection bias.</s><s>Even though we performed a randomised selection of all long-term care facilities, there were differences between participating and non-participating institutions.</s><s>Whether this has an effect on the results is unclear.</s><s>We also excluded residents at the end of life which may have led to a selection bias.</s><s>Although we collected numerous data, the systemic diseases were not further specified.</s><s>This restricts detailed analyses of possible associations.</s><s>Furthermore, we did not perform laboratory or histology.</s><s>We also had no control over the documentation quality of the medical records.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation</head><p><s>Research in this setting is challenging due to difficulties of gathering written informed consent (eg, due to dementia and associated cognitive impairments). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24</ref></s><s>Irrespectively from that, besides a study published in Turkey in 2007 by Kilic et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25</ref> this was the largest randomly selected sample Open Access of residents aged 65 years or older undergoing a headto-toe skin examination by board certified dermatologists in institutional long-term care facilities, compared with previous studies. 5 <ref type="bibr">26 27</ref></s><s>In our study, prevalence estimates are higher compared with previous studies in this setting, for instance, the prevalence of xerosis cutis, IAD and actinic keratosis. <ref type="bibr">5 25 28-30</ref></s><s>Otherwise the study of Kilic et al reported a lower prevalence for actinic keratosis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25</ref> which may be explained by the geographical region and the assumed darker skin types of examined nursing home residents.</s><s>Prevalences for tinea pedis, pruritus and candidiasis were similar to previous reports. <ref type="bibr">25 27</ref></s><s>he PU prevalence of 9% was substantially higher compared with previous studies <ref type="bibr">31 32</ref> of the German longterm care setting.</s><s>The main reason for this finding is unclear.</s><s>Underreporting is a well-known phenomenon in epidemiological PU research. <ref type="bibr">33 34</ref></s><s>The full head-to-toe skin examination supports the internal validity and the accuracy of this point estimate.</s><s>This indicates that PUs are a substantial problem in German long-term care settings.</s></p><p><s>We diagnosed a broad spectrum of dermatological conditions in our study population with a total number of 60 diagnoses, which is unexpectedly high.</s><s>A study by Makrantonaki et al reported 72 dermatological disorders in a sample of 110 hospitalised elderly patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">35</ref></s><s>These findings underscore the importance of dermatological examinations in geriatric patients and long-term care residents.</s><s>However, the prevalence of &gt;50% of the reported skin diseases was 2% or lower.</s><s>Looking at the clinical spectrum of the diagnosed conditions, a large number are benign, easy to manage or seem to be of minor pathological relevance.</s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[40]</ref> Therefore our data may suggest a possible undersupply.</s><s>Untreated dry skin is most often related to enhanced pruritus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">38</ref> and may lead to superficial injuries or wounds with superinfection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">41</ref></s><s>AD or intertrigo may also be addressed by basic skin care interventions and/or antimycotic therapies. <ref type="bibr">39 42</ref></s><s>Other diseases like androgenetic alopecia, seborrheic keratosis or pigmentary disorders may be aesthetically disturbing but they do not require imperative medical treatment.</s><s>However, also psychosocial well-being may be affected possibly leading to restrictions in mental health. <ref type="bibr">41 43</ref></s><s>hus, in the elderly and especially in aged long-term care residents, we do have different challenges: realisation of regular dermatological examinations, detecting clinically relevant dermatoses obligatory to be treated, benign skin conditions for facultative treatment and aesthetically disturbing skin conditions with direct implications for physical and psychological well-being.</s><s>Some of the conditions identified in our study, like PUs, neoplasm, stasis dermatitis, venous insufficiency or superficial wounds require immediate medical attention.</s><s>These diseases are frequently observed in this elderly population and may lead to several complications (eg, basal cell carcinoma, ulcus cruris and osteomyelitis) if not treated appropriately.</s><s>It is important that healthcare practitioners are trained to screen for the most important and significant dermatological conditions in order to path the way for correct and adequate management.</s><s>Open Access</s></p><p><s>In our study, we also identified conditions which may be considered borderline and may have lower or no importance but others may be simple and frequent conditions with severe consequences if not treated adequately.</s><s>For instance, tinea pedis is frequent, with frequent relapses and often takes a chronic course.</s><s>If tinea pedis is not treated properly, it bears the risk to spread to tinea corporis or to lead to onychomycosis and subsequent complications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">44</ref></s><s>The dermatophytes disturb the natural defence of the skin barrier, whereby bacteria and viruses can penetrate into deeper skin layers more easily.</s><s>The risk of developing lower extremities cellulitis 45 is increased.</s><s>Another example of borderline conditions is actinic keratosis, which is a carcinoma in situ with the risk of progressing to squamous cell carcinoma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">46</ref></s><s>The distinction between actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma can be challenging, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">46</ref> but actinic keratosis may progress to a malignant disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">47</ref></s><s>nterestingly, only few associations between skin diseases and demographic characteristics have been detected.</s><s>Overall, the presence of skin diseases seems not to be associated with care dependency (Barthel Index) and the duration of residency.</s><s>This indicates that residents are already affected by the skin disease when being admitted.</s><s>Apparently they do not develop these conditions de novo in the institutions, but may develop them as a consequence to lifetime exposure to well-known risk factors such as ultraviolet (UV) exposure increasing the risk of skin cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">48</ref></s><s>The reason why higher education is associated with less dry skin is unclear.</s><s>The educational level may be associated with skin self-care behaviour like the regular application of leave-on products.</s></p><p><s>The association of male sex and androgenetic alopecia was expected, because in the Caucasian population, the prevalence increases with age in men up to 80% and in women up to 42%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">49</ref></s><s>This may be also associated with actinic keratosis.</s><s>Because men have a higher prevalence of pattern baldness, there is a reduced natural UV protection on the scalp skin which caused a higher occurrence of actinic keratosis.</s><s>Also, increased manifestation of tinea pedis in the male gender may possibly be explained to increased hyperhidrosis, lower awareness for skin care (eg, regularly drying between toes, regularly checking feet and inappropriate hygiene habits). <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">50</ref></s><s>uring the last decades, many studies were published reporting the high occurrence of dermatological disorders and the necessity to pay increasing attention to specialised dermatological care in the elderly population.</s><s>However, is more specialised medical (dermatological) care feasible in this setting and is it cost-effective?</s><s>A discussion of prioritisation in this vulnerable population is missing so far.</s><s>Although there is an obvious need of dermatological care in institutional long-term care, it is unlikely that board certified dermatologists will solve this problem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">51</ref></s><s>Telemedicine applications and better medical training of healthcare providers in the institutional longterm care facilities were assumed as being suitable strategies. <ref type="bibr">51 52</ref></s><s>Frequent examinations by a dermatologists, as proposed by others, <ref type="bibr">35 53</ref> are unlikely to be affordable and manageable in this setting.</s><s>Caregivers might be the key because they may have a gatekeeper function.</s><s>They need to have skills to decide whether residents need medical or basic care and they need to decide when to refer to a specialist.</s><s>They need to have an evidence-based algorithm for skin care and diagnostic skills to distinguish whether the skin condition is a
