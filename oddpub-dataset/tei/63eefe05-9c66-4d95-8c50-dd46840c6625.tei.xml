<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9.6.">Squat</head><p><s>For the squat activity, subjects stood with stationary feet, approximately shoulder width apart, and hands stretched forwards.</s><s>Knee joint flexion was then performed as far as possible before returning to the standing position.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.10.">Processing of the data</head><p><s>Tibio-femoral A-P translations and proximo-distal (p-d) distances were described using the distance-weighted means of the 10 nearest points on each of the medial and lateral femoral condyles (surface element edge length approx.</s><s>2.8 mm) relative to the tibial baseplate, which were re-calculated for each time point of the recorded kinematics to account for relative motion and rotation of the implant components.</s><s>As a result, anterior translation of the medial contact point would denote internal tibial rotation.</s></p><p><s>For all gait activities, all kinematic and kinetic parameters were temporally normalized to a complete gait cycle.</s><s>The gait cycle was defined from heel-strike to heel-strike.</s><s>Heel-strikes and toe-offs were defined using a GRF threshold of 25 N.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p><s>In general, all subjects were able to successfully undertake all activities.</s><s>Considerable variations in both kinematic and kinetic parameters were observed between subjects, but also between trials in individuals.</s><s>Exemplary results of the kinematic and kinetic parameters obtained by moving video-fluoroscopy and the instrumented knee implant during different activities are presented for one subject (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>However, it is our intention that complete datasets for all subjects, activities, trials and measurement modalities will be made freely available for non-commercial usage.</s><s>Consequently, the following results are all presented as mean values over all subjects in order to provide a greater overview of the population kinematics and kinetics:</s></p><p><s>Knee flexion angles during level walking, downhill walking and stair decent exhibited a biphasic pattern for all subjects.</s><s>The mean knee flexion ROM across all subjects for level walking was 56.0 ± 6. 4°, 65.2 ± 3.0°for downhill walking, and 87.1 ± 4.4 for stair descent.</s><s>The sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit activities resulted in a knee flexion to a mean of 76.0 ± 6.8°, and extended to a mean of À3.9 ± 11.2°.</s><s>In a similar manner, the knee flexion reached a mean of 73.1 ± 9.4°during the squat activity.</s></p><p><s>The mean ad-abduction of the knee remained nearly constant throughout all activities and did not exceed 2°.</s><s>External rotation of the tibia was rarely observed.</s><s>Internal rotation of the tibia increased with increasing knee flexion for almost all activities, resulting in a relatively large RoM, ranging from 3°external (occurring during gait) to 9.3°internal (during squats) rotation.</s><s>A-P translation of the nearest medial and lateral articular points (described above) demonstrated different patterns during different activities, but with similar RoMs.</s><s>The greatest RoM was measured during stair descent (medial 9.3 ± 1.0 mm, lateral 7.5 ± 1.6 mm), while the lowest RoM was observed during the stand-to-sit activity (medial 4.5 ± 1.1 mm, lateral 3.7 ± 1.4 mm).</s><s>The minimum p-d distance between the tibial and femoral components remained relatively constant, but some variations were visible during the walking task in this subject.</s><s>The mean range of p-d distance was 1.4 ± 0.3 mm, 1.7 ± 0. 6 mm, 2.0 ± 0.5 mm, 1.1 ± 0.2 mm, 1.3 ± 0.3 mm, 1.5 ± 0.5 mm for level walking, ramp walking, stair descent, stand-to-sit, sit-tostand, and squat respectively.</s></p><p><s>The tibio-femoral joint contact forces reached a mean peak of 2.74 BW during walking (highest single peak value of 3.73 BW was found in the database: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), 2.73 BW during sit-to-stand, 2.57 BW during stand-to-sit, and 2.64 BW during the squat exercises.</s><s>However, considerably higher forces of approximately 3.38 BW and 3.39 BW were observed during stair descent and ramp descent respectively.</s><s>In general, the compressive forces followed different patterns during different activities; however, these patterns had nearly consistent shapes between subjects.</s><s>As can be seen from the maximum and minimum values across all subjects and all trials (shown as '' ⁄ " and ''o" respectively for walking only; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), considerable variability was observable between subjects.</s><s>Of note was that the highest joint contact forces did not necessarily relate to the joint kinematics.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Accurate knowledge of the relationship between joint kinematics and kinetics in vivo forms the foundation of understanding and improving many clinical and rehabilitation treatments in the fields of orthopaedics and sports medicine.</s><s>To date, however, access to such datasets remains astonishingly restricted.</s><s>In this CAMS-Knee project, we have directly addressed this deficit by providing accurate kinematic and kinetic data in a small population during a range of functional activities.</s><s>After their public release in 2018, these unique datasets will lay the foundations for understanding the complex interactions between the hard and soft tissue structures in the human knee and can thus be used towards e.g.</s><s>verifying and improving novel surgical implants, developing injury prevention or rehabilitation strategies, and analysing the biomechanics of joint degeneration, but will also importantly provide a gold standard for the validation of biomechanical computational models.</s></p><p><s>To date, the most extensive datasets that include accurate measurements of the internal tibio-femoral joint contact forces have been made available on www.orthoload.com or published as part of the grand challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fregly et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kinney et al., 2013)</ref>; but this data is limited in several ways, including number of subjects, accuracy of the kinematic measurements, extensiveness of the datasets (repetitions, number of activities, etc.), and limited range of measurement for moving activities.</s><s>The data measured within the CAMS-Knee project are the first datasets to be made publicly available that include comprehensive data on multiple subjects, activities, repetitions and synchronized measurement technologies.</s></p><p><s>The CAMS-Knee data are aligned with previous reports on internal tibio-femoral loads <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fregly et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kinney et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kutzner et al., 2010)</ref>, in which forces of 2.5-3 BW for normal walking were presented.</s><s>The observed higher forces during stair decent and ramp descent were not unexpected due to the increase in muscle activity required to induce the movement and joint stabilisation in these more challenging exercises, and are also consistent with previous measurements in these <ref type="bibr">subjects (www.orthoload.com)</ref>.</s><s>In terms of kinematics, it is clear that this highly constrained prosthesis limits the motion of the knee, even during walking, producing similar A-P translation and internalexternal rotation to other implants <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mahoney et al., 2009)</ref>, but slightly less rotation compared to the natural knee <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lafortune et al., 1992)</ref>, where internal-external rotation of up to 10°was observed.</s><s>The collected data were not all obvious however, and open a number of questions for further investigation.</s><s>For example, p-d motion between the implant components was observed in the presented level walking data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), posing the question as to whether lift-off of the femoral component occurs.</s><s>In this case, we are of the opinion that no lift-off occurs, but rather that the simultaneous posterior translation of the lateral condyle pushes the components apart due to the congruous shape of the inlay, but that contact with the inlay still remains; a hypothesis that is supported by the smooth proximal movement of the femoral component over an extended duration of the cycle, but also that this period coincides with the phase of highest tibial internal rotation.</s><s>However, it is entirely possible that the loading and unloading of the implant, which has hardly been measured throughout complete cycles in real world (non-treadmill) scenarios previously, could partially explain this anomaly.</s><s>The observed peak p-d motion ranges from ca. 3-7mm in other subjects and trials, however, possibly indicates the requirement for improved 2D ?</s><s>3D component registration to remove outliers, or indeed possible lift-off of the femoral component.</s><s>Further investigation into such aspects is clearly warranted, and will hopefully be undertaken in future collaborative projects.</s></p><p><s>A number of limitations to the quality of the data collected exist.</s><s>First and foremost, only a single-plane fluoroscope was used for the analysis of internal kinematics, and 2D-3D fitting accuracy in the out-of-plane axis is known to be lower than for in-plane registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Foresti, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, the assessment of e.g.</s><s>femoral component to inlay contact may be limited.</s><s>In addition, the quality of the images, and therefore the accuracy of 2D-3D registration, is limited when the second leg crosses through the imaging plane.</s><s>This problem was exacerbated in this study since four out of the six subjects assessed possessed bi-lateral TKAs.</s><s>As a result, a small number of images were obscured by the contralateral implant and could not be reconstructed.</s><s>In addition, the subjects assessed in this study averaged 68years old and possessed at least one TKA.</s><s>The interpretation and extrapolation of any musculoskeletal assessments to younger or healthy subjects may be limited, especially in light of the highly congruent INNEX knee implant that is known to considerably constrain tibio-femoral translation and rotation.</s><s>Unfortunately, no detailed analysis of the pre-operative kinematics and kinetics was performed, therefore also restricting a deeper understanding of any correlation with e.g.</s><s>pre-operative limb alignment.</s><s>Finally, it is known that the moving fluoroscope can encumber free walking through unusual noise and visual impediments, producing a kinematic equivalent of slow walking <ref type="bibr">(Hitz et al., in review)</ref>.</s><s>Despite these limitations, the ETH Zürich moving fluoroscope is one of the only systems available worldwide that is able to track the knee during complete cycles of activities of daily living, and thereby still offers a unique insight into joint kinematics in combination with GRF measurements, throughout loaded and unloaded phases of gait.</s></p><p><s>After a proprietary period for data analysis, the comprehensive CAMS-Knee datasets will become freely available for noncommercial usage at www.cams-knee.orthoload.com.</s><s>In order to download the full datasets, recipients will be required to sign a licence agreement, provide full name, position, and contact details, but also specify their intended usage of the data.</s><s>With this information, we anticipate building a community of users, who will be able to interact, support each other, and even provide e.g.</s><s>open source models based on the datasets.</s><s>As a result, we expect the CAMS-Knee data to positively impact on current scientific and clinical approaches for the assessment and management of joint disease and injury, with tremendous potential for becoming reference datasets in medical innovation world-wide.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Coordinate system of the instrumented tibial tray.</s><s>Figure adapted from (Kutzner et al., 2010) and reprinted with permission.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,53.29,67.92,229.69,115.48" type="bitmap" /></figure>
