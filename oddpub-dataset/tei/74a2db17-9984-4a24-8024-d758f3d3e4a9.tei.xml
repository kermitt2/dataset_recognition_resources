in controls.</s></p><p><s>Analogous to glutamate release, aspartate release of AWR in the desflurane sub-group showed a tendency to be lower over the entire timecourse of microdialysis, with significant differences apparent from 140 min after induction.</s><s>Under sevoflurane anesthesia, there were no apparent group differences in aspartate release.</s><s>Induction of isoflurane caused an increase in aspartate release in AWR relative to controls for the first 40 minutes of anesthesia.</s></p><p><s>Aspartate is an excitatory neurotransmitter of the NMDA receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, but the excitotoxicity seems to be less severe in comparison to glutamate <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Both glutamate and aspartate, the excitatory amino acids we measured in this study, are absorbed out of the synaptic gap mostly due to excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT).</s><s>These transporters are the most important regulators of excitatory neurotransmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, but their function is reduced under chronic alcohol exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, leading to impaired glutamate uptake during withdrawal.</s></p><p><s>The different EAAT are thought to be partly responsible for the varying effects of each of the volatile anesthetics, but the precise molecular pathways underlying these effects remain unclear.</s><s>Volatile anesthetics reduce exocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, and increase excitatory transmitter uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>An increased activity of EAAT3 has been shown under isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane anesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr"

trafficking <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is remarkable that neuronal structures adapted to alcohol seem to respond more sensitively to volatile anesthesia, and are more efficient in reducing excitatory neurotransmitters than those that are not adapted.</s></p><p><s>Under each volatile anesthetic, our data showed an increase in arginine release over the entire microdialysis timecourse, both in AWR and alcohol-naïve rats.</s><s>When compared to the control group, the release of arginine in the AWR group was lower under isoflurane, equal under sevoflurane, and higher under desflurane.</s><s>GABA release under isoflurane increased over the timecourse, according to the known mode of action.</s><s>However under sevoflurane, we did not measure any increase in GABA release.</s><s>Under desflurane, GABA release was lower in AWR than controls at the majority of the timepoints measured.</s><s>These results might be due to limitations in the microdialysis approach, since the potentiation of GABA-induced currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> cannot be measured by this method.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations to the Study</head><p><s>Since this study was performed as a pilot study, we did not statistically estimate the sample size beforehand.</s><s>A possible consequence of this is that the data sample collected was not sufficiently large to show significant differences for particular comparisons.</s></p><p><s>The spread of data in the alcohol group may reflect variability due to differences in individual metabolism and alcohol uptake behavior from the unforced uptake protocol, which we used based on the recommendations of the institutional animal care board.</s><s>Comparable studies with strict, regular feeding procedures, such as intragastric feeding or intraperitoneal application, showed lower variability but a similar onset time for withdrawal.</s></p><p><s>In this study, every anesthetic treatment group was matched with its own control group.</s><s>This method is not suitable for comparing the treatment groups, and so direct comparisons of the three anesthetics to each other cannot be made.</s></p><p><s>Although sevoflurane and desflurane are routinely used in clinical practice, only a few experimental studies have been published which investigate the mode of action and effects of both anesthetics.</s><s>Isoflurane is predominantly used in such experiments, although it is rarely used in clinical practice in industrialized nations.</s><s>This fact makes a reliable translation of our results to human clinical practice difficult.</s></p><p><s>Volatile anesthetics have an alcohol-like effect on the NMDA receptor through their action as noncompetitive antagonists <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and isoflurane even leads to a compensatory increase in expression of the NMDA subunit NR2B <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>To evaluate the total inhibitory effect of the anesthetics, it is necessary to consider not only the concentration of transmitters, but also their induced currents and postsynaptic effects.</s><s>The microdialysis approach alone is not sufficient to measure such effects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In this study, we showed an increased glutamate release in AWR during alcohol withdrawal compared to controls.</s><s>Desflurane induction led to a moderate glutamate increase in AWR, whereas aspartate and GABA levels gradually decreased over the timecourse, following the increase in glutamate release.</s><s>Under isoflurane, aspartate release was elevated in AWR compared to controls after induction, whilst the controls showed higher arginine concentrations.</s><s>There were no group differences under sevoflurane anesthesia.</s><s>All three anesthetics intensified the release of arginine over the timecourse.</s></p><p><s>Due to the complexity and lack of clarity regarding the mechanisms of action of the anesthetics, presenting reliable explanations for the effects we observed would be challenging.</s><s>Since EAAT are the most important known regulators of excitatory neurotransmission, their differing affinities with each of the volatile anesthetics used in this study may explain their variable effects, and could be a good starting point for further research.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
