<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAteRIALs ANd Methods</head><p><s>Development and feasibility testing of the scale was part of the preparations for a study on "Evaluation of Care Models based on the Regional Psychiatric Budget acc.</s><s>§64b, V Book of German Social Law.</s><s>" Since these care models were new to German psychiatry there was no appropriate questionnaire to ask for patient's evaluation in this setting thus creating the need for developing an own instrument.</s><s>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Medical Chamber Brandenburg [2016, No. S 7 (a)].</s><s>All eligible patients were given a comprehensive description of the study and informed that their participation or refusal would not affect their care.</s><s>After positive patient decision of participation, the written informed consent was obtained.</s></p><p><s>The development and biometric evaluation of the scale were carried out in construction and pilot testing phases.</s><s>The construction of the scale included five steps.</s><s>Firstly, for generating the items, we examined the scientific literature regarding existing scales for assessment mental health services.</s><s>The most salient themes from these searches were developed into a topic guide for stage 2. Stage 2 consisted of a qualitative study, using the Grounded Theory Methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(18)</ref> in order to extract relevant components of CSMHC: psychiatric patients, their kin and mental health care workers were asked about their experiences with CSMHC and recurrent themes were used to generate items.</s><s>Thirdly, the first author (Yuriy Ignatyev) created an item pool and a scientific expert panel which consisted of a psychologist and two psychiatrists assessed the content validity of the scale.</s><s>The expert panel evaluated the wording and item allocation of the tool.</s><s>In the fourth step, we evaluated face validity.</s><s>A group of 90 patients from three German hospitals (Imland Klinik Rendsburg, Psychiatrische Klinik Lüneburg, Immanuel Klinik und Poliklinik Rüdersdorf) experienced in with CSMHC were asked to evaluate each item and to indicate if they felt difficulties in replying to the questions.</s><s>An item was considered to be adapted or excluded if it was problematic for at least five patients.</s><s>In the fifth step, selected items were checked for reliability, and then items with at least acceptable Cronbach's α values were combined to generate the preliminary version of the scale.</s><s>The biometric evaluation aimed to take specific experience of patient into account as it was documented by part one of the questionnaire.</s><s>In addition, intra-rater reliability was estimated by ratings for contradictory questions in part two of the questionnaire.</s><s>The evaluation method was developed a priori, i.e., not based on empirical data.</s></p><p><s>The testing phase was carried out using a cross-sectional design in mental health departments of 7 from 16 German hospitals (Klinikum Itzehoe, Südharz Klinikum Nordhausen, Imland Klinik Rendsburg, Rudolf-Virchow-Klinikum Glauchau, Westenküstenklinikum Heide, Immanuel Klinik und Poliklinik Rüdersdorf, Psychiatrische Klinik Lüneburg) that offer CSMHC, from June to December 2016.</s><s>The only criterion for the inclusion of any hospital into the research program was the given consent of hospitals administration.</s><s>The sampling was conducted on the basis of equal patient strata from different care sectors (stations, day hospitals, outpatients' clinics, and on a number of occasions home treatment).</s><s>The recruitment process within each care sector was based on a randomized design.</s><s>A study group in each hospital consisted of one or two research doctors/psychologists.</s><s>The inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 18 years, capacity to provide informed consent, ability to read, and understand German.</s><s>Patients were excluded if they were involuntarily admitted or if their clinical condition limited comprehension (acute mental disorders, severe mental disability, etc.) as judged by their psychiatrist.</s><s>To assess current psychopathology, a short version of the SCL-90-R (19) was used.</s><s>The questionnaires were filled out by the participants without assistance.</s><s>Additionally, some sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (gender, age, education status, employment status, family status, and duration of current mental disorder) were obtained.</s></p><p><s>A case number of 300 patients was calculated for the preliminary testing of the questionnaire and the biometric method to analyze it.</s><s>This sample size was calculated to be efficient to detect effect sizes of about 0.333 between two groups of 150 patients or a correlation coefficient of 0.16 between two measures of each patient as significant with α = 5% and power = 80% which seemed convenient for a feasibility study.</s><s>A p &gt; 5% and &lt;10% were thought to represent a trend toward significance.</s></p><p><s>Common descriptive statistics (count, mean, SD, min, max, and median) were computed for all examined variables.</s><s>No imputation for missing ratings was conducted as the rate of missing values was less than 5%.</s><s>The heterogeneity of the responses to specific items was estimated as a quotient of the theoretical variance of random response (equally distributed) by the empirical variance.</s><s>With respect to the experience questions only affirmative answers (YES) were taken into account as relevant.</s><s>Both missing affirmative and negative (YES and NO) answers were interpreted as "no experience.</s><s>"</s></p><p><s>In order to be able to use the developed ratings as dependent variables for later CSMHC studies, the shape of the resulting distribution of total ratings was checked by estimating skewness and kurtosis and their SDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>The relevancy of both statistics was inspected by comparing the quotient of their value by their SD with the numeric value 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Findings</head><p><s>The development process resulted into an 18-item scale with, in the first section a two-point and, in the second section a fivepoint response options.</s><s>The first section is related to the patients' experiences with different relevant components of CSMHC such as home treatment, flexibility of treatments' switching, case management, cross-sectoral treatment groups' offerings, and interdisciplinary professional practice.</s><s>The second section addresses the patients' opinions regarding these relevant components.</s><s>Using raw and transformed scoring resulted into comparable results.</s><s>However, the transformed data showed a smaller deviation from normality and a higher reliability.</s><s>Therefore, the application of transformed scoring should be preferred.</s></p><p><s>The developed scale showed a good internal reliability in the measurement of CSMHC.</s><s>Linear regression analyses demonstrated that the scale has postdictive validity for patient opinions based on their experiences with relevant components of CSMHC.</s><s>Self-reported experiences with home treatment, flexibility of treatments' switching, case management, cross-sectoral treatment groups' offerings, and interdisciplinary professional practice using the Scale for Evaluation of Psychiatric Integrative and Continuous Care (SEPICC) were positively associated with the approval of these mental health care components.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>strengths and Limitations</head><p><s>To the best of our knowledge, the SEPICC is the first measurement combining differentiated experiences and opinions by  patients in regional psychiatric budget hospitals about specific items in relation to the use of CSMHC as part of the treatment program.</s><s>The tool is brief and simple to use so that it can be applied in mental health care practices.</s><s>As there is no gold standard for assessing CSMHC, this scale provides a good starting point for further testing and development as well as a pilot scale that can be used in the evaluation of treatment programs.</s><s>However, the lack of a gold standard metric limits our understanding of the concurrent validity of our tool.</s><s>Secondly, due to the cross-sectional design of the present study and practical reasons, we were not able to evaluate the test-retest reliability of the scale.</s><s>Future studies should assess other psychometric properties of the SEPICC such as discriminant validity, construct validity, and criterion validity using administrative records, provider's perception as well as its measurement invariance across different patient groups.</s><s>Our research group plans to test for divergent validity of the SEPICC using comparison with a scale measuring general patients' satisfaction without health service specification.</s><s>Thirdly, on the basis of our sensitivity analysis the best results were obtained by using transformed scoring that is different from the traditional raw scoring.</s><s>However, results from both traditional and transformed scoring largely coincided.</s><s>Fourthly, the survey was conducted at only seven hospitals, raising the issue of the findings' generalizability.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the majority of the patients in the present study were relatively highly educated.</s><s>In future studies, it would be necessary to examine the psychometric properties of the SEPICC in patients with different levels of education.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison against the Literature</head><p><s>The comparison of domains which are specific for our scale and analogous international instruments reflects differences between relevant components of mental health care configurations.</s><s>Whereas several key principles of Assertive Community Treatment such as holistic approach to services, integrated services, continuity of care, delivery of services in the community, and multidisciplinary team <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> are well incorporated in the German CSMHC, other features, like full responsibility for treatment services, high frequency of contact to patients are less common in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>In many instances, our findings replicate previous studies conducted on the basis of self-reported scales, which showed good criterion validity regarding different relevant components of Assertive Outreach Teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, Assertive Community Treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, Crisis Resolution Teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, Case Management <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, Disease Management <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, and Community Mental Health Teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>Remarkably, existing studies identified primarily positive associations between some experiences with innovative mental health care and patient satisfaction.</s><s>Whereas existing self-reported satisfaction scales focus on individual treatment aspects such as continuity of care <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>, interdisciplinary treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, or communication (9), our tool comprises in short form different dimensions of mental health care, which can be presented as total score.</s></p><p><s>Several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(17)</ref> reported that psychopathology may account for 3-28% of the variance in patient ratings depending on the specific sample and treatment setting.</s><s>Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> showed that almost 98% of variance in patients' experiences could be attributed to differences between patients rather than the care unit in which they were treated.</s><s>For example, younger patients reported significantly less positive perceptions of continuity of care.</s><s>In another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, evidence was found to suggest that satisfaction rates with home treatment were influenced by monthly income and duration of enrollment in the program: individuals with fewer financial resources were in greater need of home care services, hence reporting higher satisfaction, and vice versa.</s><s>As our scale enabled patients to express their evaluations instead of their degrees of satisfactions, based on the regression analyses, it may be concluded that SEPICC scores may not be dominated by the degree of patient symptom levels or other examined co-variables.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>contradiction score with respect to the pair A, B: C (A, B) = abs (4 − (A + B))/4 as (A, B)− and reliability score with respect to A,B: Rel (A,B) = 1 − C(A;B) combined reliability score of each patient: Rel = Mean (Rel (R3, R8), Rel (R5, R10))</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
