<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affective Word Processing in Context</head><p><s>In order to develop sufficiently precise neurocognitive models of affective word processing <ref type="bibr">(Jacobs et al., 2015, this issue)</ref> such studies on single word processing appear to be in need of complementary research characterized by higher degrees of ecological validity, as shown in recent attempts at more natural approaches to language use and reading (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Altmann et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hsu et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">Hsu et al., , 2015a,b,c;,b,c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wallot, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Willems, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Up to now only, a few studies have examined affective word processing in sentence contexts.</s><s>Pioneers in this respect were <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fischler and Bradley (2006)</ref>, who investigated the processing of coherent adjective noun phrases.</s><s>They basically replicated ERP differences between negative and positive words compared to neutral ones in different time windows, which were usually found in studies on single word processing.</s><s>The enhanced processing for emotional compared to neutral words were also replicated for words embedded in whole meaningful sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(De Pascalis et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Holt et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bayer et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Martín-Loeches et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Scott et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Delaney-Busch and Kuperberg, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ding et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Other studies demonstrated that the pronounced effect for positive words could also be observed within phrases and sentences.</s><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Schacht and Sommer (2009)</ref> examined the processing of positive, negative and neutral verbs in a minimal semantic context (i.e., word pairs) and found that the ERPs for emotional verbs following a single noun reflect enhanced processing compared to neutral ones.</s><s>Moreover, their behavioral data showed an advantage for positive verbs across different tasks.</s><s>Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jiang et al. (2014)</ref> demonstrated that sentences containing a high pleasure adjective lead to shorter reaction times in a valence decision task than sentences containing low pleasure adjectives.</s><s>This effect occurred irrespective of sentence polarity.</s><s>Even when containing a negation, reaction times for sentences with high pleasure adjectives were shorter, although the negation changed the valence of the whole sentences.</s><s>The behavioral effects were accompanied by an early ERP effect for the emotional adjectives indicating advanced processing for high pleasure adjectives.</s><s>Besides the main effect of valence, the authors described a significant interaction between word valence and sentence polarity in later time windows, which were more strongly associated with contextual integration.</s><s>They assumed that after the rapid extraction of word valence, further processing of emotional words like the integration in a mental representation of the whole phrase (e.g., a situation model), is influenced by the sentence context.</s><s>There exists empirical evidence, that not only context information influences the processing of emotional words but also that the emotional salience of a word can modulate its integration into sentences or discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(León et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Moreno and Vázquez, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Leuthold et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ding et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hsu et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">Hsu et al., , 2015a,b,c),b,c)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wang et al. (2013)</ref> presented plausible questionanswer pairs while varying the emotional salience of the target word and its linguistic focus.</s><s>Besides typical early ERP effects indicating an initial highly automatic processing advantage of emotional words, an interaction between emotional salience and information structure in the later N400 component was observed.</s><s>Corresponding with <ref type="bibr">Jiang et al.'s (2014)</ref> results the authors interpreted this interaction as evidence for an attentionemotion interaction at later processing stages associated with the integration of the emotional meaning into the mental representation of the whole sentences (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">De Pascalis et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Holt et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Martín-Loeches et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Whether the emotionality of words influences the processing of following neutral words was tested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ding et al. (2014)</ref>.</s><s>They presented orthographically correct and incorrect neutral object nouns after emotional and neutral verbs in the context of simple declarative sentences.</s><s>The ERP effects observed for the orthographic violation differed for emotional compared to neutral context.</s><s>Whereas, after neutral verbs orthographically incorrect nouns elicited a smaller P2 and a larger N400 compared to correct nouns, only a late positive effect starting at 500 ms was observed after emotional verbs.</s><s>The authors' interpretation was that emotional words captured and held more attentional processes compared to neutral ones and thus compromised the early processing of following neutral words leading to a general reanalysis especially on perceptual and lexico-semantic levels.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does the Processing of Emotional Words Influence the Processing of other Emotional Words?</head><p><s>Despite the growing number of studies investigating effects of embedded emotional words, up to now is not clear to what extent the processing of such words influences the processing of other emotional words presented in the same sentence.</s><s>Regarding the processing of single words effects of the emotional connotation of one word on the processing of a following word are usually described as affective priming (cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fazio, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">De Houwer et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fazio et al. (1986)</ref> first described a processing advantage for emotional target words following an emotionally congruent prime in an evaluative decision task, subsequent research replicated and extended the original findings many times (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Klauer and Musch, 2003</ref>, for a review).</s><s>Typically, faster and less error-prone responses were observed when prime and target are affectively congruent (i.e., positive-positive, negativenegative) than when they are incongruent (i.e., positive-negative, negative-positive).</s><s>Most important, affective priming effects have also been found for (implicit) tasks not focusing on the processing of the emotional meaning, e.g., naming and lexical decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hill and Kemp-Wheeler, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bargh et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">De Houwer and Randell, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Spruyt et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>These studies support the view, that affective priming effects can be explained with a pre-activation of evaluatively congruent targets by spreading activation within a semantic network or by semantic pattern priming in a distributed memory system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bargh et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fazio, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Spruyt et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Hofmann and Jacobs, 2014</ref>; for a neurocomputational model implementing such a mechanism).</s><s>Especially in evaluative decision tasks, processes related to response priming also seem relevant.</s><s>Here it is assumed that affective primes automatically activate the corresponding evaluative response that is the correct one in congruent, but the incorrect one in incongruent trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Klauer and Musch, 2003)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Klauer et al. (2005)</ref> assumed that response-related priming should be larger than semantically mediated priming effects.</s><s>This is in line with the observation that in tasks in which the affective prime-target congruency is unrelated to the response and the task at hand, affective priming effects could not be observed reliably <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Klauer and Musch, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Primarily due to the last fact it still remains unclear, whether or not the processing of emotional words is mutually interrelated when they are embedded in sentences.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ding et al. (2014)</ref> demonstrated that emotional words influenced the processing of upcoming neutral words.</s><s>Whether these influences differ for upcoming emotional words as suggested by semantically mediated affective priming effects reported for single word processing is an empirical question.</s><s>Up to now only <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fischler and Bradley's (2006)</ref> study explored possible interaction effects.</s><s>They reported no significant congruence effects on ERPs recorded for positive, neutral, and negative nouns following positive, neutral, or negative adjectives.</s><s>The ERPs observed for the nouns did not differ as a function of the emotional meaning of the preceding adjective, irrespective of whether the two consecutive words were processed as phrases or as single words.</s><s>As discussed by the authors, one reason for the non-occurrence of any congruence effects could be the presentation mode, i.e., the ERP-typical serial presentation of words separated by a blank monitor.</s><s>As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hermans et al. (2001)</ref> affective priming effects are moderated by the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between prime and target.</s><s>They appear to be based on fast-acting automatic processes, are quite shortlived, and thus should only be observed reliably for SOAs below 300 ms.</s><s>Fischler and Bradley, however, used longer SOAs of 750 ms between the emotional words.</s><s>As discussed by the authors these circumstances might have minimized the possibility to observe any interaction.</s></p><p><s>In spite of the possibility that affective priming is limited to tasks focusing on valence evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Klauer and Musch, 2003)</ref>, results from a recent study on sentence comprehension indicated, that the processing of emotional words embedded in sentences could be influenced by emotional information delivered by preceding words.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">León et al. (2010)</ref> measured ERPs for positive or negative adjectives qualifying the emotion of protagonists that were introduced in narratives describing emotional episodes presented before the critical sentences.</s><s>The protagonist's emotions mentioned in the critical sentences were either consistent or inconsistent with the preceding story.</s><s>Inconsistent emotions were found to elicit larger N1/P2 and N400 complexes than consistent emotions, indicating clear interactions between the emotional valence of the critical word and the emotional meaning of the context.</s><s>Given the significant temporal interval between the reading of the context story and the on-line sentence processing, the authors interpreted the congruency effects as a discourse level phenomenon.</s><s>Although the authors argued, that such effects could not be observed in isolated words.</s><s>It is unclear whether these effects could also be due to some form of long-term affective priming based on an automatic spread of evaluative activation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Eder et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affective Meaning Making at the Supralexical Level</head><p><s>Most of the studies presented above focus on the early processing of emotional words or its integration into sentence context.</s><s>The issue of how the affective meaning of phrases or sentences as supralexical units is constructed from the words constituting this unit was not explored.</s><s>Based on the logico-philosophical tradition since Frege, according to which the literal meaning of a sentence could be determined by the meanings of its parts and their syntactical combination, it can be assumed that the emotion potential of supralexical units is a (linear or non-linear) function of the emotion potential of the words included therein <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hsu et al., 2015c;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jacobs, 2015a,b)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, the simplest model predicting the emotion potential of a sentence should take into account only the emotional or connotative meaning of its component words while neglecting other potentially relevant influences like their syntactic role or the constituents' order <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Jacobs, 2015a)</ref>.</s><s>Following this account a simple declarative sentence containing a positive noun and a negative adjective like "The mother is bad" should -on average-be evaluated as neutral.</s><s>First empirical evidence for this "null-model" of supralexical affective meaning was obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bestgen (1994)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Whissell (1994)</ref>, both demonstrating that the valence of supralexical units could be predicted-to a considerable extentas a function of the emotional or connotative meaning of their component words.</s></p><p><s>This most simple model does not take into account other potentially relevant variables, e.g., different syntactic roles of words, which could also be relevant for affective meaning construction.</s><s>The simple "The mother is bad" contains a noun and an adjective.</s><s>While nouns occur as the head of a noun phrase and refer to concrete entities such as people or things, adjectives characterize noun phrases and modify their meaning.</s><s>Therefore, especially evaluative and emotive adjectives denoting specific features of possible noun referents may induce deeper elaborative affective processing than nouns.</s><s>Empirical evidence for this assumption comes from an ERP-study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Palazova et al. (2011)</ref> reporting differences in emotional effects in single word processing of nouns and adjectives.</s><s>Besides an early effect for emotional compared to neutral words for both nouns and adjectives, Palazova et al. observed a second emotion effect around 450 ms, but this time only for adjectives.</s><s>They interpreted this Late Positivity Complex (LPC) observed for positive compared to both neutral and negative adjectives as an index of sustained and elaborate processing of the emotional aspects of adjectives, which was possibly not induced by nouns.</s><s>Thus, if an adjective is presented not in isolation but as predicative adjective modulating the meaning of a noun, it can be assumed, that the emotional meaning of the adjective dominates the affective meaning of the supralexical unit as a whole.</s><s>A recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Liu et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims of the Present Study</head><p><s>The present study was designed to investigate to what extent the processing of emotional words within a sentence context shows interactive effects.</s><s>It is now a well-established result that both the early processing of a word as well as the following integration into the context of a phrase, sentence, or short discourse can be modulated by the emotional connotation of that word.</s><s>Whether or not the processing of an emotional word is also influenced by the processing of other emotional words presented in the same sentence remains, however, an open question.</s><s>Results from the field of affective priming suggest that interactive effects are possible even in tasks not focusing on the emotional meaning of the words or phrases.</s><s>However, possible congruency effects are very short-lived.</s><s>To observe reliable interaction effects, it seems necessary that the crucial words are processed within a time window of about 300 ms.</s><s>In order to test such interaction effects between emotional words we therefore presented simple declarative sentences containing a noun and an adjective (e.g., The grandpa is clever) separated only by a short auxiliary verb.</s><s>Combined with a self-paced reading paradigm this ensured that the critical time window was obtained.</s><s>To investigate the influence of the emotional connotation the valence of the nouns and adjectives was manipulated using the Berlin Affective Word List (BAWL; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Võ et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jacobs et al., this issue)</ref>.</s><s>To ensure processing at sentence level participants had to decide whether a sentence was meaningful (e.g., The grandpa is clever) or not (e.g., The cheese is intelligent).</s></p><p><s>Besides the question whether the early processing of emotional words presented in sentences is interrelated, we were also interested in seeing how the affective meaning of single words influenced the interpretation of the sentences as a supralexical unit.</s><s>To investigate this aspect of meaning construction, we expand the present study by a second task requiring an explicit and deep processing of the affective meaning of words.</s><s>The meaningful emotional sentences used in the sentence verification task were presented again, but this time participants had to rate the emotional valence and arousal of the whole sentences as supralexical units.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head><p><s>Although a sentence verification task does not require explicit processing of the affective meaning of words to yield correct responses, we generally expected that the emotional valence of nouns and adjectives automatically influences the reaction times.</s><s>Empirical research on single word processing provides ample demonstrations that even a superficial semantic elaboration as required for lexical decisions is sufficient for observing emotional effects <ref type="bibr">(Jacobs et al., 2015, this issue)</ref>.</s><s>Based on the above-mentioned literature, we therefore anticipated shorter verification times for sentences containing emotional adjectives compared to sentences with neutral ones.</s><s>Moreover, due to the often-reported processing advantage of positive over negative words, we also expected shorter verification times for sentences with positive compared to negative adjectives and nouns, i.e., a positivity superiority effect.</s><s>If the emotionality of a word basically influenced its early processing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Recio et al., 2014)</ref>-and if the positivity superiority was a general phenomenon-the following rank order of verification times should be obtained: emotionally congruent sentences with no positive word &gt; emotionally incongruent sentences with only one positive word &gt; emotionally congruent sentences with two positive words.</s><s>If, on the other hand, the processing of emotional nouns and adjectives interacted, as suggested by the affective priming literature, verification times should be faster for sentences with emotionally congruent words (e.g., sentences with positive nouns followed by positive adjectives) than for emotionally incongruent sentences and sentences with neutral adjectives.</s><s>This rank order should be reflected in a significant interaction between the two variables indicating the valence of the noun (valence group-noun) and the adjective (valence group-adjective).</s><s>To ensure that a potential interaction effect depends primarily on the emotional relation between nouns and adjectives, we controlled the semantic associations between them.</s><s>As shown neurocomputationally by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hofmann and Jacobs (2014)</ref> direct first-order co-occurrences of two words are valid indices of their semantic association.</s><s>We thus matched the sentence based first-order co-occurrences for nouns and adjectives in all six experimental conditions.</s></p><p><s>For the evaluation task the simple "null-model" presented above predicts that the valence ratings conducted in the second part of the study should depend equally on the valence of both of their constituents, the noun as well as the adjective.</s><s>More precisely, lower valence ratings should be observed for sentences with negative compared to positive adjectives and nouns.</s><s>This should lead to the following rank order of the sentence valence ratings: sentences with two negative words &lt; sentences with only one negative word &lt; sentences with only one positive word &lt; sentences with two positive words.</s></p><p><s>Taking into account other potentially relevant variables especially the syntactic role, different predictions arise.</s><s>The assumed dominance of emotional adjectives in the evaluation of simple supralexical units and the ubiquitous negativity bias would predict that the valence ratings of our simple declarative sentences show a negativity bias especially for adjectives.</s><s>We thus hypothesized that sentences with a negative adjective were evaluated as strongly negative, while the valence of the nouns should have only a minor influence.</s><s>For sentences with neutral and positive adjectives, the overall valence evaluation should also be influenced by both the emotional connotation of the adjectives and the nouns.</s><s>If these adjectives were preceded by negative nouns, the overall valence ratings should be biased in a more negative direction compared to sentences with positive nouns.</s></p></div>

positive nouns were verified faster than sentences with positive adjectives after negative nouns.</s><s>Mean verification times for sentences with negative adjectives after negative nouns were also shorter than those for sentences with negative adjectives after positive nouns, but this effect was smaller than the priming effect for congruent positive ones and was not significant.</s><s>Such an unbalanced priming effect only for congruent positive sentences was neither suggested by the affective priming literature nor by the literature on supralexical consequences of emotional congruency.</s><s>In both fields, congruent and incongruent trials usually are not differentiated with respect to the emotional connotation of the prime.</s><s>We can reasonably well rule out the possibility that this unbalanced priming for positive words was due to a confound of the valence manipulation with the associative strength between nouns and adjectives.</s><s>As described in the Methods Section, semantic association strength was kept constant across all conditions.</s><s>One explanation for the observed unbalanced priming effect is suggested by the recently reported phasic affective modulation hypothesis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Topolinski and Deutsch (2013)</ref>.</s><s>This hypothesis rests upon the assumption that affect regulates the breadth or extent of spreading activation from a prime to close and remote semantic associates, with positive mood fostering semantic spread and negative mood inhibiting it (cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Storbeck and Clore, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Topolinski and Deutsch demonstrated that this affective modulation can be observed not only for modulation on a tonic temporal, but also on a phasic level.</s><s>For example, the presentation of a positive tone or a positive face in one trial increased semantic priming particularly for weak associations even if the prime was presented simultaneously with the affect-inducing stimuli.</s><s>They therefore concluded that an affective prime not only induced a spread of activation, but also a phasic affective modulation.</s></p><p><s>Thus, this phasic affective modulation might also play a role in the sentence verification paradigm.</s><s>Sentences with positive nouns might induce a positive phasic mood modulation increasing spreading activation between semantic word units.</s><s>This could lead to stronger affective priming for congruent positive sentences observed in our study.</s><s>Still, this modulation effect should also at play in sentences with neutral adjectives.</s><s>Semantic associations between positive and negative nouns and positive adjectives were as high as those between both noun types and neutral adjectives.</s><s>If positive phasic modulation increased semantic priming, sentences with neutral adjectives after positive nouns should also be verified faster than sentences with neutral adjectives after negative nouns.</s><s>However, we found no evidence for this.</s><s>Thus, the phasic mood modulation hypothesis cannot fully account for the unbalanced priming effect for congruent positive sentences.</s><s>This might be the case for all approaches focusing on mechanisms, which influence early processing stages like automatic spread of semantic activation.</s><s>We assume that mechanisms at the supralexical level offer an alternative or complementing approach.</s><s>In contrast to the standard affective priming paradigm, which does not require deeper semantic processing and especially integration of prime and target, the sentence verification task clearly requires the construction of a situation model to yield correct answers.</s></p><p><s>A promising account of the unbalanced priming effect is based on recently described valence effects related to the distribution and/or frequency of affective words and the semantic cohesiveness hypothesis (cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hofmann and Jacobs, 2014)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Westbury et al. (2014)</ref> demonstrated for a very large corpus of affective words, that positive words are usually characterized by high frequencies.</s><s>Negative words are more extreme on average in absolute valence magnitudes.</s><s>The authors concluded that positive and negative words should be interpreted as distinct sets with possible differences on other dimensions than valence and frequency.</s><s>The fact that negative events tend to be more finely differentiated than positive events is one example <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Rozin and Royzman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rozin et al., 2010)</ref> that is best illustrated in discrete emotion theories which since Darwin contain more negative than positive emotions.</s><s>It could be assumed that finer differentiation of negative events hampers processing at the supralexical level, especially semantic integration and situation model construction: if negative words are less homogenous building coherent situation models for sentences with two negative words could be harder compared to sentences with two positive words.</s><s>Recently, reported results according to which positive words provide a greater amount of semantic associations than negative words are in line with this account <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hofmann et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hofmann and Jacobs, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>For sentences with two positive words, semantic activation can spread across wider associative pathways, and thereby elicit a positivity bias during meaning construction.</s><s>First evidence for this assumption is reported by <ref type="bibr">Jacobs et al. (2015, this issue)</ref>.</s><s>In a study on the comprehension of affectively uni-and bi-valent noun-noun-compounds (NNCs), Jacobs et al. reported that comprehensibility ratings for NNCs containing two positive nouns were significantly higher than ratings for bipolar NNCs (containing both a positive and a negative noun), and also higher than univalent NNCs with two negative nouns.</s><s>Based on the assumption that meaning construction is a necessary step for sentence verification, we thus would like to propose that the processing advantage observed for emotionally congruent sentences with two positive words also occurs at the supralexical level.</s><s>Nevertheless, future studies are necessary to test this hypothesis directly.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the online processing of sentences, we were also interested in the emotional evaluation at the supralexical level, as expressed by sentence-level affective ratings.</s><s>In general, our valence ratings indicated that the affective meanings of both nouns and adjectives contributed to the valence of the whole sentences, since we observed simple main effects for both.</s><s>Sentences with negative nouns were rated more negatively than sentences with positive nouns.</s><s>The same was observed for adjectives.</s><s>Sentences with negative adjectives were rated more negatively than sentences with neutral adjectives, which were rated more negatively than sentences with positive adjectives.</s><s>While these main effects are in line with the simple model predicting the emotion potential of supralexical units to be an algebraic sum of constituent word valences <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bestgen, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Whissell, 1994)</ref>, this is not the case for the observed strong interaction effect for the supralexical valence evaluations.</s><s>Sentences with positive and neutral adjectives after negative nouns were evaluated more negatively than sentences with positive and neutral adjectives after positive nouns.</s><s>For sentences with negative adjectives, no differences in supralexical valence ratings were observed.</s><s>These sentences were generally evaluated as strongly negative, independently of whether they contained a positive or negative noun.</s><s>These interactions are not in line with the simple model, but fit nicely with the assumed negativity bias especially for adjectives, described in the Hypothesis Section.</s><s>The assumed dominance of emotional adjectives in the evaluation of supralexical units and the often reported negativity bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baumeister et al., 2001)</ref> predicted that supralexical valence ratings for sentences with negative adjectives are biased into a more negative direction.</s><s>Our results demonstrated not only a simple bias into a more negative direction.</s><s>Rather, negative adjectives dominated the supralexical valence evaluation, indicated by the fact that noun valence had no notable influence on the overall valence evaluation for sentences with negative adjectives.</s><s>Our results for the supralexical valence ratings correspond to the results reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Liu et al.
