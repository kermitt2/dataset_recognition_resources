acid metabolism).</s><s>In all photosynthetic pathways, a bi-functional enzyme-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is needed to fix CO 2 into carbohydrates.</s><s>The C 4 photosynthetic pathway completes the initial and secondary CO 2 fixations using two distinct photosynthetic cell types, which form a distinct CO 2 -concentrating mechanism that significantly improves the carboxylation efficiency of Rubisco.</s><s>Consequently, C 4 plants exhibit a higher photosynthetic efficiency, biomass production, and water and nutrient usage than C 3 plants under hot, dry conditions that favor stomatal closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Diao et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Saha and Blumwald, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>These characteristics enhance the ability of plants to grow in increasingly arid environments and decrease the need for fertilizer applications.</s><s>However, many agriculturally important crops, such as rice, wheat, soybean, and potato, are C 3 plants.</s><s>Thus, the suggestion that introducing the C 4 pathway into C 3 plants may improve productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Zhu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr"

a group that included leading rice researchers.</s><s>Promising results have included the successful transfer of genes encoding key C 4 pathway enzymes into C 3 plants to improve photosynthetic efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ku et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chi et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>However, researchers have been unable to generate C 3 plants with a highly efficient CO 2 -concentrating mechanism even after transferring one or more genes encoding C 4 cycle metabolic enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Westhoff and Gowik, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>This inability has been partly due to a lack of a leaf Kranz structure, which is important for the spatial separation of enzymatic activities related to carbon fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kromdijk et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>All grass family C 4 crops have a typical Kranz structure <ref type="bibr">(Christin et al., 2013)</ref> consisting of an inner layer of relatively large bundle sheath cells around a vascular bundle.</s><s>The bundle sheath cells are surrounded by a layer of mesophyll cells that are compactly arranged to form a concentric ring-shaped structure.</s><s>These are generally only two mesophyll cells between vascular bundles in C 4 leaves as opposed to up to 18 cells in C 3 leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Sage et al.,

2010)</ref>.</s><s>These studies identified several differentially expressed genes between leaf development stages before and after the formation of the Kranz structure, and between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells.</s><s>Although these studies have suggested several candidate genes, no functional tests of these candidates have revealed regulators of the process.</s></p><p><s>Geological studies (e.g., involving carbon isotopes) and phylogenetic analyses of various species have suggested that C 4 plants evolved from C 3 plants, with structural and gene expression changes having occurred over time.</s><s>More than 66 independent events took place that caused some C 3 plants to evolve into C 4 plants, which is considered as the best example of convergent evolution <ref

2013)</ref>.</s><s>The first stage of this evolution involved structural changes, including the development of a higher leaf vein density, larger bundle sheath cell volume, as well as increased abundance and altered localization of organelles (e.g., chloroplasts and mitochondria) in bundle sheath cells.</s><s>Additionally, genes encoding specific enzymes (e.g., PEPC and GDC) began to show cell-type specific enrichment.</s><s>Moreover, 1 https://c4rice.com</s><s>CO 2 fixation occurred first in the outer leaf cells, after which the carbohydrates derived from CO 2 were fixed in the inner

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic Analysis of Kranz Anatomy in the Grasses</head><p><s>The identification of mutants in which key characteristics of C 4 photosynthesis have been disrupted represents a reliable and efficient method for elucidating the molecular basis for these traits.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rizal et al. (2015)</ref> identified two sorghum (C 4 plant) mutants with relatively low leaf vein densities.</s><s>A further analysis confirmed that the brassinolide synthesis pathway was blocked, implying this pathway may induce an increase in leaf vein density <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rizal et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Comparative genomics and bioinformatics investigations led researchers to identify many transcription factors, cis-acting elements, and differentially expressed enzymecoding genes possibly related to the C 4 pathway based on transcriptome sequencing data.</s><s>Several transcription factors have been identified, including SCR, SCL23, and SHR, which may regulate both root endodermal cell fate and leaf bundle sheath determination <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Slewinski et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Slewinski, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the genetic network controlling root endodermal cell fate may be wired very similarly to the leaf bundle sheath developmental program.</s><s>Although some insight has been gained from the genetic analysis of Kranz anatomy in the grasses, much remains to be discovered.</s><s>Here we show through the characterization of EMS induced mutations of S. italica, that forward genetic screens offer an attractive path to understanding Kranz anatomy.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we identified several mutants with disorderly arrayed leaf veins and undeveloped or abnormally developed bundle sheath cells.</s><s>For example, the t22, t42, t71, and t74 mutants lacked large, chloroplast-filled, and sheath-shaped cells surrounding vascular bundles (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4F,G,J,K</ref>), suggesting the mutated genes were associated with bundle sheath cell development, or related to the disruption of developmental regulators like SHR or SCR.</s><s>Thus, these mutants may be useful materials for comprehensive analyses of bundle sheath cell development (e.g., gene localization and cloning studies).</s><s>We observed that, in addition to not forming normal bundle sheath cells, the mutants produced thin and irregularly shaped leaves, as well as abnormally arranged epidermal and mesophyll cells (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4F,G,I</ref>).</s><s>These complex mutant phenotypes suggest the regulation of the relevant genes or their functional networks is also complex.</s></p><p><s>Combining with pictures of mutants' phenotype in field (data were not shown), mutant t22 and t71 identified in study exhibited similar plant height, panicle type and leaf size compared with wild-type Yugu1.</s><s>Especially for t22, no significant change of carbohydrate accumulation and vein space (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>) has been observed between the mutant and wild type, which might illustrate that genetic dissection of t22 would definitely provide us more detailed information of Kranz structure formation in Setaria.</s><s>Further studies focused on genetic dissections of Kranz structure mutants through MutMap or transcriptome approaches would be helpful for clarifying how Kranz anatomy came into being in the grasses.</s><s>Although we really have acquired one or two mutants that maybe special for Kranz structure, most of mutants identified in this trial may not directly relate to the Kranz structure, and exhibited pleiotropic effect (photosynthetic, chloroplast, leaf size) that may be of limited use for dissecting Kranz development.</s><s>Furthermore, some Kranz structure mutants may be missed during screening processes, despite this is a fast way for mutant identification.</s><s>Several severe mutants may not have been identified because Kranz anatomy maybe regulated by many genes and possibly redundant, thus making single or limited gene mutations a difficult way to screen mutations with completely terminated Kranz anatomy.</s><s>Also, mutations that disrupt Kranz anatomy beyond what was found in this study may be seedling lethal, and thus not detected.</s><s>Former investigations always only focused on vein density and very less leaf tissue cross sections were identified, this may be why these reports have failed to identify Kranz structure mutants.</s><s>Large scale of cross section analysis may be the only efficient way to identify Kranz structure variations occurred in mutant library.</s></p></div>
