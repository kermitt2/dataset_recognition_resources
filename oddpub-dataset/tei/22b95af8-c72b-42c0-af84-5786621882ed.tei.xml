<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major public health problem in India and Nepal where it mainly affects the poor populations of rural areas.</s><s>In Nepal the disease is endemic in twelve southern districts with an estimated population of 5.5 million people at risk.</s><s>In India VL occurs in 52 districts in the north-east of the country, mainly in the state of Bihar, in Jharkand and West Bengal.</s><s>VL is also endemic in Bangladesh.</s><s>More than 66% of the world's VL cases are found in these three countries where around 147 million people are at risk of the disease and 40,000 VL cases are registered per year <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>These figures may underestimate the true burden of disease as VL is drastically under-reported in the region <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>Active case detection revealed that the annual VL incidence per 100,000 population ranges from 43-90 cases in Nepal to 298-380 cases in Bihar, India <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>Lately, there have been important advances in the diagnostics and treatment of VL, such as the development of rK39 dipstick test and the oral drug miltefosine <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Other novel treatment options include liposomal amphotericin B and paromomycin as well as combination therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In 2005, the governments of Nepal, India and Bangladesh and the WHO committed to eliminate VL which requires to decrease VL incidence below 10 per 100,000 population by 2015 and Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) incidence to 0 by 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>To achieve VL elimination, the following areas were to be strengthened: 1) Early Diagnosis and Complete Case Management, 2) Integrated Vector Management and Vector Surveillance, 3) Effective Disease Surveillance through Passive and Active Case Detection (ACD) and Vector Surveillance, 4) Social Mobilization and Building Partnerships, 5) Clinical and Operational Research.</s></p><p><s>A challenge for early VL diagnosis remains the traditional health care seeking behavior of patients who often first consult unqualified private doctors, quacks, indigenous healers or local chemists <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, VL diagnosis can be delayed because patients remain at home for economic and social constraints despite feeling sick <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>As community mobilization and awareness raising has been performed in Nepal and India, people might seek health care faster after onset of VL symptoms now.</s><s>An additional challenge for early VL case diagnosis is the lack of appropriately equipped health facilities to rural patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>In India, the first level of the health care system is constituted by so-called Sub-Centers whereas in Nepal, Sub-health Posts and Health Posts are in use.</s><s>All first level institutions do not diagnose or treat VL.</s><s>Primary Health Centers (PHCs) and Community Health Center, secondary level health care institutions diagnose and treat VL in India whereas PHCs in Nepal do not.</s><s>District hospitals (DHs) perform diagnosis and treatment of VL in both countries but are usually located in the district capital only.</s><s>Many patients report to near public providers or, mainly in India, to private providers first and then require referral to public services which are capable of VL diagnosis or, in India, to specialized private diagnostic laboratories.</s><s>This requires well-trained health workers and also implies long travel times for patients.</s></p><p><s>To be able to perform ACD in localities where a new case has been reported, a fast and reliable VL surveillance system is required.</s><s>However, there is currently a gap between estimated and reported cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>In India, VL surveillance is complex as patients are treated by private as well as public health providers and cases treated in private facilities are not reported to the government system.</s><s>Furthermore, it is currently unclear in both countries how fast and by what means information on diagnosed and hospitalized cases is transferred to higher health authorities.</s></p><p><s>Briefly, the surveillance system in Nepal requires district hospitals to prepare a standardized hard-copy report and sent it to the District Public Health Office (D(P)HO).</s><s>The D(P)HO is then obliged to compile a joint report for the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) in Kathmandu which can then prepare an adequate public health response.</s><s>In addition, the Early Warning and Reporting System (EWARS), an electronic hospital-based sentinel surveillance system established in some districts in Nepal in 1996 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, can provide timely information to central level decision makers.</s><s>The 40 EWARS sites currently monitor VL and five other communicable diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; however, it is unclear how EWARS information currently contributes to VL elimination measures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In Bihar PHCs and district hospitals prepare a standardized hard-copy report and sent it to the District Malaria Offices (DMOs).</s><s>DMOs then compile the district report and submit it to the State Program Office Kala-Azar (SPOKA) who again forwards a compiled monthly VL state report to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) in Delhi.</s><s>The NVBDCP is the final authority for VL programs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>This study analyzes the time VL patients wait after onset of symptoms until they seek help and how much time is then required until they receive a diagnosis and treatment.</s><s>Furthermore, the study identifies how long it takes to send the patient's report from the district to the center and describes the implications of these lags for the VL elimination program.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study identified three different major lag times VL patients face when seeking treatment in Terai, Nepal, and Bihar, India.</s><s>In Bihar, the time from seeking health care to receiving a VL diagnosis is alarmingly high (90 days).</s><s>In Nepal, patients who feel sick wait too long before seeking health care (30 days).</s><s>In addition, VL reporting times of district health managers in Bihar and Nepal was recorded for the first time: in Nepal, in took 19 days to report a VL case and in Bihar it took 28 days.</s></p><p><s>For both VL endemic regions, the results of this study can be depicted as a continuous timeline from the onset of symptoms of a VL patient until this patient's case is reported to the center (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>In Nepal, this period consumes 77 days, whereas in Bihar 132 days are expended.</s></p><p><s>The VL elimination strategy is built on five pillars <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> two of which are closely linked to this study: "Early diagnosis and complete treatment of cases" and "Effective disease surveillance through passive and active case detection".</s><s>Early diagnosis and immediate treatment are not only important for individual patients to cut down  the time of suffering, but also for public health, as infected humans serve as parasite reservoir and sources of infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>VL reporting by local health managers from the district level to the central level is the backbone of VL surveillance and subsequent ACD activities.</s></p><p><s>In this study, the lag time from feeling sick to seeking health care (T P ) and the lag time from seeking health care to receiving the VL diagnosis (T D ) were identified to be major obstacles to early diagnosis and treatment.</s><s>T D, the time from initiating the search for help after feeling sick to reaching a proper diagnosis, was particularly long in Bihar (90 days) where "doctor shopping", i.e. the use of a variety of different informal and formal health care providers, was common.</s><s>In contrast, in Nepal, with its limited access to health services, the decision to go for help after feeling sick (T P ) was delayed leading to a prolonged infective period of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>This situation is unchanged in Nepal but clearly improved in Bihar compared to a previous study 4 years before our study in Bihar, Nepal and Bangladesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The observation that Bihari VL patients seem to seek health care and visit a service provider earlier than in 2008 may have the following reasons: Educational efforts about VL within the community might have been successful to the extent that the population knows at least about the socio-economic consequences of VL as well as about VL symptoms and its mode of transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and health services are now more accessible in Bihar <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>In Nepal, road conditions and accessibility of health services continue to be an issue in the VL endemic areas and the incentive of 1000 rupees might need to be raised in order to attract more patients to visit government facilities.</s><s>The previous study additionally found T D to exceed one week in 42% of cases of a combined sample of 113 patients from Bihar, Nepal and Bangladesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, compared to 79% in our study.</s><s>Although the methods and places of the study were different, lag times and thus the period of infectivity continue to be a serious problem and seem to have even deteriorated.</s><s>In Bihar, 95% of patients preferred to visit a private provider first whereas only 4% chose to visit a government doctor.</s><s>In 2003, 11.39% of patients were found to prefer the public sector in Bihar <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, indicating that the acceptance for public service providers has not increased in Bihar since nine years.</s><s>T D was significantly higher for patients initially visiting a private service provider as compared to patients visiting a government doctor or hospital.</s><s>To encourage referrals to the public sector, private providers could receive a financial bonus when referring VL patients to a government hospital.</s><s>Furthermore, "doctor shopping" and extensive utilization of the private sector could be reduced by providing IEC about VL services of the public sector in Bihar.</s><s>Also, increasing ACD could help identifying patients not self-reporting to or dropping out of the health system which would decrease T P as well as T D .</s></p><p><s>The time between diagnosis and start of treatment (T T ) was small in both countries reflecting the increased availability of miltefosine in local treatment centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>These figures represent a major advance compared to the study in 2008 when 36% of patients in Nepal, Bihar and Bangladesh had to wait for more than two weeks after the diagnosis for the start of treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> while in our study these were only 6% in Bihar and 7% in Nepal (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>).</s><s>The lag times for patients having been infected with VL for the first time and patients suffering a recurrent infection/re-infection were the same.</s><s>This is surprising, as patients might know better how to react properly to VL symptoms when experiencing them a second time.</s><s>However, patients stated that they assumed to be successfully cured and that they could not be infected with VL again indicating a lack of information about the possibility of a VL recurrence or re-infection.</s><s>Women tended to have a longer period of looking for care before receiving a VL diagnosis.</s><s>Although the differences were not statistically significant, these preliminary findings coincide with previously reported findings and general gender-based health inequalities in South Asian countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>VL reporting is a main focus of VL elimination activities which include training of health managers, revision of reporting formats and employment of additional staff.</s><s>This study presents first data on implementation and functionality of VL reporting from the district to the center in the region in Nepal and Bihar.</s><s>Only DMOs in Bihar were able to reach the target to report to the center within four weeks.</s><s>D(P)HOs in Nepal required significantly longer times to report to the center (10.8 weeks) as health managers send reports at varying times: sometimes weekly, or every four weeks (following the new national standard of 4 weeks instead of 16 weeks) or every 16 weeks.</s><s>Data reported by D(P)HOs is currently of lower importance for central level health managers in Nepal, as faster and more reliable alternatives like EWARS sentinel reporting and HMIS already exist.</s><s>EWARS sites are widely distributed in Nepal and report directly to an own department in EDCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>They cover six infectious diseases including VL, function similarly to specialized VL sentinel sites -as proposed by the VL elimination strategy-, are hospital-based and have to report weekly to the center <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, at the time of our study, 90% of health managers working in D(P)HOs did not know about EWARS sites functioning as VL sentinel sites.</s><s>HMIS data is collected in all D(P)HOs and hospitals of the country and reported monthly to the HMIS department of the Department of Health Services.</s><s>EDCD receives a copy of HMIS reports containing VL data.</s></p><p><s>In Bihar, no sentinel VL reporting sites were identified.</s><s>DMOs do not report to HMIS and VL cases are not included in standard HMIS reporting from PHCs or DHs.</s><s>Furthermore, SPOKA does not receive any VL-related information from the state or national HMIS authority.</s><s>This separation of the modern, online-based HMIS system and the paper-based VL reporting is surprising because WHO proposed to increase the linkage of VL reporting with HMIS already in 2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>This separation is evident down to the sub-district level: all PHCs were found to be equipped with computers and internet access to report to HMIS online.</s><s>However, the available HMIS infrastructure on sub-district level cannot be utilized for VL reporting due to information technology shortcomings on the district (DMOs) and state level (SPOKA).</s><s>It is now essential for center level health managers in India to closely link HMIS and VL reporting to be able to utilize these resources.</s><s>In Nepal, D(P)HOs and HMIS are better connected and EDCD incorporates data obtained from HMIS.</s><s>However, D(P)HO reporting is mainly paper-based too and email was rarely used.</s><s>In both countries no appliance of national standard VL reporting formats was observed, instead individually designed and often hand-written reporting formats were utilized which represents a major problem for data reliability.</s><s>As reported previously, observed formats did not permit to monitor patient adherence and clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, analyzing the collected data and reporting concisely and timely is very difficult to do for DMOs without a computer.</s><s>To standardize VL reporting and monitor clinical outcomes in both countries it is now important to introduce one joint electronic reporting system using the existing computer infrastructure and mobile smart phones.</s></p><p><s>In both countries district health managers do not only report according to the standard hierarchical way of their country but also to a multitude of other governmental offices/agencies.</s><s>This reporting can be relevant for the district or region (e.g.</s><s>reporting to Civil surgeons, Additional Chief Medical Officers, and Regional Health Directorates) but can also be irrelevant because the recipient simply ignores the reports.</s><s>However, although additional reporting often does not initiate direct actions of local decision makers it might increase awareness towards VL.</s></p></div>
