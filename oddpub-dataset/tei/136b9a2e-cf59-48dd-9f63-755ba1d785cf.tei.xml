<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>! Sexual violence is a major health-care political problem worldwide.</s><s>The first contact with the health-care system paves the way for the further coursesnot only for the salutogenesis of the victim but also for the forensic processing.</s><s>The present investigation illustrates a practically complete documentation of 270 cases in which the women, after making a police report about sexual violence, were treated and examined with the help of the "Charité stuprum kit" at one of the three departments of emergency medicine of the Charité (l " Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).</s><s>First of all, two possible surrogate parameters for patient-friendly treatment should be mentioned.</s><s>The long waiting times for the patients of about 1 hour on average can be explained by the generally high patient volume in the emergency departments and the usual priority-setting; patients were triaged on the basis of the Manchester triage system (MTS), and were then treated according to urgency.</s><s>Thus, life-threatening diseases and the classical somatic emergencies are treated first.</s><s>The long overall management and treatment times arose, among others, due to additional consultations or complicated examination conditions for patients with diminished vigilance, for example, after drug consumption or those in poor mental states that required additional expenditure of time.</s><s>The relatively low number of post-exposure prophylactic (PEP) measures is due to the fact that here only the treatments primarily performed by the gynaecologists are presented.</s><s>The results of later consultations in the departments of inner medicine or infectiology are often not included in the present statistics.</s><s>Examinations by a physician of the same sex as a second surrogate parameter could only be realised in a little more than half of the cases.</s><s>It is noteworthy that a large proportion of the perpetrators were reported by the victim to be "strangers".</s><s>This is due, among other things, to the way the question is posed in the MFF.</s><s>Here the sus-pected perpetrators are also recorded as "strangers" when the victims had first met them in the hours before the assault.</s><s>In addition, the prerequisite of a police report prior to management with a "Charité stuprum kit" may serve as a possible selection criterion since a larger inhibitory threshold may be assumed when reporting against a previously known perpetrator.</s><s>The treating personnel evaluated the "stuprum kit" including the management and interviewing guidelines predominantly as good to very good.</s><s>Above all the examination conditions were criticised, thus almost 40 % of the participants considered the situation to be not or rather not appropriate.</s><s>Considering the importance of an adequate and empathic primary care for victims of sexual violence, a calm and secure environment for the examination of victims should be aimed for.</s><s>However, for organisational reasons this is difficult to achieve in a hospital emergency department.</s><s>An improvement in patient-oriented care could be realised by personnel changes with regard to the guaranteed provision of medical staff of the same gender as the victim.</s><s>Furthermore, less time pressure would certainly have a positive effect on the empathy of the treating personnel and thus on the trusting relationship between the physician and the patient as well as that between nursing staff and patient.</s><s>This argues in favour ofeven if it is not easy to achieve organisationallya duty rostering that takes the victims of sexual violence as a patient group into consideration from the outset.</s><s>Against the background of the ever increasing overcrowding of emergency departments <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> with, in part, critical care situations for life-threatened patients such special provisions are, however, less realistic.</s><s>Even if most of the personnel judge their individual personal burdens beyond working hours that arise from the care of victims of sexual violence to be of "rather no" importance or as "donʼt know", it must be assumed in general that the care of victims of violence is indeed a burden for the care-giving personnel.</s><s>Studies confirm that nursing personnel in emergency departments suffer more often from stress and burnout than other nursing staff <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14]</ref>.</s><s>In a survey of the specialised nursing staff in a US American victimʼs outpatient department, over half of the participants reported on indirect traumatisation resulting from the treatment of rape victims.</s><s>The emotional challenges and worries about the victims after they have left the outpatient department were burdens for most of the participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Also. the role conflict of simultaneously being an empathic person of trust as well as an objective and forensically correct working reporter of findings is not to be underestimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it is not surprising that over 2 2 ⁄3 3 of the participants in this survey expressed the desire for supportive measures such as supervision and further training in the care of rape victims.</s><s>The present study investigating the female victims of sexual violence in a clinical context encompasses a relatively large collective of 270 patients and covers the entire two-year survey period since introduction of the structured "stuprum kit".</s><s>The healthcare situation is examined from various aspects by evaluation of the medical findings form (MFF), complemented by a survey of the involved personnel.</s><s>However, this is still a monocentric survey (one hospital, three locations).</s><s>On account of the high fluctuation, the entire medical and nursing staff of the emergency departments could not be included here and a selection effect cannot be discounted.</s><s>The involved female patients were not asked to evaluate the health-care situation for ethical and practical reasons.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>!</head><p><s>The more or less complete documentation of the medical findings form included in the "stuprum kit" and the positive evaluation of "stuprum kit" by the personnel illustrate the acceptance and practical utility of this standardised procedure.</s><s>In the framework of patient-centred health-care without time pressure and long waiting times, however, beside the regular guarantee for medical personnel of the same sex, the increased expenditure of time for the care of victims of sexual abuse should be taken into consideration in the duty rosters of the treating personnel.</s><s>In consideration of the diverse negative sequelae of sexual violence, the expectations of the victims concerning the health-care environment that have been demonstrated in other studies as well as their perception by the personnel, the prerequisite of a police report for the structured management by means of the "stuprum kit" needs to be questioned.</s><s>In its place, the now established procedure could be coupled to a comprehensive legal clarification for the affected women with a low threshold and the offer of a socalled confidential securing of evidence which has now also been possible in Berlin since July 1, 2016.</s><s>In future, attention should also be directed to psychosocial care of the victims.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 Fig. 2</head><label>12</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.1Evaluation of the examination conditions by the participating personnel (values in %, n = 92).</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
