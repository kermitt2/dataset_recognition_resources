<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSI ON</head><p><s>This study investigated HST scoring agreement of respiratory events across seven international centers within SAGIC.</s><s>The major findings of this study are: (1) there is a very strong interrater agreement in the scoring of the AHI among experienced sleep technologists regardless of the type of airflow signal used (NP, transformed NP, or RIP flow); (2) there is strong agreement in the scoring of the apnea and hypopnea indices particularly when the transformed NP is used as the airflow signal;</s></p><p><s>(3) there is excellent intrarater agreement between the first and second scoring sessions in the scoring of all respiratory indices   using any of the three airflow signals; and (4) the automated scoring of the ODI also shows very strong agreement despite using various scoring software to derive this index.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the agreement of HST scoring of respiratory events among international sleep centers.</s><s>Because HST is now increasingly used as the initial modality to diagnose OSA, the issue of agreement is not only important to researchers who are planning multicenter collaborative efforts but also to clinicians because such information is essential for evaluation of the findings and interpretation.</s><s>As in our prior study of PSG scoring, the use of different scoring software across the SAGIC centers is a strength of this study because it provides a greater challenge to good agreement and is a real-world application. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>he current study extends our previous report that showed substantial agreement in the scoring of the respiratory events among international sleep centers working in the SAGIC consortium for in-laboratory PSGs.</s><s>The results of the current study on HST scoring and our previous report on PSG scoring suggest an alternative approach to centralized scoring of sleep studies in research collaboration among international centers.</s><s>Similar to our in-laboratory PSG scoring study, the agreement in the scoring of central and mixed apneas for HSTs was lower than for obstructive apneas.</s><s>The reasons for these findings are unclear, but suggest that it is an area that needs to be emphasized in ongoing quality improvement of sleep study scoring among the SAGIC centers.</s><s>However, it should also be noted that the number of mixed and central apneas in the HSTs was low.</s><s>For HSTs, it appears that using the transformed NP signal improves the HST scoring of central and mixed apneas, although not to the level of agreement obtained in scoring obstructive apneas.</s></p><p><s>1]<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> Our results suggest that using the transformed NP may improve the agreement in the scoring of the hypopneas.</s><s>The use of the RIP flow from the thorax and abdominal belt signals, which is suggested as an alternative sensor for scoring respiratory events if the NP signal fails, also showed strong agreement in AHI scoring.</s><s>To our knowledge, ours is the first study that has examined the AHI scoring agreement using RIP flow.</s><s>Two prior studies examined the agreement between automatic and manual scoring of respiratory events in HSTs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref></s><s>The two studies suggest that the agreement between automatic and manual agreement is modest and that automatic agreement consistently underestimated the AHI derived from manual scoring of HSTs.</s><s>None of these prior publications reported the agreement when different scoring software is used on the same studies, which is a strength of our current study given that this would be the real-world situation in collaborative research involving international sleep centers.</s></p><p><s>Our study has some limitations.</s><s>First, we used a ≥ 4% oxygen desaturation to define a hypopnea.</s><s>An update of the AASM PSG scoring rules stipulate the following change in hypopnea definition: a drop of peak signal excursion by ≥ 30% of preevent baseline using the nasal pressure signal for duration of ≥ 10 sec with a ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation from preevent baseline or an associated arousal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>However, we are aware of only two studies that have systematically examined the association of varying definitions of hypopnea and clinical outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref></s><s>In a large epidemiologic study examining an outcome-based definition of hypopneas, only desaturations of ≥ 4% were independently associated with cardiovascular disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref></s><s>In contrast, no association was observed between cardiovascular disease and hypopneas associated with milder desaturations (including 3%) or arousals in a population of 6,106 adults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref></s><s>A more recent study showed that using a ≥ 4% desaturation to define a hypopnea was most consistently associated with systolic blood pressure in 2,040 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref></s><s>8]<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> Nonetheless, the effect of the AASM change in hypopnea definition on the interrater reliability of scoring respiratory events for HSTs among international centers is yet to be examined (excluding arousal assessment as it cannot be performed in typical type 3 portable devices).</s><s>A second limitation is using 15 HSTs acquired from one SAGIC center.</s><s>However, data acquisition in these HSTs used standard techniques that would not be expected to be different in other international centers given that the equipment used is a type 3 portable device.</s><s>A third limitation of our study is that it was not specifically powered to examine scoring agreement in those with mild OSA (AHI ≥ 5 to &lt; 15/h).</s><s>Finally, we did not randomize the order of the scoring of respiratory events when using one of the three airflow signals: NP, transformed NP, and RIP flow.</s><s>We could not entirely rule out a learning effect during the multiple scoring sessions that could have affected the interrater agreement.</s><s>However, HSTs were scored with only one airflow signal visible at each scoring session.</s><s>In addition, the intrarater agreement of respiratory indices scoring was all similarly excellent using the three different airflow signals, suggesting that any order effect on scoring was not significant.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our findings show that there is a strong interrater and intrarater agreement in the scoring of the respiratory events among international sleep centers for HSTs in the SAGIC consortium.</s><s>Use of the transformed NP as the signal for airflow appears to increase the agreement in the scoring of hypopneas.</s><s>There is also strong agreement in AHI scoring when alternative signals such as RIP flow is used in scoring of HSTs.</s><s>Taken together with our previous study on in-laboratory PSG scoring, our results suggest that centralized scoring of HSTs and PSGs may not be necessary in research collaboration among international sites provided adequate recordings are acquired and experienced scorers are involved.</s></p></div>
