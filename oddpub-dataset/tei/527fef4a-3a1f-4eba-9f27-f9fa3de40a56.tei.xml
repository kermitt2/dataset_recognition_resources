<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>The data analyzed for this study were prospectively collected as part of a predefined secondary analysis during STAR AF II, which randomized patients with persistent AF to different approaches to AF ablation.</s><s>The detailed study protocol has been published previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and will be summarized briefly here.</s><s>The study was approved by the respective ethics committees at each center.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study procedures and follow-up</head><p><s>All patients had persistent AF and were undergoing first-time ablation for AF.</s><s>Patients were randomized 1:4:4 to PVI alone, PVI plus ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs), or PVI plus linear ablation at the LA roof and mitral isthmus.</s><s>Ablation was assisted by a 3dimensional electroanatomic mapping system (EnSite NavX, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) and performed with an open irrigated radiofrequency energy catheter.</s><s>A decapolar catheter was placed into the coronary sinus (CS).</s></p><p><s>For PVI, wide circumferential isolation of the PVs was performed in all patients, and complete entrance and exit block measured with a circular mapping catheter in the antrum of each PV was the procedural endpoint.</s></p><p><s>After PVI, patients randomized to additional electrogram ablation underwent mapping of CFAEs using an automated algorithm (EnSite NavX).</s><s>During AF, bipolar signals were mapped in the LA, CS, and right atrium, and all areas with a cycle length o120 ms were defined as CFAE.</s><s>If a patient was not in AF after PVI, AF was induced by rapid atrial pacing from the CS catheter and assisted with isoproterenol infusion if needed.</s><s>Induced AF had to persist for at least 1 minute before CFAE mapping was started.</s><s>CFAE ablation was started in the LA and CS and continued until all CFAEs were eliminated or AF terminated.</s><s>If AF did not terminate, CFAEs in the right atrium were targeted for ablation.</s><s>Intraprocedural antiarrhythmic drugs were not allowed, and all antiarrhythmic drugs were stopped at least 5 half-lives before ablation with the exception of amiodarone, which was stopped at least 8 weeks preablation.</s></p><p><s>For patients randomized to linear ablation in addition to PVI, an LA roof line and mitral isthmus line was performed.</s><s>The endpoint of this approach was complete block across the respective line.</s><s>The methods of linear ablation and the endpoints for block were protocol defined. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>To check whether complete block had been achieved, patients were cardioverted to sinus rhythm (SR) if AF did not terminate during ablation.</s></p><p><s>If AF terminated into atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter during ablation, the decision to map and ablate the tachycardia or cardiovert was left to the investigator's discretion.</s></p><p><s>An initial blanking period of 3 months was used, and follow-up visits along with 24 hour Holter recordings were performed 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months after the initial ablation procedure.</s><s>Weekly transtelephonic monitoring was also performed, with additional recordings in the event of symptoms.</s><s>Antiarrhythmic therapy (except amiodarone) was allowed during the first 3 months after initial ablation.</s><s>After 3 months, antiarrhythmic therapy had to be stopped to assess for recurrence of AF.</s><s>Recurrence of AF was defined as any documented episode of AF 430 seconds.</s><s>In case of recurrence of AF after the initial 3-month blanking period, a repeat ablation procedure was allowed by the study protocol using the same approach as in the initial ablation.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Presence of early SR on freedom from AF recurrence</head><p><s>Based on the observation of better outcomes in patients who started the procedure in SR, we looked at the early presence of SR either because patients presented to the laboratory in sinus or because sinus was restored early during the procedure by cardioversion during the initial PVI component of the ablation.</s><s>Freedom from AF at 18 months was significantly better in patients who had presence of early SR compared to patients without early presence of SR (57.6% vs 41.4%, P o.001; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>When the patients with early termination (during PVI) were added to the patients who presented to the laboratory in SR or who were cardioverted back to sinus early in the procedure, they also had a significantly better outcome  compared to patients who did not have presence of early SR (56.0%</s><s>vs 40.8% freedom from AF, P ¼ .001; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of AFCL prolongation on freedom from AF recurrence</head><p><s>Information about AFCL was available in 528 patients.</s><s>Prolongation of AFCL by 420 ms during the procedure occurred in 270 patients but had no significant influence on freedom from AF compared to patients without prolongation of AFCL (48% vs 45%, P ¼ .83)</s><s>or patients who began the procedure in SR (45% vs 63%, P ¼ 0.06; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>The same result was obtained if the cutoff used was 10 or 30 ms.</s></p><p><s>We performed receiver operator curve analysis on the baseline AFCL at the start of the procedure to determine whether there was a cutoff between those with freedom from AF and those without.</s><s>Receiver operator curve analysis failed to identify any significant cutoff that distinguished those with and those without AF recurrence.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main findings</head><p><s>This study is one of the largest to investigate the effects of procedural AF termination and AFCL prolongation during ablation of persistent AF based on the outcomes of the STAR AF II study.</s><s>AF termination was not a consistent predictor of freedom from AF at 18 months.</s><s>Termination rates were significantly different among the 3 arms of the study, yet 18month outcome was similar.</s><s>Furthermore, in Kaplan-Meier analyses, those who had acute AF termination did not have significantly better outcomes than did those without.</s><s>The presence of SR early in the procedure (either at ablation outset or due to early cardioversion) was the only consistent predictor of better outcome.</s><s>AF termination was a univariable and multivariable predictor of freedom from AF but was not as strong a predictor as the presence of early SR and may be driven by early (not late) acute AF terminations, which may be the same as the presence of early SR.</s><s>Studies investigating the impact of AF termination on long-term outcome have shown divergent results.</s><s>5]<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> However, in another study using the stepwise approach, AF termination was not a significant predictor of recurrence-free survival after ablation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>Oral et al 9 investigated 100 patients undergoing ablation of complex atrial electrograms and could not find a significant effect of AF termination on outcome.</s><s>The CHASE-AF trial randomized 205 patients to ablation with the stepwise approach or PVI alone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>Although AF terminated in 60% of the patients undergoing stepwise ablation, recurrence-free survival was no better compared to patients undergoing PVI alone.</s><s>Interestingly, in the study by O'Neill et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> AF termination was a predictor of freedom from AF but not a predictor of freedom from atrial tachycardia or all atrial arrhythmias.</s></p><p><s>There are several possible explanations for the different findings concerning the predictive value of AF termination.</s><s>First is the incidence of AF termination found in the study population.</s><s>If the rate of AF termination is very low or if it is very high, then it may be impossible to show a significant difference between those with and those without acute termination because of the disparity in numbers between groups.</s><s>Furthermore, if both success rates and AF termination rates are either very high or very low, then this may create a statistical association between the 2 variables that cannot be generalized.</s><s>Ideally, we need intermediate values of termination and success rate to determine whether there is a true and generalizable association.</s><s>In our analysis, success rates at 18 months were approximately 50% and the termination rate overall was 26% (40% in the PVIþCFAE arm), and we did not find a consistent association.</s><s>Second, use of antiarrhythmic drugs, especially amiodarone, could influence the probability of AF termination and long-term outcome.</s><s>If amiodarone is continued throughout the procedure and afterward or if intravenous antiarrhythmics are used during the procedure, this can contribute to high acute termination rates and better long-term outcome.</s><s>In STAR AF II, all antiarrhythmic drugs were stopped at least 5 halflives preablation, and amiodarone was discontinued at least 8 weeks before the procedure.</s><s>No intraprocedural antiarrhythmic drugs were allowed.</s><s>Third, different studies include different variables into the multivariable models assessing the predictive value of AF termination, which could influence the results of the analysis.</s><s>We tried to be inclusive of all relevant variables and also included presence of early SR, which has not been studied extensively before.</s></p><p><s>It is interesting that the early presence of SR during ablation, because the patient either arrived in the laboratory in SR or was cardioverted early during the procedure, was  associated with a significantly better long-term outcome after the procedure.</s><s>When included into the multivariable analysis, early SR was also the strongest independent predictor of AF-free survival, possibly because the amplitudes of atrial electrograms are higher during SR and therefore may be more robust to determine ablative endpoints, particularly PVI, in SR vs AF.</s><s>In fact, this hypothesis was studied by Bassiouny et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> who compared the results of PVI after early cardioversion to PVI performed during AF with supplementary ablation of CFAE.</s><s>In their study, PVI in SR was associated with a significantly better long-term outcome.</s><s>It also is possible that patients with persistent AF who are capable of maintaining SR either spontaneously or after early cardioversion represent a population of patients who have less advanced disease.</s><s>Thus, those patients who have spontaneous termination during AF ablation, particularly early in the procedure before all the ablation has been completed, may simply represent a phenotype of AF patient who is destined to have a better outcome regardless of the ablative strategy at 18 months compared to those who terminate late or do not terminate at all.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFCL prolongation as predictor of outcome</head><p><s>Prolongation of AFCL during ablation has been proposed as a surrogate for effective AF substrate ablation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>AFCL prolongation often precedes AF termination and therefore may predict better long-term outcome.</s><s>However, in our investigation, AFCL prolongation by 20 ms was not associated with better long-term outcome after ablation and was not a predictor of AF-free survival in univariable analysis.</s></p><p><s>Baseline AFCL may distinguish between those patients more likely to have a better postablation outcome and those who are not.</s><s>For example, 1 study showed that baseline cycle length 4142 ms may predict those with better outcome compared to those without. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>In our study, receiver operator curve analysis failed to show any specific cutoff value of initial AFCL that predicted long-term freedom from AF.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study limitations</head><p><s>The STAR AF II trial was not specifically designed and powered to investigate the influence of AF termination and AFCL prolongation on the outcome of persistent AF ablation, but both parameters were prospectively specified, secondary endpoints.</s><s>The results from this investigation only apply to the described methodology for measuring AFCL.</s><s>Although this investigation is one of the largest studies investigating the ablation of persistent AF, it still is possible that patient numbers were too small in the subgroups to reveal a significant benefit of AF termination on outcome.</s></p><p><s>We also did not evaluate a stepwise ablative approach combining PVI plus CFAE ablation plus linear ablation in the STAR AF II trial.</s><s>Much of the literature describing AF termination as a predictor of outcome comes from studies using the stepwise approach.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Termination of AF during ablation did not consistently predict long-term outcome of ablation of persistent AF, but the early presence of SR was a consistent and, in fact, the strongest predictor of better freedom from AF. Prolongation of AFCL by ablation had no influence on long-term outcome, and we did not find a specific value of initial AFCL that predicted better outcome.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 AF-free survival stratified by intraprocedural AF termination in all arms.</s><s>AF ¼ atrial fibrillation.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,126.00,56.00,324.00,171.36" type="bitmap" /></figure>
