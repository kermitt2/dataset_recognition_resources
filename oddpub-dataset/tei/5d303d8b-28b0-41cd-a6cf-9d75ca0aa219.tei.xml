<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Ideal vaccines comprise a single antigenically conserved component of the target pathogen, preferably against a virulence determinant.</s><s>The highly successful tetanus and diphtheria toxoid vaccines epitomise this approach, with a major impact on disease globally as part of the World Health Organisation Expanded Programme on Immunisation (WHO EPI) <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, the conjugate polysaccharide vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and certain capsular variants of Neisseria meningitidis, the meningococcus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, have been highly successful in eliminating the diseases they cause, largely through herd immunity effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">2</ref> .</s><s>A number of more complex vaccines have also been successful, but several of these, including the widely used tuberculosis vaccine BCG <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> , or those comprising killed whole cells, such as whole cell pertussis and certain typhoid and cholera vaccines, are more difficult to define and control, often achieving imperfect disease control.</s><s>Antigenically diverse pathogens continue to challenge vaccine design, and it is necessary either: (i) to identify protective antigens that are invariant, as has been attempted with the RTS,S malaria vaccine <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4</ref> , or (ii) to include multiple components, perhaps varying composition over time, as has been done with influenza vaccines over many years.</s></p><p><s>There is a limited repertoire of meningococcal polysaccharide capsules associated with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), identified as serogroups A, B, C, W, X, and Y <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5</ref> , potentially simplifying vaccine formulation.</s><s>While vaccines based on one or a few capsular polysaccharides have been deployed successfully since the 1960s, with notable success achieved by proteinpolysaccharide conjugate vaccines <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">2</ref> , a comprehensive anti-capsular vaccine has been precluded by concerns about the safety and efficacy of formulations that include the serogroup B polysaccharide.</s><s>Attempts to generate 'serogroup B substitute' vaccines have consequently focussed on subcapsular antigens, especially proteins, but in most cases these are highly variable.</s><s>Meningococcal diversity extends beyond antigen genes, with a very wide range of distinct genotypes defined by variation in 'housekeeping genes' that encode essential cytoplasmic metabolic functions.</s><s>This diversity is captured by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approaches, including conventional MLST <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6</ref> , ribosomal MLST (rMLST), and core genome MLST (cgMLST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">7</ref> .</s><s>These approaches have shown that both genetic and antigenic diversity of this organism is structured into clusters of related organisms, which share a common ancestor (lineages).</s><s>These clusters are recognised by conventional seven-locus MLST as clonal complexes (ccs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">8</ref> .</s><s>The ccs are correlated with clinical phenotypes, including the propensity to cause disease and its severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">9</ref> , and antigenic characteristics including capsular and subcapsular antigens <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">10</ref> .</s><s>Comprehensive genomic typing schemes have been developed that catalogue serogroups, ccs and principle vaccine antigens <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The multiple variants of the subcapsular antigens included in serogroup B substitute vaccines do not necessarily generate crossreactive protective immune responses against a wide range of distinct meningococci <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">12</ref> .</s><s>Two main approaches have been adopted to overcome this problem: (i) the generation of strain-specific vaccines that target epidemics caused by particular meningococci; (ii) the identification of conserved antigens that offer broad protection.</s><s>The most widely used strain-specific vaccines have been based on meningococcal outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which contain outer membrane proteins (OMPs) as principle antigens, especially the PorA porin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5</ref> .</s><s>The investigational vaccine 'Nonamen' included nine different PorA proteins in a single OMV background to increase population coverage <ref type="bibr">13</ref> .</s><s>'Second generation' meningococcal B substitute vaccine development, using both conventional <ref type="bibr">14</ref> and 'reverse vaccinology' <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">15</ref> approaches, identified Factor H binding protein (fHbp) as a leading contender for a single, conserved vaccine antigen, leading to licensure of two vaccines: Bexsero Â® (4CMenB) <ref type="bibr">16</ref> ; and Trumenba Â® (rLP2086) <ref type="bibr">14</ref> .</s><s>The fHbp protein is, however, highly variable in meningococcal populations <ref type="bibr">17</ref> , so the effectiveness of the protection offered, not fully established at the time of writing, is dependent on the generation of cross-protective immune responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The bivalent Trumenba Â® vaccine, containing two lipidated fHbp variants was licenced for use in the US in 10-15-year-olds in 2014 and for those aged 10 years or over in Europe in 2017; however, as of summer 2018, Bexsero Â® vaccine was the only serogroup B substitute vaccine licenced, in 2013, for use in infants.</s><s>This vaccine was introduced into the UK infant immunisation programme in 2015 18 , undergoing post implementation assessment <ref type="bibr">19</ref> and comprising three recombinant meningococcal proteins: fHbp, neisserial heparin binding antigen (NHBA); and Neisseria adhesin A (NadA); together with the MeNZBâ„¢ OMV that contained PorA as a principal antigen 20 .</s><s>The meningococcal antigen typing system (MATS) immunological assay had been used to assess potential cross-reactivity of toddler antibodies to the principal Bexsero Â® components <ref type="bibr">21,</ref><ref type="bibr">22</ref> and a Bexsero Â® Antigen Sequence Typing scheme (BAST) was developed to assess the sequence variability of these vaccine components from meningococcal whole-genome sequence (WGS) data <ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">24</ref> .</s><s>At the time of writing, however, no means were available to systematically asses the other protein components of the OMV, which could potentially contribute to cross-immunity generated by this vaccine.</s><s>Shotgun proteomics was performed to identify the protein content of the Bexsero Â® -derived OMVs, and alongside published data 25 , informed the selection of proteins for use in the development of an Outer Membrane Vesicle peptide Typing (OMVT) scheme.</s><s>Here we describe the OMVT scheme and investigate its value in supporting the assessment of vaccine impact and the improvement of vaccine formulation.</s></p></div>
