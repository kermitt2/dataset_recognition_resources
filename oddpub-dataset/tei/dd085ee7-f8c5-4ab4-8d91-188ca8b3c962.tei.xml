<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The outcome of patients with MM has improved substantially during the last decades as a result of drug development and progress in the understanding of disease biology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>However, even in the era of novel agents some patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities or early relapse after first-line treatment have a dismal outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Clonal heterogeneity and evolution are contributors to disease progression and ultimately refractoriness in MM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> So far, there are only limited data available that proved clonal evolution in patients relapsing after ASCT for newly diagnosed disease.</s><s>With our current analysis of 128 patients with FISH data at primary diagnosis and relapse after ASCT we demonstrate that highrisk cytogenetic abnormalities occur more frequently at relapse.</s><s>This observation was especially due to de novo gains of chromosome 1q and new deletions of chromosome 17p.</s><s>No changes were observed between primary diagnosis and relapse for defined IGH translocations, including t (4;14).</s></p><p><s>A recent study demonstrated that chromosomal instability is a cornerstone of high-risk myeloma and propagated by bi-allelic inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53 located on chromosome 17p. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>Furthermore, gain of chromosome 1q is associated with increased proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> (e.g. compared to hyperdiploid MM) and genomic instability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>Both cytogenetic abnormalities (del17p and gain 1q21) are considered secondary events in myelomatogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and associated with a high risk of progression from smoldering to symptomatic MM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref>   a large, longitudinally analyzed cohort of patients treated with ASCT.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the increased rates of the high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities del17p and gain 1q21 after relapse, we did not observe the occurrence of new, defined IGH translocations, including t(4;14) with its adverse implications.</s><s>This is most likely due to the fact that IGH translocations are considered primary, tumor-initiating events in MM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> However, a study by the Intergroup Francophone Myélome found a de novo t(4;14) in 14 out of 268 patients, while in the same study 11 patients lost the t(4;14) after relapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>In accordance with our results, real time polymerase chain reaction analysis for IGH-MMSET confirmed the presence of minor t(4;14) subclones in selected cases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>The authors concluded that t(4;14) can evolve from subclones, present at primary diagnosis, or can be silenced after chemotherapy until next relapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>This is in line with our finding, and those of recent studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> that patients with t(4;14) show a better response to primary therapy but still suffer from early relapse.</s><s>To clarify whether clones with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities remain present as minimal residual disease in patients with serological remission, future longitudinal genome sequencing studies in patients with relapse from minimal residual disease negativity as well as positivity are warranted.</s></p><p><s>Sublclonal evolution was also observed in patients with new del17p and gain 1q21.</s><s>In a subset of patients, del17p occurred only in less than 60% of analyzed plasma cells, in line with the findings of a previous study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>urthermore, patients with gain 1q21 showed massive clonal heterogeneity after relapse, since many patients had subclones harboring different copy numbers compared to the main clone.</s><s>Future studies will have to clarify whether the observed clonal heterogeneity in patients with del17p or gain 1q21 might be one of the reasons for the associated dismal outcome.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the unchanged frequencies of the analyzed, defined IGH translocations [t(4;14), t(11;14) or t(14;16)] after relapse, we observed higher rates of IGH translocations with unknown partners with the IgH breakapart probe.</s><s>Translocations involving the MYC locus have been associated with disease progression and adverse outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>In our cohort, only a small group of patients was tested for MYC translocations at primary diagnosis and relapse, so that we were unable to perform a statistical analysis to confirm the hypothesis that MYC translocations are observed more frequently after relapse.</s><s>Furthermore, sequencing studies are warranted not only to identify the translocation partners, but also to clarify, whether de novo translocations are caused by class switch recombination or by other mechanisms, as shown previously for t(11;14) and t(14;20). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>atients with hyperdiploid MM had a favorable outcome in our current analysis and in the majority of patients a hyperdiploid karyotype proved to be stable after relapse.</s><s>Remarkably, seven patients lost their hyperdiploid karyotype after relapse and gains of odd numbered chromosomes, especially of chromosome 5, were the only cytogenetic abnormalities occurring at lower frequencies after relapse.</s><s>This might reflect chemosensitivity of the</s></p></div>

abnormalities, other mechanisms might be responsible for disease progression, e.g.</s><s>genomic mutations or epigenetic and microenvironmental modifications.</s><s>However, it must be mentioned that we defined hyperdiploid status based on gains of the aforementioned odd-numbered chromosome loci.</s><s>To rule out whether abnormalities other than the analyzed trisomies occurred after relapse, we

higher risk of developing the aforementioned cytogenetic abnormalities.</s></p><p><s>Since the first novel agents were combined with ASCT for the treatment of MM, physicians have debated whether relapses from primary therapy are becoming more aggressive.</s><s>It has been suggested that the rates of extramedullary disease after novel agent-based treatment are higher <ref type="bibr"

provide the first evidence that relapse after treatment with novel agents might result in higher rates of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities.</s><s>One explanation for this finding might be that

same dismal outcome as patients with the respective cytogenetic abnormalities detected at both time points.</s><s>In fact, time to first progression was not significantly shorter whether the respective aberrations were already present at primary diagnosis or not.</s><s>Again, this could imply that the evolving high-risk clone after relapse might have already been present at a subclonal level at primary diagnosis.</s></p><p><s>There are several potential criticisms of the current study that need to be addressed in the future.</s><s>First of all, although patients were uniformly treated with ASCT, there were substantial differences in pre-transplant induction therapy in the cohort analyzed.</s><s>Some patients were treated with proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulatory drugs before and/or after ASCT while others received only conventional chemotherapy.</s><s>This might have caused different selection pressures on pre-existing clones andmore importantly -might have caused different secondary genetic events, since treatment with immunomodulatory drugs, in particular, has been associated with the occurrence of cytogenetic abnormalities typical of myelodysplastic syndromes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>This hampers the comparison of study and non-study patients within our analysis.</s><s>Secondly, our retrospective data included only 128 patients and all patients had relapsed at the time of the second FISH.</s><s>The findings for some subgroups are, therefore, based on very small numbers and we did not have a validation cohort of patients with a second FISH analysis in remission after ASCT.</s><s>This weakness could be overcome in future studies including pre-planned bone marrow aspirates with FISH at certain time-points in a prospective clinical trial, e.g. at primary diagnosis, after ASCT before maintenance, at the end of maintenance and relapse.</s><s>In this way, a longitudinal comparison of changes in the genetic profile of patients in remission and relapse would be possible.</s><s>Lastly, as mentioned above, we will investigate the partners of the so far unknown IGH translocations observed after relapse in our current study.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our findings underline the importance of FISH analyses at relapse.</s><s>We demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses need to be repeated, since the risk profile might be worse after treatment than at baseline, especially in the era of novel agents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
