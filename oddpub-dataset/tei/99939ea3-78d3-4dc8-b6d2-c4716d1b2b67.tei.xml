<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I</head><p><s>nformation processing in the central nervous system relies on efficient synaptic transmission.</s><s>Neurotransmitter (NT) release occurs at a specialized presynaptic release site, known as the active zone (AZ), and depends on the availability of docked and primed fusion-competent vesicles.</s><s>The processes of docking, priming and fusion rely on the function of specific proteins at the AZ.</s><s>Loss-of-function studies in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian synapses have identified several AZ protein families that play a key role in vesicle docking and priming, including Munc13 (refs 1-6), CAPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , a-Liprin 8 , ELKS <ref

target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Among these proteins, Munc13s and their homologues in C. elegans and D. melanogaster are of particular interest because they are absolutely crucial for both of these steps in the synaptic vesicle (SV) cycle.</s><s>In the mammalian central nervous system, the Munc13 protein family comprises of four members: the most prominently expressed Munc13-1, the two Munc13-2 isoforms bMunc13-2 and ubMunc13-2, and Munc13-3 (ref.</s><s>14).</s><s>Neurons from Munc13-1/2 double knockout (DKO) lack of a measurable ready releasable pool (RRP) and show no spontaneous or Ca 2 þ -dependent evoked release <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , similar to the observations made in the corresponding unc-13 mutant in C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and in D. melanogaster dunc-13 mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>This absence of neurotransmission was initially attributed to events downstream of SV docking, based on ultrastructural data from conventional chemical fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>However, reexamination of Unc13/Munc13 deficiency in C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> using high-pressure freeze fixation revealed a loss of docked SVs, indicating that Munc13 plays a role in the vesicle docking mechanism.</s></p><p><s>All Munc13s expressed at central synapses are large multidomain proteins and share a well-conserved C-terminal region, including a diacylglycerol (DAG) binding C 1 domain, a Ca 2 þ /phospholipid binding C 2 B domain, a MUN domain and a C 2 C domain at the very C-terminal end.</s><s>Biophysical studies show that the Munc13 C terminus is crucial for membrane fusion in reconstitution experiments that include the SNAREs, Munc18-1, NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) and a-SNAP (a-soluble NSF attachment protein) because Munc13 and Munc18-1 orchestrate SNARE complex assembly in an NSF/a-SNAP-resistant manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Structure-function analyses revealed that the C-terminal MUN domain is essential for vesicle priming activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and mediates the activity of Munc13 by opening syntaxin-1 (refs 23-25).</s><s>Moreover, Munc13-1 fragment including the C 1 C 2 B region preceding the MUN domain and the C 2 C domain is critical for neurotransmitter release as they may help bridge the SV and plasma membrane, that in turn facilitates opening of syntaxin-1 (ref.</s><s>26).</s><s>In addition, the C 1 (refs 27-29)  and C 2 B domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> are important regulators of vesicle release probability and short-term plasticity, modulating vesicle fusion efficiency through interaction with the plasma membrane in a DAG-or Ca 2 þ /phospholipid-dependent manner.</s></p><p><s>The Munc13 N terminus, on the other hand, varies considerably between the Munc13 isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>In C. elegans, the long and short Unc13 isoforms differ in their regulation of both vesicle location relative to Ca 2 þ channels and neurotransmitter release kinetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>In mammals, the N termini of the isoforms Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 contain a calmodulin (CaM)binding sequence that regulates short-term plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , and a C 2 A domain that is not present in bMunc13-2 and Munc13-3.</s><s>Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the C 2 A domain can form tight homodimeric complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> or alternatively, a heterodimeric complex with the zinc-finger domain (ZF) of the RIM protein that can bind to the SV protein Rab3 (ref.</s><s>35).</s><s>Based on functional studies of Munc13 C 2 A domain interactions, two distinct roles have been proposed for this domain: the recruitment of Munc13 to the presynaptic active zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> and the activation of Munc13 as prelude to vesicle priming activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>In the latter study, Munc13 homodimers were shown to be inactive and priming incompetent, while competitive binding of RIM to the C 2 A disrupted the Munc13 homodimer and activated vesicle priming.</s><s>Remarkably, either expression of an N-terminally truncated Munc13 or a Munc13 with a C 2 A domain point mutation that inhibits Munc13 homodimerization in RIM1/2 conditional DKO bypassed the requirement of RIM in vesicle priming, suggesting that RIM only interacts with Munc13 to disrupt the homodimer, and indicating that the active form of Munc13 is the monomer.</s><s>These findings further implied that the Munc13/RIM complex does not play a role in priming itself and that the Munc13 C 2 A domain merely acts as an inactivationactivation switch.</s><s>This model is surprising given that classical electron microscopy (EM) studies of aldehyde-fixed synapses lacking all RIM1 and RIM2 isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and EM tomography from high-pressure freeze synapses of unc-10 mutant in C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> show a reduction in docked vesicles.</s><s>Moreover, the Munc13/RIM/Rab3 complex may play a direct role in regulating release probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>On the other hand, it is unclear how the conversion of Munc13 from homodimers to monomers or Munc13/RIM heterodimers affects other steps in the SV cycle: does it only affect priming or also upstream processes, such as vesicle docking, and downstream processes, such as release?</s><s>Does homodimerization have a functional role beyond maintaining Munc13 in an inactive state?</s><s>To clarify the role of the C 2 A domain and the individual functions of Munc13 monomers, Munc13/Munc13 homodimers and Munc13/RIM heterodimers, we performed a structure-function analysis of the role of the C 2 A domain of Munc13-1 in docking, priming and vesicular release in mammalian central synapses.</s></p></div>

1 domain (Munc13-1 del 151-520) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Munc13-1/2 DKO neurons rescued with a full-length Munc13-1 protein (Munc13-1 wild type (WT)) served as our

the Munc13-1 þ / þ /Munc13-2 À / À neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To address the role of Munc13 C 2 A domain in vesicle docking, we performed

type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , Munc13-1/2 DKO active zones were essentially devoid of docked vesicles (0.2 ± 0.04 docked vesicle/AZ), while the active zones of the Munc13-1 WT-rescued synapses showed approximately 2 docked synaptic vesicles (1.62 ± 0.11 docked vesicle/AZ).</s><s>However, synapses from DKO rescued with the two Munc13-1 mutants that lacked the C 2 A domain, that is, the C 2 A domain (del 1-150) and the N-terminus (del 1-520) truncations, showed a 42% reduction in the number of docked SVs.</s><s>In contrast, deletion of the intermediate region of the N terminus that does not eliminate the C 2 A domain (del 151-520) showed the same docking activity as the Munc13-1 WT (Fig. <ref type="figure"

current (EPSC).</s><s>The Munc13-1 mutant that conserves the C 2 A domain but lacks the intermediate N-terminal region (del 151-520) only moderately altered RRP size without affecting the AP-evoked
