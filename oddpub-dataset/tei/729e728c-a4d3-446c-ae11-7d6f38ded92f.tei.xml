<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Genetic heterogeneity between and within tumours is a major factor determining cancer progression and therapy response.</s><s>Here we examined DNA sequence and DNA copy-number heterogeneity in colorectal cancer (CRC) by targeted high-depth sequencing of 100 most frequently altered genes.</s><s>In 97 samples, with primary tumours and matched metastases from 27 patients, we observe inter-tumour concordance for coding mutations; in contrast, gene copy numbers are highly discordant between primary tumours and metastases as validated by fluorescent in situ hybridization.</s><s>To further investigate intra-tumour heterogeneity, we dissected a single tumour into 68 spatially defined samples and sequenced them separately.</s><s>We identify evenly distributed coding mutations in APC and TP53 in all tumour areas, yet highly variable gene copy numbers in numerous genes.</s><s>3D morpho-molecular reconstruction reveals two clusters with divergent copy number aberrations along the proximal-distal axis indicating that DNA copy number variations are a major source of tumour heterogeneity in CRC.</s></p></div>

alterations clustered along the proximal-distal axis of the tumour.</s><s>In contrast, we found a high concordance in known driver mutations within both the reconstructed tumour and the

NEB, E7370S) and NEB Next Multiplex Oligos provided for Illumina (NEB, E7335S). 100 pM of resulting library DNA was pooled, all samples from one patient were pooled together.</s><s>The average read output was 4.6 Â 10 6 reads.</s></p><p><s>Shallow whole-genome sequencing.</s><s>DNA from samples 3-4D, 5-3D, 6-6B, 5-2D, 5-4B, 2-2B, 2-3B, 2-4A, 3-3A and 3-4A was prepared with TruSeq Nano DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol: 100 ng of genomic DNA were fragmented to 350 bp using Covaris LE220 system (Covaris, Inc.).</s><s>Fragments were end-repaired, A-tailed, adaptor ligated and PCR amplified (8 cycles).</s><s>The final libraries were validated using Agilent Tapestation 2200 (Agilent Technologies) and Qubit flourometer (Invitrogen), normalized and pooled in equimolar ratios.</s><s>101 bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 according to the manufacturer's protocol.</s><s>To match downstream analysis requirements, only the first members of the read pairs were considered, and were truncated to the first 50 bp.</s><s>The resulting genome coverage was between 0.25 and 0.39 Â (0.64-0.79 Â for paired end reads).</s><s>Data analysis were performed following Scheinin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> Validation of single-nucleotide variations.</s><s>To validate NGS results we used the Illumina platform, Sanger sequencing and Single Nucleotide Primer Extension/ HPLC method (SNuPE).</s><s>MiSeq (Illumina) platform was used to re-sequence several samples (described above).</s><s>Sanger sequencing was used to validate SNVs that occurred at an allele frequency higher than 10%, either using primers from our CRC panel or newly designed primers.</s><s>For mutations with allele frequencies below 10% we used SNuPE, as described in Hoogendoorn et al. and Tierling et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> This method allows validation of variants with allele frequencies down to 1%. (see Supplementary Tables 3,4 and 6 for primer lists and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> for validation examples).</s></p><p><s>Prediction of DNA copy number variations from NGS data.</s><s>DNA CNV were predicted by analysing the panel-sequencing data using CNVPanelizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , which compares tumour samples with a pool of non-matched normal tissue samples.</s><s>The algorithm combines bootstrapping the reference set with the subsampling of amplicons associated with each of the target genes.</s><s>This serves as a non-parametric distribution estimation of the gene-wise mean ratio between healthy reference samples and each tumour sample.</s><s>To correct for different numbers of amplicons per gene, a second subsampling step was applied.</s><s>For the inter-patient and tumour heterogeneity study we used the matched normal tissue as a reference.</s><s>For the intra-tumour heterogeneity study, blood samples from healthy individuals and matched normal tissue were used as the reference.</s><s>PCR duplicates were removed and only CNVs with a P value o0.001 in both the bootstrapping and background methods were called.</s></p><p><s>Fluorescence in situ hybridization.</s><s>FISH was performed on 5 mm tumour sections.</s><s>We used commercially available and standardized probes for detection of EGFR (Vysis LSI EGFR SO/CEP7 SG), TP53 (Vysis LSI TP53; Abott Molecular), SOX11, CDX2, CARD11, BRCA2, EDEM2 and MMP9 (Empire Genomics).</s><s>Hybridization was performed according to manufacturer's instructions.</s><s>Where possible we scored 50 cells per sample (inter-patient and inter-tumour heterogeneity study) and 30 cells per sample (intra-tumour heterogeneity study) for hybridization patterns using an Olympus microscope.</s><s>Analysis was conducted using 'BioView solo' (Abbott Molecular).</s></p><p><s>Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis.</s><s>Four tumour samples and matched normal tissue were analysed using 0.5 ng of FFPE DNA.</s><s>An internal control was integrated using normal colon tissue DNA from two patients without a history of cancer.</s><s>Analysis was performed using the 2 ( À DDCt) approach.</s><s>qPCR was performed for APC, EDEM2, GNAS, HDAC3, MAP2K4, MMP9, TP53, SMAD4 and SOX9 genes, the TERT gene served as a reference (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref> for a list of primers).</s></p><p><s>Study of genetic and patient characteristics.</s><s>The relationships between the genetic attributes of the tumours in the cohort and several patient characteristics were investigated through the application of a series of tests to reveal potential targets and biomarkers, and to find mechanistic explanations for observed genetic variations.</s><s>Two genetic attributes (mutation status and gene copy number) were tested against (1) whether the tumour was a primary neoplasm or metastatic, (2) whether the patient had received treatment or not, (3) disease stage, (4) whether the primary tumour was in the right or left colon, (5) gender of the patient, (6) whether the samples was derived from a lymph-node metastasis, (7) whether the sample was derived from a liver metastasis.</s><s>Primary tumours (P) and metastases (M) were analysed together for characteristics 1 and 2. Primary tumours and metastases were analysed separately for characteristics 3-5.</s><s>Only metastases were analysed for characteristics 6 and 7.</s></p><p><s>We corrected for inter-patient genetic similarity (the patient effect) using a generalized linear mixed model with the 'logit' link function to model the binomial nature of the phenotype values.</s><s>In cases where there was only one sample from each patient, a generalized linear model with a 'logit' link function was fit.</s><s>In all other cases, both the independent variable and the response variable were binomial in nature and a Fisher Exact test was used.</s></p><p><s>The P values for the generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models were calculated using a chi-square test comparing the fitted model with the null model in which only the patient effect was modelled.</s><s>For each independent/ response variable combination the P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</s><s>All analyses were implemented using R and the libraries nlme (ref.</s><s>52) and ggplot2 (ref.</s><s>53).</s></p><p><s>Hierarchical clustering of genes.</s><s>CNVs belonging to the 68 samples from the intra-tumour heterogeneity study were clustered using pvclust (ref.</s><s>54), an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm that performs multiscale bootstrap resampling to calculate an approximate unbiased P value for each identified cluster.</s><s>Bootstrapping was performed with 10,000 repetitions.</s><s>The genes that best distinguish between the clusters were determined by applying the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test to the difference in gene copy number aberrations between the clusters for each gene individually.</s><s>The resulting P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</s><s>The genes with the most significant P values were chosen for validation according to the methods described above.</s></p><p><s>Reconstruction of tissue architecture and 3D visualization.</s><s>To obtain a full spatial representation of the tumour and visualize intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity, we generated a 3D micro-anatomic tumour model from consecutive sections taken from all 68 tumour samples from one stage II CRC patient.</s><s>H&amp;E stained slides were digitized with a 3D Panoramic 250 scanner (3D HISTECH).</s><s>Four different compartments (designated A, B, C and D, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>) were annotated manually for each digital slide corresponding to the region used for separate molecular analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> .</s><s>The shapes of these annotations were exported and scaled into images of 1,776 Â 562 pixels.</s><s>As slides from five different blocks were used to create the 3D model, a manual registration of those images was necessary.</s><s>Slices in the x-y-plane were stretched along the z-axis to preserve uniform aspect ratio.</s><s>As a consequence of the tumour's overall macroscopic architecture, the number of sections differs among tissue blocks.</s><s>For this patient, block #1 represents normal tissue and was not used for reconstruction, block #2 is represented by 20 samples, block #3 by 16, block #4 by 8, block #5 by 16 and block #6 by 8 samples.</s><s>Slight deformations of the sections are unavoidable due to the softness of the tube-like colonic tissue.</s><s>When serial tissue sections were placed into embedding cassettes, discontinuities between them were minimized by careful processing, however not eliminated completely.</s><s>The position and rotation of regions was adjusted manually, while the shapes were not changed (rigid registration).</s><s>In a fine adjustment step each region under-went further minimal non-rigid transformation to improve reconstruction.</s><s>Next, the MoMo (morphology modeller) algorithm described in Klauschen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> was used to create a 3D model for each region of the planar mask images containing the shape information.</s><s>Models were stored in.obj files and imported into Blender (https://www.blender.org/),</s><s>a 3D modelling tool, which was used for additional smoothing of the model and exporting it into one.fbx</s><s>file.</s><s>Colouring information was loaded from.csv</s><s>files and passed to a shader that interpolates a value for each vertex from all measured values depending on the squared distance between the center of the measured region and the vertex.</s><s>The data from the shader is mapped back to the tissue sections by assigning the respective molecular feature value of a subregion to the center voxel of the subregion in each histological plane for which the molecular analysis was performed.</s><s>Then the surface mesh colours are interpolated between neighbouring centres.</s><s>We used the 3D reconstruction and colouring process to model the spatial distribution of the clusters found through hierarchical clustering and the copy number for the genes MMP9, CARD11 and BRCA2 in addition to CNV cluster information obtained by the method described above.</s><s>An interactive 3D visualization of the measured data (per gene and clusters) can be downloaded by the reader using Supplementary Software 1.
