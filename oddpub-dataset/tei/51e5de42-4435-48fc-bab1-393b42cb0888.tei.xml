<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and methods Animals</head><p><s>Male Wistar rats, 280-300 g (Harlan Winkelmann, Borchen, Germany), were maintained on standard laboratory rat chow and water ad libitum.</s><s>The animals were kept in cages (n = max.</s><s>5) on a 12-h light-dark cycle.</s><s>This study was carried out in accordance with the European Directive introducing new animal welfare and care guidelines (2010/63/EU).</s><s>IRB approval for animal experiments was given by local authorities (Reg # G 0144/12; Landesamt fu ¨r Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin, Germany) after a thorough review process.</s><s>All surgical interventions were performed under isoflurane (ACF induction) and tiletamine/zolazepam (hemodynamic measurements) anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize animals' suffering.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental model</head><p><s>The needle-technique to induce an infrarenal aortocaval fistula (ACF) has previously been described by Garcia and Diebold using a 18G needle <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we applied a modified technique using a 16G needle <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, under isoflurane anesthesia a laparotomy was performed and the aorta was punctured with a 16G disposable needle (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) distal to the renal arteries.</s><s>Then, the needle was advanced to penetrate the aortic wall into the adjacent inferior vena cava.</s><s>After temporarily compressing the aorta and venous vessels above and below the puncture site, the needle was carefully withdrawn and the aortic puncture site was sealed with a drop of cyanoacrylate glue <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Patency of the fistula (ACF) was visualized by the pulsatile flow of oxygenated blood from the aorta into the inferior vena cava <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Sham operated animals underwent a laparotomy with a temporary compression of the vessels without any puncture of the aorta.</s><s>As analgesic regimen, animals received intraoperatively a s.c.</s><s>injection of 40 mg/kg dipyrone which was continued over the next three postoparative days by dipyrone dissolved in drinking water (1.33mg/ml).</s><s>The rats were maintained in animal room facilities and monitored daily under the supervision of a veterinarian.</s><s>Considering technical aspects of the here presented approach, the main complication was uncontrollable bleeding at the puncture site of the ACF induction (mortality: 2 out of 40 rats).</s><s>During the progressive course of heart failure over 28±2 days 3 out of 40 rats died due to cardiac arrhythmias.</s><s>Out of the remaining 35 rats n = 5 sham rats and n = 10 ACF rats were used for morphometric measurements, hemodynamic measurements, rBNP plasma concentrations, and Western blot.</s><s>In addition, n = 5 sham rats and n = 5 ACF rats were used for light microscopy/immunohistochemistry and n = 5 sham rats and n = 5 ACF rats were used for electron microscopy.</s></p></div>
