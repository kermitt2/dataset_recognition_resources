<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Project organisation</head><p><s>ISOS was a 7-day international cohort study.</s><s>Regulatory requirements differed between countries, with some requiring research ethics approval and some requiring only data governance approval.</s><s>In the UK, the study was approved by the Yorkshire &amp; Humber Research Ethics Committee (reference: 13/YH/0371).</s><s>The inclusion criteria were all adult patients (age 18 years) undergoing elective surgery with a planned overnight stay in the hospital.</s><s>Each participating country selected a single data collection week between April and August 2014.</s><s>Patients undergoing emergency surgery, day-case surgery or radiological procedures were excluded.</s><s>Patient data included only that recorded as part of routine care.</s><s>In some countries, patient consent was sought to allow the collection of supplementary data for prespecified substudies.</s><s>In each country we approached individuals to act as national coordinators using contacts in national and international specialist societies in surgery and anaesthesia.</s><s>Individual participating hospitals were then identified through a global online recruitment campaign led by the study management group and through the direct approach of the national coordinators.</s><s>Nominations for participation were then confirmed as appropriate through discussion with national coordinators.</s><s>The study website provided all study documentation and guidance on study procedures (www.isos.org.uk/docu</s><s>ments).</s><s>ISOS was registered prospectively with an international trial registry (ISRCTN51817007).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p><s>Data describing perioperative care facilities were collected for each hospital at the beginning of the study.</s><s>Data describing consecutive patients were collected until hospital discharge on paper case record forms (Supplementary file).</s><s>Complications were assessed according to predefined criteria and graded as mild, moderate, or severe. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">19</ref></s><s>Data were censored at 30 days following surgery for patients who remained in the hospital.</s><s>Data were anonymised before entry onto a secure Internet-based electronic case record form designed specifically for ISOS, which incorporated automated checks for plausibility, consistency and completeness.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome measures</head><p><s>The primary outcome measure was in-hospital postoperative complications.</s><s>Secondary outcomes were death following a postoperative complication (failure to rescue) and in-hospital mortality.</s><s>Process measures were admission directly to critical care after surgery, admission to critical care for treatment of a postoperative complication, and duration of hospital stay.</s><s>A single prospective definition of critical care was used for all countries (a facility routinely capable of admitting patients who require invasive ventilation overnight).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>We aimed to recruit as many hospitals and countries as possible and asked investigators in those hospitals to enrol all eligible patients.</s><s>No formal sample size calculation was performed.</s><s>Only hospitals returning valid data describing 10 patients and countries with 10 participating hospitals were included in the primary analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association between surgical procedure category and patient outcomes</head><p><s>We assessed the association between surgical procedure category and complications or mortality both before and after adjustment for potential confounding factors.</s><s>The unadjusted analysis was performed using a logistic regression model with the surgical procedure category included as a fixed factor.</s><s>The adjusted analysis was performed using a three-level mixedeffects logistic regression model.</s><s>Patients were entered at the first level, hospitals at the second level, and countries at the third level.</s><s>This model accounted for correlation between patients in the same hospital or country.</s><s>The following variables were included as fixed factors in the model: age, current smoker, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score, severity of surgery, surgical procedure category, and presence of ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, cirrhosis, stroke, or other comorbid diseases.</s><s>Factors were selected for biological plausibility, scientific rationale, and a low rate of missing data.</s><s>We used restricted cubic splines to account for a potential non-linear association between age and outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">20</ref></s><s>To assess the effect of predefined exclusions on our findings, we repeated our analyses for all patients in the database.</s><s>For both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistics were used to test model calibration and multicollinearity was assessed using the variance inflation factor.</s><s>The ability of the model to discriminate cases from noncases was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).</s><s>Data are presented as mean (SD)</s></p><p><s>Editor's key points</s></p><p><s>• As global access to surgical procedures increases, it is important to understand differences in outcomes depending on economic development and access to perioperative care.</s></p><p><s>• The International Surgical Outcomes Study evaluated incidence and risk factors for complications and death after inpatient elective surgery in 27 countries of varied economic status.</s></p><p><s>• Adverse outcomes were common after inpatient surgery and were similar in low-and middle-income compared with high-income countries despite lower baseline risk of the former.</s><s>and median [interquartile range (IQR)] for continuous data, number (%) for binary data, or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</s><s>Analyses were performed using Stata 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process measures</head><p><s>The median stay in a post-anaesthetic care unit was 1 (IQR 0-2) h.</s><s>A total of 4360 (9.7%) patients were admitted to a critical care unit as routine immediately after surgery.</s><s>The median length of time spent in critical care for those with a planned admission directly after surgery was 1 (IQR 1-3) day.</s><s>Of these patients, 2198 (50.4%) developed a complication, with 105 (2.4%) deaths.</s><s>A total of 1233 (4.9%) patients were admitted to a critical care unit to treat complications, of whom 119 (9.7%) died.</s><s>The median length of time spent in critical care for patients admitted to treat a complication was 3 (IQR 1-6) days.</s><s>The median overall hospital stay was 4 (IQR 2-7) days, increasing to 8 (IQR 5-14) days among those patients who developed complications.</s><s>Outcomes in low-, middle-, and high-income countries Patient outcomes and process measures according to low-and middle-or high-income country status are presented in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</s><s>One country in the low-and middle-income groups, which returned a large patient sample, experienced much lower complication rates than other participating nations.</s><s>Patients in lowand middle-income countries tended to be younger with lower ASA scores.</s><s>Crude complication rates were lower, but mortality rates overall, and for patients developing complications, were similar to those in high-income countries, suggesting care for patients who develop complications may be less effective.</s><s>There was a much lower rate of planned admission to critical care immediately after surgery in low-and middle-income countries.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This international prospective cohort study has provided detailed outcome data on a population of &gt;44 000 consecutive patients undergoing elective inpatient surgery in 27 low-, middle-, and high-income countries worldwide.</s><s>The principal finding was that 1 in 6 patients experienced a complication before hospital discharge and 1 in 35 patients who experienced a complication subsequently died without leaving the hospital.</s><s>The mortality among patients who developed complications (failure to rescue) of 2.8% indicates the continued need for a more effective treatment response for patients who develop postoperative complications.</s><s>Despite lower baseline risk, crude patient outcomes were broadly similar in low-and middleincome compared with high-income countries.</s><s>There are few large datasets of complication rates after surgery, and none we are aware of which provide data at an international level, although the findings of a recent study of almost 11 000 patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery in 58 low-, middle-, and high-income countries indicate high mortality following such procedures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22</ref></s><s>Caution should be exercised when comparing between country-level datasets because of international differences in patterns of surgical disease and genetic backgrounds, as well as in health care systems.</s><s>A variable degree of selection bias is also likely to result in important differences between reports that are few in number.</s><s>While overall complication rates in the current data were slightly lower than those previously reported in the USA, <ref type="bibr">9 23</ref> this might simply be due to differences in patient risk factors and the surgical procedures included.</s><s>In particular, ISOS only included patients undergoing elective surgery.</s><s>6]<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[18]</ref> A recent study of postoperative mortality in Europe suggested in-hospital mortality of 3% for elective inpatient surgery, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">11</ref> similar to overall mortality rates in reports from the USA. <ref type="bibr">9 16 23</ref></s><s>hese data provide detailed insights into patterns of critical care admission after surgery.</s><s>This is an expensive resource, and rates of admission in low-and middle-income countries appear to be much lower than in high-income countries.</s><s>The value of routine admission of high-risk patients to a critical care unit after surgery remains uncertain and allocation of this resource appears inconsistent.</s><s>3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref> The findings of two recent health care registry studies in the UK suggest that provision of critical care can improve survival for surgical patients, although the effect may be subtle. <ref type="bibr">24 25</ref></s><s>eanwhile, a study of Medicare registry data in the USA failed to identify any benefit of critical care admission. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">26</ref></s><s> Comparison of failure to rescue (rate of death after postoperative complications) between hospitals and health care systems could help us to understand the impact of postoperative critical care on patient outcomes.</s><s>While it seems unlikely that we could ever reduce mortality from postoperative complications to zero, failure to rescue has provided a useful metric of the quality of postoperative care for surgical patients in high-income countries. <ref type="bibr">9 28-31</ref></s><s>We could argue that in a well-resourced system, very few patients should die after elective surgery without being admitted to a critical care unit.</s><s>The current data confirm there is an important rate of failure to rescue at a global level, which is placed in context by the rates of use of critical care facilities.</s></p><p><s>Global strategies to improve access to surgical treatments should take account of the increased demand for perioperative care services, in particular critical care, for patients who develop complications. <ref type="bibr">3 4</ref> While the surgical population is very large, few countries have any reliable system to monitor the volume of activity and clinical outcomes.</s><s>Understanding the safety and effectiveness of surgical treatments is therefore limited and the need remains for robust audit and public reporting of outcomes after all surgery worldwide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">8</ref></s><s>Data-driven improvement in the quality of perioperative care might be possible even in resourcelimited environments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref></s><s> strengths of this study is the large number of consecutive patients enrolled worldwide.</s><s>Importantly, critical care beds were classified according to a standard definition in participating hospitals.</s><s>We also distinguished between planned admission to critical care immediately after surgery as a part of routine postoperative management and unplanned admission to critical care to treat a life-threatening complication.</s><s>By developing a very simple dataset consisting primarily of categorical variables, we were able to minimise the amount of missing data.</s><s>Patient-level variables were selected on the basis that they were objective, routinely collected for clinical reasons, could be transcribed with a high level of accuracy, subject to a low rate of missing data, and relevant to a risk adjustment model that included a wide variety of surgical procedures.</s><s>The online data entry system was designed specifically for ISOS and included a variety of internal error checks while avoiding the redundant functionality of generic software designed for complex trials.</s></p><p><s>The study also has a number of weaknesses.</s><s>Despite the large sample size, we cannot consider this study as representative of current practice in all countries.</s><s>ISOS was a pragmatic study and only a small proportion of hospitals took part in a small number of countries.</s><s>While we are pleased to have recruited hospitals in 30 countries, only 27 of these reached the predefined number of participating hospitals.</s><s>We discussed participation with potential investigators in a number of countries who did not feel they had adequate resources to take part.</s><s>This affected the participation of low-, middle-, and high-income countries.</s><s>Many patients were enrolled in university hospitals while smaller, low-volume centres are underrepresented.</s><s>This effect was greater in the lowand middle-income countries that took part.</s><s>The risk adjustment methods used might not fully account for high mortality rates in hospitals specialising in more complex surgery.</s><s>After risk adjustment there were differences in postoperative outcomes between countries, but there are likely to be differences in case mix that are not fully represented in our baseline data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">12</ref></s><s>We note that crude complication and mortality rates were lower in one high-volume country, reducing the overall event rate.</s><s>Given the pragmatic nature of this study, it was only possible to follow patients until hospital discharge.</s><s>In countries where the availability of hospital beds is more limited, early hospital discharge of patients could have resulted in a lower measured complication rate.</s><s>Although we planned to enrol every eligible patient undergoing surgery during the study period, we cannot be sure of the exact proportion of eligible patients included.</s><s>Despite these limitations, assuming the volume of surgery during the cohort week is typical of the participating hospitals, these centres perform &gt;3 million inpatient surgical procedures each year, 1% of the estimated volume of surgery taking place worldwide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">12</ref></s></p></div>
