(PPV) within the pSS cohort.</s><s>This is the first study showing that an elevated IFN system detected by SIGLEC1 expression is prevalent in a pSS subgroup, that is simultaneously at higher mortality and morbidity risk.</s><s>However, one patient with pSS (ID18, see online supplementary table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>) had only a mild upregulation of SIGLEC1 expression and showed a moderate disease activity with an ESSDAI of 13 (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>This patient was taking 5 mg prednisolone daily, which is known to have an inhibiting effect on SIGLEC1 expression. <ref type="bibr">13 32</ref></s><s>The IFN-inhibitory effect of hydroxychloroquine is known for SLE and pSS. <ref type="bibr">30 31</ref></s><s>In this regard, we could confirm in a small longitudinal cohort that introduction of hydroxychloroquine and  prednisolone reduces the IFN signature reflected by reduced SIGLEC1 expression.</s><s>Thus, we assume that SIGLEC1 expression could be higher in this patient when assessed without the respective medication.</s><s>Hydroxychloroquine was investigated in a randomised clinical trial ( JOQUER trial) showing no efficacy in the treatment of inactive to mildly active patients with pSS (ESSDAI ≤6). <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>In this context, it needs to be studied on a larger scale to which extent enhanced IFN activation can be modulated by hydroxychloroquine, as shown before and how this may support clinical decisions.</s></p><p><s>In the group of glandular manifestation, only four patients showed an upregulation of SIGLEC1.</s><s>Two of them presented with moderate disease activity (with ESSDAI scores of 7 and 10, respectively), and three of them were positive for both autoantibodies (anti-Ro/ SSA and anti-La/SSB).</s><s>Noticeably, almost all other patients in the group of glandular manifestation presented with inactive disease and were only positive for anti-Ro/SSA antibody (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>It has previously been described that anti-Ro/SSA und anti-La/SSB are both able to induce IFN production in pSS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>Moreover, the simultaneous appearance of both autoantibodies (anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB) was associated with a lower rate of circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC), <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> which are considered as the main producers of IFN in pSS. <ref type="bibr">7 35</ref></s><s>These pDCs accumulate in the tissue in which they produce IFN. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>Hence, a higher frequency of migrated tissue pDC might lead to a higher activated IFN system, indicated here by an upregulation of SIGLEC1 expression and may explain a broader or more active organ involvement.</s><s>Patients suffering from glandular disease may be at risk for further organ involvement when displaying an activated IFN system indicated by increased SIGLEC1 expression.</s><s>Nevertheless, the current findings indicate that SIGLEC1 is a candidate for identifying patients with extraglandular manifestations.</s></p><p><s>In a previous study, the upregulation of type I IFN signature genes was positively correlated with the disease activity in pSS. <ref type="bibr">8 9</ref></s><s>MxA, but not SIGLEC1, could be shown to correlate with the disease activity in pSS. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> In contrast to Maria et al, we found a correlation of SIGLEC1 expression with disease activity.</s><s>A possible explanation for this finding is, that low disease activity, with a low systemic IFN activation, might not be sufficient to upregulate SIGLEC1 expression.</s><s>Patients of the cohort by Maria et al presented with low disease acitivity with the majority of patients with ESSDAI ≤6. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Patients in our study presenting with moderate to high disease activity (defined by ESSDAI &gt;5) showed a significant upregulation in SIGLEC1 expression and therefore might resemble a more systemic IFN activation.</s><s>We conclude that our results are not contradictory to Maria et al, but rather extend that an activated IFN system is operative in pSS.</s><s>Thus larger and longitudinal studies, including patients presenting with a wide range of disease activity, are needed to identify reliable IFN biomarkers for pSS.</s></p><p><s>In SLE, IP-10 was shown to correlate with disease activity cross-sectionally and longitudinally and therefore might be useful as an IFN biomarker in clincial practice or pSS (shown in red) was measured before and after the introduction of prednisolone or hydroxychloroquine.</s><s>The average dose was 13.33 mg for prednisolone and 300 mg for hydroxychloroquine; the time period between measurements was ∼5.5 months for prednisolone and 5 months for hydroxychloroquine.</s><s>Both treatments significantly reduced SIGLEC1 expression ( p=0.028 and p=0.046,</s><s>Wilcoxon test).</s><s>The dashed line represents the calculated threshold of SIGLEC1 (260.5).</s><s>pSS, primary Sjögren's syndrome; SIGLEC1, sialic acid binding Ig like lectin 1; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.</s></p><p><s>in SLE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>In pSS, IP-10 was shown to be involved in lymphocyte infiltration into glandular tissue of patients with pSS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>Moreover, elevated levels of IP-10 in pSS were described recently by Howard Tripp et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Thus, overlapping features in the pathogenesis of SLE and pSS and evidence of an involvement of IP-10 in the pathogenesis of pSS, led to the hypothesis that IP-10 might also serve as biomarker in pSS.</s><s>This is the first study that investigated IP-10 as a biomarker of systemic disease avticity in pSS.</s><s>Likewise to the study of Howard Tripp et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> we found that IP-10 was significantly upregulated in patients with pSS (80%) compared to HD.</s><s>However, although SIGLEC1 and IP-10 are both induced by type I and II IFNs, unexpectedly, we could neither find a correlation of IP-10 to the disease activity nor observe a correlation between both markers. <ref type="bibr">14 15 18</ref></s><s>Gene expression data of in vitro stimulated human monocytes indicate quantitative and qualitative differences in the response signatures induced by IFN-α or with IFN-γ (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> The kinetics are completely different for IP-10 and SIGLEC1 mRNA expression: while IP-10 is strongly upregulated very early after stimulation, the induction of SIGLEC1 is relatively delayed.</s><s>Furthermore, there are indications that SIGLEC1 mRNA and protein expression is more stable compared to IP-10.</s><s>The upregulation of IP-10 in response to IFN-α and IFN-γ is ∼50-fold higher compared to the upregulation of SIGLEC1.</s><s>This could speak in favor that IP-10 is more acutely induced during the immune response and might be an explanation why there is a correlation to the flaring and waning disease course in SLE <ref type="bibr">16 37</ref> but not to the chronic disease course in pSS.</s><s>Moreover, Smiljanovic et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and others showed that SIGLEC1 is mainly upregulated by IFN-α, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> while IP-10 equally responds to IFN-α and IFN-γ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Recently it was shown that type I and II IFN expression patterns may contribute to distinct clinical phe-notypes in pSS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Nezos et al investigated the IFN-signature in minor salivary glands (MSG) of patients with pSS which were complicated by lymphoma and found that IFNγ is more prevalent in MSG of patients with lymphoma, compared to patients without lymphoma.</s><s>They proposed to use a ratio of IFN-α/IFN-γ in the diagnosis of salivary glands biopsies as a histopathological biomarker. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>Since IP-10 is regulated by IFN-γ, it would be interesting to study IP-10 in a pSS subset complicated by lymphoma.</s></p><p><s>The current study has some limitations.</s><s>First, we did not simultaneously analyse other biomarkers in pSS, such as MxA or CD64.</s><s>In particular the difference between MxA and SIGLEC1 expression in the context of a higher disease activity would have been of interest.</s><s>Second, the study did not enroll patients with pSS with central nervous or lymphoma manifestations which can contribute to an enhanced morbidity and mortality though both occur infrequently.</s><s>There remains the possibility that type I IFN signatures may differ between additional subgroups of extraglandular disease which needs to be addressed by subsequent studies.</s><s>Third, we cannot exclude that some patients taking hydroxychloroquine or prednisolone in the group of glandular disease would have an upregulation of SIGLEC1 expression without the respective medication.</s><s>We compared the SIGLEC1 expression in a subsequent analysis of a smaller pSS subgroup without medication and found a significant difference in SIGLEC1 expression as well as a reduction of SIGLEC1 expression by prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine.</s><s>It seems that SIGLEC1 expression is not only related to disease activity and with extraglandular disease but can also be modulated by therapeutic interventions.</s><s>In addition to new insights into the immunopathogenesis, these aspects may have clinical implications including general and targeted treatment considerations, especially targeting IFN pathways.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure
