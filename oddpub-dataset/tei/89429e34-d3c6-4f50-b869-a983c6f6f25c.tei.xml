<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Free access to essential medicines is a fundamental right.</s><s>Governments should provide accessible and affordable medicines to people.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to evaluate medicines' prices, availability and affordability in Jordan.</s><s>Method: Data was collected from 30 public sectors and 30 private sectors in 6 regions in Jordan.</s><s>At each institution, the availability and prices data of 50 originator brand (OB) medicines and lowest-price generic (LPG) equivalent medicines were collected.</s><s>Medicines' prices were compared with international reference prices (IRPs) to obtain a median price ratio (MPR).</s><s>Availability of medicines was determined on the day of data collection.</s><s>Affordability was calculated with regards to the daily income of the lowest-paid unskilled government employee.</s><s>Result: Availability of medicines in public and private sectors was 72% and 76% for LPGs, respectively.</s><s>Median MPRs of procurement prices for OBs and LPGs in the public sector were 1.1 and 5.5 times the IRPs, respectively.</s><s>Private sector OB medicines were priced 4.8 times higher than IRPs, whereas LPGs were 3.8 times higher.</s><s>OBs cost 14% more than LPGs in private sector.</s><s>The median MPRs of patient prices for LPGs in the public sector were lower than in the private sector (1.1 versus 7.6).</s><s>Generally, medicines' prices are affordable in public sector that the lowest paid unskilled government employee need less than a 1 day income to purchase the LPGs.</s><s>While in private sector, the medicine prices are not affordable.</s><s>For example, the treatment of hypertension either by LPGs or OBs needs more than 1 day income by lowest paid unskilled government employee.</s><s>Conclusion: This study showed good availability of LPGs in the public sector.</s><s>In private sector, it showed good availability of LPGs and OBs with higher patient prices.</s><s>The procurement prices in the public sector were reasonable in comparison to IRPs.</s><s>Policy evaluation efforts must be directed to cut medicines prices and to improve affordability in private sector.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p><s>Medicine facilities were visited to collect data about the prices and the availability of medicines.</s><s>In all facilities, data was collected on the same dosage form, strength and pack size for each medicine to allow local and international comparisons to be made.</s><s>For every medicine, data was collected for both products: the OB (the international brand product for the medicine) and the LPG equivalent (any product other than the originator brand that includes the same active ingredient).</s><s>Price information was collected for 1) procurement prices only in public sectors; and 2) patient prices in both public and private sectors.</s></p></div>
