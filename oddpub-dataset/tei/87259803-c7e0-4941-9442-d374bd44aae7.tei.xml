<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Angiogenesis is a complex remodeling process characterized by the sprouting of new blood vessels from preexisting ones, occurring mainly during embryonic development and in pathological processes such as cancer.</s><s>During the early stages of this process, endothelial cells (ECs) are stimulated to form new capillaries by growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF).</s><s>Angiopoietins (Angs) play a fundamental role in the subsequent maturation step, in which microvessels acquire a layer of mural cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells, which are critical for the development and maintenance of functional vasculature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Experimental evidence identifies the Angs and their Tie receptors as important regulators of tumorinduced angiogenesis and metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>So far, a major effort in the field of angiogenesis control has centered on the VEGF-VEGF receptor system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>However, despite partial success, resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, resulting from a variety of mechanisms, remains a major obstacle <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>The search for novel key downstream effectors as a possible common "signaling hub" between Angs and other known growth factors is therefore of potential significance in the perspective of angiogenesis control in cancer.</s></p><p><s>The Tie receptors and their Angiopoietin (Ang) ligands have been identified as the second vascular tissue-specific tyrosine kinase receptor system.</s><s>Angs-Tie system is essential during embryonic vessel assembly and for the correct organization and maturation of newly formed vessels and functions as a key regulator of adult vascular homeostasis in the later stages of the angiogenic cascade.</s><s>Thus, whereas VEGF signals promote initiating events in angiogenesis, such as ECs sprouting and proliferation, Ang-Tie signals appear to promote ECs survival and vascular assembly, stability, and maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The best-characterized Angs are Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), which are secreted glycoproteins with a dimeric structure and molecular weight of approximately 75 kDa <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> showing about 60% amino acid sequence homology.</s><s>Ang-1 is expressed by smooth muscle cells and other perivascular cells and acts in a paracrine manner as agonist of the endothelial Tie-2 receptor, whereas Ang-2 is considered as its antagonist although also reported to context-dependently act as a Tie-2 agonist inducing receptor phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The molecular basis for agonistic versus antagonistic functions of Ang-2 has not been unraveled.</s><s>Cell type specific effects, the degree of endothelial confluence, the duration of Ang-2 stimulation, concentration dependent effects, and the presence of the coreceptors such as Tie-1 have all been implicated in controlling agonistic versus antagonistic function of Ang-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Ang-1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Tie-2 in ECs and activates downstream signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.</s><s>In adult tissues, Ang-1 does not induce endothelial chemotaxis or proliferation but exerts a dual role: it stimulates angiogenesis at sites of vascular remodeling contributing to the formation of capillary sprouts, while it stimulates prosurvival pathways and promotes vascular quiescence in mature vessels, preventing apoptosis and inflammation through the activation of PI3K-AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Ang-2 is almost exclusively expressed by ECs where it is stored in Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Following cytokine activation of the endothelium, Ang-2 is rapidly released and acts in an autocrine manner on Tie-2 receptor binding as homodimers or multimers.</s><s>Under physiological conditions, in the adult tissues Ang-2 is expressed in regions of vascular remodelling, during vascularization of the retina or during vessel formation/regression of ovarian corpus luteum.</s><s>Ang-2 expression is also upregulated under pathological conditions, for example, in the endothelium of tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, experimental evidence indicates that signaling downstream of Tie-2 activation is influenced by the subcellular localization of the receptor, which is different in confluent versus sparse ECs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>In these studies, Ang-1 produced stronger AKT signaling in confluent cells, in which Tie-2 was localized at cell/cell junctions, and stronger ERK activation when cells were sparse and Tie-2 was localized at cell/matrix junction, indicating that the effect of Ang-1 on Tie-2 activation may depend on the nature of cell/cell or cell/matrix contacts.</s><s>Less well known is the role of calcium (Ca 2+ ) in the regulation of angiogenic processes.</s><s>Ca 2+ is a crucial point of intersection for many distinct molecular signaling pathways that promote and modulate angiogenesis.</s><s>Specific Ca 2+ signatures rely upon spatiotemporal variations in [Ca 2+ ] i <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and are mainly based on three second messengers, namely, inositol trisphosphate (IP 3 ) and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR), which mobilize Ca 2+ from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, and nicotinic acid adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), which triggers Ca 2+ release from acidic organelles <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>We have previously demonstrated that histamine H1 receptors mediate NAADP-dependent Ca 2+ signaling in ECs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and have recently identified that in HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) VEGF increases [Ca 2+ ] i by mobilizing Ca 2+ from internal stores.</s><s>The latter study demonstrated the direct role of NAADP in VEGF-induced Ca 2+ mobilization from acidic organelles and its important involvement in the control of angiogenic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>To our knowledge, the role of Ca 2+ signaling in the regulation of Ang-1/Ang-2-induced angiogenesis has not been investigated yet.</s><s>In the present work, we identify a novel pathway for Angs-Tie signaling whereby receptor activation leads to IP 3 -and cADPRdependent Ca 2+ release and show that each of these Ca 2+ mobilizing second messengers specifically controls distinct Angs-mediated angiogenic steps.</s></p></div>
