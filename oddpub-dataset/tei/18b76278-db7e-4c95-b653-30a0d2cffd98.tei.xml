<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present multi-center prospective study has several important findings.</s><s>COPD is a common comorbidity of CAP and associated with increased short-and longterm mortality.</s><s>Age and ICU-admission, and not COPD per se, were independent risk factors for CAP mortality.</s><s>Additionally, CAP in COPD patients is related to increased severity of pneumonia and prolonged hospitalization.</s><s>The clinical presentation of CAP in COPD patients is different as compared to CAP-only patients.</s></p><p><s>In accordance with previous CAPNETZ publications, <ref type="bibr">20,</ref><ref type="bibr">21</ref> overall CAP mortality rates were low in the present population.</s><s>There are several explanations for this observation.</s><s>First, it should be noted that the average age of the study population was lower than in most registry studies, which partly explains the lower mortality rates.</s><s>Moreover, signed informed consent was obligatory for participation in CAPNETZ, while in Despite the low mortality rates, COPD patients had more than twice as high a risk of dying due to CAP than CAPonly patients.</s><s>6]<ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> The discrepancies found can possibly be due to inclusion of ICU patients with very severe pneumonia, 2 differences in severity of airflow limitation in COPD patients, variability in other patients' characteristics, such as age and comorbidities, <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref> and the initiated therapy.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study prospectively addressing 180-day mortality.</s><s>Others found contradicting results.</s><s>Restrepo et al, 4 found a significantly higher 90-day mortality rate for CAP-COPD patients, whereas Crisafulli et al 7 did not find differences in 90-day, as well as 1-year mortality.</s></p><p><s>Finding significant differences when comparing CAP-only and CAP-COPD patients in univariate analysis, suggested that COPD could be of influence on mortality rates in CAP patients.</s><s>However, when adjusting for other characteristics, COPD was no independent predictor of shortand long-term mortality.</s><s>This is in line with a recent meta-analysis, in which COPD didn't affect mortality in patients with CAP (OR=1.44,</s><s>95%CI 0.97-2.16).</s><s>12 By our knowledge, Restrepo et al 4 were the only ones who assessed the relationship between COPD and long-term mortality in multivariate analyses.</s><s>They observed an association between COPD and 90-day mortality.</s><s>It is worth noticing that, all referred studies used different characteristics to adjust for, which could have influenced the results.</s></p><p><s>Predictors of short-and long-term CAP mortality in the present study were age and ICU-admission.</s><s>Age as an independent risk factor is not surprising, as older age itself is associated with increased mortality.</s><s>In addition to age, ICU-admission was associated with an increased risk of both shortand long-term mortality.</s><s>Comparable results of population-based studies, this is not the case. 22</s><s>Thus, possibly less critically ill patients were included in the present study, as more critically ill patients were not able to provide written informed consent.</s><s>ICU-admission between CAP-COPD and CAPonly patients were observed by others. <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref></s><s>ICUadmission was identified as a significant predictor of CAP-mortality by others, which did not sustain when adjusted for other confounders. <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s>In contrast, Restrepo et al 4 observed increased ICU-admission in CAP-COPD patients, which did not result in differences in 30-and 90-day mortality rates comparing COPD and non-COPD patients who needed ICU-admission.</s><s>Rello et al 2 observed a higher ICU mortality in CAP-COPD patients, compared with non-COPD patients.</s></p><p><s>The length of hospital stay was increased in CAP-COPD patients.</s><s>Pifarre et al 8 showed comparable results in CAP-COPD patients, while others did not find this association. <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7</ref></s><s>Differences can partly be explained by the criteria used to discharge patients, which differ between hospitals, the attending physician and different health care systems.</s><s>However, longer hospital stays could be anticipated, 24,25 as CAP-COPD patients suffered from more severe CAP.</s></p><p><s>The question arose if including former and current smokers in the CAP-only group could have influenced the outcomes, as there is a possibility that smoking, CAP-only patients are in fact CAP-COPD patients.</s><s>Results of baseline characteristics, laboratory data, clinical parameters, severity scores and mortality rates were almost comparable to the results stated above (online data supplement).</s><s>Overall, it could be stated that smoking status of CAP-only patients was not of influence on characteristics of group comparisons and mortality-rates.</s></p><p><s>A limitation of the present study is that the primary outcome of the initial CAPNETZ-study was not to describe mortality rates in CAP-COPD patients, although mortality in CAP patients was one of the objectives.</s><s>Assessment of COPD as a comorbidity was added to the study starting in December 2009.</s><s>Due to the study design, this assessment relied on medical reports because patients were included during the acute phase of their pneumonia.</s><s>Hereby, there was no structured extensive baseline assessment of COPD severity.</s><s>However, lung function results, together with cigarette smoke exposure and appraisal of inhalation medication, were used to identify COPD patients.</s><s>Study physicians assessed the most recent lung function results and defined the appropriate GOLD stage.</s><s>This resulted in data concerning COPD diagnosis and severity.</s><s>We chose this concept in order to keep the extensive database manageable with the drawback of lacking specific lung function data.</s></p><p><s>A strength of the present study is the extensive manner and accurate characterization of CAP patients systematically including chest x-ray.</s><s>Using a combination of chest x-ray and clinical symptoms to diagnose pneumonia, provides a more objective way of diagnosis, as compared to using only physical examination, clinical characteristics, or chest x-ray alone. <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref></s><s>Moreover, CAPNETZ has a prospective design and is possibly the largest cohort on CAP worldwide.</s><s>It is a multi-center study, with centers in 5 different European countries, including both in-and outpatients, which makes the results also relevant for the general population.</s><s>The cohort is representative of patients with CAP in more economically developed countries. <ref type="bibr">26</ref></s><s>n conclusion, COPD is common in patients with CAP and results in increased severity of pneumonia.</s><s>Moreover, age and ICU-admission are important risk factors for mortality in CAP.</s><s>Further study of ICUadmission as a risk factor seems warranted.</s><s>To us, there is no clear therapeutic pattern which could conclusively explain the differences in mortality discussed above.</s><s>Although COPD itself was not an independent risk factor for mortality, this group is at higher risk of dying due to CAP, with generally a higher age and more severe CAP.</s><s>Further research is necessary to identify specific COPD characteristics associated with mortality, which can possibly contribute to better management of CAP-COPD patients.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>journal.copdfoundation.org</s><s>JCOPDF © 2015 Volume 2 • Number 2 •
