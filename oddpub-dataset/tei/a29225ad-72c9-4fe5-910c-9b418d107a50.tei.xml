<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The burden of type 2 diabetes is globally high, with sub-Saharan African migrants in Europe being almost three times more likely to have type 2 diabetes than the European host population <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In the sub-Saharan African region, type 2 diabetes prevalence has been increasing rapidly over recent decades and is projected to increase most in this region over all world regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A combination of genetics and health-related behaviours are thought to cause type 2 diabetes by contributing to increased insulin resistance and reduced beta cell function.</s><s>These result in impaired fasting blood glucose (IFBG) and, ultimately, type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, increased insulin resistance is initially compensated by elevated beta cell function <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>However, once insulin resistance increases to a level where beta cell function can no longer compensate, IFBG develops <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in sub-Saharan Africans is still poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The importance of insulin resistance and beta cell failure to produce insulin in the development of IFBG and type 2 diabetes seems to differ among sub-Saharan African populations compared with European populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Studies have shown that insulin resistance is more severe and beta cell insulin production is elevated in African populations with normal glucose tolerance compared with European populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, during the progression of normal glucose tolerance to IFBG and type 2 diabetes, insulin production has been found to decrease more rapidly in African populations than in European populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>However, most of these studies have been performed in African-Americans <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> (who are more genetically admixed compared with sub-Saharan African populations) or on a small sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The high burden of type 2 diabetes among African migrants in Europe, and the steep increase in type 2 diabetes in urbanising Africa, indicate that environmental exposures, such as changes in health-related behaviours, and resulting changes in anthropometrics might play a role in a disruption of balance between beta cell function and insulin sensitivity in these individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>However, data on the role of the environment in the development of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction among Africans are limited.</s><s>Furthermore, there are indications that the determinants of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction at play among Africans may differ from European populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is unclear which determinants (e.g.</s><s>sociodemographic factors, anthropometrics or healthrelated behaviours) are driving insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction in African populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study found differences in IFBG and type 2 diabetes prevalence among Ghanaians that were resident in multiple geographical locations.</s><s>While type 2 diabetes prevalence was highest among Ghanaians in Berlin (12.8%), followed by Amsterdam (11.2%),</s><s>London (9.4%), urban Ghana (9.3%) and rural Ghana (4.9%), IFBG prevalence was highest among Ghanaians in Amsterdam (27.5%), followed by London (14.7%), urban Ghana (11.9%),</s><s>Berlin (11.2%) and rural Ghana (11.2%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>The relatively homogenous but geographically distinct population of the RODAM study offers an important opportunity to investigate the role of environment and health-related behaviours in insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction among this sub-Saharan African population.</s></p><p><s>We therefore used data from the RODAM study as a means to: (1) assess the contribution of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction to differences in IFBG between sub-Saharan Africans in different geographical locations; and (2) investigate which sociodemographic, anthropometric and healthrelated behaviour determinants contribute to insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction among this population.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The findings from this study demonstrate that, compared with Ghanaians in rural Ghana, the prevalence and age-and sex-adjusted odds for IFBG were higher for those in urban Ghana, Amsterdam and London but were similar between those in rural Ghana and Berlin.</s><s>Insulin resistance accounted for the differences in IFBG between locations of residence, except for Amsterdam, while beta cell dysfunction did not.</s><s>BMI and waist circumference were most strongly associated  Data are presented as mean (95% CI), % (95% CI) or median (interquartile range) BP, blood pressure with insulin resistance in Ghanaians.</s><s>Exceeding the guideline for alcohol consumption and smoking were the two determinants that showed the strongest positive associations with beta cell dysfunction.</s></p><p><s>It is speculated that the increasing burden of IFBG and type 2 diabetes in African migrants and urbanising Africa might be driven by environmental exposures that disturb the balance between beta cell function and insulin sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study that has looked at differences in insulin resistance and beta cell function among a sub-Saharan African population living in different geographical locations.</s><s>Previous research by Osei et al demonstrated greater insulin resistance in African-Americans compared with Nigerians <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Here we found that levels of insulin resistance varied between Ghanaians living in different geographical locations, even within Europe.</s><s>Insulin resistance accounted for most of the differences in IFBG between locations.</s><s>In contrast, after inclusion of inverse HOMA-B in an age-and sex-adjusted logistic regression model, the odds for IFBG were increased in multiple geographical locations compared with rural Ghana.</s><s>This finding is consistent with a study in Koreans that found no association between lower HOMA-B and IFBG <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>In the current study, the lack of contribution of HOMA-B to differences in IFBG between locations and the weak association between HOMA-B and IFBG may be suggestive of compensation by the beta cells to overcome the reduced insulin sensitivity that accompanies this condition.</s><s>Hence, in IFBG, environmental and associated health-related behaviour changes seem to impact insulin resistance more than beta cell dysfunction.</s></p><p><s>In sub-Saharan Africans, the prediabetes phase (defined as IFBG in this study) was suggested to be characterised by insulin resistance rather than failure of insulin secretion; per SD increase of HOMA-IR the odds for IFBG were 3.26 compared with 1.13 for 1 SD increase in HOMA-B.</s><s>In the corresponding calculations of attributable risk for IFBG, we found that if the entire study population had a HOMA-IR that was 1 SD higher, there would be between 63% and 75% more individuals with IFBG.</s><s>In comparison, if HOMA-B was 1 SD higher in the entire population, between 5% and 17% more individuals would have IFBG (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>This is in line with studies in African-Americans that found more severe insulin resistance in individuals with normal glucose tolerance or prediabetes, the latter being defined as IFBG or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, studies among sub-Saharan Africans with type 2 diabetes have found variable insulin resistance in these individuals compared with individuals without type 2 diabetes, but fast declines in insulin secretion after diagnosis with type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>According to the model by Gibson <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>,  sub-Saharan Africans in a normal blood glucose state present an equilibrium characterised by both higher insulin resistance and higher beta cell function.</s><s>When insulin resistance becomes more severe, initially beta cell function compensates for this change.</s><s>However, when this beta cell compensation fails, type 2 diabetes develops.</s><s>Longitudinal studies are needed to fully elucidate the progression from normal blood glucose state to impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes among sub-Saharan Africans.</s></p><p><s>The determinants that contributed to insulin resistance among Ghanaians included anthropometric indices that

determinants are also converted to standardised z scores</s></p><p><s>In bivariate analyses, each determinant was individually included in the model.</s><s>In multivariate analyses, all determinants were simultaneously included in the model a Guideline: ≤1 unit of alcohol per day for women and ≤2 units of alcohol per day for men <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> of 36 Ghanaians residing in urban Ghana <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally we found that alcohol consumption exceeding the recommendations and smoking contributed to more beta cell dysfunction.</s><s>The negative associations of beta cell dysfunction with BMI and waist circumference reinforce the notion that compensation by beta cells for more severe insulin resistance might play a role in IFBG.</s><s>Furthermore, a family history of diabetes was found to contribute to increased insulin resistance severity and somewhat less beta cell dysfunction.</s><s>This apparent contradiction could again result from an increased compensatory beta cell function among those with more severe insulin resistance.</s><s>Lifestyle interventions, including either physical activity alone or combined with dietary advice aiming at weight loss, have been shown to significantly reduce the progression of IGT to type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>While pharmacological intervention with, for example, metformin also targets insulin resistance, previous studies do not demonstrate it to be more effective than lifestyle interventions in terms of primary prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>The reduction of BMI could be fruitful as a means to reduce the high burden of IFBG and subsequent type 2 diabetes among urban Africans and African migrants in Europe.</s><s>Despite the observed associations of smoking and excessive alcohol consumption with beta cell dysfunction, public health interventions may not be worthwhile considering the relatively low prevalence of alcohol consumption and smoking in the population studied.</s></p><p><s>We found that insulin resistance accounted for the differences in IFBG between all geographical locations except Amsterdam.</s><s>Among Ghanaians in Amsterdam, the odds for IFBG remained three times higher compared with rural Ghana when adjusted for insulin resistance and beta cell function.</s><s>An excessively high prevalence of IFBG among Ghanaians in Amsterdam has been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, a very high prevalence of IFBG has also been observed among the host Dutch population <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>We found that Ghanaians in Amsterdam had more severe insulin resistance compared with all other sites, and lower beta cell function compared with London, urban Ghana and Berlin (however, the difference in beta cell function was only significant compared with Berlin).</s><s>This may imply that the failure of beta cell function to compensate for the more severe insulin resistance in Ghanaians in Amsterdam had already set in.</s><s>In post hoc analyses (data not shown), waist circumference was the only modifiable risk factor associated with IFBG in Amsterdam, while in the other locations waist circumference was not associated with IFBG.</s></p><p><s>Hence, there is a potential for body fat distribution and, perhaps, the ratio of subcutaneous:visceral body fat to play a role in the difference in IFBG prevalence in Ghanaians in Amsterdam compared with those in other geographical locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>However, this requires further study.</s></p><p><s>It is unclear why there was a relatively low prevalence of IFBG in Berlin compared with other European sites.</s></p><p><s>Previously, in the same cohort, we found Berlin to have a marginally higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes compared with other European sites and Ghana <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>It is possible that IFBG progresses more rapidly into type 2 diabetes in this location than in other sites.</s><s>Further research is required to determine the progression from normal glucose to IFBG and subsequent type 2 diabetes in different geographical
