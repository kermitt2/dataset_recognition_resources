<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nanocones morphological and optical properties.</head><p><s>Arrays of random NCs were formed with different sizes depending on the value of the maximum energy.</s><s>Silicon NCs were distributed throughout the irradiated annealed section.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref> shows the NCs at the center of the section annealed with an E max of 260 mJ/cm 2 .</s><s>It could be seen that only the upper part of the deposited a-Si layer contributed in forming the NCs while leaving approximately a 350 nm thick a-Si layer underneath.</s><s>This indicates that the NCs are formed by transferring the a-Si material from some parts to others not by etching any of the deposited a-Si.</s></p><p><s>Increasing the E max increases the size of the NCs; the length and the diameter.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(b-f) show the NCs formed with E max values of 260 mJ/cm 2 , 300 mJ/cm 2 , 350 mJ/cm 2 , 390 mJ/cm 2 and 520 mJ/cm 2 , respectively.</s><s>The length and diameter distribution for each case was measured.</s><s>it could be seen from the SEM images that there is a large spread in the size of the NCs.</s><s>To indicate the spread in the length and base diameter of the NCs, a histogram for the length and the diameter of each sample was calculated.</s><s>From the histogram, the mean and the standard deviation were calculated and a Gaussian curve was plotted accordingly.</s><s>The histograms along with the gaussian distribution for the samples with different E max are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</s><s>In these measurements, the number of cones measured in each sample varied between 50 and 80 cones.</s><s>The area chosen for measuring the cones' size was varied from 5 to 10 µm 2 according to the size of the cones.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows accurately the spread in the length and the diameter of each measurement.</s><s>To summarize the results and gain a better insight on the effect of the energy on changing the NC size, the mean of each measurement is plotted versus the energy for both the length and the diameter.</s><s>The standard deviations are also indicated as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. NCs formed with an E max of 220 mJ/cm 2 had an average length of 148 nm while the base diameter is 209 nm.</s><s>Increasing the E max to 260 mJ/cm 2 caused a rapid increase in the length (262 nm) and diameter (443 nm) Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b</ref>).</s><s>Further increase in E max (300 mJ/cm 2 ) increased the length to 397 nm and the diameter to 610 nm as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(c)</ref>.</s><s>For E max equals 350 mJ/cm 2 , the length of the NCs reached 439 nm and the diameter 725 nm as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(d</ref>).</s><s>It could be seen that NCs with lengths larger than the thickness of the deposited a-Si are obtained confirming that the transfer in material is the mechanism forming the NCs.</s><s>Clearly, both the length and the base diameter of the NCs increase with increasing E max .</s><s>The measured length of the NCs were done while considering the 20° tilt.</s><s>The apparent length was divided by cos (20) to calculate the actual length without the tilt.</s></p><p><s>At 350 mJ/cm 2 , most of the deposited a-Si was already consumed in forming the NCs.</s><s>Thus, any added energy resulted in forming irregular shapes as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(e</ref>) for E max equals 390 mJ/cm 2 .</s><s>Moreover, the layer started to be ablated with additional increase in energy as could be seen in the larger voids between the structures in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(f</ref>) for E max equals 520 mJ/cm 2 .</s></p><p><s>To examine the optical properties of these nanostructured Silicon films, spectrophotometer analysis has been performed.</s><s>A large, broadband increase in absorption has been detected for the NCs compared to the reference bare a-Si film without any nanostructuring.</s><s>The as-deposited 370 nm a-Si has two absorption peaks at 520 nm and 580 nm as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(a)</ref>.</s><s>These peaks are attributed to the fabry perot resonances in the thin film.</s><s>For wavelengths beyond 650 nm, the bare a-Si layer has a very low absorption of around 10%.</s><s>At this small thickenss of a-Si, the losses at the long wavelength range become severe.</s><s>Introducing the NCs on top of the a-Si resulted in a significant increase in absorption over the entire measured wavelength range as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(a)</ref>.</s><s>Increasing E max from 220 mJ/cm 2 to 260 mJ/cm 2 resulted in an increase in absorption.</s><s>Further increase in E max resulted in increasing the absorption in the short wavelength range while a slight decrease was observed at the    long wavelength range.</s><s>It could be seen that at higher energies (E max = 390 mJ/cm 2 and 520 mJ/cm 2 ), the absorption spectrum continued decreasing at the long wavelength range.</s><s>The high absorption at the short wavelength observed for the E max = 520 mJ/cm 2 samples could be attributed to the larger length shapes obtained at this high energy.</s><s>The decrease in absorption after E max = 350 mJ/cm 2 could be due to the larger voids between the cones and the depletion of silicon in these voids.</s><s>The randomness of the produced NCs offers a variety of diameters that yields this broadband absorption enhancement.</s></p><p><s>In previous measurements, the energy was varied while keeping the time and frequency constant.</s><s>Next, the effect of changing the time and frequency is studied while fixing E max to 300 mJ/cm 2 .</s><s>Decreasing the time in which the energy is gradually increased to 300 mJ/cm 2 , resulted in the formation of smaller NCs with an average length of 230 nm and a diameter of 290 nm as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6(a)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the density of the NCs is less compared to all other conditions with T = 40 s.</s><s>This indicates that the NCs continue to form throughout the time of increasing the energy and not only at the beginning of the laser pulse irradiation.</s><s>For these reasons, the decreased time condition showed the least absorption as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(b)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, increasing the time to 60 s resulted in longer NCs with average length of 510 nm.</s><s>However, the average diameter is only 415 nm.</s><s>Hence, the structure in this case is different and has a length larger that the diameter.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6(b)</ref> shows that this structure looks more like nanoparticles or extremely short nanowires.</s></p><p><s>Regarding the frequency variations, values were increased from the previous 10 Hz to 20 and 30 Hz.</s><s>For higher frequency samples, the time was reduced to 25 s in order to prevent the formation of irregular shapes.</s><s>Having a high frequency such as 30 Hz resulted in longer NCs, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6(d)</ref>, with an average length of 545 nm and a diameter of 465 nm.</s><s>Here, longer NCs are obtained without causing irregular shapes as in the case of increasing the energy density.</s><s>These long NCs resulted in the highest absorption, especially in the short wavelength as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(b) for the NCs formed with 30 Hz in 25 s.</s><s>The slightly reduced absorption in the long wavelength range may be attributed to the more rounded tip of the NCs compared to the sharp tip obtained with other conditions.</s><s>It could be concluded that increasing any of the laser parameters (E max, T or f) increases the length of the NCs.</s></p><p><s>The enhancement in absorption is calculated using the formula: enhancement is obtained at the long wavelength range where the absorption in the bare a-Si layer was minimal due to the small thickness of the film.</s><s>The strong enhancement in light absorption is attributed to the reduced reflection of the textured Silicon layer compared to the flat one.</s><s>Introducing a NC structure causes a gradual change in the refractive index resulting in supressing the reflection.</s><s>In addition, this surface texturing increases light scattering in the a-Si under layer, resulting in increased light path length and thus increased absorption.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">λ λ λ = − × Enhancement factor(%) A( ) A ( )<label>A</label></formula><p><s>Another problem that arises for many Silicon solar cells is the angle dependent absorption.</s><s>Away from the oblique light incidence, the reflection starts to increase causing a reduced absorption in the solar cell.</s><s>For the bare 370 nm a-Si layer, the refection at angles from 10° to 60° is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8(a)</ref>.</s><s>It could be seen that the two peaks found in the absorption correspond to two dips in the reflection due to the Fabry Perot resonance in the thin film.</s><s>Except at these two dips, the reflection in the whole wavelength range is above 30% and increases with increasing the angle of incidence.</s><s>The proposed structure with NCs shows a much reduced reflection not exceeding 5% in the whole wavelength range for angle of incidences up to 40°.</s><s>At 50° and 60°, although the reflection slightly increases at longer wavelengths, it does not surpass 10% in all cases.</s><s>This wide angle anti-reflective property is essential in the new generation of thin film Silicon solar cells and would play a significant role in the commercialization of such devices.</s></p><p><s>To gain further insight on the phenomena occurring at each time interval while increasing the energy during laser irradiation, AFM is performed for 4 samples with gradually increasing the energy.</s><s>The first sample had an energy density increasing from 45 to 130 mJ/cm 2 in 16 s Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>(a), the second one from 45 to 175 mJ/cm 2 in 24 seconds Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>(b), the third one from 45 to 215 mJ/cm 2 in 32 s Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9(c</ref>) and finally from 45 to 260 mJ/cm 2 in 60 s Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9(d)</ref>.</s><s>These images show the step-by-step progression of forming the nanocones in order to aid in analyzing the process of their formation by showing what happens at each time interval in these 60 s.</s><s>In the first 16 s, small NCs (30 nm in length) are formed.</s><s>Then, the length of NCs starts to increase in some areas in the sample reaching 120 nm as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9(b)</ref>.</s><s>Additional increase in length (up to 500 nm) is observed as the energy density and the exposure time increase.</s><s>Further increase in the energy density did not increase the length any further.</s><s>However, more NCs were formed.</s><s>It could be concluded from the AFM images that as the time pass while  increasing the energy density, the size of the nanocones increase and the number of formed nanocones increases as well.</s></p><p><s>Due to the lower thermal conductivity of the silica substrate compared to Silicon, the absorbed heat due to the laser irradiation is mainly dissipated laterally <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Thus, the laser irradiation causes the surface of the deposited a-Si film to melt laterally.</s><s>After laser induced melting, the Silicon surface starts to cool and re-solidifies.</s><s>During re-solidification, the edges get more rapidly cooled than the center <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Hence, different densities arise in the same spot.</s><s>Since the density of liquid Silicon (2.52 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> ) is larger than the density of solid amorphous Silicon (1.1 g/cm 3 ), the liquid Silicon occupies a smaller volume than the solid a-Si <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, the volume of the Silicon increases during the solidification process.</s></p><p><s>Since the solidified material occupies a larger volume, it pushes the remaining liquid Silicon upward forming the NC.</s><s>However, the NCs are formed as an array of several NCs within the same laser irradiated spot.</s><s>This could be due to either the excitation of capillary waves or surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) waves <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>The SPP waves are excited due to the excitation of large number of electrons in the conduction band during laser irradiation.</s><s>Thus, the incident laser interferes with these surface waves causing periodic modulation of the laser light intensity, therefore, periodic structures are formed.</s><s>In addition, during the cooling phase, a-Si material crystallizes while forming the NCs.</s><s>This is confirmed by the Raman measurements shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>.</s><s>While the as-deposited film shows a weak and broad peak located at ∼480 cm −1 corresponding to a typical a-Si peak Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(a)</ref>, the laser annealed film exhibited a sharp peak centered around ∼520 cm −1 ,

(FESEM).</s><s>All SEM images are taken for the cross section of the sample.</s><s>Prior to SEM measurements, the samples were cut in the middle of the laser spot to be able to visualize their cross section.</s><s>Then, they were sputtered with Au to make the surface conductive to be able to visualize it in the SEM.</s><s>Au sputtering was done for 40 seconds using one target.</s><s>After sputtering, the samples were placed inside the SEM chamber with their cross section facing the electron gun and titled with 20°. the chamber was evacuated to reach a base pressure of 1 × 10 −9 mbar for gun vacuum and 1 × 10 −5 mbar for chamber vacuum.</s><s>In all measurements, the electron gun was adjusted in the middle of the laser irradiated spot so that the electron beam hit the sample in the middle.</s><s>The contrast and brightness of each sample were adjusted to reach the optimum contrast for each image independently and the focus was adjusted accordingly.</s><s>The scan rate for all images was adjusted so that each image was taken in 2 minutes.</s><s>The InLens detector was used in the majority of the SEM images.</s><s>In order to get clear images of the structures, the working distance was typically set between 1 and 3 mm and the acceleration voltage to 8 kV.</s><s>The morphology analysis was examined using VEECO Dimension 3100 Atomic force microscopy (AFM).</s><s>The tapping mode was used during the measurements with a sharpened DNP-S10 silicon nitride probe (tip radius = 10 nm and tip height = 2.5 um).</s><s>For the first two samples, the AFM scan area was 1µmx1µm with a scan rate of 1.969 Hz.</s><s>For the second two samples, the AFM scan area was 5µmx5µm with a scan rate of 1.001 Hz.</s><s>For absorption and reflection measurements, a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 (UV-VIS NIR) spectrophotometer was used.</s><s>The absorption is measured using a 150 mm integrated sphere unit (Lab Sphere).</s><s>The wall of the integrated sphere unit as well as the reference are made of a spectralon material (a fluoropolymer that has a very high diffuse reflectance).</s><s>The setting up of the experiment is done using a UV Winlab software application.</s><s>The procedure for the measurements starts by first recording a baseline scan by doing 0% reflection and 100% reflection while there are no samples.</s><s>The 0% reflection detects a dark signal, while blocking the beam, to measure the noise signal of the detector.</s><s>The 100% reflection detect the reflection of the spectralon material as a reference measurement.</s><s>The detector used in the visible range is a R955 photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector that is embedded in the internal walls of the integrated sphere unit.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> in the supplementary materials shows the beam directions inside the integrated sphere unit.</s><s>After doing the baseline measurements, the sample is placed inside the integrated sphere unit.</s><s>The PMT detector measures the percentage of the diffuse reflection from the sample compared to the reference (%R) and then measures the absorption according to the formula A = 2 − log 10 (%R).</s><s>Reflection at multiple angles were measured using the universal reflectance unit accessory which measure the specular reflection at variable angles.</s><s>These measurements are done by first collecting the baseline measurements.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> in the supplementary materials shows the beam direction for collecting the baseline measurements inside the universal reflectance unit.</s><s>For the baseline measurements, the input mirror rotates to direct the beam off the sample.</s><s>The detector assembly moves vertically and with an angle to capture the reflected light according to the angle of incidence.</s><s>The input mirror also moves horizontally to set the angle of incidence for the detector assembly.</s><s>When the sample measurements are taken, the input mirror changes its angle to direct the beam to the sample as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>.</s><s>The detector used for measurements in the UV-Vis range is a silicon detector.</s><s>The Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature using ProRaman-L analyzer with the excitation wavelength of 532 nm, 66 mW laser diode and a linewidth 2.0 cm −1 .</s><s>The laser spot has a diameter of 0.7 mm and a Gaussian shape.</s><s>The laser is fiber coupled to a 0.22 NA objective lens which is mounted adjacent to the detector.</s><s>The sample is placed underneath the laser beam so that it is flat and perpendicular to the beam.</s></p><p><s>Data and materials availability.</s><s>All data needed to evaluate
