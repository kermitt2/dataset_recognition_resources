target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) show a similar distribution of binding sites of T (16%-23%), Sox2 (19%-27%), or both factors (51%-63%), and thus no enrichment of either factor in any of the five groups is evident (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Together, these data show that the vast majority of genes that are differentially expressed in NMPs and their neural or
