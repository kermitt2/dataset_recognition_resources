<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Currently, it is unclear whether pediatric multiple sclerosis (PMS) is a pathoetiologically homogeneous disease phenotype due to clinical and epidemiological differences between early and late onset PMS (EOPMS and LOPMS).</s><s>Consequently, the question was raised whether diagnostic guidelines need to be complemented by specific EOPMS markers.</s><s>To search for such markers, we analyzed cerebral MRI images acquired with standard protocols using computer-based classification techniques.</s><s>Specifically, we applied classification algorithms to gray (GM) and white matter (WM) tissue probability parameters of small brain regions derived from T2-weighted MRI images of EOPMS patients (onset b12 years), LOPMS patients (onset ≥12 years), and healthy controls (HC).</s><s>This was done for PMS subgroups matched for disease duration and participant age independently.</s><s>As expected, maximal diagnostic information for distinguishing PMS patients and HC was found in a periventricular WM area containing lesions (87.1% accuracy, p b 2.2 × 10 −5 ).</s><s>MRI-based biomarkers specific for EOPMS were identified in prefrontal cortex.</s><s>Specifically, a coordinate in middle frontal gyrus contained maximal diagnostic information (77.3%, p = 1.8 × 10 −4 ).</s><s>Taken together, we were able to identify biomarkers reflecting pathognomonic processes specific for MS patients with very early onset.</s><s>Especially GM involvement in the separation between PMS subgroups suggests that conventional MRI contains a richer set of diagnostically informative features than previously assumed.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we identified diagnostic features in conventional MRI images separating between EOPMS patients, LOPMS patients and HC subjects by applying computer-based classification techniques to locally specific brain tissue probability information.</s></p><p><s>Three main analyses were conducted that investigated diagnostic separability within the three pairs of groups (EOPMS vs. LOPMS, EOPMS vs. HC, and LOPMS vs. HC) based on gray as well as white matter voxel tissue probability information.</s><s>In these analyses, the PMS groups were matched by disease duration, lesion load and gender whereas the same comparisons were computed in three supplementary analyses (S1 -S3) based on PMS groups matched for age, lesion load and gender.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zivadinov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Polman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Morgen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Prinster et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Filippi and Rocca, 2005)</ref>, a set of widely distributed brain areas was identified across analyses.</s><s>Among these, areas were detected that are discussed as key markers for MS such as WM areas in vicinity of e.g.</s><s>caudate nucleus and thalamus (i.e.</s><s>'periventricular' WM areas, cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Polman et al., 2011)</ref> and for these areas, very high accuracy has been obtained.</s><s>Specifically, for the separation of EOPMS and HC (based on PMS groups matched for age, gender and lesion load, Analysis S2), an accuracy of 87.1% has been reached for a WM coordinate close to caudate nucleus (MNI: -18, -18, 30).</s><s>However, besides these well established markers temporal and frontal GM areas have also been identified, which are less well known to be diagnostically relevant, although their general involvement in MS has repeatedly been reported (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Morgen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Prinster et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>For example, 87.1% accuracy has been reached for a GM locus in the middle temporal pole (MNI: -16, 10, -38) for the separation of LOPMS and HC (based on PMS groups matched for disease duration, gender and lesion load, Analysis 3).</s></p><p><s>Unfortunately, identification of biomarkers for the separation of EOPMS patients from HC subjects or even for EOPMS vs. LOPMS patients alone does not necessarily imply that the markers are also specific for EOPMS.</s><s>To the contrary, many of the markers found for EOPMS vs. HC are considered to be generic markers for MS.</s><s>Markers found for EOPMS vs. LOPMS are not necessarily specific as PMS subgroups differed in terms of age in Analysis 1 (or disease duration in Analysis S1).</s><s>These differences cannot be easily avoided by e.g.</s><s>another matching procedure because they follow from the conjunction of a) the mutual dependence of the factors disease onset, disease duration and age (e.g., age is the sum of disease onset and duration) and b) the definition of EOPMS and LOPMS in terms of their different disease onset, disease duration and age (e.g., age is the sum of disease onset and duration) and b) the definition of EOPMS and LOPMS in terms of their different disease onset.</s><s>Thus, within this constellation, balancing one of the factors disease duration or age automatically results in inducing a bias in the other.</s></p><p><s>Consequently, balancing alone cannot be sufficient to guarantee specificity of biomarkers identified in the comparison EOPMS vs. LOPMS.</s><s>Instead, an additional group comparison must be taken into account that is comparably characterized by a difference in age or disease duration.</s><s>Specifically, given that certain findings are made only in the EOPMS vs. LOPMS comparison but not for a pair of groups that is similarly characterized by one of these confounding factors, it is unlikely that underlying differences observed in EOPMS vs. LOPMS are induced by the confound since its effect should be comparable across analyses.</s></p><p><s>A comparison for which this condition was fulfilled was LOPMS vs. HC (Analysis 3).</s><s>In particular, the average age in the LOPMS group was higher than in the EOPMS group and (comparably) higher than in the HC group (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, biomarkers identified in the EOPMS vs. LOPMS but not in the LOPMS vs. HC comparison should not depend on differences in participant age (and disease duration) and should thus be specific for EOPMS.</s><s>This specific result pattern was found for frontal gyri and WM areas located in the vicinity to frontal GM gyri.</s><s>In particular, Analysis 1 identified a coordinate in middle <ref type="bibr">([MNI: 24,</ref><ref type="bibr">32,</ref>, MSS = 80.6%) and inferior frontal gyri <ref type="bibr">30,</ref>, 77.3% MSS) with diagnostic information.</s><s>In addition, a WM area in vicinity to superior frontal gyrus <ref type="bibr">54,</ref><ref type="bibr">12)</ref>, MSS = 74.2%)</s><s>also contained diagnostic information.</s><s>On the contrary, frontal gyri were not at all identified in Analysis 3 and Analysis S3.</s><s>Thus, taken together the integration of findings made across analyses conducted in the study suggest that disease-related alterations of frontal gyri starting early after disease onset is a diagnostically relevant feature specific for EOPMS.</s></p><p><s>Besides identifying brain MRI-based biomarkers specific for EOPMS, the study also demonstrates that computer-based classification approaches are able to utilize subtle tissue variations for diagnosis, extracted from GM but also WM that are less characterized by pronounced intensity alterations than hyperintense WM lesions in T2w-images.</s><s>This was revealed by the GM analyses conducted as most of the coordinates with diagnostic information did not contain lesions (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2-4 and S1-S3</ref>).</s><s>Non-lesion GM based separation of EOPMS and HC is in line with findings of studies showing GM loss in adult MS patients compared to HC <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Weygandt et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ceccarelli et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Morgen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Prinster

target="#b1">Bakshi et al., 2002)</ref>, it was assumed that elevated iron deposition might lead to tissue loss in deep gray matter nuclei which in turn induces signal hypointensity in T2w-images.</s><s>Speculatively, this mechanism might also underly GM-based separability of PMS groups and HC.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, utilization of non-lesion related MRI signals for the diagnosis of EOPMS vs. HC by the regression approach in addition to utilization of lesion-related signals was also supported by white matter analyses.</s><s>In particular, although high diagnostic accuracy was frequently linked to high lesion occurrence in these analyseswhat is in line with the diagnostic guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Polman et al., 2011)</ref> implying that lesions are the only MRI features indicative of MShigh lesion occurrence alone was frequently not sufficient to explain accuracy obtained by the regression approach.</s><s>This can be seen e.g. in Analysis 2b for a WM coordinate (MNI: -24, -34, 40) located in the vicinity of postcentral gyrus.</s><s>Although a substantial proportion of EOPMS patients had a lesion at this coordinate (i.e. 4 out of 15 or 26.7%, see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) accuracy expectable by this lesion occurrence was lower than accuracy obtained by the logistic regression approach.</s><s>Specifically, when following the diagnostic guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Polman et al., 2011)</ref> suggesting that lesions are the only MRI alterations indicative of MS, and when additionally assuming that lesions do only occur in patients but not controls, this lesion occurrence should go along with a diagnostic accuracy of 63.4%.</s><s>In particular, given that four out of 15 patients, who should present with lesions, had a lesion at this coordinate (sensitivity = 26.7%),</s><s>and none of 15 controls, who should not have lesions, had a lesion (specificity = 100%), a mean of sensitivity and specificity of 63.4% follows.</s><s>Contrary to these 63.4% however, the logistic regression approach evaluating continuous tissue probability parameters (instead of the dichotomously scaled 'presence of a lesion' marker evaluated by human raters) obtained 80.0% mean of sensitivity and specificity.</s><s>Consequently, the discrepancy between these accuracies suggests that the regression approach utilizes further MRI signals in addition to lesion-induced signal alterations.</s><s>Speculatively, WM characterized by only slight signal hyperintensities being too weak to be classified as lesion by a human rater (i.e.</s><s>socalled 'dirty-appearing' white matter; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ge et al., 2003)</ref> might be these signals.</s><s>This interpretation would be compatible with our recent findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Weygandt et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>At first glance, the moderate sample sizes of groups investigated might be considered a drawback of the study.</s><s>However, within the specific framework of the present study several aspects have to be considered when evaluating the sample size.</s><s>First, we were able to identify diagnostic information in periventricular WM areas containing lesions.</s><s>Periventricular WM lesions are considered (one of) the key diagnostic marker(s) for MS (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Polman et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the sample size was sufficient to reliably identify this major MRI marker for MS frequently reported in the literature.</s><s>Second, from a pragmatic perspective the small prevalence of pediatric MS has to be considered.</s><s>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ruggieri et al. (2004)</ref>, the prevalence of MS with an onset prior to the age of 16 years is approximately between 0.003% and 0.006% in the overall population.</s><s>For MS with an onset prior to the age of 10 years it is even lessapproximately between 0.0002% and 0.0008%.</s><s>Thus, EOPMS and even LOPMS are rare clinically cases.</s><s>Finally, we used nonparametric permutation testing to estimate the probability of diagnostic accuracies obtained on the voxel level.</s><s>Compared with parametric procedures, permutation tests rely much less on the fulfillment of distributional assumptions for a given test statistic (Good, 2005)a problem that might be more prominent in moderately sized data sets as compared to larger data sets.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the small deviations in the number of slices acquired for T2w-images across groups for PMS groups matched with regard to disease duration, lesion load and gender might be considered as limitation of the study.</s><s>However, the impact of this imbalance does not appear to be very strong since results obtained for Analyses 1-3 are compatible with those obtained in Analyses S1-S3.</s><s>And for the latter analyses the number of slices was balanced across groups.</s></p></div>
