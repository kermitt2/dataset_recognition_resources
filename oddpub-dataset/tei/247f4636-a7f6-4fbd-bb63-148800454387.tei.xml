<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study context</head><p><s>We designed a cross-sectional study including supervisors of medical thesis projects at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin (http://www.charite.de).</s><s>In order to analyse the dropout rate from supervisors' perspectives, we first describe their position in general, including their motivation, reasons for terminating theses and formal training and preparation for the role of supervisor.</s><s>In a second step, the results of this survey among thesis supervisors were compared with a longitudinal survey among doctoral candidates published in 2014. <ref type="bibr">13 16</ref></s><s>oth this longitudinal survey and the current survey among supervisors <ref type="bibr">13 16</ref> relied on the participants' self-assessments. <ref type="bibr">20 21</ref></s><s>rticipants Potential addressees of our questionnaire were all Charité employees with a university degree qualifying them to supervise a medical thesis.</s><s>A total of 3653 potential medical thesis supervisors were identified and email addresses extracted from the central information and intranet contact portal of Charité.</s><s>An email invitation to participate in our survey was sent to all potential medical thesis supervisors in January 2014.</s><s>Nearly one-third (29.3%) of them participated (1069 of 3653).</s></p><p><s>The longitudinal survey among doctoral candidates had very similar response rates: 28% participated in 2011 (303 of 1081) and 31% in 2001 (321 of 1036). <ref type="bibr">13 16</ref></s><s>ta collection Preparations for the questionnaire survey began in November 2013 by implementing a search tool to identify and invite potential thesis supervisors as described in the preceding section.</s><s>For the present analysis, we tried to avoid a recall bias by restricting participation in the survey to those who actually supervised a medical thesis during the 12-month period before mailing the questionnaires.</s><s>For correct extraction we used decision questions.</s><s>The questions in the survey were logically linked, so that the answer of one question determined which questions to ask next; therefore, the number of participants answering a question is variable (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Two email reminders were sent by the Dean of Charité (Professor Grüters-Kieslich) and Professor Dewey during the survey, which was open from the beginning of January 2014 until March 2014.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire</head><p><s>The questionnaire was developed using LimeSurvey (https://www.limesurvey.org/en/)</s><s>and included a total of 65 questions.</s><s>3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> Programming details and the entire questionnaire can be provided on data sharing request.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS, V.18, and R 2.15.1 (http://www.r-project.org).</s><s>Data are presented using descriptive statistics.</s><s>The χ 2 test was used for comparing groups, and p values of 0.05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>About 75.6% of the respondents (808 of 1069) were supervisors of thesis projects during the 12 months prior to the survey, and 67.2% (718 of 1069) were supervising a thesis at the time of the survey (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivation for supervising thesis projects</head><p><s>At the time of the survey, 67.2% of respondents (718 of 1069) were supervising 3744 doctoral candidates (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), corresponding to an average 5.2 doctoral candidates per supervisor.</s><s>Asked about their motivation for fostering medical thesis projects, most thesis supervisors, 63% (459 of 718), ticked off 'sharing enthusiasm for their own field', followed by 'job satisfaction' (55%, 395 of 718) and the 'option of mutual future projects' (53%, 380 of 718).</s><s>Promotion of their own scientific career was the motivation for 44% (316 of 718) of supervisors, whereas 37% (266 of 718) considered thesis supervision one of their core responsibilities.</s><s>Only 13% felt well prepared for supervising medical theses, while 39% reported that they were not at all prepared for this role (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dropout rate and reasons for dropping out</head><p><s>In our survey 25% of the supervisors (156 of 624) stated that a total of 208 of medical thesis projects were discontinued, while 44% of the supervisors (344 of 782) stated that a total of 598 projects had been completed successfully.</s><s>Fifty-eight doctoral projects were prematurely ended by 11% of supervisors (47 of 436), while 28% of supervisors (109 of 386) reported a total of 150 thesis projects terminated by the candidates themselves.</s><s>Supervisors stated that doctoral candidates most commonly terminated projects because of unspecified personal problems or time management problems, or simply failed to show up.</s><s>In contrast, the reasons given by doctoral candidates in our earlier survey differed greatly (figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Comparison of the most common reasons for termination of thesis projects given by supervisors and candidates using the χ 2 test yielded significant differences (table 1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>easons for dropout given by thesis supervisors comparing projects terminated by candidates with those terminated by supervisors.</s><s>About 29.8% of abandoned doctoral projects were terminated by the candidates for methodological reasons.</s><s>Only 8.4% were discontinued by thesis supervisors for the same reasons.</s><s>In contrast, 37.3% of thesis projects were ended prematurely by supervisors because of timelines.</s></p><p><s>Supervisors assumed difficulties with managing timelines and personal differences of students ( p=0.024 and p=0.001) as the true reasons for dropout, whereas doctoral candidates more often gave difficulties with research methodology or the thesis subject in general as reasons for terminating the project ( p=0.001 and p&lt;0.001).</s><s>Therefore, we further compared the opinions of thesis supervisors and doctoral candidates about received statistical support.</s><s>Candidates felt poorly prepared for the statistical part of the project before or during conduct of their research ( p=0.019 and p&lt;0.001) with 49.5% stating that they never received statistical support. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>In contrast, about 97% of the supervisors believe that they provided statistical help.</s><s>Only 3.4% of doctoral candidates confirm that they have received support before, during and after practical work on the thesis project (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the German system for acquiring the academic title of doctor of medicine focusing on the role of supervisors and their views.</s><s>Following our longitudinal survey among medical doctoral candidates at Charité, <ref type="bibr">13 16</ref> the current survey among supervisors was primarily motivated by an interest in finding out why so many candidates do not complete their thesis projects despite the graduate programme existing at Charité since 2002.</s><s>Both the longitudinal survey among students <ref type="bibr">13 16</ref> and the present survey among supervisors were based on self-assessment. <ref type="bibr">20 21</ref></s><s>While there are problems with self-assessment, this does not degrade our work because we are not concerned with competency, but with the subjective perception of the situation, which affects the behaviour leading to drop-out.</s><s>Our statistical findings suggest that the drop-out rates are correlated with the respondents' self-assessments.</s><s>On a more general level, the current survey and our earlier surveys, <ref type="bibr">13 16</ref> provide important insights into the situation of junior medical research in Germany in general and draw attention to what needs to be done to adequately prepare medical students before embarking on their first major research project.</s><s>Taken together, our two earlier surveys among doctoral candidates and the current survey provide an important database for how the system can be improved.</s><s>The system has recently come under attack through media coverage of prominent cases of plagiarism, which have unveiled an inherent problem of the German system: namely that junior physicians in Germany are under extreme pressure in accomplishing a medical dissertation, often while doing full-time residency training, as succinctly described in a recent Nature Editorial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>Critics of the German system claim that this situation is conducive to laxness and low standards of medical dissertations.</s></p><p><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> Despite the low response rate, there is no problem for data analysis in terms of selection bias, for the following reasons: updating of the intranet always lags behind the high fluctuation of staff.</s><s>Thus, our email invitation to participate in our survey included both staff who no longer worked at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin (eg, guest scientists, emeritus professors) at the time of the survey Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> Collated responses given by students, 13 (n=66) and supervisors (n=158); multiple answers were possible.</s><s>Questions marked with * were only asked in the student survey; questions marked with # were only asked in the supervisor survey.</s><s>According to supervisors, doctoral candidates most commonly terminated projects because of unspecified personal reasons.</s><s>In contrast, the most common reasons given by students were difficulties with methodology, including statistical problems.</s><s>and staff who had just started recently and could not yet have become supervisors of doctoral projects.</s><s>Moreover, it is likely that a large proportion of the addressees, although formally qualified, never supervised a doctoral thesis project at all.</s><s>This is reflected by the fact that nearly half (47.3%) of the professors we addressed did respond (252 of 533) as opposed to only 5.3% (6 of 114) of the addressees without a doctor title, but with a university degree such as a master or bachelor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>verall, the results of the current survey show that, while the vast majority of supervisors are motivated, they feel inadequately prepared for this role.</s><s>Moreover, from the supervisors' perspective, candidates are not adequately prepared for research and lack both fundamental information and skills for successfully handling the kind of research required for earning the title of medical doctor in Germany.</s></p><p><s>Some of the deficits thesis supervisors report about in their doctoral candidates are surprising since, following the results of the first survey in 2001, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> the Charité graduate programme was specifically initiated and established at the Charité to fill this gap.</s><s>5]<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> The results of our longitudinal survey among doctoral candidates reflect an improvement in that students consider themselves to be better prepared for scientific work due to obligatory university courses ( p&lt;0.001) offered by Charité Medical School. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>In addition, participants of the voluntary graduate programme feel significantly better prepared for scientific work ( p&lt;0.001).</s><s>However, the situation is still not optimal with 50% of candidates in 2011 reporting to have received no statistical support during their thesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Overall, however, the programme has started to provide some formal training (such as statistics) and has at least to some extent improved the preparation for medical thesis research over the past 14 years.</s></p><p><s>The deficits supervisors identify among their doctoral candidates are in line with the reports of students that medical studies do not prepare them for research.</s><s>However, doctoral candidates also state that they expect more assistance from their supervisors with regard to research methodology in general and statistical analysis in particular.</s><s>This is an interesting aspect as it contradicts the supervisors' perspective-who mostly state that they do provide statistical support.</s><s>These discrepancies may point to the true core of the problem, namely a failure to communicate and high expectations the other party cannot meet.</s><s>Lack of a general environment that is conducive to research in terms of providing the necessary infrastructure, resources and time for doing research applies to candidates and supervisors alike: supervisors lack the time to supervise and adequately guide junior medical scientists in doing their first major research project.</s><s>This is what critics of the German system of medical dissertation deplore, namely that it promotes low scientific standards.</s><s>Overall, there are two issues to be solved: providing an adequate framework (funding, time, etc), also for supervisors and the basic skills required for adequately planning and managing a scientific project over an extended period of time (from planning to scientific writing).</s></p><p><s>An improved process quality for collaboratively managing medical thesis projects may improve success rates.</s><s>Based on our findings, methodological preparation of doctoral candidates, regular training of supervisors in project management and soft skills, and regular meetings of both parties to discuss progress and problems are required and recommended.</s><s>Once basic information and skills are taught in formal courses, supervisors can spend their time more efficiently by focusing on guiding students in how to apply their theoretical methodological knowledge in conducting their thesis research.</s><s>In this way, both parties can spend their time more efficiently and candidates will benefit by improving their methodological skill while working on their project.</s></p><p><s>Our complementary data on candidates' and supervisors' perception of problems in doing doctoral thesis research and completing these projects are important bases for devising strategies to improve the system and help candidates do better research for their doctoral dissertations.</s><s>Improvements in preparing doctors for supervising medical thesis projects and in preparing medical students for doing research might ultimately also help restore the international reputation of medical dissertations in Germany.</s><s>On a national level there are many efforts to improve the situation, <ref type="bibr">8 37 39</ref> which emphasises that university hospitals have to be structurally adjusted to satisfy the needs of medical research and education. <ref type="bibr">15 34 35 40 41</ref></s><s>Our findings confirm the idea of adjustment in that universities need to provide the structural framework that is conducive to high-quality research by doctoral candidates. <ref type="bibr">2 13 16 19 34</ref> In Europe, there is a debate about a unified medical doctorate.</s><s>While this is in general a good idea, doing so in the form of a vocational degree might have undesired consequences and plans to abolish the research aspect should be given careful consideration.</s><s>Clinician scientists are needed in the medical community and would also encourage more consistent application of evidencebased medicine in daily practice throughout the European Union. <ref type="bibr">15 42</ref></s><s>Formal training of lecturers, tutors and supervisors responsible for this integration would help to standardise and improve the quality of thesis supervision. <ref type="bibr">17 43</ref></s><s>This could be accomplished by master classes, 'Teaching the Teachers', <ref type="bibr">44 45</ref> which were implemented to improve the management skills of supervisors at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</s></p><p><s>A graduate programme teaching both doctoral candidates and supervisors to prepare them for their roles in medical thesis research projects and thus helping more candidates in actually completing their thesis projects is recommended.</s><s>The success of any measures implemented, including a desirable improvement in process quality, can be assessed by repeat surveys.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations of this study</head><p><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that considers the supervisors' perspective on medical thesis projects.</s><s>Our results are based on a cross-sectional survey and do not reflect temporal dynamics.</s><s>We conducted a unimodal online survey; therefore the response rate was rather low.</s><s>Moreover, our survey was conducted at a single university, though one of the largest European medical schools located in Germany and may not be representative of the perspective of medical thesis supervisors elsewhere in Europe.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>We found different perceptions on reasons for constantly high dropout rates of doctoral projects between supervisors and doctoral candidates, which suggest a lack of true scientific collaboration.</s><s>Based on selfassessments, the vast majority of supervisors (87%) feel inadequately prepared for their supervisory role of medical thesis projects.</s><s>An improved process quality for collaboratively managing medical thesis projects may improve the chance of success as would a uniform European MD. <ref type="bibr">11 43</ref> Master classes preparing medical thesis supervisors for their crucial supervisory role should raise awareness about the differences in perspectives and expectations.</s><s>This has great potential to foster truly collaborative efforts and a new process quality in the pursuit of medical thesis projects.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure2More than half of all respondents feel poorly or not at all prepared for the role of supervising doctoral candidates (n=948) by Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</s><s>The period to which this question related was not restricted to the past 12 months.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,322.13,542.44,216.00,135.44" type="bitmap" /></figure>
