<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by degeneration of dorsal root ganglia, cerebellum and cardiomyopathy.</s><s>Heart failure is one of the most common causes of death for FRDA patients.</s><s>Deficiency of frataxin, a small mitochondrial protein, is responsible for all clinical and morphological manifestations of FRDA.</s><s>The focus of our study was to investigate the unexplored Ca 2+ homeostasis in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and in cardiomyocytes of FRDA cellular models to understand the pathogenesis of degeneration.</s><s>Ca 2+ homeostasis in neurons and cardiomyocytes is not only crucial for the cellular wellbeing but more importantly to generate action potential in both neurons and cardiomyocytes.</s><s>By challenging Ca 2+ homeostasis in CGNs, and in adult and neonatal cardiomyocytes of FRDA models, we have assessed the impact of frataxin decrease on both neuronal and cardiac physiopathology.</s><s>Interestingly, we have found that Ca 2+ homeostasis is altered both cell types.</s><s>CGNs showed a Ca 2+ mishandling under depolarizing conditions and this was also reflected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) content.</s><s>In cardiomyocytes we found that the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2+ content was pathologically reduced, and that mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake was impaired.</s><s>This phenomenon is due to the excess of oxidative stress under FRDA like conditions and the consequent aberrant modulation of key players at the SR/ER and mitochondrial level that usually restore the Ca 2+ homeostasis.</s><s>Our findings demonstrate that in both neurons and cardiomyocytes the decreased Ca 2+ level within the stores has a comparable detrimental impact in their physiology.</s><s>In cardiomyocytes, we found that ryanodine receptors (RyRs) may be leaking and expel more Ca 2+ out from the SR.</s><s>At the same time mitochondrial uptake was altered and we found that Vitamin E can restore this defect.</s><s>Moreover, Vitamin E protects from cell death induced by hypoxia-reperfusion injury, revealing novel properties of Vitamin E as potential therapeutic tool for FRDA cardiomyopathy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Friedreich's ataxia is caused by frataxin insufficiency leading to changes in iron metabolism that inhibits mitochondrial respiration and promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and subsequent mitochondrial iron accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Oudit et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>These effects result in selected neuronal atrophy, where the primary sites of pathology are the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dyck et al., 1968)</ref>, and a characteristic proliferation of the synaptic terminals in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Koeppen et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>The neuronal degeneration in DRG seems to be caused by a dying-back phenomenon triggered by Ca 2+ deregulation, including failure to buffer Ca 2+ and defective storeoperated calcium entry (SOCE) mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Molla' et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Ca 2+ mishandling has been closely associated to oxidative stress mediated cell death as Ca 2+ chelators proved to be protective <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wong et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mincheva-Tasheva et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>CGNs are also subjected to degeneration, in which we previously showed increase of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in a FRDA mouse model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abeti et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>We have now investigated whether oxidative stress can be also linked to Ca 2+ mishandling in CGNs.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the pathology of the central and peripheral nervous system, a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is commonly seen at the beginning of the disease, and this progressive cardiomyopathy is considered one of the most common causes of death in FRDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pastore and Puccio, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Iron-induced oxidative stress has been associated with altered Ca 2+ homeostasis.</s><s>In particular, it has been associated with reduced peak systolic Ca 2+ levels, slowed rates of Ca 2+ relaxation and elevated diastolic Ca 2+ levels in diseases such as hereditary haemolytic anemia and other iron-overload conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Navarro et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rehsia and Dhalla, 2010)</ref>, which can lead to arrhythmias and sudden death, both of which have also been seen to occur in FRDA.</s><s>We therefore investigated whether the lack of frataxin in cardiomyocytes could be relevant to Ca 2+ homeostasis, to this purpose we have employed two different cell lines of cardiomyocytes, one similar to adulthood and one neonatal and also primary cardiomyocytes from an FRDA mouse model.</s><s>The usage of neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes allowed us to understand whether there could be any differences during cardiac development in FRDA pathophysiology.</s><s>Deregulation of Ca 2+ homeostasis has been previously observed in neuronal models of FRDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bolinches-Amoros et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mincheva-Tasheva et al., 2014)</ref>, however, this is the first study focused on Ca 2+ signaling in cardiomyocytes of FRDA models.</s><s>Given the known association between iron-induced oxidative stress and altered Ca 2+ homeostasis, as well as the overlap with some pathogenic aspects of FRDA and other neurodegenerative iron-overload diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Isaya, 2014)</ref>, this study could be of great benefit in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanism of FRDA in neuronal and heart cells.</s><s>The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is one of the major Ca 2+ stores in cardiomyocytes.</s><s>Ca 2+ influx occurs through ryanodine receptors (RyRs Type 2) operating under a system of Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release (CICR), where the presence of Ca 2+ itself induces further Ca 2+ release from SR stores, generating a Ca 2+ wave that contributes to cardiac action potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Puccio et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, Ca 2+ has a vital role in excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes.</s><s>RyRs together with SR Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pumps contain many free cysteine (Cys) residues that are sensitive to oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Stephanou et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ying et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Oxidative stress may causes potentiation to RyRs increasing the probability and the duration of the open state of the RyR channel, which in turn leads to SR Ca 2+ leak <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ying et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore investigated the activity of RyRs and the SR Ca 2+ content to understand whether those could be affected in cardiac FRDA-like models.</s><s>Oxidative stress has already been observed in several models of FRDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lamarche et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Emond et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Puccio and Koenig, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bradley et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abeti et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we confirm that oxidative stress is present in CGNs and cardiomyocytes with a reduced level of frataxin and this impairs Ca 2+ homeostasis.</s><s>To protect cells from oxidative stress we have employed Vitamin E, a natural lipid soluble antioxidant processed in cellular membranes and in particular in the mitochondria.</s><s>Previous studies on Vitamin E combined with Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on FRDA patients showed a beneficial effect on mitochondrial bioenergetic monitored directly in the cardiomyocytes and muscle cells with magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31 P-MRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lodi et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hart et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>At that time there was not enough natural history on FRDA patients and cardiomyopathy to have a definitive conclusion of efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cooper and Schapira, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>We observed the mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake which improved significantly in frataxin knocked down cardiomyocytes.</s><s>Moreover, we have challenged the cells with hypoxia-reoxigenation (H/R) injury to understand how cells were coping during H/R damage.</s><s>The beneficial effect of Vitamin E improved cell viability in cardiomyocytes stressed with H/R challenge.</s><s>Our results confirm that Vitamin E has a protective effect on FRDA like cardiomyocytes.</s><s>Therefore, this compound could be proposed as a therapy for FRDA patients.</s></p></div>

via its release from the ER.</s><s>Then Ca 2+ should be taken up by the internal stores and the homeostasis restored.</s><s>By challenging CGNs with a depolarising insult, FRDA-like neurons could not restore their resting potential, leaving the membrane depolarised until death.</s><s>This could be ascribed to a possible hyperactivity of either Inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3Rs) or RyRs but also from an inhibition of the SERCA pumps impeding the Ca 2+ to enter the ER and restore its cytosolic homeostasis.</s><s>At the same time Ca 2+ homeostasis in cardiac myocytes results from the integrated function of transsarcolemmal influx and efflux pathways modulated by membrane potential and from intracellular Ca 2+ uptake and release predominantly by SR.</s><s>Thus, modification of Ca 2+ homeostasis may cause significant alterations in contraction and relaxation of the heart and cardiac failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Limbu et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we focused our studies on Ca 2+ homeostasis in cardiac FRDA like models.</s><s>We showed that FxnKD in cardiomyocytes raised the level of ROS in the cytosol and in the mitochondria.</s><s>We then demonstrated that Ca 2+ homeostasis was altered, by challenging the cells with Caffeine and Thapsigargin, as the SR Ca 2+ was lower in FxnKD cells compared to controls.</s><s>The detrimental effect of Ca 2+ signaling could be explained by the exacerbation of the oxidative stress in the FRDA like cells, since RyRs and SERCA present cysteines are affected by the variation of the oxidative environment <ref

increases its open probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ying et al., 2008)</ref> and also oxidative stress takes place in potentiating the channel.</s><s>However, we cannot exclude a SERCA2a
