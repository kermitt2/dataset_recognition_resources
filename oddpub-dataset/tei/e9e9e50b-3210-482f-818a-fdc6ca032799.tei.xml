<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>X chromosomes are in many regards unusual (reviewed in <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">2]</ref>).</s><s>The peculiarities of the X include an unusual recombination environment, unusual dominance relations and an unusual proportion of time spent in members of the two sexes.</s><s>The consequences of these peculiarities include, in some taxa, reduced recombination rates and lower mutation rates.</s><s>In addition, the X chromosome is expected to have an unusual effective population size, this being exaggerated by strong sexual selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Such forces can likely explain many peculiarities of X chromosomes.</s><s>For example, the human X chromosome, whose genome sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[9]</ref> is much less degraded than that of non-recombining Y chromosome, has an AT-content between that of the Y chromosome and autosomes, consistent with reduced rates of recombination-associated biased gene conversion favoring AT!GC SNPs in the face of a GC!AT mutation bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[10]</ref>.</s><s>That we see an increase in GC-content as we move from the haploid part of the X to pseudoautosomal regions on the X <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">12]</ref> strongly supports such a recombination-associated model.</s><s>The hemizygous nature of the X in males, exposing adaptive mutations, is similarly central to the "faster X" hypothesis-that is, the notion that X-linked genes might be fast evolving <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several models also predict that the X will be unusual in its gene content.</s><s>Two models are pre-eminent.</s><s>First, Rice noted that because of dominance effects and time spent in the two sexes, an X chromosome might have a tendency to accumulate genes with either male-or female-specific expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The former is owing to a selective filter enabling the spread of male-advantage/female-disadvantage recessive alleles (the deleterious effects being hidden at the point of invasion of a sexually antagonistic allele).</s><s>The latter is owing to selection favoring dominant female-advantageous/male-deleterious dominant mutations, given the two thirds of time the X spends in the female germline, thus exposing the advantageous effects more often than the deleterious ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[14]</ref>.</s><s>To account for sex-biased expression, one then evokes modifiers of the sex of expression, reducing expression in the sex in which an allele is deleterious <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[14]</ref>.</s><s>This we refer to as the sexually antagonistic model.</s><s>Second, as the X chromosome is inactivated in the male germline, the X has been considered an environment incompatible with the presence of genes needed in spermatogenesis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">16]</ref>, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[17]</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the traffic of spermatogenesis genes off the X was to be expected, as the ancestral autosome (proto-X) became the X chromosome.</s><s>The SAXI hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[18]</ref> is a fusion hypothesis suggesting that sexual antagonism drove male-biased genes off the X, thereby enabling germline X chromosome inactivation (note that this hypothesis presumes the X chromosome to be incompatible with male-advantage genes although this need not be true).</s></p><p><s>Both the above models can claim some support (for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">4]</ref>).</s><s>There is, for example, evidence for a movement off the mammalian X chromosome via retroposition of genes whose retroposed copies are highly expressed in the male germline <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[19]</ref>.</s><s>This is potentially consistent with the germline inactivation/SAXI model but not the version of sexual antagonism that predicts accumulation on the X of genes biased towards male-specific expression.</s><s>However, unexpectedly <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[19]</ref>, there is also evidence for a loss on the X of genes whose retrocopies function after the time of germline X inactivation (i.e., when the X is active again) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Given this potential direct germline effect, tests of the logic of Rice's hypothesis are best done when considering somatic tissues.</s><s>While there is evidence that the mouse X is enriched for sex-biased genes not subject to the meiotic sex chromosome inactivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[20]</ref>, the evidence is somewhat contradictory.</s><s>For example, one report claims an excess of female-biased gene expression and a dearth of genes biased towards male-specific expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Another report finds evidence for an enrichment of male-specific genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In Drosophila, genes expressed in male-specific accessory-gland, but not testis, are excluded from the X <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, following a proposal of Vicoso and Charlesworth <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[26]</ref>, we wish to suggest that there is a further, potentially complementary, simple yet powerful, driving force for the evolution of gene content on the X chromosome.</s><s>This force stems from the fact that in males the X is haploid-expressed.</s><s>This might limit the maximal expression of any X-linked gene.</s><s>Put simply, when transcription rates are potentially high, if there are two parallel sites for transcription (diploid expression on autosomes), the net rate of production can be higher than if there are transcriptional traffic jams on the haploid-X.</s><s>The same limitation is not of great importance if the rate of transcription is not limiting.</s><s>Thus, we expect the X chromosome to be a non-optimal environment for genes with very high maximal levels of expression.</s><s>Such high levels of expression cannot be readily achieved, owing to transcriptional traffic jams, with all gene expression running through one promoter, as opposed to two promoters in diploid-expressed autosomal genes.</s><s>X inactivation in female mammals exacerbates the problem.</s><s>We call this model the "weak X" or traffic jam model.</s></p><p><s>The precise expectations may depend on the mechanism of dosage compensation.</s><s>In fruit flies, for example, the X chromosome in males is hyper-transcribed <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">28]</ref>.</s><s>This, it has been argued, will make it hard to increase the expression level even more if there is an upper limit to the rate of transcription, as suggested by Vicoso and Charlesworth <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[26]</ref>.</s><s>As male-biased expression commonly comes about through increased expression in males, this force alone is enough to explain the absence of male-biased gene expression on the Drosophila X <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, Bachtrog et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[29]</ref> find evidence that Drosophila's mode of dosage compensation restricts the ability to further up-regulate X-linked genes.</s><s>More recent work suggests that genes expressed in male-specific accessory-gland, but not testis, are excluded from the X in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[25]</ref> because of expression limits on the X.</s></p><p><s>If, however, the fly X is truly hyper-transcribed, it is an environment for the most part compatible with high maximal expression, just not one readily capable of increasing it still further.</s><s>Indeed, Vicoso and Charlesworth <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[26]</ref> find no evidence that maximal expression on the X is lower than that on autosomes.</s><s>The hyper-transcription from the fly X contrasts somewhat with the situation in mammals (as best as it is currently understood).</s><s>In mammals, it was for a long time believed that the X in males is also hyper-transcribed to compensate for the loss of expression on the decaying Y chromosome <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[30]</ref>.</s><s>However, two recent analyses indicate that, compared with the expression level of the ancestral genes prior to the formation of the X chromosome (as opposed to the consideration of the current X to autosomal expression ratio), the extant X-linked genes have not increased their expression levels <ref type="bibr">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr">32]</ref>.</s><s>A recent proteomicsbased analysis supports this finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Rather, autosomal genes that partake in protein-protein interactions with X-linked counterparts appear instead to have reduced their expression levels <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref>.</s><s>There is also evidence that some X-linked genes associated with protein complexes have increased their expression <ref type="bibr">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr">34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Assuming no or limited increase in the expression level of X-linked genes, this suggests a simple explanation for the fortune of genes as the diploid proto-therian X evolved into the haploid-X.</s><s>Unlike in fly (with hyper-transcription), any gene that had high maximal expression on the proto-mammalian X could not sustain this.</s><s>If a reduction in dosage was cost-free, then no further adaptation was needed.</s><s>If a reduction in a gene's dosage was not cost-free, then an adaptation of some variety might have been required.</s><s>This might mean divestment of some of a gene's function to autosomal genes, possibly mediated by changed expression of compensating paralogs or the creation of such paralogs, if not already present.</s><s>We thus expect a net movement away from (or avoidance of) the X chromosome for genes with high maximal expression.</s><s>This could, in principle, explain why highly expressed germline genes are moved away from the X, even if there is no germline X inactivation during their time of activity, an observation previously posed as unexpected <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[19]</ref>.</s><s>If broad expression tends to be coupled with high maximal expression, it might also possibly explain why genes tend to be more tissue-specific on the X chromosome (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr">35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, we seek to test these models.</s><s>To this end, we employ an exceptional expression resource, Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5), and in addition, a merge of FANTOM5 with The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE).</s><s>FANTOM5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[36]</ref> is an extensive atlas of mammalian expression patterns at a single-nucleotide resolution level <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[37]</ref>, including libraries from 179 human tissues, 513 isolates of primary cells, and 260 cancer cell-lines, generated using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) technology <ref

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Maximal Expression Level of X-Linked Genes Is Far Below That of Autosomal Genes</head><p><s>A prediction of the "weak X" model is that the upper limit for the highest attainable level of gene expression for X-linked genes should be lower than the maximal attainable for autosomal genes.</s><s>Consistent with this idea, the average maximal expression on the human X chromosome is three times lower than on autosomes, that is to say 87 versus 261 tags per million (TPM) (Fig 1, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The difference is highly significant (a Wilcoxon test, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16; randomization test's p-value = 0 based on 1 million random subsamples in a test designed to measure the probability of obtaining similarly skewed, i.e., deviant from null, the mean maximal on the X by chance; see Methods).</s><s>Median maximal expression on the X is also lower than on autosomes: 23 versus 39 TPM.</s><s>In human tissues, the absolute maximal expression on the X chromosome (highest for any gene in any tissue) is 5604 TPM (brain expressed, X-linked 1 [BEX1], NM_018476, expressed in the medial temporal gyrus library).</s><s>In contrast, the maximal expression on autosomes is over 62 higher at 3.48e+05 (hemoglobin, beta; NM_000518 expressed in blood; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Note that maximal expression is the greatest numerical value attained (in TPM) for a transcript across all relevant CAGE libraries and thus, unlike the mean (or the median) expression, maximal expression does not greatly suffer from method problems relating to cutoffs to call a gene expressed or not.</s><s>As then expected, the effect is robust to the exclusion of "non-expressed" genes, with the average maximal expression on the X and autosomes at 122 and 321 TPM respectively (a Wilcoxon test, p-value = 2.96e-12) for genes with a minimum maximum expression level of 10 TPM.</s><s>The result is also robust when considering maximal expression per gene (where multiple transcripts from one gene are amalgamated by averaging or summing their expression levels), instead of maximal expression per transcript (S1 Table <ref type="table">)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An analysis of the behavior of the large pseudoautosomal region (PAR1), with its 24 genes, is broadly compatible with the view that the maximal expression constraint is specific to the haploid part of the X chromosome (S2 Table <ref type="table">)</ref>.</s><s>Definitive statements should, however, not be made, owing to the limited sample size.</s><s>Indeed, if we randomly select 24 autosomal genes and ask how often these are significantly different in their mean maximal expression to genes on the haploid part of the X, then in less than 50% of randomizations do we detect any effect (S2 Table <ref type="table">)</ref>, while the comparison of all autosomal genes to all X-linked genes is unambiguous.</s><s>This Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s>A lower breadth of expression on the X is observed both in normal and diseased samples in human as well as in mouse.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Highly Expressed X-Linked Genes Cannot Easily Increase Their Expression</head><p><s>If high expression of X-linked genes is difficult, then we might expect that lowly expressed Xlinked genes might be able to increase their expression more readily than highly expressed ones, the latter having a problem with transcriptional traffic jams.</s><s>To address this we consider Brawand's RNAseq dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[44]</ref>, presenting expression of orthologous genes across five somatic tissues in males in several primates.</s><s>Because it includes primate data, the Brawand et al. dataset is better suited to address this aspect of our analysis than FANTOM5.</s><s>Note that we do not wish to determine whether immediately after the formation of the X, the X was upregulated; rather we wish to know whether during a more normal phase of expression evolution, genes on the X are constrained in their ability to increase expression.</s></p><p><s>Here, we used a Bayesian approach to infer the ancestral expression state in the human/ Chimpanzee common ancestor.</s><s>We then used the ancestral state to define the change in expression from the ancestor to the current human expression level, expressing this as a Zscore.</s><s>The Z-score factors in noise in both the estimation of current levels and the ancestral state.</s><s>Positive Z-scores imply increases in expression since the common ancestor.</s><s>We excluded from the analysis genes with no expression in the ancestor in any given tissue, as these are most likely unexpressed genes (although this exclusion makes no qualitative difference).</s><s>We calculated a tissue-specific p-value comparing the Z-scores for X-linked genes and Z-scores for autosomal genes via a Wilcoxon test for each tissue (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We then combined these scores using Fisher's method to generate a single p-value for each test.</s><s>Note that our metric of expression change is not in terms of fold-change as this would almost certainly bias towards finding a larger effect for lowly expressed genes (it is easier to double expression of a lowly expressed gene than it is of a highly expressed gene).</s><s>Instead, we take a more conservative measure, asking about absolute change in standard deviation units, not

the density of transcription factor binding sites much lower than suggested by their overall gene number and gene density.  of expression strongly depends on promoter GC-content, but not isochore GC-content, eliminating the possibility of the impact of the different rate of biased gene conversion (bGC) on the breadth of expression on the X.</s><s>This figure consists of six parts identified as

scatterplot of the breadth of expression versus promoter's GC-content is shown (one kb window ± 500 bps from the TSS).</s><s>Genes with promoter GC-content lower than 50% tend to be tissue-specific (panel b), but the correlation between GC-content and the breadth of expression weakens at a higher range of GC-values (i.e., more than 60%).</s><s>Since the breadth of expression is not normally distributed, we applied non-parametric tests and nonlinear models.</s><s>Spearman correlation's rho between the breadth of expression and GC-content equaled 0.1852 (p-value &lt; 2.2e-16).</s><s>Next,

the 20 kbps window around the TSS (panels e and f,±10 kbps from the TSS).</s><s>With the exception of genes located in isochores of very low GC-content (lower than 35%), which tend to be

loess model separately for autosomes and sex chromosomes (panel e).</s><s>We find that there are an insufficient number of data points on chromosome Y to draw a reliable loess curve.</s><s>However, a
