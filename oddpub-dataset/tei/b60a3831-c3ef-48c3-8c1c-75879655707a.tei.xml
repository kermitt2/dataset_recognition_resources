target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, since it has many advantages (e.g., a low heat affected zone (HAZ), higher precision levels, faster speed, and a non-contact method).</s><s>The advantage of the non-contact method is that it provides almost no tool wear, thus there is no need for tool replacement, so LAM can be used almost permanently.</s><s>Moreover, LAM can provide high-energy density and high-processing speed.</s><s>In addition, from a practical point of view, a laser providing high-energy density can also be applied to remove a large volume of cement-based construction materials, as high-power laser beams are commercially available, and the laser beam can be focused on very small areas by manipulating optics.</s></p><p><s>Due to these advantages, LAM has been used to treat or the concrete surfaces.</s><s>Savina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> used a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with fiber optic beam delivery to ablate surface and near-surface regions of concrete.</s><s>They used the 1064 nm fundamental of an Electrox 1.6 kW pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a fiber optic cable and focused to a 0.55 mm spot via a 120 mm lens.</s><s>The sample stage was moved at a rate of 45 cm/s while the laser was fixed.</s><s>They found that cement matrices melts, dehydrates, and vaporizes, while silica-rich aggregate tends to fracture and dislodge without melting with laser interaction.</s><s>Lawrence and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> used a 2.5 kW high power diode laser beam (Rofin-Sinar, DL-0.25), emitting at 940 nm in order to increase wear resistance of concrete by glazing the surface using the laser interaction.</s><s>Peach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> studied laser scabbling of concrete.</s><s>Key factors affecting the laser scabbling of concrete were found.</s><s>In addition to key factors, relationships among laser interaction time, removed volume, and surface temperatures were studied.</s><s>Based on these relationships, they found the effects of the composition of concrete composites on laser scabbling behavior.</s><s>However, relatively low laser power density, having a laser power of 5 kW and a spot diameter of 90 mm, was used since laser scabbling selectively removes not degraded surface volume, but degraded surface layers.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the concrete surface treatment, LAM has been used to cut concrete.</s><s>Using a 3 kW Nd:YAG laser, Lenk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> cut a 70 mm concrete up to 25 mm/min.</s><s>They used an airtight pressure chamber and the laser beam was applied through the chamber's window horizontally.</s><s>Layer-by-layer laser machining with mechanical removal of dross was applied to cut the concrete by Crouse et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>They presented a cutting depth of 100 mm thick concrete specimen using high-power CO 2 and diode lasers with multiple scans.</s><s>Tei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> used a multi-mode high-power laser to cut concrete with a beam diameter of 10 mm and a wavelength of 1070 nm.</s><s>They cut 10 mm thick concrete with a laser power of 4 kW and a scan speed of 5 mm/s.</s><s>In addition, a 100 mm thick piece of concrete was cut with a laser power of 4.5 kW, a scan speed of 5 mm/s, and 10 multi-scans.</s><s>Although, this study achieved 100 mm thick concrete cutting with a multi-scan technique, the dross was removed after each laser scan.</s><s>Muto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> applied a laser-based hybrid technique to cut concrete and drill rock.</s><s>They used a 7 kW fiber laser with a wavelength of 1070 nm.</s><s>A scanning speed of 2.5 mm/s with 14 scan passes was applied to cut the 100 mm thick plain concrete.</s><s>A scanning speed of 10 mm/s with 38 passes was applied to cut the 100 mm thick heavy concrete.</s><s>Nguyen Phi Long et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> studied the removal of concrete using a pulsed laser.</s><s>They tested the removal performance by irradiating the laser beam downward and upward.</s><s>When the pulsed laser was irradiated in the upward direction, it was confirmed that the concrete removal performance improved with the help of gravity.</s><s>A quasi-continuous (QCW) pulsed laser can be used to cut and drill without auxiliary gas.</s><s>They presented that a 1.6 kW laser can drill to 20 mm thickness in 10 s.</s><s>Furthermore, they demonstrated two scans with 6 kW laser power and 3 mm/s cutting speed cut, and confirmed drilling of 50 mm thick specimens.</s><s>Most of the previous studies applied the multi-scan technique to cut concrete, and additional tools were required to remove dross.</s><s>Furthermore, the effects of the composition variation were not studied.</s><s>Therefore, the systematic study of laser parameters and composition variations on concrete cutting has not been done in detail.</s></p><p><s>This research focuses on the laser cutting of cement mortar in order to find the effect of laser parameters and compositional variations of cement-based materials on cutting characteristics.</s><s>First, the material compositions and the experimental setup used in this research are described.</s><s>Then, the effects of compositional variations of cement-based materials, from cement paste to ultra high-performance concrete (UHPC), on laser cutting are discussed in terms of geometrical parameters such as the kerf width and penetration depth of the workpiece.</s><s>In addition to the geometrical parameters, composition changes before and after laser cutting on the surface are characterized using Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis.</s><s>Furthermore, cutting results are characterized depending on the laser cutting speed.</s></p></div>
