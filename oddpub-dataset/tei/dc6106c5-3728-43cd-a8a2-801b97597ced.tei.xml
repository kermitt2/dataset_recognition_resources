<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p><s>Postnatal day 21 (P21) Kcne2 ─/─ pups exhibited lower bodyweight compared to wild-type (Kcne2 +/+ ) counterparts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), but had elevated serum triglycerides (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Serum ALT and AST levels were also elevated in P21 Kcne2 ─/─ pups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) whereas bilirubin was unchanged (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>These findings are consistent with early NAFLD, which was further explored using histology.</s><s>Liver tissue from P21 Kcne2 ─/─ pups had a more vacuolated appearance than those from wild-type pups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>) and Kcne2 deletion caused marked accumulation of lipid in both P7 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>) and P21 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G, H</ref>) pup livers, confirming that Kcne2 ─/─ pups had early-onset NAFLD.</s></p><p><s>Microarray transcriptome analysis (Supplemental Spreadsheet 1) followed by regulator effect analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, Qiagen) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in livers of P21 Kcne2 ─/─ pups compared to Kcne2 +/+ littermates identified the network with the highest consistency score as one including beta-oxidation of fatty acids, glucose concentration and hepatic steatosis, controlled by the transcriptional co-activator and regulator of genes important for energy metabolism, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-α (PGC-1α , encoded by PPARGC1A) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>The specific transcriptional changes observed within functional gene networks in the liver were highly consistent with remodeling in response to development of NAFLD, e.g., increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids in response to the lipid accumulation, and increased glucose-6 phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC) expression (knockout of glucose-6 phosphatase causes hepatic steatosis in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> ).</s><s>Thus, the associated transcriptome changes were likely not causing the NAFLD but were the result of remodeling in response to it, indicating that the Kcne2 ─/─ liver was responding (albeit insufficiently) to abnormally high lipid accumulation.</s><s>These changes occurred despite the lack of Kcne2 expression in Kcne2 +/+ mouse liver (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), suggesting that Kcne2-dependent NAFLD arose via an initially extrahepatic defect.</s></p><p><s>Again employing an unbiased comparison of Kcne2 ─/─ versus Kcne2 +/+ mouse liver transcriptomes from P21 pups, Ingenuity pathway analysis software identified Inborn error of lipid metabolism as the primary disease/biological function gene set exhibiting differential expression arising from Kcne2 deletion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>The gene within this set exhibiting the greatest magnitude change in hepatic expression was apolipoprotein B (ApoB), which was 3.2-fold upregulated in livers from Kcne2 ─/─ versus Kcne2 +/+ mice (n = 8 per genotype, P &lt; 0.05).</s><s>This is of particular interest because ApoB is the predominant apolipoprotein of low and intermediate density lipoproteins and chylomicrons, with one ApoB100 molecule per hepatic-derived lipoprotein (ApoB100 being the full-length protein product of the ApoB gene and the only form of the protein synthesized in the liver).</s><s>Hepatic ApoB expression is therefore a useful index of hepatic lipoprotein concentration, and its increase in response to Kcne2 deletion is highly consistent with NAFLD.</s><s>Furthermore, previous studies showed that the human ApoB/A1 ratio positively correlates (independent of other risk factors) with prevalence of NAFLD <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Our transcriptomic analysis indicates that the hepatic ApoB/A1 transcript ratio is increased 2.3-fold by Kcne2 deletion (Supplemental Spreadsheet 1), again consistent with a diagnosis of NAFLD in Kcne2 ─/─ mice.</s></p><p><s>Kcne2 deletion-linked achlorhydria <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> causes iron-deficiency anemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , which can predispose to dyslipidemia and NAFLD <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Although data vary depending on the animal model studied, iron deficiency in rats, for example, has been reported to increase hepatic lipogenesis, causing steatosis; this may occur via increased de novo lipogenesis from glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Here, to investigate the possible role of iron deficiency in Kcne2 deletion-linked NAFLD, we initially utilized transcriptomic analysis in conjunction with iron supplementation.</s><s>Non-treated P21 Kcne2 ─/─ livers exhibited extensive transcriptome remodeling indicative of NAFLD and anemia (Supplemental Spreadsheet 1).</s><s>The 6 top-ranked DEG networks as identified by pathway analysis were: increased beta oxidation of fatty acids, elevated carbohydrates, hepatic steatosis, survival of erythroid progenitor cells and red blood cells, and proliferation of embryonic stem cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Strikingly, supplementation with injectable iron (iron dextran) eliminated the differences in concerted gene expression caused by Kcne2 deletion that are associated with anemia (demonstrating that the iron supplementation we employed was effective in restoring iron levels and preventing anemia) and also the gene expression changes associated with NAFLD.</s><s>Thus, only 5 of the 116 DEGs in the top 6 DEG networks were still differentially expressed in Kcne2 ─/─ livers after iron treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; Supplemental Spreadsheet 2).</s></p><p><s>Consistent with the finding that iron supplementation prevented the transcriptome changes associated with NAFLD in Kcne2 ─/─ pups, iron supplementation also prevented excessive vacuolation in the liver and eliminated Kcne2-dependent differences in hepatic lipid accumulation in the liver (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A-C</ref>).</s><s>A comparison of hepatic oil red O staining in iron-treated versus non-treated Kcne2 ─/─ pups indicated successful alleviation of hepatic steatosis by iron supplementation (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.03).</s><s>Thus, iron deficiency is a major factor in Kcne2-dependent, early-onset NAFLD.</s><s>Note that the moderate increase in hepatic lipids of Kcne2 +/+ pups treated with iron likely arose from iron overload which, as with iron deficiency, can also cause hepatic steatosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To increase confidence that iron deficiency played the major role in Kcne2-dependent NAFLD, we examined other potential causes.</s><s>Kcne2 deletion also causes cardiac dysfunction, which can lead to right-heart failure and associated liver fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Although the livers studied here were from global Kcne2 ─/─ pups at P21, at which age they do not show signs of heart failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , we next examined livers isolated from mice with a cardiac-specific Kcne2 deletion, to rule out a direct role for cardiac dysfunction in Kcne2-dependent NAFLD.</s><s>Accordingly, only 15/116 DEGs in the top 6 DEG networks identified in global Kcne2 ─/─ mouse livers were also differentially expressed in cardiac-specific Kcne2 ─/─ mouse livers, strongly suggesting against a cardiac role in Kcne2 ─/─ NAFLD initiation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; Supplemental Spreadsheet 3).</s><s>Kcne2 deletion also results in hypothyroidism because KCNQ1-KCNE2 channels facilitate thyroid iodide uptake by the sodium iodide symporter <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Pups of Kcne2 ─/─ dams are hypothyroid regardless of their own genotype because they rely on milk for iodide and/or thyroid hormones, whereas Kcne2 ─/─ mice bred from Kcne2 +/─ dams do not exhibit signs of hypothyroidism until adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>However, because hypothyroidism is a risk factor for NAFLD and even upper-normal levels of TSH associate with human NAFLD <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , and because we previously observed findings suggestive of liver fibrosis in hypothyroid Kcne2 ─/─ mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , here we nevertheless examined this possibility, by comparing livers of P21 Kcne2 ─/─ pups bred from Kcne2 +/─ versus Kcne2 ─/─ dams.</s><s>Only 14 DEGs identified when comparing livers of Kcne2 ─/─ pups versus those of Kcne2 +/+ pups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) were also identified as being differentially expressed in Kcne2 ─/─ pups from Kcne2 ─/─ dams versus those from Kcne2 +/─ dams (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>), and none of these were within the 6 identified anemia/NAFLD networks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, network analysis of DEGs in livers of Kcne2 ─/─ pups from Kcne2 ─/─ dams versus those from Kcne2 +/─ dams revealed less-populated networks, spanning a range of physiological processes and not biased toward NAFLD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s><s>Kcne2-dependent NAFLD in pups from heterozygous dams, as we used in the current study, is therefore not initiated by hypothyroidism.</s><s>Taken together, our data support a primary role for iron deficiency, but not hypothyroidism or heart failure, in initiating Kcne2-dependent NAFLD.</s><s>Similarly, iron deficiency can predispose to dyslipidemia and NAFLD in human populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , both of which are risk factors for atherosclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , as are certain human KCNE2 polymorphisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In addition, we found that serum C-reactive protein (CRP), an atherosclerotic biomarker released by the liver in response to inflammation, was elevated in Kcne2 ─/─ mice -most prominently in western diet-fed females (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>).</s><s>This correlates with recently-discovered atherosclerotic predisposition in Kcne2 ─/─ mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and is also consistent with presence of NAFLD, although elevated CRP is not a specific biomarker for NAFLD <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Achlorhydria also causes hyperhomocysteinemia, another atherosclerosis risk factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> ;
