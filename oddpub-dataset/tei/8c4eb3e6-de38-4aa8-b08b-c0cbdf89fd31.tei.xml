<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>The study sample size was based on our calculation that 26 patients per arm would allow us to detect a mean between-arm difference in RASS score of 0.32 (0.5 effect size, based on a standard deviation of 0.63) with alpha=5% using a two-sided t-test. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>We summarized our data with descriptive statistics.</s></p><p><s>To determine the MCID for RASS, we adopted the statistical analysis plan previously used to identify the MCID for the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> </s><s>n the sensitivity-specificity approach, caregiver perceived patient comfort was used as the benchmark against which RASS changes was anchored and calibrated.</s><s>Specifically, improvement was indicated by the caregiver answering "agree" or "strongly agree", while other answers ("neutral", "disagree" and "strongly disagree") were considered as no improvement.</s><s>We plotted the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves with true positive rate (sensitivity) on the y-axis and false positive rate (1 -specificity) on the x-axis.</s></p><p><s>We then calculated the area under the curve (AUC), and determined the optimal cutoff for improvement based on the Youden J's index and top left approaches.</s><s>We repeated the same analysis using perceived patient comfort by the nurse as the anchor.</s></p><p><s>We also estimated MCID using within-patient change by computing the average RASS change for the perceived comfort question categories "agree" because this category represented the smallest perceived change. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>ID is often estimated using the distribution-based approach, in which 0.5 standard deviation of baseline score is considered as a cutoff. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>However, the nature of this study design resulted in a highly homogenous RASS score distribution at baseline because patients only started the study intervention when they reached the pre-specified RASS threshold.</s><s>Thus, distribution approach was not used in this study to estimate the MCID.</s></p><p><s>The Statistical Analysis Software 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) software was used for statistical analysis.</s><s>Statistically significance was declared when the P-value is &lt;0.05.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minimal Clinically Important Difference</head><p><s>Using the sensitivity-specificity approach, the optimal cutoff for RASS improvement was a 4-point reduction for both caregivers (sensitivity 61%, specificity 80%) and nurses (sensitivity 73%, specificity 84%) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Based on this cutoff, the sensitivity was 61%, the specificity was 80%, positive predictive value was 82% and negative predictive value was 57% for caregiver assessment; the sensitivity was 73%, the specificity was 84%, positive predictive value was 84% and negative predictive value was 73% for nursing assessment.</s><s>The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve was 0.71 (95% CI 0.54-0.87;</s><s>P=0.03) for caregivers and 0.78 (95% CI 0.64-0.92;</s><s>P=0.002) for nurses, suggesting moderate to high discrimination (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The RASS cutoff based on within-patient change method was also highly consistent with the above analysis, being âˆ’4.2 (SD 0.6) for caregivers and âˆ’4.0 (SD 1.8) for nurses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we found that the MCID for RASS improvement was a 4-point reduction using both the sensitivity-specificity approach and the within-patient change approach.</s><s>Remarkably, this cutoff was the same for both caregivers and nurses.</s><s>Our preliminary findings have potential implications for clinical trial designs and interpretation.</s></p><p><s>MCID is often determined using an anchor-based approach, and the choice of anchor is critical to define clinical significance.</s><s>There is no universally accepted anchor to define clinical significance in the agitated delirium setting.</s><s>We elected to use perceived comfort as the anchor in this study because one of the most important goals of palliative care is to maximize comfort through alleviation of suffering.</s><s>Patient comfort is also a key determinant of personalized symptom goals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>While patient comfort may be affected by many factors other than agitation, such as pain and dyspnea control, the significant association between patient perceived comfort and RASS change in this study supports that the level of agitation/ restlessness remains a main driver of comfort.</s><s>The moderate to high level of discrimination in RASS score further confirms this assessment's responsiveness to change.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the MCID for RASS in the setting of agitated delirium.</s><s>We were surprised to find that the MCID for RASS was 4 points over the 10-point Likert Scale, suggesting that a large magnitude of reduction in RASS was necessary for it to be considered as clinically meaningful.</s><s>We believe our findings were robust because all 4 methods (2 assessors and 2 anchor-based approaches) arrived at the same cutoff.</s><s>One reason for this large MCID value may be related to the fact that we used perceived comfort as an anchor.</s><s>A significant shift in RASS may be necessary for patients to be considered as comfortable by surrogate observers, who likely had been troubled by the aggressive behaviour and/or sleepiness nights.</s><s>In this specific setting of persistent agitation, a consistent level of moderate sedation may be preferred over light sedation.</s></p><p><s>This large MCID value has implications for future delirium clinical trial design.</s><s>First, the sample size required may be smaller than in other symptoms.</s><s>Given that delirium trials are complex by nature and difficult to conduct, this new insight supports that even small studies (N&lt;100) may be adequately powered for hypothesis-testing.</s><s>Second, the intervention needs to have a relatively big impact on agitation.</s><s>For pharmacologic therapies, this means that the dose would need to be high enough or that medication combinations may be required to achieve the desired effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> </s><s>hird, it is important to point out that a smaller magnitude does not necessarily mean that the intervention is not clinically significant.</s><s>Smaller changes in RASS may be associated with other clinical outcomes (e.g.</s><s>fewer use of rescue neuroleptics, absence of any RASS â‰¥+1 during the 8 hour period) and need to be further investigated.</s></p><p><s>In addition to study design, findings from this study may help us to better interpret clinical trial outcomes.</s><s>For a patient with agitation at RASS of +1 or +2 at baseline, a reduction to RASS âˆ’3 (moderately sedated) and âˆ’2 (mildly sedated), respectively, would be necessary for the patient to be considered as comfortable.</s><s>Our finding suggests that RASS âˆ’1 or 0 may not be the optimal level of sedation, perhaps because patients on this trial had persistent delirium with agitation which could be extremely distressing for caregivers and nurses alike.</s><s>Applying this 4-point cutoff, 65% patients on the lorazepam/haloperidol arm and 27% patients on the haloperidol arm were able to achieve a clinical response by 8 hours.</s></p><p><s>A better understanding of the MCID may also have clinical implications for defining a clinical response.</s><s>Our current study suggests that caregivers desire a significant shift in consciousness for patients with persistent agitation.</s><s>The use of pharmacologic therapy for delirium in the palliative care setting is an area of intense debate.</s><s>Although current clinical practice guidelines recommend neuroleptics such as haloperidol and olanzapine as first line pharmacologic treatments for agitation in delirium, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> some have cautioned against their use because a recent 3-arm randomized trial found that placebo was superior to risperidone and haloperidol. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>However, several methodologic issues complicate its interpretation, including the composite primary outcome which had not been validated and enrolment of patients with relatively low delirium symptom severity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>In contrast, our randomized clinical trial in the terminal delirium setting found that haloperidol alone resulted in a significant reduction of RASS (a validated primary outcome) and the addition of lorazepam was significantly more effective. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>More research is needed to identify the right medication(s) for the right indication in the right population.</s><s>Patients with hyperactive delirium often receive higher doses of neuroleptics compared to those with hypoactive delirium; however, the optimal dosing has not been defined, resulting in wide variations in how neuroleptics are prescribed in practice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>e unique aspect of this study was that we assessed patient comfort from the perspective of caregivers and nurses.</s><s>Given that patients were delirious and unable to communicate, we needed to rely on these observers, who often spend a large amount of time by the bedside, to provide a surrogate response.</s><s>Interestingly, there was only moderate concordance between caregiver's assessment and bedside nurses' assessment.</s><s>This is consistent with previous studies on patient-reported outcomes suggesting that caregivers' and nurses' impression correlated with patient self-report, although the two groups had different perspectives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>It was reassuring that the same cutoff value for RASS reduction was considered clinically meaningful by both groups.</s></p><p><s>This study has several limitations.</s><s>First, the MCID was derived from a single randomized trial conducted in an acute palliative care unit.</s><s>Patients in this study were being treated for terminal restlessness/agitation.</s><s>The findings may not be generalizable to other settings.</s><s>Second, it is important to point out that a majority of study participants had a RASS score of +1 or +2 at the time of study medication administration.</s><s>Further research is needed to determine if the 4-point MCID cutoff is applicable to patients with higher RASS scores.</s><s>Third, the sample size was small and not specifically powered for this post-hoc analysis.</s><s>This limitation was further compounded by the fact that the anchor was missing in some patients.</s><s>Thus, the MCID cutoff should be considered as preliminary.</s><s>Fourth, the primary outcome was change in RASS reduction from baseline to 8 hours while the anchor was collected between 8 and 24 hours after study intervention.</s><s>The level of sedation/agitation and other symptoms that occurred during this time interval may have contributed to perceived comfort.</s><s>Fifth, we only assessed perceived comfort using a single question.</s></p><p><s>Qualitative studies may help to better understand how caregivers and nurses define comfort in the context of refractory terminal delirium and to identify a personalized sedation goal.</s></p><p><s>In summary, using 4 different anchor-based methods, we found that a reduction of 4 points in RASS was considered to be the MCID in the setting of persistent agitation and delirium.</s></p><p><s>Our findings may support future study designs and help with interpretation of findings from delirium trials.</s><s>The cutoff value is selected based on the largest Youden's J value, which represents the point on the ROC curve that represents the largest vertical distance from the ROC curve to the diagonal line of equality.</s><s>The optimal cutoff is highlighted in bold.</s></p><note type="other">b</note><p><s>The cutoff value is chosen based on the smallest top left value, which is on the
