current affect frontal parts of the brain including eyeball and optic nerve while only low levels were found in the visual cortex.</s><s>This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that cortical

future studies in this area current flow simulations may help to target both safety considerations and improved stimulation paradigms.</s><s>Our findings of improved visual functions are consistent

this bias by using a "minimal dose" sham-condition where phosphene perceptions also occurred.</s><s>However, the draw-back of this kind of sham procedure is that a "minimal dose" may actually have some, albeit small, therapeutic effects that cannot be separated from possible placebo effects of the current study design.</s><s>Indeed, the sham group significantly improved in some parameters as

hypothesis on their own that fewer phosphenes were less effective.</s><s>However, considering that phosphenes may contribute to a placebo effect, it cannot be ruled out that patients in the rtACS-group who experienced more significant visual phenomena during stimulation might have had a greater feeling of that a powerful treatment was occurring than those who only experienced a flash once a minute.</s></p><p><s>Several open questions should be addressed in future studies.</s><s>Important issues are whether non-invasive current stimulation-induced visual system changes are due to neuroplastic alteration, if they can be potentiated by vision training <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and if rtACS can also improve vision in patients with post-chiasmatic lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, for general diagnostics low contrast visual acuity as a sensitive outcome measure and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measurements to better define study inclusion criteria should be considered to explore altered axonal and neuronal integrity in the afferent visual pathway.</s><s>While additional studies are needed to further explore the mechanisms of action, our results warrant the use of rtACS treatment in a clinical setting to activate residual vision by brain network re-synchronization, which can partially restore
