<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The VirScan Platform</head><p><s>VirScan utilizes the Phage Immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq) technology previously developed in our laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, we used a programmable DNA microarray to synthesize 93,904 200-mer oligonucleotides, encoding 56-residue peptide tiles, with 28 residue overlaps, that together span the reference protein sequences (collapsed to 90% identity) of all viruses annotated to have human tropism in the UniProt database (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>.a and 1A.b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>This library includes peptides from 206 species of virus and over 1,000 different strains.</s><s>We cloned the library into a T7 bacteriophage display vector for screening (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>.c).</s></p><p><s>To perform a screen, we incubate the library with a serum sample containing antibodies, recover the antibodies using a mixture of protein A and G coated magnetic beads, and remove unbound phage particles by washing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>.d and 1A.e).</s><s>Finally, we perform PCR and massively parallel sequencing on the phage DNA to quantify enrichment of each library member due to antibody binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>.f).</s><s>Each sample is screened in duplicate to ensure reproducibility.</s><s>VirScan requires only 2 μg of immunoglobulin (&lt;1 μL of serum) per sample and can be automated on a 96-well liquid handling robot <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>PCR product from 96 immunoprecipitations can be individually barcoded and pooled for sequencing, reducing the cost for a comprehensive viral antibody screen to approximately $25 per sample.</s></p><p><s>Following sequencing, we tally the read count for each peptide before ("input") and after ("output") immunoprecipitation.</s><s>We then fit a zero-inflated generalized Poisson model to the distribution of output read counts for each input read count and regress the parameters as a function of input read count (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Using this model, we calculate a −log 10 (p-value) for the significance of each peptide's enrichment.</s><s>Finally, we call a peptide significantly enriched if its −log 10 (p-value) is greater than the reproducibility threshold of 2.3 in both replicates (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterizing VirScan's sensitivity and specificity</head><p><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> shows the antibody profiles of a set of human viruses in sera from a typical group of individuals in a heat map format that illustrates the number of enriched peptides from each virus.</s><s>We frequently detected antibodies to multiple peptides from common human viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and rhinovirus.</s><s>As expected, we observed more peptides to be enriched from viruses with larger proteomes, such as EBV and CMV, likely because there are more epitopes available for recognition.</s><s>We noticed fewer enriched peptides in samples from individuals less than ten years of age compared to their geographically matched controls, in line with an accumulation of viral infections throughout adolescence and adulthood.</s><s>However, there were occasional samples from young donors with very strong responses to viruses that cause childhood illness, such as Parvovirus B19 and Herpesvirus 6B, which cause the "fifth disease" and "sixth disease" of the classical infectious childhood rashes, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>These observations are examined in greater detail in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We developed a computational method to identify the set of viruses to which an individual has been exposed, based on the number of enriched peptides identified per virus.</s><s>Briefly, we set a threshold number of significant non-overlapping enriched peptides for each virus.</s><s>We empirically determined that a threshold of three non-overlapping enriched peptides gave the best performance for detecting Herpes simplex virus 1 compared to a commercial serologic test, described below (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>For other viruses, we adjusted the threshold to account for the size of the viral proteome (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Next, we tally the number of enriched peptides from each virus.</s><s>Antibodies generated against a specific virus can cross-react with similar peptides from a related virus.</s><s>This would lead to false positives because an antibody targeted to an epitope from one virus to which a donor was exposed would also enrich a homologous peptide from a related virus to which the donor may not have been exposed.</s><s>In order to address this issue, we adopted a maximum parsimony approach to infer the fewest number of virus exposures that could elicit the observed spectrum of antiviral peptide antibodies.</s><s>For groups of enriched peptides that share a 7 amino acid subsequence and may be recognized by a single specific antibody, we only count it as one epitope for the virus that has the greatest number of other enriched peptides.</s><s>If this adjusted peptide count is greater than the threshold for that virus, the sample is considered positive for the virus.</s><s>For this analysis, we also filtered out peptides that were enriched in only one of the 569 samples to avoid spurious hits.</s></p><p><s>Using this analytical framework, we measured the performance of VirScan using serum samples from patients known to be infected or not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV), based on commercial ELISA and Western blot assays.</s><s>For both viruses, VirScan achieves very high sensitivities and specificities of ~95% or higher (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) over a wide range of viral loads (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>The viral genotype was also known for the HCV positive samples.</s><s>Despite the over 70% amino acid sequence conservation among HCV genotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, which poses a problem for all antibody-based detection methods, VirScan correctly reported the HCV genotype in 69% of the samples.</s><s>We also compared VirScan to a commercially available serology test that is type specific for the highly related Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV1 and HSV2) (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>These results demonstrate that VirScan performs well in distinguishing between closely related viruses and viruses that range in size from small (HIV and HCV) to very large (HSV1 and HSV2) with high sensitivity and specificity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population-level analysis of viral exposures</head><p><s>After ascertaining the performance of VirScan for a panel of viruses, we undertook a largescale screening of samples with unknown exposure history.</s><s>Using our multiplex approach, we assayed over 106 million antibody-peptide interactions using samples from 569 human donors in duplicate.</s><s>We detected antibody responses to an average of 10 species of virus per sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s><s>Each person is likely exposed to multiple distinct strains of some viral species.</s><s>We detected antibody responses to 62 of the 206 species of virus in our library in at least 5 individuals, and 84 species in at least 2 individuals.</s><s>The most frequently detected viruses are generally those known to commonly infect humans (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>We occasionally detected what appear to be false positives that may be due to antibodies that cross react with non-viral peptides.</s><s>For example, 29% of the samples positive for Cowpox virus were right at the threshold of detection and had antibodies against a peptide from the C4L gene that shares an eight amino acid sequence ('SESDSDSD') with the Clumping Factor B protein from Staphylococcus aureus, against which humans are known to generate antibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>This will become less of an issue when we test more examples of sera from patients with known infections to determine the set of likely antigenic peptides for a given virus.</s><s>However, the fact that we do not detect high rates of very rare or virulent viruses strengthens our confidence in VirScan's specificity (see Supplementary Discussion).</s></p><p><s>We frequently detected antibodies to rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, which are normally found only in the respiratory tract, indicating that VirScan using blood samples is still able to detect viruses that do not cause viremia.</s><s>We also detected antibodies to influenza, which is normally cleared, and poliovirus, to which most people in modern times generate antibodies through vaccination.</s><s>Since the original antigen is no longer present, we are likely detecting antibodies secreted by long-lived memory B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We detected antibodies to certain viruses less frequently than expected based on previous seroprevalence studies using optimized serum ELISA assays.</s><s>For example, the frequency at which we detect influenza (53.4%) and poliovirus (33.7%) is lower than expected given that the majority of the population has been exposed to or vaccinated against these viruses.</s><s>This may be due to reduced sensitivity because of a gradual narrowing and decrease of the longlived B cell response in the absence of persistent antigen.</s><s>We also rarely detected antibody responses to small viruses such as JC virus and Torque Teno virus, which are frequently detected using specific tests.</s><s>We believe that the disparity is due to low titers of antibodies to unmodified, linear epitopes from these viruses.</s><s>For example, serum antibodies against the major capsid protein of JCV are reported to only recognize conformational epitopes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the frequency of detecting varicella zoster virus (chicken pox) antibodies is also lower than expected (24.3%), even though the frequency of detecting other latent herpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (87.1%) and cytomegalovirus (48.5%), is similar to the prevalence reported in epidemiological studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>This may reflect differences in how frequently these viruses shed antigens that stimulate B cell responses or a more limited humoral response that relies on epitopes that cannot be detected in a 56-residue peptide.</s><s>It might also be possible to increase the sensitivity of detection of these viral antibodies by stimulating memory B cells in vitro to probe the history of infection more deeply.</s></p><p><s>To assess differences in viral exposure between populations, we split the samples into different groups based on age, HIV status, and geography.</s><s>We first compared results from children under the age of ten to adults within the United States (HIV-positive individuals were excluded from this analysis) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Fewer children were positive for most viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus, HSV1, HSV2, and influenza virus, which is consistent with our preliminary observations comparing the number of enriched peptides (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>In addition to the fact that children may generate lower antibody titers in general, these younger donors probably have not yet been exposed to certain viruses, for example HSV2 which is sexually transmitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>When comparing results from HIV positive to HIV negative samples, we found more of the HIV positive samples to also be seropositive for additional viruses, including HSV2, CMV, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (false discovery rate q &lt; 0.05, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>These results are consistent with prior studies indicating higher risk of these coinfections in HIV positive patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>Patients with HIV may engage in activities that put them at higher risk for exposure to these viruses.</s><s>Alternatively, these viruses may increase the risk of HIV infection.</s><s>HIV infection may reduce the immune system's ability to control reactivation of normally dormant resident viruses or to prevent opportunistic infections from taking hold and triggering a strong adaptive immune response.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we compared the evidence of viral exposure between samples taken from adult HIVnegative donors residing in countries from four different continents (the United States, Peru, Thailand, and South Africa).</s><s>In general, donors outside the United States had higher frequencies of seropositivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C-E</ref>).</s><s>For example, cytomegalovirus antibodies were found in significantly higher frequencies in samples from Peru, Thailand, and South Africa.</s><s>Other viruses, such as

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We have developed VirScan, a technology for identifying viral exposure and B cell epitopes across the entire known human virome in a single, multiplex reaction using less than a drop of blood.</s><s>VirScan uses DNA microarray synthesis and bacteriophage display to create a uniform, synthetic representation of peptide epitopes comprising the human virome.</s><s>Immunoprecipitation and high-throughput DNA sequencing reveals the peptides recognized by antibodies in the sample.</s><s>VirScan is easily automated in 96-well format to enable high throughput sample processing.</s><s>Barcoding of samples during PCR enables pooled analysis that can dramatically reduce the per-sample cost.</s><s>The VirScan approach has several advantages for studying the effect of viruses on the host immune system.</s><s>By detecting antibody responses, it can identify infectious agents that have been cleared after an effective host response.</s><s>Current serological methods of antiviral antibody detection typically employ the selection of a single optimized antigen in order to achieve high accuracy.</s><s>In contrast, VirScan's unique approach does not require such optimization in order to obtain similar performance.</s><s>VirScan achieves sensitive detection by assaying each virus's complete proteome to detect any antibodies directed to epitopes that can be captured in a 56-residue fragment and specificity by computationally eliminating cross-reactive antibodies.</s><s>This unbiased approach identifies exposure to less well-studied viruses for which optimal serological antigens are not known and can be rapidly extended to include new viruses as they are discovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>While sensitive and selective, VirScan also has a few limitations.</s><s>First, it cannot detect epitopes that require post-translational modifications.</s><s>Secondly, it cannot detect epitopes that involve discontinuous sequences on protein fragments greater than 56 residues.</s><s>In principle, the latter can be overcome by using alternative technologies that allow for the display of full-length proteins such as Parallel Analysis of Translated ORFs (PLATO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>Third, VirScan is likely to be less specific compared with certain nucleic acid tests that discern highly related virus strains.</s><s>However, VirScan demonstrates excellent serological discrimination among similar virus species, such as HSV1 and HSV2 and can even distinguish the genotype of HCV 69% of the time.</s><s>We envision VirScan will become an important tool for first-pass unbiased serologic screening applications.</s><s>Individual viruses or viral proteins uncovered in this way can subsequently be analyzed in further detail using more focused assays, as we have demonstrated for a panel of immunodominant epitopes.</s></p><p><s>We have demonstrated that VirScan is a sensitive and specific assay for detecting exposure to viruses across the human virome.</s><s>Because it can be performed in high-throughput and requires minimal sample and cost, VirScan enables rapid and cost-effective screening of large numbers of samples to identify population-level differences in virus exposure across the human virome.</s><s>In this work, we analyzed over 106 million antibody-viral peptide interactions in a comprehensive study of pan-virus serology in a large, diverse population.</s><s>In doing so we detected 84 different viral species in 2 or more individuals.</s><s>This is likely to be an underestimate of the history of viral infection as only low levels of circulating antibodies may remain from infections that were cleared in the distant past.</s><s>In addition, an individual could be infected by multiple distinct strains of each viral species.</s><s>We identified known and novel differences in virus exposure between groups differing in age, HIV status, and geographic location across four different continents.</s><s>Our results are largely consistent with previous studies, validating the effectiveness of VirScan.</s><s>For example, cytomegalovirus antibodies were found in significantly higher frequencies in Peru, Thailand, and South Africa whereas Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and HSV1 antibodies were detected more frequently in Peru and South Africa, but not in Thailand <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr"

also uncovered previously undocumented serological differences, such as an increased rate of antibodies against Adenovirus B and respiratory syncytial virus in HIV positive individuals compared to HIV negative individuals.</s><s>These differences may provide insight into how HIV co-infection alters the balance between host immunity and resident viruses, as well as help to identify pathogens that may increase susceptibility to HIV and other heterologous infections.</s><s>HIV infection may reduce the immune system's ability to control reactivation of normally dormant resident viruses or to prevent opportunistic infections from taking hold and triggering a strong adaptive immune response.</s><s>Beyond the epidemiological applications demonstrated here, VirScan could also be applied to identify viral exposures that correlate with disease or other phenotypes in virome-wide association studies.</s></p><p><s>Our results identified a large number of novel B cell epitopes, cumulatively nearly doubling the number of all previously identified viral epitopes.</s><s>We have utilized our data to identify globally immunodominant and commonly recognized "public" epitopes.</s><s>For most species of viruses, one or more peptides are individually recognized in over 70% to 95% of samples positive for that species (table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</s><s>We identified a set of two peptides that together are recognized by &gt;95% of all screened samples and a set of five peptides that together are recognized in &gt;99% of screened samples.</s><s>These public epitopes could be used to improve vaccine design by piggybacking on the existing antibody response against them.</s><s>Fusing a public B cell epitope to a protein in a vaccine to which we hope to induce an immune response may increase a vaccine's efficacy among a broad population by improving presentation of that protein and aiding affinity maturation.</s><s>Pre-existing B cells recognizing the public epitope can act as antigen presenting cells to process and present T cell epitopes of the fused vaccine target on MHC class I and II <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>Antibodies secreted by these B cells can also participate in immune complexes with the fused vaccine target, which are critical for follicular dendritic cells to prime class switching and affinity maturation of B cells recognizing other epitopes on the fused antigen <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, we demonstrated that applying more weight to these public epitopes increases the sensitivity of VirScan without significantly affecting specificity, suggesting that this limited subset of peptides can serve as the basis for the next generation of our assay or for other novel diagnostics.</s></p><p><s>We also found that the precise epitopes recognized by the B cell response are highly similar among individuals across many viral proteins.</s><s>One possible model for this striking similarity is that these regions possess properties favorable for antigenicity, such as accessibility.</s><s>Another model is that the same or highly similar B cell receptor sequences that recognize these epitopes are commonly generated.</s><s>Identical T cell receptor sequences ("public" clonotypes) have been found in multiple individuals and are thought to be the result of biases during the recombination process that favor certain amino acid sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>V(D)J recombination of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain loci is also heavily biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s>Highly similar or even identical complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences have been observed in dengue virus specific antibodies from different individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>It is possible that, rather than being an exception for dengue specific antibodies, this represents a general phenomenon: inherent biases in V(D)J recombination generate the same or similar antibodies in multiple individuals that recognize highly similar epitopes.</s><s>Slight differences in the antibody CDR3 sequence may subtly alter antibody-antigen interaction, leading to the slight variations observed in the extent of critical epitope regions.</s><s>Sequencing of antigen specific antibody genes will be required to investigate these possibilities.</s><s>The same principle may also apply to T cell epitopes and their cognate TCRs.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, VirScan is a new method that enables human virome-wide exploration -at the epitope level -of immune responses in large numbers of individuals.</s><s>We have demonstrated its effectiveness for determining viral exposure and characterizing viral B cell epitopes in high throughput and at high resolution.</s><s>Our preliminary studies have revealed intriguing general properties of the human immune system, both at the individual and population scale.</s><s>VirScan will be an important tool in uncovering the effect of host-virome interactions on human health and disease and could easily be expanded to include other human pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and protozoa.</s></p></div>
