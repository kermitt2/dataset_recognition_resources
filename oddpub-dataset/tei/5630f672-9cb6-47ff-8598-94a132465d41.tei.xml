<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between spiders and pest insects</head><p><s>The abundances of both planthoppers and leafhoppers in early August had a negative relationship with the abundance of Tetragnatha spiders in late July (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>This relationship was due to the temporal shift in the relative abundances of predator and prey species, i.e., from a state of low-spider and high-hopper abundances to high-spider and low-hopper abundances.</s><s>However, a similar negative relationship was not found for stinkbugs (z = 0.527, P = 0.598) and lepidopterans (z = 4.712, P &lt; 0.001); notice that lepidopteran abundance exhibited a positive association with spider abundance.</s><s>Additionally, the abundance relationship between spiders and planthoppers or leafhoppers became positive in late August (Planthopper, z = 2.418, P = 0.016; Leafhopper, z = 2.175, P = 0.030), suggesting the disappearance of top-down effects in this season.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our results demonstrated that the time since the transition from conventional to organic farming appeared to influence the abundance of some arthropods in paddy fields.</s><s>Moreover, the shape of the time-abundance relationship occasionally exhibited a non-linear saturation pattern, i.e., abundance increased for several years, but did not appreciably increase from 10 years onward.</s><s>This suggests that a non-equilibrium state of arthropod populations could last for a decade after the transition to organic farming.</s><s>To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence for time-dependent responses of organism in rice fields.</s><s>Earlier studies on cereal fields in Europe have also shown transient abundance or richness dynamics for plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, butterflies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, and microbes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> in response to changes in farming practices.</s><s>Most of these studies have shown a continual increase for several years or more, with the exception of weeds and weed-dependent moths, which show a peak in abundance/richness after a few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The results of our study are therefore in agreement, in part, with earlier studies of cereal croplands.</s><s>We expected Tetragnatha spiders to show a more delayed response to organic farming due to their higher trophic position, but such a pattern was not evident in comparison to other arthropods.</s><s>Several factors are thought to explain the delayed or gradual response of organisms, including dispersal limitation (or "colonization credit"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>), effects of residual pesticides and/or chemical fertilizer in soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, and lag time to the mineralization of organic matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, some taxa showed a gradual increase since the transition to organic farming, i.e., larval lepidopterans, Tetragnatha spiders, and some planthoppers and stink bugs.</s><s>Among the above factors, dispersal limitation may not be the main cause of the gradual increase, as individual paddy fields were the unit to which organic farming was applied, so immigration into such fields from adjacent habitats is likely to occur in a short period.</s><s>Nevertheless, dispersal limitation might explain the observed changes in Tetragnatha spiders, to some degree.</s><s>These spiders are known to aggregate in patches with high prey availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, but their mechanism of movement basically involves changing their web sites day-by-day, probably in a trial-error manner.</s><s>This process appears to be slow in comparison to the movement of freely flying insects.</s></p><p><s>The effect of residual pesticides is a likely cause for delayed responses because some pesticides applied in our conventional paddy fields have residual toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, fipronil residues remain in paddy soils for over a year, and decrease not only target insect pests (lepidopterans and hemipterans), but also other insects, including chironomid larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>This Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>We found appreciable effects of the time since the transition to organic farming on organismal abundance in paddy fields, but the response types varied among taxa, with increasing, steady, and even decreasing patterns.</s><s>The time-abundance relationship occasionally exhibited a nonlinear saturation pattern, and a transient non-equilibrium state could last for a decade.</s><s>Moreover, differences in responses might be partially explained by predator-prey interactions.</s><s>Although our results are not conclusive owing to the limited number of replications and the time-for-space substitution approach, they strongly suggest that consideration of the timedependent responses of organisms is essential for the evaluation of the costs and benefits of organic/WF farming.</s><s>Such evaluations could facilitate the establishment of guidelines regarding how long organic/WF farming should be continued to restore biodiversity or the economic subsidy needed to compensate for pest damage.</s></p></div>
