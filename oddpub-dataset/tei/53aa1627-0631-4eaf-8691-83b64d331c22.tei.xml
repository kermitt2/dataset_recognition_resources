forms of hypertension are associated with a higher risk of death in older adults, although the association appeared to be stronger with SDH.</s><s>Both forms of hypertension also had similar associations with other cardiovascular events including incident AMI and stroke.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to examine the association of SDH with cardiovascular outcomes in older adults.</s><s>These findings are important as the rather similar risk profile of SDH and ISH in communitydwelling older adults suggest that both forms of hypertension need to be treated to reduce the risk of HF and other adverse cardiovascular outcomes and death in this population.</s></p><p><s>Aging is associated with arteriosclerotic stiffening of large capacitance vessels resulting in an elevation of SBP with a normal or decreased DBP and an associated widening of the pulse pressure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>Thus, a higher risk of incident HF among those with ISH may be attributed to both an elevated SBP and a decreased DBP.</s><s>However, an elevated SBP alone with a normal DBP may also increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events including incident HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> In a propensity-matched cohort of CHS participants in which those with and without ISH were balanced on 64 baseline characteristics including a mean DBP of 71 mm Hg in both groups, ISH was independently associated with a significant 26% higher risk of developing new-onset HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The mean SBP of participants with SDH in our study was 12 mm Hg higher than that in the SDH group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Yet, the risk of incident HF was rather similar in both groups, suggesting that either an elevated DBP may have attenuated the risk in the SDH group, or a decreased DBP may have increased the risk in the ISH group.</s></p><p><s>The mean DBP in the ISH group in our study was 19 mm Hg lower than that in the SDH group.</s><s>Little is known about the association of an isolated elevation of DBP with incident HF in older adults.</s><s>We have demonstrated that isolated diastolic hypertension, defined as DBP ≥90 mm Hg and SBP &lt;140 mm Hg, a rare form of hypertension in older adults, may be associated with a higher risk of incident HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> In contrast, a low DBP has been shown to be a risk factor for incident HF in this population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>In a propensity-matched cohort of CHS participants in which those with and without isolated diastolic hypotension (DBP &lt;60 mm Hg) were balanced on 58 baseline characteristics including a mean SBP of 130 and 131 mm Hg (among those with and without diastolic hypotension, respectively), DBP &lt;60 mm Hg was independently associated with a significant 33% higher risk of developing new-onset HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Although participants with DBP &lt;60 mm Hg were excluded from our analysis, the mean DBP in the ISH group was 19 mm Hg lower than that in the SDH group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, with a mean DBP (±SD) of 76 (±8) mm Hg, about a third of those with ISH in our study had DBP &lt;68 mm Hg.</s><s>Thus, a low DBP in the ISH group may have accentuated the risk of HF in that group despite a lower mean SBP in that group, thus explaining similar risk of HF in both ISH and SDH.</s></p><p><s>Because of the age-related atherosclerotic changes in large capacitance vessels, hypertension in older adults is more likely to be ISH.</s><s>However, it is also possible that some patients with treated SDH in whom SBP may have responded more favorably than DBP would be misclassified as ISH.</s><s>Findings from randomized controlled trials of hypertension suggest that SBP may be more responsive to antihypertensive therapy than DBP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>This nonrandom misclassification may have attenuated a differential association that the two types of hypertension may have with incident HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> In contrast, ISH is unlikely to be misclassified as SDH because by definition patients with ISH would have a normal or low DBP before treatment is initiated and DBP would unlikely be elevated after initiation of therapy.</s><s>Therefore, patients in the SDH group in our study represent those with true SDH as opposed to being diluted by those with misclassified ISH.</s><s>Thus, both higher SBP and DBP may have contributed to the higher risk of HF in the SDH group, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and a low to low-normal DBP may have been accentuated the risk of HF in the ISH group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>It is possible that without the confounding association of low DBP with incident HF in ISH, the true risk of HF in ISH would be lower than that in SDH.</s></p><p><s>There are limited data in the literature on association of SDH with cardiovascular outcomes.</s><s>In one study, ISH was associated with a higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy than SDH. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>This is in contrast to our study where there was no significant difference in the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy between the two hypertension groups.</s><s>This is likely due to the fact that in the prior study ISH was defined as SBP ≥140 mm Hg and DBP &lt;90 mm Hg and these patients had a mean SBP that was 11 mm Hg higher than in the SDH group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>This study did not present data on associations with outcomes.</s><s>In another study, relatively younger Japanese rural patients (mean age, 65 years) with SDH (home SBP ≥137 and DBP ≥84 mm Hg) had higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of comparative associations of SDH and ISH with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in older Americans.</s></p><p><s>The clinical benefit of BP control in older adults with ISH is well established.</s><s>In the SHEP trial, in patients (mean age, 72 years) with ISH (SBP ≥160 and DBP &lt;90 mm Hg; mean SBP 171 and DBP 77 mm Hg), antihypertensive drugs significantly reduced the risk of incident HF and stroke, but not of cardiovascular death. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>In the HYVET trial, in patients (mean age, 84 years) with hypertension (SBP ≥160 mm Hg; mean SBP 173 and DBP 91 mm Hg), antihypertensive drugs significantly reduced the risk of stroke and cardiovascular death, but not of HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Because two thirds of HYVET participants had SDH (versus 12% among community-dwelling older CHS participants in the current analysis), these findings suggest clinical benefit of BP control in older adults with SDH.</s><s>However, because of the substantial overlap in cardiovascular risks between ISH and SDH observed in the current study, evidence from trials in ISH and SDH may be generalizable to SDH and ISH, respectively, and vice versa.</s><s>Findings from the SPRINT older subgroup trial that enrolled older patients (mean age, 80 years) with relatively milder hypertension (SBP ≥130 mm Hg; mean SBP 142 and DBP 72 mm Hg) also support clinical benefit of BP control in older adults with hypertension, regardless of either or both SBP and DBP are elevated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>veral limitations of our study need to be acknowledged.</s><s>As in any observational epidemiological study, bias due to residual confounding is possible.</s><s>It is also possible that the small number of patients with SDH may result in chance associations.</s><s>However, consistent associations across outcomes and lack of association with non-cardiovascular mortality point to biological plausibility.</s><s>As discussed above, regression dilution and potential underestimation of true associations is possible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s></p></div>
