combination of smoking and oral contraceptive use among young women with migraine with aura markedly increased the risk of ischemic stroke, reaching a 10-fold increase for current cigarette smokers and oral contraceptives users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>However, for overall vascular risk status, several studies indicate that the association between migraine and ischemic stroke is apparent only among those with a low cardiovascular risk profile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s> Multivariable models were adjusted for age (continuous), elevated cholesterol

of 60 (yes/no).</s></p><p><s>Studies on modifying effects of other cardiovascular disease events are sparse.</s><s>Findings of the Women's Health Study indicate that migraine with aura and an increased vascular risk profile resulted in a higher risk of incident myocardial infarction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>However, the event rate among women with migraine with aura

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potential biological mechanisms</head><p><s>Several mechanisms that have been implied for migraine have also been linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, such as increased thrombogenic susceptibility, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> shared genetic markers, <ref type="bibr">12 13</ref> and inflammation processes. <ref type="bibr">16 17</ref></s><s>Our findings confirm results of other studies that women with migraine have a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, higher body mass index, and hypercholesterolemia. <ref type="bibr">11 19</ref> However, as all studies evaluating the association between migraine and cardiovascular disease have controlled for these factors, the association between migraine and cardiovascular disease is unlikely to be explained by this.</s><s>Evidence suggests that the pathophysiology of migraine can also be viewed in part as a systemic disorder affecting the endovascular system. <ref type="bibr">9 35-39</ref></s><s>rengths and limitations of study Our study has several strengths, including the prospective design, large number of participants and outcome events, long follow-up, high participation rate, standardized evaluation of migraine and cardiovascular disease risk factors, confirmation of outcomes by physician's review, and the homogeneous nature of the cohort (all were nurses), which may reduce confounding by factors such as access to medical care.</s></p><p><s>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our results.</s><s>Firstly, physician diagnosed migraine status was self reported, leading to potential misclassification.</s><s>In addition, people with mild migraines may not have reported symptoms to a clinician and thus not received a diagnosis.</s><s>Because of the prospective design, however, such misclassification would probably result in underestimation of relative risks and would be unlikely to explain the observed association pattern.</s><s>Furthermore, a previous report in a comparable study of female health professionals showed that self reported migraine had good agreement with the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and our prevalence of migraine is close to that reported in other population based studies. <ref type="bibr">18 40 41</ref></s><s>Secondly, we had no information on the presence or absence of migraine aura, and migraine with aura has been suggested to be the subgroup carrying most of the risk of cardiovascular disease. <ref type="bibr">4 18</ref></s><s>Furthermore, no information on frequency of migraine or migraine specific information was available.</s><s>Thirdly, residual confounding-for example, by markers of inflammation or genetic factors <ref type="bibr">10 12 13</ref> remains a potential alternative explanation, as our data are observational.</s><s>Finally, participants in this study were all nurses aged 25 to 42 at baseline and mostly white, so generalizability to other populations might be limited.</s><s>However, we have no reason to believe that that the biological mechanisms by which migraine might be associated with vascular events and mortality would be different in other populations of women.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>implications of findings</head><p><s>9]<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> Although most studies link migraine with aura with increased risk of ischemic stroke, <ref type="bibr">4 28</ref> emerging evidence indicates that this risk extends to other cardiovascular disease as well.</s><s>Our data support consideration of a history of migraine as a marker for increased risk of any cardiovascular disease event.</s></p><p><s>To date, no clear mechanisms have been identified that could explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality among patients with migraine, and no data exist on whether prevention of migraine attacks reduces these risks.</s><s>Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and results of a randomized clinical trial provide initial evidence that the combination of a statin and vitamin D may reduce the burden of migraine, <ref type="bibr">42 43</ref> which may be explained by the anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs.</s><s>Future targeted research, such as on whether statins and vitamin D reduce the burden of migraine and cardiovascular disease, is urgently warranted to provide answers to patients and their treating physicians.</s></p></div>
