of B cells in tolerance needs further scrutiny, particularly regarding the immunosuppression effects.</s></p><p><s>While there is no clear major genetic pathway connecting the genes included in the new IS-independent signature, literature reports suggest that at least some of these genes have a mechanistic relevance to tolerance.</s><s>For example, a polymorphism in the NFjBIA gene resulting in upregulation has been associated with higher rates of acute liver transplant rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, and BCL2A1 has been shown to be a transcriptional target for NFjB <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s>In our study, both genes were downregulated in tolerant patients.</s><s>IGLC1 has been included in the expansion of the B cell signature of tolerance in KTRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</s><s>Upregulation of MS4A4A and RAB40C (upregulated in tolerant patients in our study) has been associated with macrophage activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>.</s><s>TNFAIP3 (A20) is an NFjB regulatory protein and its expression has been associated with outcome prediction in kidney transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, but the regulation of its expression and function in inflammatory responses has been shown to be complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>.</s><s>The association found herein of the downregulation of this gene with operational tolerance merits further investigation.</s></p><p><s>External validation of the presented signature in other independent cohorts would strengthen the confidence in the generalizability of the results and would allow final calibration before translation into clinical practice.</s><s>Such studies would require the collection of detailed clinical phenotype data in parallel to the gene expression data (best approached in a prospective manner).</s><s>We are part of two European consortia that will provide data for this further validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of assessing and correcting for the effect of diverse IS regimens on gene expression-based biomarker signatures.</s><s>Using this correction, we identify a novel-and, arguably, a more clinically robust-signature of operational tolerance, which we have validated in independent and extensive cohorts of KTRs.</s><s>Moreover, in our prospective validation cohort, the estimated probability of tolerance remained unchanged after steroid withdrawal, supporting the view that the new signature highlights natural counter-regulatory mechanisms and excludes transient alterations of the immune effector pathways by IS drugs.</s><s>Further evidence that our approach is uncovering tolerance-related responses is the fact that the estimated probability of tolerance in tolerant patients is higher than that of healthy controls, in agreement with studies demonstrating the involvement of an active immune response in tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We are aware that these results do bring into question previous published evidence, and we have demonstrated the effect of IS drugs on our own published signature.</s><s>Transplant physicians will require confidence in any novel clinical-grade biomarker set of kidney transplantation tolerance, such as the new one described in this article, prior to embarking on clinical trials of IS weaning or minimization.</s><s>Such trials are critical if we aim to reduce cancer risk and increase long-term survival with improved quality of life for KTRs.</s><s>In the current climate of stratified medicine, these findings may also be relevant to autoimmune diseases and other disorders in which IS is a prevalent drug therapy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 2: Effects of
