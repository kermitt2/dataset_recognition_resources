<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we assessed the effect of the anti-CD22 mAb epratuzumab on the production of specific cytokines upon BCR and combined BCR and TLR9 B cell stimulation in vitro.</s><s>As a key result, cytokines produced following BCR activation were TNF-α and IL-6, and both were substantially reduced upon epratuzumab exposure.</s><s>Interestingly, the secretion of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 in culture supernatants and intracellular IL-10 production were largely dependent on TLR9 activation by CpG in both HD and patients with SLE, and this production was not influenced by epratuzumab.</s><s>Of particular note, immunoregulatory cytokines appear to be less dependent on BCR activation, but they have been reported to be intimately involved in regulatory circuits of IL-10 and IL-35 production <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study confirms that B cells can be activated by different pathways, resulting in a distinct modulation of the production of certain cytokines.</s><s>All cytokines studied were produced at the highest level in the combined stimulation settings, but it was clear that IL-10 induction was independent of BCR activation.</s><s>Whereas enhanced IL-10 production by cis signaling of Siglec family members has been reported for DCs and macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the role of BCR and TLR9 activation on B cells from controls and patients has not been reported before.</s><s>Moreover, reports of the production of IL-10 by B cells stimulated with different stimuli have been controversial.</s><s>Several studies showed an inhibitory effect of anti-IgM stimulation on IL-10 production by B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, whereas other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, consistent with our study, showed a synergistic effect of anti-BCR or anti-BCR + CpG to produce IL-10.</s><s>A principal difference that may explain the different results between these studies is the different isotypes used to stimulate the BCR, such as IgM only; IgM and IgG; or IgM, IgG and IgA.</s><s>Given the inherent regulatory function of CD22 for BCR activation, the data we present also support the notion that epratuzumab has a striking effect on BCR-dependent cytokine production (IL-6 and TNF-α) but leaves the TLR9-dependent axis largely intact.</s><s>This regulatory dichotomy appears to be important to explain the distinct effects when targeting CD22 that is closely linked to downstream functions of BCR activation.</s></p><p><s>It should be emphasized that the influence of epratuzumab on IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10 production was comparable between SLE B cells and controls, but that the ratios of IL-10 to TNF-α and IL-10 to IL-6 were substantially different in SLE upon BCR-TLR9 stimulation.</s><s>Although a potential influence of non-B cells contributing to the in vitro cytokine production cannot be absolutely excluded, the mean B cell purity of 98.5 ± 2.2 % with only two samples with 8.2 % and 5.6 % non-B cells did not likely result in a substantial difference in the influence of the mAb against CD22, because this binding is very B cell-specific.</s><s>Moreover, F(ab′) 2 epratuzumab has been chosen to ensure that the observed effects can be attributed to a specific CD22 binding and to avoid potential Fc receptor effects, especially on monocytes, validated by FC using an F(ab′) 2 isotype control.</s><s>However, current studies in our laboratory address the comprehensive impact of intact epratuzumab on PBMC cultures, including indirect effects on T cells and monocytes.</s><s>Because we used negatively selected B cells to avoid any additional preactivation of B cells by other purification methods, we believe that the ratios reflect the situation in individual patients.</s><s>However, the influence of the mAb in treated patients needs to be fully explored.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Epratuzumab targets the BCR coreceptor CD22 and was found to substantially inhibit the in vitro production of proinflammatory IL-6 and TNF-α by B cells, likely related to their close dependence on BCR signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, IL-10 production, reportedly less dependent on BCR activation, was not substantially influenced by epratuzumab.</s><s>These data suggest that epratuzumab alters the balance between the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) and the regulatory cytokine IL-10 as another B cell effector mechanism.</s><s>The findings provide further evidence that epratuzumab can affect downstream BCR functions such as particular cytokines produced by B cells.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 2 Epratuzumab does not influence the generation of intracellular interleukin (IL)-10-positive B cells.</s><s>(a) Frequency of intracellular IL-10 + B cells after 2 days of peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture of representative healthy donors (HD) or patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, respectively, without stimulation (RPMI 1640 medium) or stimulated by anti-B cell receptor (anti-BCR) or anti-BCR + CpG using flow cytometry.</s><s>(b) Comparison of the frequency of IL-10-producing B cells from 6 patients with SLE and 10 HD without (open squares) and with F(ab′) 2 epratuzumab (gray squares) incubation in response to the indicated stimulations (Mann-Whitney U test)</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,127.28,96.27,340.76,301.78" type="bitmap" /></figure>
