Po1e À 4).</s><s>Variation in translation captured by Ribo-seq resulted in significantly different protein abundances across strains (whiskers indicate 5th and 95th percentiles).</s><s>RNA only genes have a lower (c) translational efficiency and a significantly increased (d) 3 0 UTR length compared with RIBO only and RNA þ RIBO genes (mean with 95% confidence interval).</s></p><p><s>translation to protein levels.</s><s>Each step of biological information processing introduces a new set of specific regulatory changes (for example, post-transcriptional or -translational) that affect the abundance of a gene product.</s><s>However, consequences of events that occur in later stages are not expected to be evident in preceding stages.</s><s>In particular, translation levels reflect both transcriptional and translational regulation events, whereas transcript levels only reflect transcriptional-and not translational-regulation events.</s><s>Therefore, when comparing RNA levels and protein levels conditioning on the translation levels, we would expect no additional information about the protein levels to be present in the RNA and thus they should be conditionally independent.</s><s>On the other hand, when comparing translation levels and protein levels conditioning on the RNA levels, we would still expect dependences between translation levels and protein levels due to translational regulation events.</s><s>We first tested the conditional independence between RNA and protein levels, given the Ribo-seq data using partial correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> .</s><s>In both strains the partial correlation was not significantly different from zero (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Second, for each strain we found highly significant partial correlations between Ribo-seq data and protein levels when we conditioned on RNA transcript levels (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>This corroborated previous observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> that ribosome footprint abundances correlated better with genome-wide protein levels than RNA-seq data, and indicated that Ribo-seq provides a better proxy for protein levels than RNA-seq in our data (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Transcript levels provided no additional information to explain protein expression.</s><s>Strain-specific regulation of translation (RIBO only ), not detected by RNA expression profiling, was found to account for significant differences in protein abundances across strains (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney; Po1e À 4).</s><s>Ribo-seq data effectively revealed additional variation in gene usage that explains protein levels (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>For 25% of differentially transcribed genes across both tissues, we did not detect strain-specific differences in RPF abundances.</s><s>This can in part be explained by translational buffering of RNA expression differences for these RNA only genes (likelihood ratio test; slope heart ¼ 0.66; slope liver ¼ 0.8; Po2.2e À 16), reducing the inter-strain variation in gene expression.</s><s>In addition, RNA only genes were translated at a low efficiency (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>), resulting in fewer ribosome footprints per transcript.</s><s>Translational efficiency (TE) is defined as the number of RPFs compared with RNA-seq reads covering the coding sequence (CDS) of genes (see Methods).</s><s>Low TE effectively reduced the power to detect differences using Ribo-seq compared with RNA-seq.</s><s>Thus, these genes cannot be as effectively quantified during and after translation, which may result in an overestimation of buffering events.</s><s>RNA only genes possess significantly longer 3 0 untranslated regions (UTRs) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test; Genes with differential RNA expression (forwarded: black bar; buffered: blue bar) between the parental strains were enriched for eQTLs.</s><s>As expected, genes regulated on the translational level only (red bar) were not significantly enriched for eQTLs (for details see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>The majority of RNA expression differences were forwarded to the translational level and detected in both RNA-seq and Ribo-seq experiments.</s><s>This percentage increased when RNA expression differences were under genetic control.</s><s>(c) SNP density in the regulatory regions of RNA only (blue bar) and RIBO only (red bar) genes compared with genes without RNA or RPF strain-specific differences (grey bar).</s><s>SNP density was significantly higher in the 3 0 UTR of translationally regulated genes (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney).
