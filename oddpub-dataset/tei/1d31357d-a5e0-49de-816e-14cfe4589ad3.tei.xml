<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In an analysis of administrative data on file from a large cohort of surgical patients undergoing intraoperative mechanical ventilation for non-cardiothoracic surgery, we found that high median intraoperative FI O2 was significantly associated with a composite outcome of major postoperative respiratory complications.</s><s>High FI O2 was also associated with increased risk of 30day mortality.</s><s>Our analyses controlled for a predefined set of confounding variables and were robust across a series of sensitivity analyses including markers of surgical complexity, comorbidities, pulmonary function, intraoperative oxygenation, and duration of exposure.</s></p><p><s>The analyses in this study were made on basis of a large data set that reflects routine clinical practice.</s><s>Data were retrieved from accurate and prospective recording of intraoperative management and postoperative complications.</s><s>Before initiating data analysis, we finalized the protocol, including definitions of risk factors and outcomes, and registered the study at ClinicalTrials.gov.</s><s>The observational design allowed us to collect a large number of events, which provided the analysis with sufficient power to detect differences in relatively infrequent complications.</s><s>A specific strength relates to the availability of arterial blood gas analyses, which allowed us to discriminate between supranormal arterial oxygen tension (hyperoxygenation) and adequate treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure.</s><s>However, some important limitations must be mentioned.</s><s>First, we adjusted for a large number of different risk factors and performed several sensitivity analyses, including propensity scoring, in order to reduce the risk of confounding.</s><s>Optimally, our results should be confirmed in a future randomized controlled trial.</s><s>However, because of the low event rate of clinically meaningful respiratory complications in patients undergoing surgery, and multiple risk factors (co-morbidities and procedure-related factors), a randomized controlled trial would need to be conducted in several thousand patients.</s></p><p><s>Residual and unmeasurable confounding cannot be eliminated.</s><s>For example, we are not able to know why the anaesthesia provider decided to use the oxygen fraction recorded.</s><s>Our oxygenation data clearly exclude the possibility that the association between FI O2 and respiratory complications is attributable to baseline hypoxia.</s><s>Rather, many anaesthetists apparently hyperoxygenate their patients, and a likely explanation for our finding is that the value of FI O2 was selected based on personal preference of the anaesthesia provider.</s><s>Our institution has no standard operating procedure for intraoperative FI O2 value.</s><s>One could argue that the anaesthesia provider is a confounding variable of the association between FI O2 and respiratory complications.</s><s>Therefore, we accounted for clustering of patients by provider.</s><s>We found that the association between the FI O2 and the risk of respiratory complications remained unchanged from the primary analysis.</s><s>Data on postoperative management that could have influenced the occurrence of respiratory outcomes were not available.</s><s>However, it is unlikely that those are directly related to intraoperative FI O2 values and their association with respiratory complication rates.</s><s>The median FI O2 throughout the procedure might not adequately represent the burden of a high oxygen concentration.</s><s>Therefore, in additional exploratory analyses we included the FI O2 measured during distinct parts of the surgical procedure to evaluate whether the observed effect of median FI O2 in occurrence of respiratory complications was affected.</s><s>We observed that the FI O2 measured immediately after intubation and before extubation, or the range of FI O2 used during the procedure, did not explain any variance of postoperative respiratory complications.</s><s>In addition, adding these variables to the primary regression model did not change the association between median FI O2 and respiratory complications (see Supplementary material Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>We did not include information on FI O2 values before intubation because the accuracy of this variable will depend on multiple factors.</s></p><p><s>Residual neuromuscular block is associated with respiratory complications.</s><s>In our study, we controlled for neuromuscular blocking agent dose and neostigmine dose and for the last TOF count documented before extubation as a potential indicator of postoperative residual neuromuscular block.</s><s>Furthermore, we extended the analysis and included additional confounders (epidural analgesia, driving pressure, duration of hypotension, and ventilation mode) in an exploratory analysis.</s><s>This did not change the primary results (Supplementary material, Results section).</s><s>The partial correlation coefficients between FI O2 and respiratory complications were small, but we did not expect to see a close correlation between FI O2 and respiratory complication rate because only a fraction of the occurrence of postoperative respiratory complications can be explained by oxygen toxicity.</s></p><p><s>There is substantial controversy among clinicians on the appropriate FI O2 settings to be used during intraoperative mechanical ventilation.</s><s>This is because proposed advantageous effects of hyperoxia, such as reduction of surgical wound infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> and increased time for desaturation, could be offset by deleterious effects, such as the increase in atelectasis, <ref type="bibr"

an effect of FI O2 despite the observation of specific physiological effects in both high and low FI O2 groups.</s><s>Several mechanisms might contribute to an oxygen-related lung injury.</s><s>High alveolar oxygen concentration leads to faster collapse of small lung units as a result of absorption of oxygenrich gas into the blood from closed off alveoli or alveoli with very low ventilation/perfusion ratios. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref></s><s>The resulting atelectasis leads to intrapulmonary shunt and impaired oxygenation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref></s><s>The amount of atelectasis depends on the oxygen concentration and the duration of high oxygen administration. <ref type="bibr">25 26</ref></s><s>Atelectasis is likely to

28</ref></s><s>nother plausible mechanism behind the oxygen-related lung injury is hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s>Hyperoxia and inflammation

32</s><s>Hyperoxia may thus be hypothesized to increase the risk of myocardial infarction after surgery. <ref type="bibr">33</ref></s><s>Finally, in a study of patients admitted to the ICU after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, arterial hyperoxia was independently associated with increased inhospital mortality. <ref type="bibr">34</ref></s><s>However, we found no significant association between high FI O2 and cardiac or cerebral morbidity.</s><s>This may be a result of lack of power to detect these outcomes in our study.</s></p><p><s>We did find a significant dose-response association between administrated oxygen and 30-day mortality.</s><s>Increased longterm mortality has also been reported in patients randomized to a high FI O2 during abdominal surgery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref></s><s>It is possible that the increased risk of mortality associated with increased FI O2 in our study is related to an impairment of cardiac function.</s><s>Moreover, it is possible that our finding of increased occurrence of pulmonary oedema with hyperoxia may be explained in part by cardiogenic pulmonary oedema secondary to myocardial

in critically ill patients in the operating room or the ICU, Pa O2 may be kept well above the normal range in order to prevent hypoxia and because this is considered as to be without associated

material).</s><s>This observation, together with that of a dose-response relationship between median FI O2 and respiratory complications, supports the hypothesis that increases in FI O2 in our studied patients were not merely targeting the maintenance of a specific value of normal blood oxygenation.</s><s>Instead, they produced supraphysiological conditions, which could have resulted in the observed complications through the mechanisms discussed above.</s><s>The contribution of supraphysiological oxygenation could have been either as an independent factor or as a factor synergistic with
