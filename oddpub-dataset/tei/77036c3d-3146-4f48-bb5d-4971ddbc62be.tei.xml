<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Decision making is an integral part of everyday life.</s><s>People have to make choices within diverse decision-making environments.</s><s>It has been found that taking a break benefits cognitive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, possibly by providing a favorable condition for offline replay by minimizing the incoming interference information <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>However, the effects of taking a break during the decision-making process remain to date to be explored.</s></p><p><s>Decision making is influenced by two systems: the habitual and the goal-directed system.</s><s>These two systems can also be described computationally as model-free versus model-based, or by the terms retrospective versus prospective <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>We recently observed significant correlations between goal-directed and model-based decision making, supporting the notion that these concepts address similar behavioral decision-making systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>When we rely on the habitual (model-free) system, we simply repeat the actions that lead to a gain in the past.</s><s>When using the goal-directed (model-based) system, choices are guided by the likelihood of affective outcomes that are predicted by a model of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Computational models have described habitual behavior as depending on model-free retrospective reinforcement, and goaldirected behavior to rely on model-based prospective planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Adaptive behavior depends on the ability to flexibly regulate the respective contributions of the habitual and goaldirected systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A number of factors have been discovered to interact with and shape these two systems, with cognitive abilities such as working memory found to be one of the core factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, dual-task conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, electromagnetic stimulation (TMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortext (dlPFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, as well as acute <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or chronic <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> stress are thought to impair executive resources underlying working memory and were found to impair goaldirected decision-making, inducing a relative shift towards habitual behavioral control.</s><s>Experimental manipulations are often found to interact with baseline working memory capacity, such that (a) goal-directed reasoning is particularly impaired in individuals with a rather limited working memory capacity, and (b) individual differences in baseline working memory capacity predict reliance on goal-directed decision-making under conditions where working memory is impaired <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Other cognitive abilities are also found to moderate the balance between goal-directed versus habitual choice systems.</s><s>Importantly, goal-directed control increases with higher levels of processing speed, particularly in individuals with a large working memory capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, an inverted U-shaped curve was found for the effect of processing speed on habitual choice, indicating that habitual choice is strongest at medium levels of processing speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Likewise, executive resources and verbal knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> seem to play important roles in reward-based decision making.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that other potential factors, such as different activities during a break, might shape the balance between habitual and goal-directed decision-making systems.</s><s>We chose two common break activities: listening to music and playing a video game.</s><s>Music can act as a catalyst for cognitive abilities: it has been demonstrated that musical education can enhance working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>Rauscher found that listening to a Mozart sonata increases subsequent spatial reasoning ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>However, the effect may rather depend upon mood, arousal, or enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and little is known about the specific aspects of music that contribute to the transfer effects on learning.</s></p><p><s>Playing video games can result in a wide range of behavioral benefits, including enhancement of task performance, spatial cognition, processing speed, task switching and level of reasoning in decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>At the same time, video games have been associated with a variety of negative outcomes.</s><s>For example, the sound of a video game could disturb the players' concentration on learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> and induce physiological stress while gaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>So far, research has rarely explored the effects of video games interleaved with different types of learning, though a few studies have already found an effect on memory performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, we <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> found that playing video games reduces subsequent working memory performance over time, likely because gaming during breaks prevents recovery of depleted executive resources, eliciting failures in sustained attention and increasing "mind wandering".</s></p><p><s>To date, effects of different break activities on a decision-making task have not been investigated.</s><s>Given their known influence on working memory, we predicted that the type of activity engaged in during breaks might significantly affect decision-making systems and shape subsequent performance.</s><s>Specifically, we assumed that listening to music might enhance goaldirected decision making.</s><s>Based on our previous finding that video gaming impairs working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, we expected gaming to reduce goal-directed decision making.</s><s>Moreover, we aimed to explore whether this effect is particularly prominent in individuals with a low working memory capacity, suggesting an influence of baseline working memory capacity on individual differences in goal-directed control.</s><s>We used a within-subjects design to have subjects perform a sequential two-step Markov decision task <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, which involves decision preferences that change on a trial-by-trial basis to access these two decision-making systems.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods Subjects</head><p><s>Thirty three right-handed healthy native German subjects (17 female; age range: 19-32, Mean = 24.6,</s><s>SD = 3.5) were recruited in Berlin.</s><s>Subjects were screened for major psychiatric disorders (SCID-I screening questionnaire).</s><s>Basic information was gathered: social and demographical data, music listening habits (time spent on listening to music per week in the past 12 months, types of music listened to) and video gaming experience (time spent on playing games per week in the past 12 months, types of games played).</s><s>Subjects were given detailed information and provided fully informed written consent.</s><s>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>The target sample size was estimated on the basis of our previous study on cognitive abilities in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>No subjects' data was excluded from analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuropsychological battery</head><p><s>Subjects underwent neuropsychological testing including verbal knowledge [28], fluid intelligence cognitive speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> and memory and executive functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Backwards Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>; One-minute Semantic Verbal Fluency (SVF) was tested for the category "animals"</s></p><p><s>(Verbale Flüssigkeit Tiere <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>); Executive Functioning was assessed by the Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0150165.t001</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Break activity scenarios</head><p><s>To evaluate the effects of different break activities on the habitual and goal-directed decisionmaking systems, subjects were instructed to engage three times (i.e.</s><s>once before and twice during the main task) in "listening to music" or "playing a video game", for 8:30 min per break.</s></p><p><s>For the "listening to music" condition, subjects were instructed to listen to Mozarts "Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major, KV. 448-Allegro con spirito" over headphones; for the "playing a video game" condition, subjects were instructed to play the "Angry Birds" video game (www.</s><s>angrybirds.com) on a laptop computer.</s><s>We chose Mozarts Sonata piece because it has been a major musical piece in empirical investigations of the effects of music on cognitive functions and has been used in a large range of studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33]</ref>.</s><s>We chose the popular mobile game Angry Birds game because playing Angry Birds utilizes concepts of qualitative spatial representation, utility function and decision making under uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p><s>The sequential two-step Markov decision task drew on on Wunderlich, Smittenaar, &amp; Dolan <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to assess the relative degree of habitual vs. goal-directed decision making when this decision making is preceded and interrupted by breaks of either listening to music or playing a video game.</s><s>The version of the task was identical to on Wunderlich, Smittenaar, &amp; Dolan <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> except for different stimulus images (see <ref type="bibr">Fig 1)</ref>.</s><s>The task consisted of two subsequent steps, each demanding a choice between two stimuli.</s><s>During the first step (step 1), two stimuli were presented and subjects were requested to choose one.</s><s>This choice probabilistically determined (i.e. a common (70%) or a rare (30%) transition) which pair of stimuli was presented at the second step.</s><s>During the second step (step 2), subjects were presented with another pair of stimuli and again requested to choose one.</s><s>This second choice was either rewarded with money (20 cents) or nothing.</s><s>The reward signal during the task was the amount of 20 cents for each trial.</s></p><p><s>To enhance subjects' motivation, subjects were also advised that the top three performers could also expect to be rewarded with an unspecified, but worthy and pleasant surprise at the end of the experiment.</s><s>The surprise was valuable gift boxes of chocolates.</s></p><p><s>Prior to the experiment, subjects were given very detailed information about the structure of the task; they were informed that the reward probabilities in step 2 would change (and were shown exemplary sample random walks), but those controlling the transitions from step 1 to step 2 would remain fixed and be primarily associated with one or the other of the second-step states.</s></p><p><s>Subjects underwent 50 practice trials with a separate set of stimuli before starting the main task.</s><s>Immediately after practice, subjects engaged in an 8:30 min break of either gaming or listening to music.</s><s>Subsequently, they started the main task, which consisted of 201 trials with two breaks (of listening to music or video gaming) after trial 67 and 134.</s><s>A repeated measures design with within-subjects factors of two break activities (music vs. gaming) and two versions of two-step task was applied and the order was counterbalanced across subjects.</s></p><p><s>Immediately after every task performance, we asked subjects to rate the task difficulty and their ability to concentrate on the task, as well as their enjoyment of the break activity and the extent to which they thought about the task during the break by using visual analogue scales (VAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p><s>We used the stats package for data analysis and ggplot2 package (Wickham, Springer New York, USA) for graphics in the R system for statistical computing (version 3.1.0;</s><s>www.r-project.</s><s>org).</s></p><p><s>Statistical tests of the VAS questionnaires were performed using SPSS Statistics Version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</s><s>Differences were considered significant at p &lt; .05 and highly significant at p &lt; .001.</s><s>We used paired t-test for pairwise comparisons of the respective game and music conditions (two-tailed p values were assumed).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We studied how habitual and goal-directed decision-making systems are affected by different break activities (i.e., listening to music and playing a video game).</s><s>We found that gaming  reduced reliance on the goal-directed system in individuals with a rather low working memory capacity, while leaving the habitual system intact.</s><s>These results were consistent with our expectation that playing video games during break periods may impair working memory resources and thus interfere with goal-directed planing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gaming reduced goal-directed decision making in low working memory individuals</head><p><s>We recently observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that video gaming compared to listening to music reduced working memory performance in the n-back task over time.</s><s>In line with these previous findings, we have found that gaming reduces reliance on the goal-directed decision system in low workingmemory individuals, suggesting that gaming may interfer with working memory resources needed for goal-directed planning.</s><s>This finding is congruent with previous research showing that taxing executive resources can impair goal-directed choice particularly in individuals with low baseline working memory capacity, but often has little effect in high working-memory individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>Gaming may thus have rather subtle interfering effects on executive functioning: during decision-making, individuals with high levels of executive resources appear to be able to compensate for these effects and maintain high levels of goal-directed control.</s><s>Individuals whose executive resources are limited, however, may not be able to guard against such negative influences and impaired executive resources may induce a decline in goal-directed planning.</s></p><p><s>A recent computational proposal <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> frames the arbitration between habitual vs. goaldirected decision making as a tradeoff between time cost and behavioral flexibility, both of which are high in goal-directed and low in habitual decision making.</s><s>Gaming might create internal time pressure and heavily tax attention which may lead low-working memory subjects to reduce cognitive and time costs by immediately scaling down goal-directed choice and elevating habitual choice at the initial step.</s></p><p><s>How may such an influence of gaming on working memory processes in goal-directed control be moderated by additional factors?</s><s>Interestingly, in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the decremental influence of gaming on working memory was associated with mind wandering and impaired concentration, suggesting that these factors may contribute to the present findings.</s><s>As an additional possible explanation, gaming may induce stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which could in turn decrease cognitive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The sound of a video game could disturb the players' concentration on learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> and induce physiological stress while gaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Such stress may tax cognitive resources and consequently inhibit more sophisticated ways of goal-directed decision making but spare more parsimonious habitual decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43]</ref>.</s><s>Thus subjects might not integrate the information of each step into a cohesive model in order to optimize choice selections.</s><s>An interference of stress with prefrontal-dependent functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> may thus contribute to the negative effects on goal-directed choice.</s></p><p><s>Recent work suggests that goal-directed processes impose considerable demands on central executive resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, which rely on the prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>.</s><s>These central executive resources including processing speed and working memory capacity may interact to moderate the tradeoffs between habitual and goal-directed systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and may thus provide particular vulnerabilities to interference with executive functions.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>We examined whether typical everyday activities that people engage in during a break (i.e.</s><s>listening to music and playing a video game) interact with decision making.</s><s>We did not find support for our hypothesis that gaming reduces overall goal-directed decision-making.</s><s>However, we found that break effects depended on baseline working memory: in individuals with a rather low working memory capacity video gaming induced a relative shift from goal-directed to habitual decision making as compared to listening to (Mozart's) music.</s><s>A rather high working memory capacity, on the other hand, prevented such a decline in goal-directed control, suggesting that (as compared to music) gaming may prevent recovery of executive resources during breaks, leading to a decline in resources available for goal-directed planning.</s><s>Understanding learning mechanisms during break activities may help to develop better procedures for rest and recuperation and help guide further research into the effects of video gaming on young adults, specifically breaks in between learning sessions.</s><s>Also, our research can help to develop recommendations for parents, who have to decide whether they should ban their kids from playing video games during learning or whether they can tolerate or even encourage them to play.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
