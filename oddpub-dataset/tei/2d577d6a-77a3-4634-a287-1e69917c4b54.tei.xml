<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this prospective cohort study on periodontal disease and incident VTE, we found that selfreported tooth loss due to gum disease may be associated with 30% higher VTE risk than no tooth loss due to gum disease, and this association remained significant or borderline significant after adjustment for confounding variables.</s><s>Associations between CDC/AAP and PPC clinical periodontal disease classifications and VTE as well as continuous measures of periodontal disease and VTE were not statistically significant in adjusted models.</s></p><p><s>Our results differ from the previous study evaluating periodontal disease and VTE.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sanchez-Siles et al., 2013)</ref> In that study, Sanchez-Siles et al. found that periodontitis was more prevalent among 97 VTE patients than in the 100 healthy controls (OR = 3.33 (95% CI 1.83, 6.06)).</s><s>The case-control study design which is unable to verify temporality between the exposure and the outcome and the lack of adjustment for relevant confounding may make these results prone to bias.</s><s>The discordant findings suggests that further research on the association between periodontal disease and VTE is needed.</s></p><p><s>The discrepancy between our self-reported periodontal disease and clinical periodontal disease results is worth exploring.</s><s>Self-reported tooth loss due to gum disease may indicate more severe periodontal disease over a longer period of time compared to the clinical disease classifications which were categorized based on measures taken at a single point in time.</s><s>If periodontal disease is in fact a risk factor for VTE, the potential greater lifetime duration and severity of periodontal disease among those who reported tooth loss may explain why a stronger result was found for self-reported periodontal disease compared to one-time clinical characterizations in those who still have natural teeth.</s></p><p><s>Our study has a number of strengths, including a large sample size from a community cohort with lengthy follow-up and rigorous methodology to adjudicate VTE events.</s><s>It also has limitations.</s><s>Since we are assessing exposure at only a single time point, our study could suffer from measurement error since a participant's periodontal disease status could change after baseline assessment.</s><s>Changes in periodontal disease status after baseline could not be accounted for and could create misclassification of our exposure.</s><s>This potential time lag between exposure and the outcome of interest would most likely lead to non-differential misclassification which could bias our results towards the null and may explain the absence of significant findings.</s><s>Further, there could be measurement error associated with selfreported tooth loss due to gum disease.</s><s>Social and behavioral risk factors may be a common causes of both tooth loss and VTE.</s><s>We attempted to isolate the impact of self-reported tooth loss due to gum disease on VTE risk by including relevant SES and access to dental care variables in our adjusted models but residual confounding may persist and may explain the association between self-reported periodontal disease and VTE.</s><s>In addition, those who had all teeth removed would have been counted in the periodontitis group, even though tooth removal should have removed their oral inflammatory burden that was hypothesized to be the mechanism between periodontitis and VTE.</s><s>The vast majority of VTE events were symptomatic events captured via hospital records.</s><s>Although we did not capture VTEs treated in an outpatient setting, pilot studies have indicated that the aging ARIC cohort had few outpatient VTEs through 2011.</s><s>VTE results from a combination of predisposing factors (genetic predisposition, increased coagulability with aging, obesity, etc.) as well as precipitating factors (recent trauma, immobilization, surgery, cancer, etc).</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rosendaal, 1999)</ref> Chronic periodontal disease or other chronic inflammation, generally, would be hypothesized to be a predisposing factor for VTE.</s><s>This study was unable to incorporate precipitating factors for VTE and other unmeasured confounders in the analysis, which could have led to biased HRs.</s></p><p><s>Traditional risk factors for atherosclerotic CVD (e.g., smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes) are generally considered weak risk factors for VTE.</s><s>However, systemic inflammation is believed to predispose to both atherosclerotic CVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ridker, Hennekens, Buring, &amp; Rifai, 2000)</ref> and VTE.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Folsom et al., 2009)</ref> While studies investigating the periodontal disease treatment as a primary prevention strategy of CVD are lacking, a number of studies have investigated the impact of periodontal treatment on atherosclerotic CVD risk factors.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Li et al., 2014)</ref> Most relevant to VTE, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials investigating the impact of periodontal treatment on CVD risk factors found that periodontal treatment was effective at reducing systemic inflammatory marker levels in subjects with periodontitis.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Teeuw et al., 2014)</ref> Further research is needed to determine if periodontal treatment reduces VTE risk.</s></p></div>
