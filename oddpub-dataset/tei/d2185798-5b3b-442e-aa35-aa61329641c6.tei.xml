<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Altered synaptic bioactive lipid signaling has been recently shown to augment neuronal excitation in the hippocampus of adult animals by activation of presynaptic LPA 2 -receptors leading to increased presynaptic glutamate release.</s><s>Here, we show that this results in higher postsynaptic Ca 2+ levels and in premature onset of spontaneous neuronal activity in the developing entorhinal cortex.</s><s>Interestingly, increased synchronized neuronal activity led to reduced axon growth velocity of entorhinal neurons which project via the perforant path to the hippocampus.</s><s>This was due to Ca 2+ -dependent molecular signaling to the axon affecting stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton.</s><s>The spontaneous activity affected the entire entorhinal cortical network and thus led to reduced overall axon fiber numbers in the mature perforant path that is known to be important for specific memory functions.</s><s>Our data show that precise regulation of early cortical activity by bioactive lipids is of critical importance for proper circuit formation.</s></p></div>
