<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PATIENTS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>Out of 1080 isolated and combined heart valve procedures performed at the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at Charité Campus Mitte between January 2010 and December 2012, 41 patients underwent surgery for PVE.</s><s>Economic data could be obtained from the Institute for the Hospital Remuneration System (InEK GmbH, Siegburg, Germany) for 30 of them, representing the study cohort.</s><s>Retrospective individual assignation of costs failed in 11 patients.</s><s>There was no evidence for differences of these patients from the study cohort regarding age, EuroSCORE II, 30-day mortality, 30-day morbidity and hospital stay.</s><s>The patient's mean age was 64 ± 12 years (range 37-79 years), and 73% were men.</s><s>With approval from our institutional Ethics Committee (EA1/ 032/13), we performed a retrospective review of their clinical course and analysed morbidity, mortality and costs as well as interrelated factors.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions</head><p><s>Diagnosis of PVE was based on clinical findings (fever, inflammatory syndromes), laboratory testing (blood cultures, leucocytosis, levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin), results of transthoracic/transoesophageal echocardiography and intraoperative findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>According to Guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), PVE occurring within 1 year of primary valve surgery was classified as early and beyond 1 year as late <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Culture-negative endocarditis was present when no micro-organism could be identified, neither in serial blood cultures, nor in cultures from the explanted material despite the clinical presence of characteristic signs for IE as vegetations, periprosthetic destruction or pus.</s><s>For assessment of perioperative risk, logistic EuroSCORE II was calculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>PVE predispositions were classified following the criteria proposed by Grinda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Endocarditis was considered locally uncontrolled, when the infectious pathology extended beyond the prosthetic valve (i.e.</s><s>paravalvular dehiscence, destruction and/or purulent deformation of adjacent tissue, periprosthetic abscesses and fistulas into a cardiac chamber or the pericardium).</s><s>Concomitant procedures were all surgical procedures performed to correct associated cardiac diseases.</s><s>Operations were classified as emergency if surgery was performed within 48 h and urgent if performed within 5 days after definite diagnosis, clearly indicating surgical treatment.</s><s>All other procedures were classified as elective.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgery and postoperative treatment</head><p><s>All operations were performed through a median sternotomy, using an oscillating saw.</s><s>Cardiopulmonary bypass, installed via cannulation of the distal ascending aorta, the aortic arch or femoral artery and the right atrium or femoral vein, was used with systemic normothermia or mild hypothermia (32°C) if a patent mammary artery bypass was present.</s><s>Myocardial protection was achieved with intermittent antegrade blood cardioplegia.</s><s>Previously implanted prostheses were removed in total and abscesses and fistulas were thoroughly debrided.</s><s>The remaining tissue was disinfected using povidoneiodine solution.</s><s>In the presence of large abscess cavities, fistulas or tissue defects, a pericardial (autologous, bovine or equine) patch repair was performed.</s><s>The choice for the new prosthesis was at the discretion of the surgeon.</s><s>Concomitant procedures, if needed, were performed according to standard techniques.</s><s>Infected intravascular catheters were removed before surgery.</s></p><p><s>All patients underwent intravenous antibiotic/antimycotic treatment for at least 6 weeks postoperatively.</s><s>Antibiotic regimen was directed by microbiological findings and based on guidelines (ESC Guidelines).</s><s>In the case of culture-negative PVE, an empirical, broad range, antibiotic treatment, usually consisting of vancomycin, rifampicin and gentamycin, was initiated.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p><s>Any death and postoperative complication occurring within 30 days after surgery (30-day mortality and 30-day morbidity) were regarded as early outcome.</s><s>Long-term outcomes were assessed by death, recurrent endocarditis and reoperation occurring after 30 days.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hospital costs</head><p><s>Cost matrix for each individual patient was obtained from the Institute for the Hospital Remuneration System (InEK GmbH).</s><s>Since the Charité is one of the hospitals providing source data to InEK, real costs of each individual case were available.</s><s>Moreover, a breakdown of overall hospital costs into costs of intensive care unit (ICU) or intermediate care (IMC) ward, general ward, operation, anaesthesia, dialysis, laboratory, diagnostics and miscellaneous costs was obtained as well.</s><s>Time-related costs, in particular daily hospital costs, daily ICU/IMC costs and operation costs per minute, were calculated in relation to the corresponding time span.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Follow-up</head><p><s>Follow-up was obtained by registry office data, mail questionnaire and/or telephone interview.</s><s>Complications were confirmed by contact with the patient's cardiologist or family physician.</s><s>In case of rehospitalizations, copies of the medical reports were used.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Categorical variables are reported as absolute and relative frequencies.</s><s>For continuous data, means and standard deviations and/or medians with the lower and upper quartile and interquartile ranges were calculated, respectively.</s><s>Boxplots were used for visualization of data distribution where appropriate.</s><s>The significance of the association between categorical data was examined by Fisher's exact test.</s><s>Continuous variables were compared between two groups using the Mann-Whitney U-test.</s><s>Correlation between continuous variables was tested according to Pearson's sample correlation statistic.</s><s>Scatterplots were used to depict the relation between continuous variables.</s><s>Survival was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.</s><s>A P-value &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</s><s>All the statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mortality and morbidity</head><p><s>Within 30 days after surgery, 5 patients died (a 30-day mortality rate of 17%).</s><s>Causes of death are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</s><s>During followup (median 2.6 years, lower quartile 0.2 years, upper quartile 3.9 years, 100% complete), 3 patients died (1 candida sepsis, 1 sudden death, 1 unknown), 1 of them (candida sepsis) during the same hospitalization (an in-hospital mortality rate of 20%).</s><s>The overall survival rate was 71 ± 9% at 1 year and unchanged thereafter.</s><s>In total, 21 patients experienced at least one disease-or surgery-related complication, resulting in an early morbidity rate of 70% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>More than one morbidity-defining event occurred in 12 patients (40%).</s><s>During follow-up, there was neither a recurrence of endocarditis, nor was a reoperation required.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Costs</head><p><s>Although the mean total hospital costs for surgical treatment of PVE were 42.6 ± 37.4 Thousand Euro (T€)-median 25.7 T€, lower quartile 19.9 T€, upper quartile 48.3 T€-costs exceed by 48 and 100 T€ in 25% (upper quartile) and 10% of cases, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>With 40.4 ± 18.6%, intensive care medicine (ICU/IMC) occupies the leading proportion of hospital expenses, followed by costs of operation.</s><s>However, the standard deviation reflects considerable interindividual variability.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, there was a strong correlation between total costs and duration of hospital stay and between ICU/IMC costs and duration of ICU/IMC stay.</s><s>Costs of operation and duration of operation were weakly correlated.</s><s>Despite the linear relationship, also time-related costs showed marked variance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The median total costs per day of hospital stay and median ICU/IMC costs per day of ICU/IMC stay were 1.8 and 1.0 T€/day, respectively, whereas 25% of cases (upper quartile) cost more than 2.4 T€/day (total) and 1.6 T€/day (ICU/IMC).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMMENT</head><p><s>In Germany, payment to hospitals is based on the system of diagnosis-related groups (DRG), which is a cornerstone of the healthcare system, which refers mainly to the principle that healthcare is funded by a statutory contribution system.</s><s>The DRG system implies that hospitals are paid the same for the same 'type' of patient.</s><s>By entering the respective hospital data annually, the German DRG system is a continuously revised and self-adjusting system.</s><s>Although it permanently puts pressure on hospitals to perform procedures quickly and at minimal costs, it accounts for changes in real costs ( personnel costs, costs of new technology, …) and allows their scientific investigation.</s></p><p><s>Surgery for PVE is associated not only with relevant mortality and morbidity, but also with significant costs.</s><s>This study shows that average total hospital cost for surgical treatment of PVE was 42.6 T€ per case, but total costs exceeded 100 T€ in 10% of cases.</s><s>However, it has to be considered that overall costs of PVE are higher, as patients usually need further hospital care before as well as after hospitalization for surgical treatment.</s><s>Accordingly, it was estimated that the cost for PVE is 72 T€ per case in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>As reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and confirmed herein, the paramount costs result from treatment at the ICU and/or the IMC ward amounting to around 40% of total costs.</s><s>They could even be higher as costs for laboratory tests, dialysis, diagnostics and blood products frequently arise during the ICU/IMC stay.</s><s>By comparison, 26% of costs account for the operation per se.</s></p><p><s>Preoperative morbidity has an established role for postoperative outcomes after surgery for PVE.</s><s>Besides high EuroSCORE II, critical state, problematic pathogens, recurrent embolism and congestive heart failure being associated with early morbidity and/or mortality in this study, also age, staphylococcal infection, early PVE, complicated PVE, renal failure, etc. have been shown to increase early mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Demonstrating that costs of surgical treatment for PVE are significantly associated with preoperative factors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>), this study pointed out a further role of preoperative morbidity.</s><s>It is important to understand that morbidity, mortality and costs are not necessarily associated with the endocarditis of the prosthetic valve per se, but with preoperative comorbidity resulting from PVE (typically occurring in the circumstances of late diagnosis) or concomitant diseases.</s><s>Regarding this relation, indirect effects of preoperative factors acting on costs via increased postoperative morbidity and mortality have to be considered as well (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4  and 5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>With respect to postoperative mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stay, we could recently demonstrate that one-fourth to one-third of patients undergoing surgical treatment for PVE require increased hospital resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Regarding real costs, a strong linear relation between length of hospital stay and total hospital costs and in particular between length of ICU/IMC stay and ICU/ IMC costs exists (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, it is obvious that the longer the necessity for hospitalization and/or intensive care, the higher will be the costs.</s><s>Despite this linear relation, time-related costs- especially daily hospital and daily ICU/IMC costs-vary remarkably (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), reflecting considerable interindividual variability and suggesting the impact of further cost-related factors.</s><s>Increased resource utilization in a number of patients certainly causes higher expenses for treatment and can explain the observed variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>As several conditions require specific medical treatment, e.g.</s><s>renal failure may require haemodialysis, the association between increased time-related costs and patient-or surgery-related factors defining morbidity becomes evident.</s><s>In this respect, increased resource utilization was shown to be determined by critical preoperative status <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Most notably, mechanical circulatory support results in highest costs per day of hospital and ICU/IMC stay, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>).</s><s>Regarding early mortality as a cost-increasing factor, it has to be considered that 2 of 5 patients who died within 30 days after surgery in this study were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment, which may overestimate the impact of mortality per se.</s><s>Thus, mechanical circulatory support was reported to be the strongest predictor for early mortality (&lt;30 days) after surgery for PVE <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, it was recently shown in patients undergoing surgery for native valve IE in the USA, that among other preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors, in-hospital mortality was associated with significantly increased hospital charges <ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study limitations</head><p><s>The present study has limitations owing to its retrospective nature and the limited number of patients.</s><s>However, the study period of three consecutive years was intentionally chosen to reduce the impact of fluctuating hospital costs which can arise due to variable costs of materials, administrative changes and/or adjustments of medical professionals' salary over the years.</s><s>The contribution of variations in perioperative treatment was thereby reduced as well.</s></p><p><s>We report results from a single surgical centre of a large university hospital.</s><s>Therefore, caution has to be exercised regarding generalization of absolute costs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>Surgery for PVE is not only associated with relevant morbidity and mortality, but also with significant costs.</s><s>For reduction of mortality, morbidity and costs, it is, above all, preoperative morbidity which has to be addressed by timely diagnostic assessment and immediate treatment.</s><s>It is reasonable that patients with suspected PVE should be transferred to a tertiary care hospital where diagnostics and treatment can be provided by a multidisciplinary team including not only cardiologists and cardiac surgeons, but also specialists in infectious diseases, microbiologists and specialists of intensive care medicine.</s><s>As guidelines clearly indicate surgery for heart failure due to valve dysfunction, for uncontrolled infection and/or for prevention of systemic embolism in case of large and mobile vegetations, early or immediate surgery has to be preferred if these are present.</s></p><p><s>However, if we don't control this, when you read your manuscript it's very good, but what would you do now to try to improve the mortality?</s><s>Would you delay a little bit the operation in terms of getting the patient somewhat less critical, like in heart failure?</s><s>Do you use ultrafiltration?</s><s>Do you put them on echo pre-operation?</s><s>Reading the manuscript, we all know that if you operate on them critically in emergency it costs money and they stay in the ward.</s><s>But the question is, because we're faced with this every day, you have somebody who is in renal failure, you have to operate on him, of course, otherwise he's going to die, but how can you improve him to decrease the morbidity of the surgery?</s><s>Also there is nothing in the manuscript unfortunately on this.</s><s>Otherwise it's a very good study.</s></p><p><s>Dr Grubitzsch: I completely agree with you, and I think all of us would have this answer.</s><s>So to be honest, there is no single solution for this problem.</s><s>Because if we see the patient coming in with stroke, it is already too late and we cannot improve their critical state and cannot improve the results, therefore.</s><s>So it is right, we have to discuss not only with the cardiologists, but also with infectologists or GPs, because it is very complex.</s><s>We saw this kind of time delay in prosthetic valve endocarditis to get a timely diagnosis and consequently to get a timely treatment.</s><s>Many patients with a delayed diagnosis have no treatment at all, that means even no antibiotics.</s><s>Frequently, they don't have a clear indication for surgery when there are signs for prosthetic valve endocarditis, but they need further follow-up and antibiotic treatment.</s></p><p><s>Dr Folliguet: I know.</s><s>No.</s><s>If it is clearly indicated, if it is a destroyed valve, even with a streptococcus, I would go for surgery.</s><s>I mean, we have to look, is there a clear indication for surgery though?</s><s>If there is one, I wouldn't delay the surgery.</s><s>If there is, let's say, a small vegetation, 2 years after primary aortic valve replacement, and he found maybe streptococci, I would say: Please start antibiotics and look 1 week later.</s><s>If it is okay, we don't need the surgery.</s><s>If it is progressing, he will need surgery.</s></p><p><s>Dr G. El Khoury (Brussels, Belgium): I mean, he will not need surgery after maybe 1, 2, 3 weeks, so everything is clear; but 6 months later he comes back with abscess.</s><s>That's the problem of prosthetic endocarditis.</s><s>I mean, we are never sure that we can cure the endocarditis with antibiotics.</s><s>The question is should we go really when the patient is okay or not?</s><s>And I agree that we are facing this every day.</s><s>So should we operate every prosthetic endocarditis or not?</s></p><p><s>Dr R. Klautz (Leiden, Netherlands): I agree with the previous speaker.</s><s>And to make it even more complicated, is that if patients are referred early, many centres still delay surgery.</s><s>So there is a problem in our community as well.</s></p><p><s>The second problem is, if they send in patients with a prosthetic valve and fever, it's like the tip of a pyramid.</s><s>You'll get hundreds of patients sent to your clinic.</s><s>So from the cardiology perspective, they think, well, let's figure it out first before we send it out to the tertiary centre.</s><s>So there is an understandable delay to some extent.</s><s>In the perfect world, it wouldn't be like that.</s><s>But a patient with a prosthetic valve and fever, do you want to have them and see them all?</s><s>Because many of them have something else.</s></p><p><s>Dr El Khoury: I don't understand why we're always talking about our colleague cardiologists.</s><s>They don't like those patients.</s><s>They call us immediately, as soon as they see those patients.</s><s>That's our problem, not really the problem of our colleagues.</s><s>I'm sorry, I mean, they call us immediately with this because they don't like those patients.</s></p><p><s>Dr Grubitzsch: I want to be involved in these patients, of course, but I think it's not necessary to operate on every patient with just fever and a prosthetic valve.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1: Hospital costs of surgery for prosthetic valve endocarditis.</s><s>Distribution of total hospital costs within the study cohort (A) and relative breakdown of costs (B) are depicted.</s><s>Error bars in the lower graph denote standard deviation.</s><s>T€: thousand €; SD: standard deviation; ICU/IMC: intensive care unit/intermediate care.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,57.15,366.41,234.13,319.69" type="bitmap" /></figure>
