(2015)</ref>, the drift-correction alignment of videos taken from larvae later stained for Unc13A differed slightly.</s><s>For this, we used the MATLAB (R2016a) function normxcorr2 (part of the 'Image Processing' toolbox) to find the x-and y-translation that yielded the maximum correlation coefficient between pairs of the first frame and subregions of all individual succeeding frames of the movie (similar to what has been described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Newman et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>The subregion of succeeding frames to be compared to the first frame was chosen before execution of the alignment code and included the whole NMJ (as determined by GCaMP fluorescence signal), and was identical for all frames of one recording.</s><s>The function normxcorr2 returns a 2D array of values indicating the correlation coefficient between two compared images for every possible overlapping position relative to each other.</s><s>The x,y-shift was then found by calculating the x,y-difference between the position of the second image (which was a subregion of all the frames following the first) and the position of the maximum value in the 2D array.</s><s>All frames were Gaussian filtered (MATLAB function imgaussfilt) with an input sigma value of 5. To correct for changes in NMJ orientation and size, as well as uniform shearing in x-or y-direction related to fixation by Methanol or PFA, confocal images of the GCaMP channel in the fixed larvae were aligned to the first frame of the live GCaMP video using ImageJ (Fiji v1.49t).</s><s>Three points were selected in corresponding locations of each respective image, and an affine transformation (allowing translation, rotation, and x/y-shearing) was carried out using the plug-in ''TurboReg'' (Biomedical Imaging Group, EPFL, Switzerland).</s><s>If sufficient alignment could not be achieved, we used 4 reference points and performed a bilinear transformation (only necessary in 3 NMJs).</s><s>The transformation determined for the GCaMP channel was then applied to all other channels (BRP and either Unc18, Unc13 or Syx-1A).</s><s>ROIs with 650 nm diameter were then centrally overlaid with all BRP-positive spots as determined by the ''find maxima'' function of ImageJ with thresholds between 10 and 20.</s><s>The integrated density of all confocal channels and the GCaMP video was read out in these ROIs.</s><s>GCaMP Fluorescence values were read out as a function of time within each ROI.</s><s>Additionally, to correct the GCaMP signal for non-specific background, for each GCaMP video the ROIs were shifted in x,y-dimension so that no ROI would overlay with an area of GCaMP signal.</s><s>These shifted ROIs were used to measure the background in all frames of the GCaMP video, which was then subtracted from the intensity values measured in the original ROIs.</s><s>This resulted in a time-dependent GCaMP fluorescence signal for each AZ, which was further analyzed.</s></p><p><s>Single synapse activity was then quantified by detecting peaks in the fluorescence trace in custom written MATLAB code.</s><s>For this, the fluorescence trace was 1D-filtered (MATLAB function ''filter'') with a filter width of 5 frames for videos acquired with 20 Hz and a filter width of 3 frames for videos acquired with 10 Hz.</s><s>To detect peaks in the fluorescence that mark postsynaptic activation of glutamate receptors the time-dependent fluorescence profile at each AZ location was inspected.</s><s>Signals were considered only if the average fluorescence value in three subsequent frames exceeded a threshold which was chosen to be four times the value of the standard deviation of the signal.</s><s>Since the spatial dimensions of the GCaMP fluorescence -especially for large signals -can exceed the inter-AZ distance, we ensured the assignment of activity to a single AZ by only taking into account the ROI with maximal signal intensity and not considering ROIs within a circular area of 2.5 mm radius.</s><s>Finally, all signals matching these criteria were checked by visual inspection.</s><s>To classify spontaneous activity, all events were considered.</s><s>When evoked activity was tracked, the analysis was limited to peaks occurring within 1 s of stimulation to ensure relation to the AP.</s></p><p><s>To generate activity maps of spontaneous and evoked GCaMP signals (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2A</ref>), we used the number of signals per single AZ derived from the analysis described above, and plotted colored circles with sizes corresponding to the number of signals over an inverted BRP immunostaining of the recorded NMJ.</s><s>Average fluorescence traces of spontaneous and evoked events were determined from averages of all signals in the respective release mode on one NMJ and then averaged over all animals.</s><s>Exemplary single events corresponding to individual AZs were taken from the raw 8-bit GCaMP video and overlaid with a 16-color LUT in ImageJ, and optimized for contrast (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1J</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To relate single AZ activities to the local levels of different proteins (BRP;
