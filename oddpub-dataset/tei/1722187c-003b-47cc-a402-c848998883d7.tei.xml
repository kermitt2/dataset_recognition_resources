<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Prevalence of allergic diseases in infants, whose parents and siblings do not have allergy, is approximately 10% and reaches 20-30% in those with an allergic first-degree relative.</s><s>Intestinal microbiota may modulate immunologic and inflammatory systemic responses and, thus, influence development of sensitization and allergy.</s><s>Probiotics have been reported to modulate immune responses and their supplementation has been proposed as a preventive intervention.</s><s>Objective: The World Allergy Organization (WAO) convened a guideline panel to develop evidence-based recommendations about the use of probiotics in the prevention of allergy.</s><s>Methods: We identified the most relevant clinical questions and performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of probiotics for the prevention of allergy.</s><s>We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to develop recommendations.</s><s>We searched for and reviewed the evidence about health effects, patient values and preferences, and resource use (up to November 2014).</s><s>We followed the GRADE evidence-to-decision framework to develop recommendations.</s><s>Results: Currently available evidence does not indicate that probiotic supplementation reduces the risk of developing allergy in children.</s><s>However, considering all critical outcomes in this context, the WAO guideline panel determined that there is a likely net benefit from using probiotics resulting primarily from prevention of eczema.</s><s>The WAO guideline panel suggests: a) using probiotics in pregnant women at high risk for having an allergic child; b) using probiotics in women who breastfeed infants at high risk of developing allergy; and c) using probiotics in infants at high risk of developing allergy.</s><s>All recommendations are conditional and supported by very low quality evidence.</s><s>Conclusions: WAO recommendations about probiotic supplementation for prevention of allergy are intended to support parents, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions whether to use probiotics in pregnancy and during breastfeeding, and whether to give them to infants.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Executive summary</head><p><s>The purpose of this document is to provide evidencebased recommendations about the use of probiotic supplements for the primary prevention of allergies.</s></p><p><s>Prevalence of allergic diseases in infants is approximately 10% in those without an allergic parent or sibling and 20% to 30% in those with allergy in their relatives.</s><s>Studies suggest that intestinal microbiota may modulate immunologic and inflammatory systemic responses and, thus, influence development of sensitization and allergy.</s><s>Probiotics are living microorganisms that when administered to humans in adequate doses may confer a health benefit.</s><s>They have been proposed to modulate immune responses and have been advocated as therapeutic and preventive interventions for allergic diseases.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p><s>The methods used to develop clinical recommendations in this document follow the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.</s><s>The Guideline panel included clinicians and researchers in the field of allergy (allergists), pediatricians, primary care physicians, and methodologists.</s><s>Potential conflicts of interests were managed as suggested by the World Health Organization.</s></p><p><s>The guideline panel developed and graded the recommendations and assessed the quality of the supporting evidence following the GRADE approach.</s><s>The quality of evidence (also called confidence in the available estimates of health effects or certainty in the evidence) is categorized as: high, moderate, low or very low based on consideration of risk of bias, directness of evidence, consistency and precision of the estimates.</s><s>Low and very low quality evidence indicates that the estimated effects of interventions are very uncertain and further research is very likely to influence resulting recommendations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations</head><p><s>The strength of recommendations is expressed as either strong (guideline panel recommends…) or conditional (guideline panel suggests…) Understanding the interpretation of these two grades of strength of recommendations is essential for judicious health care decision-making and has explicit implications as follows:</s></p><p><s>Strong recommendation ◾ For patients: most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not.</s><s>◾ For clinicians: most individuals should receive the intervention.</s><s>Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator.</s><s>Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences.</s><s>◾ For policy makers: the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional recommendation</head><p><s>◾ For patients: the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not.</s><s>◾ For clinicians: recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences.</s><s>Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences.</s><s>◾ For policy makers: policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How to use these guidelines</head><p><s>The GLAD-P guidelines about the use of probiotics provide the basis for rational, informed decisions for clinicians, parents and other decision makers.</s><s>Clinicians, patients, third-party payers, institutional review committees, other stakeholders, or the courts should never view these recommendations as dictates.</s><s>No recommendation can take into account all of the often-compelling unique individual circumstances but provides guidance.</s><s>However, no one charged with evaluating health care professional's actions should attempt to apply the recommendations from these guidelines by rote or in a blanket fashion.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p><s>Note: statements about the underlying values and preferences as well as qualifying remarks accompanying each recommendation are its integral parts and serve to facilitate more accurate interpretation; they should never be omitted when quoting or translating recommendations from these guidelines.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation 1</head><p><s>The WAO guideline panel suggests using probiotics in pregnant women at high risk for allergy in their children, because considering all critical outcomes, there is a net benefit resulting primarily from prevention of eczema (conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Values and preferences</head><p><s>This recommendation places a relatively high value on prevention of eczema in children, and a relatively lower value on avoiding possible adverse effects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explanations and other considerations</head><p><s>There is lack of evidence that probiotics prevent any other allergy.</s><s>In most studies probiotics were used in the last 3 months of pregnancy.</s><s>This recommendation applies to otherwise healthy women and cannot be generalized to those with compromised immune system function.</s><s>High risk for allergy in a child is defined as biological parent or sibling with existing or history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, eczema, or food allergy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation 2</head><p><s>The WAO guideline panel suggests using probiotics in women who breastfeed infants at high risk of developing allergy, because considering all critical outcomes, there is a net benefit resulting primarily from prevention of eczema (conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence).</s></p></div>
