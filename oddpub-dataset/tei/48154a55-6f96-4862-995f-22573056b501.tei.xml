for example, in plasma, the presence of albumin or immunoglobulins (IgG) and other predominant proteins hinder the detection of less abundant proteins and reduces the efficiency of LC-MS/MS analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>This masking effect is also expected to be pronounced in the analysis of the urinary proteome of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who present high levels of urinary albumin <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, albumin abundance is highly variable between patients with CKD, even with the same disease etiology, which further complicates the analysis and comparison of the urinary protein content of these samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly to plasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the range of protein concentration in urine spans several orders of magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Due to the fact that the concentration of potential disease biomarkers might be relatively low, predominant proteins may mask them and make their identification challenging.</s><s>Therefore, fractionation and depletion strategies are generally employed prior to MS analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Currently, several fractionation methods for protein depletion are available.</s><s>Some of them are based on the separation of proteins by physicochemical properties such as charge (ionexchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) or size (size-exclusion chromatography <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), while others target specific protein groups or ligands, such as glycosyl groups in the case of glycoproteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or biochemical properties (i.e.</s><s>immunoaffinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>).</s><s>These affinity chromatography methods are applicable for a rapid and selective depletion or enrichment of biomolecules from complex samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>The selection of a fractionation strategy depends on the specific study requirements.</s><s>For example, combinatorial peptide ligand libraries, allow for the simultaneous depletion of highly-abundant proteins and enrichment of low-abundance targets, facilitating their detection by MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>However, this approach requires relatively high amounts of starting material (hundreds of milliliters of urine) to ensure efficient enrichment of low-abundance proteins; otherwise, high-and medium-abundance proteins would not fully saturate their ligands and ultimately the elution would have the same profile as initial sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Since in most cases low volumes of urine (&lt;1 mL) are available when investigating prospectively collected samples from clinical cohorts, combinatorial ligand peptide libraries do not appear to be applicable for analysis of such individual urine samples.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Strategies based on the depletion of abundant proteins require lower initial material compared to combinatorial peptide ligand libraries <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>These strategies include immuno-based depletion methods involving selective binding of target proteins to the stationary phase based on affinity.</s><s>They are considered to have high specificity and efficiency and achieve rapid purification or concentration of the analytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Another depletion strategy is based on ion-exchange chromatography relying on attraction of oppositely charged molecules as the basis for separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Depletion of abundant proteins appears especially relevant when investigating the urinary proteome of CKD patients, where the levels and variability of highly-abundant proteins noticeably increase with each stage of CKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, depletion of abundant proteins causes co-depletion of several low-abundance proteins, hindering their detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Several protein depletion kits are commercially available.</s><s>These kits are generally designated to be used for plasma samples and their application has been evaluated in several manuscripts (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>). Kulloli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> applied a kit for depletion of 14 abundant proteins in plasma prior to analysis by LC-MS/MS.</s><s>The depletion allowed to enrich the sample for low-abundance proteins and increased the number of identifications compared to the non-depleted sample (from approx.</s><s>71 to 130 proteins).</s><s>Similarly, Tu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> observed a 25% increase in the number of identifications when kits depleting 7 or 14 high-abundance proteins were applied prior to the LC-MS/MS analysis.</s><s>However, the authors questioned the applicability of the depletion strategy for the identification of disease biomarkers in plasma, since the low-abundance proteins accounted only for 6% of total identifications and 50 of the proteins with the highest abundance accounted for 90% of total spectral counts.</s><s>Along the same lines, twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) analyses of plasma samples, where depletion of abundant proteins strategy was applied, demonstrated an increase in the number of spots on the gel.</s><s>Yet, most of the newly identified spots, represented different isoforms of high-abundance proteins (e.g.</s><s>albumin, IgGs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Various protein depletion kits have been also tested on urine samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Afkarian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> depleted albumin and IgG from urine of diabetic patients with or without nephropathy.</s><s>Subsequently, iTRAQ labeling was performed and the samples were analyzed by 2D-LC-MS (MALDI-TOF/TOF).</s><s>No increase in the number of identified proteins was observed in the depleted samples, regardless if the patient was normo-or macro-albuminuric.</s><s>On the other hand, Kushnir et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> reported a 2.5-fold increase in the number of protein identifications by LC-MS/MS after depleting 6 highly abundant proteins (albumin, IgG, alpha-1 antitrypsin, IgA, transferring and haptoglobin) using multiple affinity removal (MARS) column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).</s><s>Abundant protein depletion strategies (14 MARS) in conjunction with iTRAQ labeling were also applied for the identification of potential bladder cancer biomarkers from urine <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</s><s>The depletion strategy allowed increasing the number of identifications from approximately 300 proteins in the non-fractionated sample to 500, and the discovery of a potential biomarker panel for bladder cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Collectively, based on the existing conflicting data it is presently unclear whether depletion strategies are of benefit when analyzing urine samples.</s><s>In this study, we therefore aimed to assess the effectiveness of different commercially available depletion strategies for the proteome analysis of urine samples from CKD patients and healthy controls: four different strategies (three immunodepletion-and one ion-exchange-based) were applied prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.</s><s>The efficiency of depletion, reproducibility, and the overall impact of each strategy on the number of protein identifications and relative protein quantification were assessed.</s></p></div>

the number of identified peptides from LC-MS/MS, each depletion strategy is reproducible, and in the case of normal samples, albumin as a target protein is efficiently depleted.</s><s>For CKD samples, immunodepletion kits efficiently depleted The reduced efficiency of Seppro IgY14 may be attributed to potential column overloadingeven though this was not expected to be the case based on the manufacturer's instructions: Seppro IgY14 is designed to work with plasma, where the concentration of highly-abundant proteins is substantial.</s><s>Additionally, the loaded protein amount in this study (437 μg) was not even half of the column binding capacity (1 mg max.</s><s>column binding capacity).</s><s>The reason(s) of the lower efficiency of Seppro IgY14 in depleting albumin in CKD urine is still unknown.</s><s>The ion-exchange-based ProteoSpin kit was found to be the least efficient in eliminating target proteins from both normal and CKD urine.</s><s>This was expected due to the highly-specific nature of immuno-based mechanism employed in the other kits <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Regardless whether a depletion method was applied or not, the number of protein identifications from LC-MS/MS analysis were comparable.</s><s>In all cases, in the urine from CKD patients fewer proteins were identified in comparison to urine from healthy controls, even though the number of PSMs, MS/MS scans and TICs were similar per method.</s><s>This may indicate that, even upon depletion, the potential masking effect from highly abundant proteins still exists.</s><s>After depletion of the target highly-abundant proteins, other non-targeted high and mediumabundance molecules (e.g. protein AMBP, vitamin D-binding proteins, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, uromodulin) likely maintain the masking effect.</s><s>Alternatively, a large number of proteins may be below the limit of detection (estimated at low femtomole range for the applied mass spectrometer) and therefore, any positive impact of depletion on proteome coverage cannot be observed.</s><s>Collectively, comparable numbers of received identifications between different strategies, as well as the presence of unique proteins in both fractionated and initial urine indicate no benefit of depletion for biomarker identification purposes.</s></p><p><s>Our results are not in agreement with Kushnir et
