<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Patient population</head><p><s>Patients with newly diagnosed biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate without prior treatment undergo routine multiparametric 3 Tesla MRI at our institution for the purposes of treatment staging or active surveillance.</s><s>Between November 2012 and February 2013, 45 consecutive of these patients (median age 60 years; range 50-72 years) had an additional sequence for T 2 mapping added to their MRI protocol.</s><s>The study was performed under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol and informed consent was obtained prior to MRI and signed by each patient and a study coordinator.</s></p><p><s>Of the 45 patients who underwent the additional imaging, four were later excluded from the study either because it was found that there was an absence of a suspicious lesion in the peripheral zone or there was a suspicious lesion but it was in the central gland or anterior fibro-muscular stroma (e.g. based on clinical T 2 -weighted and diffusion-weighted images).</s><s>Five other patients were excluded because there was significant motion artifact on the T 2 mapping sequence used for the study.</s></p><p><s>Image data from 36 patients (out of the initial 45 patients that had T 2 mapping) were included in the final study.</s><s>Of the patients whose data was included, nine had low-risk, 21 had intermediate-risk and six had high-risk prostate cancer (D'Amico's risk criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>).</s><s>At the time of enrollment, the mean serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 8.5 ng/mL (range 3.6-21.8</s><s>ng/mL).</s><s>Indications for MRI were mainly for staging (n=28), but also included active surveillance (n=8).</s><s>The time of biopsy prior to the MRI ranged from 7 to 551 days with a median and standard deviation of 51 and 127 days respectively.</s><s>Several patients had multiple biopsies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Imaging sequences and parameters</head><p><s>All patients included in this study underwent multiparametric MRI under a standard protocol that is used at our institution for the assessment of intra and extra-glandular prostate disease.</s><s>Imaging was performed using a 3T Signa HDxt scanner (General Electric Medical Systems) operating under software version 15.0.</s><s>The MRI protocol, which included the use of an airfilled endorectal coil (Medrad Inc.</s><s>Indianola, PA, USA) combined with an eight-element flexible torso phased-array coil, has been described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, T 1 -weighted spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) imaging in the axial plane, T 2 -weighted Fast Spin Echo (FSE) imaging in all three planes, as well as axial DWI and DCE imaging were performed.</s></p><p><s>The unique component of this study was the inclusion of an IV-CPMG imaging sequence for T 2 mapping.</s><s>The manufacturer's clinical FSE sequence includes a CPMG option whereby individual spin echoes in the echo train can be used to obtain images with different TE's in a single acquisition.</s><s>This sequence was modified in-house to obtain the IV-CPMG sequence used in the study.</s><s>In the modified sequence, the excitation and refocusing pulses were tilted with respect to each other, as discussed by Rangwala and Zhou <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and shown schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>This tilting has the effect not only of selectively exciting spins in the slice direction but also of restricting the volume of spins excited along the phase encode direction through selective refocusing.</s><s>The images in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> demonstrate the ability of the sequence to select a reduced field-of-view without significant aliasing in the phase-encode direction.</s></p><p><s>The preferred image orientation for prostate T2W prostate imaging is axial and the R-L direction is normally selected as the phase-encoding direction to avoid having motion artifacts from the rectal wall obscure the prostate.</s><s>The same axial orientation and selection of phase and frequency directions was adopted for T 2 mapping.</s><s>Without restricting the selected volume in the phase direction, a FOV of over 300 mm would be required.</s><s>However, the IV-CPMG sequence allowed us to greatly reduce the phase FOV (and, thus, the number of phase encoding steps) while avoiding aliasing artifact.</s></p><p><s>For a tilt angle of ϕ (assuming it is less than about 40°) the restricted volume in the phase direction equals two times the slice thickness multiplied by tangent(90°-ϕ).</s><s>In this study, we used tilts of approximately 4° to select an 85 mm section in the phase direction for a slice thickness of 3 mm.</s><s>The FOV in the frequency direction was 140 mm and the selected matrix size was 192 × 160 in frequency and phase directions respectively.</s><s>With the phase-encoding FOV set to 62% and with the half-Fourier option added, the actual number of phase encodes was reduced to approximately 50, which included a slight oversampling for the half-FT phase correction.</s><s>Thus, even with a relatively long TR, the scan times were only 2.8 minutes compared to almost 9 minutes scans that would be required for a full-FOV, full-Fourier acquisition.</s><s>A total of 8 spin echoes per slice were acquired at TE's from 18 to 144 ms at intervals of 18 ms.</s><s>With a TR of 3300 ms, 20 slices could be acquired in one acquisition, allowing for full gland coverage in the axial plane (slice thickness: 3 mm, slice gap: 1 mm).</s><s>The resultant in-plane resolution was approximately 1 × 1.5 mm 2 .</s></p><p><s>An undesired side effect due to tilting the spatially selective excitation with respect to refocusing is that the flip angle of the refocusing pulses becomes dependent on the position of the spins not just along the slice direction, as in slice selective CPMG imaging, but also along the phase-encode direction.</s><s>That is, in standard slice selective CPMG imaging, the variability of the refocusing flip angles within the slice-selection profiles results in contributions from stimulated echoes and a departure of the resulting signal decays with echo time from pure T 2 decays.</s><s>A noticeable feature of this effect is a surprisingly lower signal on first echo images and calculated T 2 values longer than expected due to T 1 contributions.</s><s>Thus, the estimated T 2 is more aptly referred to as the 'apparent' T 2 .</s><s>In the IV-CPMG sequence used in this study, we expected such effects to be exacerbated due to the additional flip angle variation along the phase-encode direction.</s><s>This is demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, which shows T 2 estimates using the standard full-FOV CPMG sequence compared with the T 2 estimates in a doped water phantom (T 2 ~60ms) obtained using the IV-CPMG sequence.</s><s>Near the center of the reduced FOV the two methods are in close agreement in terms of the estimated T 2 , however, near the edges the difference increases significantly.</s><s>In the studies reported here, the gland was positioned at the center of the reduced FOV to minimize such effects though they certainly contribute to inaccuracies in T 2 values, which are understood to be "apparent" T 2 values.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Image Analysis</head><p><s>Two radiologists (FIY and TP), aware of all clinical information (indication for the exam, clinical stage, PSA values and biopsy results), reviewed multiparametric MRI data sets (including DWI and DCE images) and identified one suspected cancer (SC) lesion per patient in consensus.</s><s>When consensus was not reached, a third senior radiologist (FMF) was consulted.</s><s>Regions-of-Interest (ROIs) corresponding to SC were then mapped to the T 2 maps generated from the IV-CPMG sequence.</s><s>When consensus was reached, another ROI corresponding to suspected healthy (SH) tissue in the peripheral zone was used for comparative analysis.</s><s>This ROI was placed in a region of homogeneously high signal intensity, containing as much normal appearing glandular tissue as possible.</s><s>For three of the patients, no consensus was reached on an acceptable SH ROI, thus, the analysis included results from 36 SC ROIs but only 33 SH ROIs.</s></p><p><s>The detailed prostate pathology report for each patient was available to the radiologists at the time of ROI selection.</s><s>All information available from the pathology report was used to confirm that the suspected cancer ROIs were placed in the location of the pathology-proven cancer.</s><s>While correlation with whole-mount pathology would be preferable, this was not feasible for the study as not all patients went to prostatectomy (only 9 of 36).</s></p><p><s>Quantitative T 2 maps were generated from the IV-CPMG data by assuming a monoexponential T 2 decay.</s><s>The first echo was not used in the analysis because it is typically found to have less signal intensity than the 2 nd echo, as noted previously with the use of slice selective CPMG sequences in the prostate <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, signals from later echoes were discarded prior to fitting if the signal was within 3 standard deviations of baseline noise values as measured in air containing-ROIs placed in the rectum.</s><s>The T 2 -mapping analysis was performed using a custom processing routine implemented within 3D Slicer (http://www.slicer.org),</s><s>an open source image guided therapy and image analysis platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Differences in mean T 2 values in SC and SH ROIs were tested for significance using an unpaired Student's two-tailed t-test with statistical significance assumed at p&lt;0.05.</s><s>Normality of the T 2 data was confirmed via the Shapiro-Wilks test.</s><s>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the optimal threshold T 2 value for cancer discrimination.</s><s>Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc for Windows, version 12.5 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).</s></p></div>

quantitative imaging is that it provides greater objectivity in image analysis.</s><s>It may also improve sensitivity and specificity in detecting and characterizing lesions when compared to qualitative-based approaches.</s></p><p><s>Although there has been a shift towards more quantitative analyses in the prostate imaging community, with an emphasis on ADC values <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and pharmacokinetic parameters, quantitative T 2 analyses has remained largely within the realm of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>It is perhaps somewhat surprising that quantitative T 2 analysis is not more prevalent considering that conventional T 2 -weighted imaging is very much in the front-line for visualization of prostate anatomy and identification of suspected regions of cancer.</s><s>Signal intensity at a single TE is an amalgam of several effects, including not only the T 2 value, but also receiver coil sensitivities, B1 inhomogeneities, and T 1 and proton density effects.</s><s>Thus, T 2 mapping in addition to standard T2W imaging should be advantageous as it is insensitive to some of these confounding effects.</s></p><p><s>There are significant technical challenges in obtaining quantitative T 2 maps in the clinical setting.</s><s>First, the gold standard T 2 mapping approach of performing multiple single spinecho acquisitions with a range of TE settings requires excessive scan times.</s><s>More practical approaches have included the use of separate fast spin echo (FSE) acquisitions with different effective TEs.</s><s>However, each scan still requires several minutes to cover the gland with adequate spatial resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Potential additions to the approach used here could significantly improve the accuracy of the T 2 estimates.</s><s>For example, with some modification to the RF excitation profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> it is possible to obtain much more uniform flip angle distributions over the selected volume to minimize spatially-dependent variation in T 2 estimates.</s><s>Also, combining the IV-CPMG sequence with a reconstruction approach such as that proposed by Ben-Eliezer et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> could be used to correct for the stimulated echo effects and provide more accurate T 2 estimates.</s><s>Other methods for selecting the reduced FOV might also be considered, such as those methods discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A recent prostate MR guideline stated the importance of quantitative measurements and structured reporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, as they can help not only to improve inter-observer agreement but also to develop computer-aided detection systems.</s><s>There is a potential benefit of incorporating quantitative T 2 values into computer-aided detection systems rather than visual interpretation of T2W alone, as has been shown in a recent report that utilized T 2weighted signal intensity histogram (skewness) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Whether the use of quantitative T 2 measurements can improve the specificity and/or sensitivity of prostate cancer detection over qualitative analysis still remains to be answered but appears, in light of this work and others, to be quite promising.</s></p><p><s>As a note of caution, it should be stated that there are disease entities associated with shorter T 2 values (and lower T2W signal) in the peripheral zone other than prostatic adenocarcinoma.</s><s>Post-prostate biopsy hemorrhage can leave foci of methaemoglobin scattered in the gland and lower the T2W signal.</s><s>This complication can be avoided if one is able to rule out hemorrhage by assessing the same location on T1W images (as was done in this study) or by simply allowing sufficient time between biopsy and imaging.</s><s>Further, benign conditions such as acute and chronic prostatitis can also lead to low T2W-signal areas within the PZ.</s><s>In most cases, these can be distinguished from cancer by morphology, since prostatitis has a "band-like" or linear shape and cancer is typically a round focal mass.</s></p><p><s>Our study has some limitations.</s><s>First, only a relatively small set of patients was examined.</s><s>Second, we recognize that the pathological correlation of the suspected cancer lesion on MRI with the biopsy results has limitations and is not as accurate as radical prostatectomy.</s><s>This is a persistent limitation of all biopsy correlation studies.</s><s>Third, we assumed a normal appearing peripheral zone without histopathologic correlation.</s><s>However, we did make efforts to select the normal ROIs in homogeneous regions of high signal in the PZ on T2W images, in an attempt to minimize potential confounders such as prostatitis that are known to reduce peripheral zone T 2 signal.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the IV-CPMG imaging sequence allowed for reasonably rapid estimates of quantitative T 2 values.</s><s>This quantification could increase the effectiveness of multiparametric MRI in the detection and staging of prostate cancer without adding significantly to the time required for image acquisition.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.Left: The schematic shows the spatial selection
