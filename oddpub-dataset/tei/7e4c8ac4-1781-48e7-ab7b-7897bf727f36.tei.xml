<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replicates to high titers in primary human fibroblast cell cultures.</s><s>A variety of primary human cells and some tumor-derived cell lines do also support permissive HCMV replication, yet at low levels.</s><s>Cell lines established by transfection of the transforming functions of adenoviruses have been notoriously resistant to HCMV replication and progeny production.</s><s>Here, we provide first-time evidence that a permanent cell line immortalized by adenovirus type 5 E1A and E1B (CAP) is supporting the full HCMV replication cycle and is releasing infectious progeny.</s><s>The CAP cell line had previously been established from amniotic fluid cells which were likely derived from membranes of the developing fetus.</s><s>These cells can be grown under serum-free conditions.</s><s>HCMV efficiently penetrated CAP cells, expressed its immediate-early proteins and dispersed restrictive PML-bodies.</s><s>Viral DNA replication was initiated and viral progeny became detectable by electron microscopy in CAP cells.</s><s>Furthermore, infectious virus was released from CAP cells, yet to lower levels compared to fibroblasts.</s><s>Subviral dense bodies were also secreted from CAP cells.</s><s>The results show that E1A/E1B expression in transformed cells is not generally repressive to HCMV replication and that CAP cells may be a good substrate for dense body based vaccine production.</s></p></div>
