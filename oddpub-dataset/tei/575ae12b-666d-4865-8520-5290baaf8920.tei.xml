<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p><s>This paper describes the development of the first known PEI-specific PRO instrument, developed on the basis of indepth and rigorous qualitative research.</s><s>The instrument has been developed with the goal of providing patients and physicians with more comprehensive and systematically collected information about PEI patients' symptoms and HRQoL functioning to aid patient-physician communication and management of PEI.</s><s>The qualitative interviews with both patients with CP and those with CF and with physicians identified many patient-reported concepts relevant to capturing the full range of PEI symptoms and impacts on patients' daily lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>Many of these concepts have not previously been documented in the literature, highlighting the value of collecting data directly from patients to fully understand their experience of symptoms and impacts.</s><s>During the qualitative interviews, physicians specializing in CF reported fewer PEI symptom and impact concepts than those specializing in CP.</s><s>This may reflect that patients with CF have usually been receiving treatment for longer than those with CP and have usually experienced symptoms since childhood, reducing the impact.</s><s>It may also be the case that certain symptoms are features of CP and not of CF.</s><s>Set against that possibility, the results from the qualitative interviews indicate that, overall, the PEI symptom experience is similar in both patient groups.</s><s>This possibility will be further explored during quantitative validation of the PEI-Q, at which point it is expected that some items may be deleted if they do not appear equally relevant to patients with CP and those with CF.</s><s>Findings also identified that patients may have difficulty estimating correct enzyme doses, which could result in poor treatment adherence.</s><s>The PEI-Q has the potential to help physicians identify the need to adjust treatment regimens, address dosing issues, and maintain treatment adherence, thus contributing to better outcomes for patients.</s><s>The instrument may have particular value in PEI management following diagnosis or alongside existing diagnostic tests, providing supplementary information to physicians.</s></p><p><s>Our findings provide evidence that, in addition to direct effects on bowel function and digestive function, PEI symptoms also distress patients and interfere with daily activities.</s><s>They can also result in patients avoiding foods that are difficult to digest rather than correctly adjusting doses of enzyme replacement.</s><s>This may lead to malnutrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> and worsening of malnutrition-related symptoms, which is associated with early mortality in patients with CF <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Achieving adequate enzyme replacement is important for all of these conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>We believe the PEI-Q will assist physicians to assess the adequacy of PERT and should help improve the management of PEI symptoms.</s></p><p><s>Guidelines for PEI diagnosis and management in CP do not include PROs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> but are reliant on stool elastase measurements, the only widely available test for PEI.</s><s>Guidelines suggest that a trial period of PERT can clarify whether patients' symptoms are due to PEI <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>, but many physicians understand that responses to PERT vary widely.</s><s>Additional symptoms found in our qualitative patient interviews highlight the benefit of a PRO to monitor PEI symptoms and the full patient experience.</s><s>This will improve assessment of treatment response and will enable adjustment of PERT doses after consideration of patientreported severity of symptoms using a standardized measure.</s></p><p><s>It is well established that PROs can provide important endpoints for the evaluation of treatment benefits and adverse effects in clinical trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, Velikova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> provided evidence that use of a qualityof-life questionnaire in clinical practice can improve patient-doctor communication and can highlight symptoms previously untreated or discounted by the doctor and patient.</s><s>The PEI-Q could help identify untreated symptoms, adjust enzyme-replacement doses to effective levels, and maintain good nutritional and general health status.</s></p><p><s>A strength of the study is that we included patients with CF and CP, the two primary causes of PEI; thus, the findings provide evidence of content validity in different sub-groups.</s><s>Inclusion of both patients with CF and those with CP maximized the likelihood of identifying symptoms and impacts that result from PEI rather than these comorbid conditions.</s><s>It is still possible that some of the symptoms identified are due to CP or CF, for example, epigastric pain.</s><s>This will be further explored in a quantitative validation study that is already underway, and it is possible that some symptom concepts currently included may be deleted based on the findings of that study.</s><s>Another strength of the study is that patients were recruited from three countries, ensuring findings have cross-cultural relevance.</s></p><p><s>However, the study has some limitations.</s><s>Data were collected in France, Germany, and the UK only; further study in other countries and outside Europe would provide further confidence in the cross-cultural validity of the PEI-Q.</s><s>That said, major differences are considered unlikely given that no differences were found across the countries studied.</s><s>Another study limitation is that some patients' PEI was diagnosed by symptoms reported rather than laboratory-based tests, allowing the possibility that patients may not have been correctly diagnosed with PEI.</s><s>This method was chosen to ensure feasibility and practicality of the study and also reflects clinical practice.</s><s>Moreover, most participants were diagnosed using clinical tests such as the fecal elastase test, and no differences were identified in symptoms reported between patients diagnosed via different methods.</s><s>However, we do recommend that future studies collect data from patients diagnosed using laboratory-based tests to cross-validate these findings.</s></p><p><s>This paper describes the first phase of development of the PEI-Q using qualitative interviews, ensuring the full patient experience is captured.</s><s>Work thus far has been qualitative, leading to a list of symptom and impact concepts to document the comprehensive PEI symptom experience and the associated impact on patients' wellbeing.</s><s>Symptoms and impacts identified have been integrated into the PEI-Q instrument.</s><s>Quantitative testing of the psychometric validity and reliability of the instrument is necessary before it can be used in clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>; the psychometric properties of the PEI-Q will be evaluated in a planned validation study.</s></p></div>
