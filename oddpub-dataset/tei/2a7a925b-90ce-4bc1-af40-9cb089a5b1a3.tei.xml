<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>To accurately characterize the cellular and ECM megakaryocyte niche in the bone marrow, we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro analyses.</s><s>The most recent bone-sectioning methods were employed together with well-characterized antibodies to ECM proteins and cellular markers, and several genetic mouse models of thrombopoiesis.</s><s>First, we adopted a system of automated imaging and alignment of images to allow detection of a complete femur, from proximal to distal epiphysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1Ai</ref>).</s><s>DAPI staining was used to monitor tissue cellularity, and for detection of cutting artifacts or loss of cells during the staining and washing procedures, which might result in false low numbers.</s><s>Femurs were divided into proximal epiphysis, diaphysis and distal epiphysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1Aii</ref>,iii,iv).</s><s>Sinusoids were marked using anti-endoglin (CD105) and megakaryocytes by anti-CD41.</s><s>Both stainings allowed a clear distinction between the bone cortex and marrow, which comprises the vasculature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>).</s><s>Total megakaryocyte numbers were calculated per bone marrow area, revealing that megakaryocytes are equally distributed with a slight increase in density at the distal epiphysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s><s>Within the diaphysis, megakaryocytes had a density of 43/mm 2 .</s><s>We found 60% in direct contact with sinusoids, although this value might be higher due to undetected sinusoids above or below the section plane.</s><s>Megakaryocyte area ranged from 150 to 600 µm 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>) and was independent of their location in the bone, with many small megakaryocytes residing at the vessel.</s><s>We found that the coefficient of determination between distance and megakaryocyte area was very low (R 2 =0.01196).</s><s>This implies that megakaryocyte maturation might not only take place within the cavity, but also while residing at the sinusoids.</s><s>To distinguish between sinusoids and arterioles, we used anti-smooth muscle actin (SMA) to mark arterioles only.</s><s>Co-staining with both antibodies revealed that both vessel types were clearly distinct (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref>) but that megakaryocytes associated only with sinusoidal endothelium.</s><s>The median distance between two sinusoids was 50 µm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The bone marrow contains a variety of ECM proteins, mostly fibrillar collagens and fibronectin, although laminins have been described mainly during embryogenesis and in association with the basement membranes of the vasculature.</s><s>To investigate whether megakaryocytes associated with specific ECM proteins, we performed triple staining using one ECM marker in addition to megakaryocyte and sinusoid staining.</s><s>We excluded small CD41+ cells that might be hematopoietic stem cells, and compared CD41 with later markers (CD42b) and could not detect significant differences.</s><s>Fibronectin was present throughout the bone marrow (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>von Willebrand factor (vWF) was expressed in megakaryocytes, where it is stored in α-granules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, vWF was completely absent from sinusoidal endothelial cells or the subendothelial matrix, whereas fibrinogen was detectable in patches throughout the cavity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>To define which laminin isoform was expressed, we used an antibody directed against Englebreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) laminin 111, which recognizes laminin α1, β1 and γ1 chains equally (and is therefore a pan-laminin antibody as it would detect several isoforms), or antibodies that specifically recognize the isoform subunits α4 or α5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Frieser et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sorokin et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>In our femur sections, we found staining around the larger vessels and the sinusoids, as expected (data not shown).</s><s>Co-staining for SMA indicated that both laminin isoforms were present in ample amounts around arterioles.</s><s>Although laminin α5 was readily detected around CD105-positive sinusoids (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D,E</ref>,G), we found laminin α4 to be weakly expressed at capillary vessels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F,H</ref>).</s><s>Trabecular bone and cortex were highly positive for collagen I, but negative for collagen IV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A-D</ref>).</s><s>In order to corroborate these observations and to show that the different collagen types used for plating and antibodies used for detecting these types are specific overall, we performed an ELISA where we measured the binding of antibodies to the distinct collagen types or mixtures.</s><s>Our result depicted in a heatmap (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2E</ref>) indicate that, despite substantial structural overlap between collagen types I and IV, the antibodies used in our study recognize their indicated substrates with the highest affinity, and, hence, we could perform co-stainings throughout the femur to map the detailed distribution of these matrix proteins.</s></p><p><s>Throughout the bone marrow cavity, we found thin filaments of collagen I, III or IV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-H</ref>) that were partially colocalizing, suggesting a reticulated fiber network.</s><s>Collagen III filaments were detected throughout the bone marrow, in direct contact with megakaryocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>), but absent from bone cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Collagen I staining also occurred around larger arterioles and arteries, probably in the outer fibrous layer, and subjacent to sinusoids (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>Collagen IV also localized to basement membranes of sinusoids (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>Megakaryocytes were in contact with collagen types I and IV, showing no obvious preference (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F,G</ref>).</s><s>We quantified the degree of megakaryocyte contact with ECM proteins in the sections by using four categories: no contact (0-5%), low contact (5-40%), intermediate contact (40-60%) and high contact (60-100%) as indicated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>).</s><s>Most bone-marrow-associated megakaryocytes (without vessel association) had direct contact with collagen type I or IV.</s><s>The degree of contact did not vary substantially for collagen I between cavity megakaryocytes and those found juxtaposed to endothelial cells.</s><s>This was in strong contrast to collagen IV: whereas cavity megakaryocytes had a comparable association with type I, more than two thirds of all vessel megakaryocytes showed high contact with collagen type IV.</s><s>As pan-laminin staining was exclusively detected in basement membranes, only vesselassociated megakaryocytes were in direct contact with laminin, albeit not completely surrounding or wrapping them.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our results show that collagen types I, III and IV cannot be exclusively assigned to a specific compartment within the bone marrow cavity or the vascular niche.</s><s>Within the bone marrow parenchyma megakaryocytes colocalize with all analyzed collagen types, but show increased colocalization (or overlap in staining) only with type IV at the vascular niche.</s></p><p><s>This observation prompted us to ask to what degree megakaryocytes adhere to different ECM proteins.</s><s>We isolated fetal liver cells and differentiated them for 3 days in the presence of TPO prior to enrichment.</s><s>Megakaryocytes were enriched through a one-step BSA density gradient on day 3 and seeded onto 24-well plates coated with either collagen types I, III, IV, laminin or fibronectin.</s><s>The area of all CD41+ megakaryocytes was measured and calculated as the fraction of total area per well.</s><s>Surface coverage was low on uncoated or bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated control wells, but adhesion was high on collagen types I and III, and intermediate on type IV and fibronectin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> and 3A, insets).</s><s>Only weak adhesion was detected on laminin-111.</s><s>Megakaryocytes also started to spread on ECM proteins (especially collagen I and III; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), as their area was significantly enlarged when compared to BSA or uncoated surfaces.</s></p><p><s>We next asked whether this adhesion and spreading on distinct matrices would affect megakaryocyte maturation.</s><s>After 54 h, megakaryocytes were removed from the substrates by gentle pipetting (which was controlled by light microscopy) and subjected to ploidy analysis.</s><s>Surprisingly, all ECM molecules led to a shift towards lower ploidy levels, independently of whether it was typical for bone marrow stroma or a vascular niche protein, with laminin-111 causing the strongest reduction of ploidy levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>However, the proportions of each ploidy level were not statistically significant between the different matrix proteins.</s><s>For size analysis, megakaryocytes were cultured on the ECM substrates  for 6 h (day 3 of culture), 30 h (day 4) or 54 h (day 5), removed and cytospun onto slides.</s><s>Megakaryocyte area was determined after β1tubulin staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s><s>Fibronectin did not have any effect, and collagen type I was the only factor that reduced megakaryocyte size significantly.</s><s>All other ECM substrates led to increased size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>), suggesting that collagen IV and laminin contribute to the final megakaryocyte maturation.</s></p><p><s>The generation of proplatelets and platelets by fetal-liver-derived megakaryocytes has been studied extensively and is considered a system that partly mimics platelet formation in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Italiano et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Junt et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore adopted a standardized system to study the influence of ECM proteins on PPF in a time-dependent manner.</s><s>Megakaryocytes were plated onto purified ECM proteins and PPF was evaluated 6 h later and twice on day 4 and 5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>As described above, we found that, on BSA, PPF increased linearly until day 5 before it peaked.</s><s>Later time points could not be accurately determined due to massive shedding of proplatelets and platelets.</s><s>PPF was markedly reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, top row) when megakaryocytes were plated on collagen types I and III, with collagen type I being the stronger inhibitor.</s></p><p><s>It is worth mentioning that we still find PPF on collagen I, but that it was strongly reduced and attenuated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, top row), and none of the basement-membrane-associated proteins (collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin) supported PPF beyond the level seen in the BSA control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, bottom row and data not shown; the increase in PPF on fibronectin on day 4 was not statistically significant).</s><s>As 'inhibitory' collagen I is also present at the vascular niche where PPF takes place, we sought to address whether mixing with a second, distinct vascular niche protein can diminish the inhibitory effect on PPF when mixed with collagen IV or whether the inhibition is dominant.</s><s>Thus, we extended our system to study serial dilutions of collagen I with collagen IV or laminin isoforms by maintaining the total protein concentration at 10 µg/cm 2 surface, which is highly saturating for surface coating.</s><s>When collagen IV was present at less than 50%, collagen-I-mediated inhibition of PPF was dominant.</s><s>However, when collagen IV became the predominant protein, we found increased PPF, implying that collagen IV might counteract the collagen I signal and thus promote PPF at the vascular niche.</s><s>This finding also suggests that both collagen types interact with the same receptors and compete for binding or signaling.</s><s>By contrast, increasing concentrations of laminin by up to 87% could not abrogate the inhibitory effect by collagen I (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>Even a
