target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, IRS4 was reported to be no substrate for the insulin receptor in muscle tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>In contrast to IRS1/2, IRS4 is

target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>This could explain why mice lacking IRS4 show only mild defects in growth and glucose homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Taken together, the physiological function and relevance of IRS4 still remain elusive.</s></p><p><s>Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) are pleiotropic cytokines belonging to the Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily.</s><s>They fulfil various cellular functions both during embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis by regulating distinct processes in a context-specific manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>BMPs signal via binding to heteromeric complexes of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, the BMP type I (ACVRI, BMPRIA, BMPRIB) and type II receptors (ActRIIa, ActRIIb, BMPRII).</s><s>Upon ligand binding the activated type I receptor kinase phosphorylates cytosolic receptor-regulated Smads1/5/8 (R-Smads).</s><s>This in turn induces their oligomerisation with the common-mediator Smad4 (co-Smad) followed by subsequent nuclear translocation and transcriptional regulation of specific BMP/Smad target genes like inhibitors of differentiation (IDs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Besides the canonical Smad pathway, BMPs induce non-Smad signalling like Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) such as p38, JNK and ERK but also PI3K/Akt-mediated routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Since malfunction of BMP signalling is intimately linked with severe diseases including cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disorders, cancer and fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , tight regulation and

type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> thereby regulating cell growth and differentiation.</s></p><p><s>Here, we present IRS4 as a novel player in the BMP pathway, which physically interacts with the BMP receptor BMPRII and affects BMP-induced signalling in myoblasts.</s><s>We show that IRS4 interferes with BMP signal transduction by impinging on the abundance of its downstream signalling component Smad1.</s><s>The IRS4-dependent decrease of Smad1 protein is linked to enhanced ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Smad1 resulting in its reduced transcriptional activity.</s><s>In addition, IRS4 affects the non-Smad signalling branch by promoting Akt signalling in muscle cells.</s><s>Furthermore, our data provide clear evidence that IRS4 is expressed in myoblasts during mouse limb development as well as in postnatal satellite cells suggesting its involvement in myogenesis.</s><s>We show that the BMPRII interacting IRS4 serves as a novel platform for inhibition of BMP/Smad signalling along with an activation of the PI3K/Akt axis to promote differentiation of precursor cells to the myogenic lineage.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>IRS4 interacts with BMPRII in a ligand-independent manner at the plasma membrane.</s><s>IRS proteins are crucial mediators of various cellular functions.</s><s>They exhibit a common architecture comprised of conserved pleckstrin homology (PH) as well as phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains and a more variable C-terminus containing tyrosine and serine residues which can be phosphorylated.</s><s>Depending on the residues phosphorylated and the downstream effectors engaged, specific signalling outcomes are initiated.</s><s>Apart from general physiological functions such as glucose metabolism, mitogenesis and survival, IRS proteins exert more particular functions in a tissue-specific context <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>The relevance of Insulin Receptor Substrate 4 (IRS4) however has not been clarified yet.</s><s>Here, we aim to decipher its function as a novel modulator of BMP signalling.</s></p><p><s>A tandem affinity-based mass spectrometry approach was used to screen for proteins interacting with BMP receptors.</s><s>We identified several BMP receptor type II (BMPRII) associated proteins, among these IRS4, which co-precipitated with BMPRII long form both in the absence and presence of BMP2 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S1a</ref>).</s><s>BMPRII exists in two splice variants;

absence of ligand.</s><s>We speculate that scaffold protein IRS4 does not only interact with BMPRII and Smad1 but also associates with and thereby recruits components intimately linked to the ubiquitination/proteasomal machinery.</s><s>In conclusion, IRS4 expression fundamentally reduces steady-state Smad1 protein resulting in decreased transcriptional activity of Smads and thus repressed BMP/Smad signalling outcome.</s></p><p><s>In recent years, studies on the role of BMPs in muscle maintenance and regeneration emerged remarkably.</s><s>For example, it has been described that BMP signalling promotes proliferation of muscle precursor cells, while differentiation is rather inhibited <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> .</s><s>This blockage of differentiation is mediated by BMP-induced ID proteins, which bind to E-proteins thereby preventing the formation of transcriptional active heterodimers with myogenic regulatory factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, the BMP/Smad axis has been shown to exert positive effects on the regulation of muscle mass thus emphasizing a critical role for BMP signalling in muscle homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70</ref> .</s><s>We found that expression of IRS4, by counteracting BMP/Smad signalling, efficiently triggered myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells.</s><s>Concurrently, IRS4 knockdown in human myoblasts revealed an upregulation of ID1, while myogenic differentiation capacity was severely impaired.</s><s>We also confirmed this in primary muscle precursor cells by depletion of IRS4.</s><s>Of note, the pro-myogenic impact of IRS4 even appeared in the absence of exogenously added BMP, while the medium added for differentiation might contain some BMPs.</s><s>Our data strongly suggest that the promoting effect of IRS4 on myogenic differentiation might be a result of both inhibition of BMP/Smad signalling and at the same time activation of the Akt pathway.</s><s>Akt is a critical player during myogenic differentiation and triggers protein synthesis by activating the mTOR/p70S6K axis which is pivotal for not only muscle differentiation but also hypertrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71</ref> .</s><s>Simultaneously, active Akt inhibits GSK3β which itself is a potent suppressor of myogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73</ref> .</s><s>In line, we demonstrated that knockdown of IRS4 resulted in decreased Akt activation and lack of myotube formation.</s><s>Noteworthy, we found IRS4 protein levels in human myoblasts to be intimately linked to the cells' differentiation state: Once cells were terminally committed to the myogenic differentiation programme, as indicated by robust expression of Myogenin, IRS4 protein was downregulated while IRS4 level remained unaltered upon BMP2 treatment, indicating a critical role for IRS4 in regulating myogenic progenitor differentiation.</s><s>Comparable results were observed in cultured and differentiated primary satellite cells.</s><s>In conclusion, the pro-myogenic effect of IRS4 is likely due to a combination of BMP/Smad inhibition decreasing ID1 expression and alleviating its inhibitory effect on myogenic regulatory factors, and in addition interference of IRS4 with other pathways pivotal for myogenesis, e.g.</s><s>switching BMP signalling to the Akt pathway.</s><s>Our study demonstrates the important role of IRS4 in differentiation of muscle precursors for the first time and strongly emphasizes the relevance of IRS4 in skeletal muscle, one of the few tissues where it has been detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Male IRS4 knockout mice expression decreases during differentiation.</s><s>Human myoblasts were differentiated with or without 10 nM BMP2 for indicated times.</s><s>IRS4 expression was assessed by flow cytometry using a specific antibody (solid line) or isotype control IgG (dotted line).</s><s>Bar charts depict means ± SD of MFI values normalised to appropriate IgG control relative to d0 of 3 (w/o) or 2 (w/) independent experiments, respectively.</s><s>To analyse different proteins in the same samples simultaneously, membranes were cut accordingly and incubated with respective antibodies separately.</s><s>For a clear and concise data presentation, displayed blots were cropped slightly.</s><s>exhibited significantly reduced weight pointing to a muscle phenotype and indicates a role for IRS4 as a regulator of muscle differentiation/homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>This is further supported by our in vivo expression data of IRS4 in mouse myoblasts during embryonic and foetal development as well as in mouse satellite cells.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our results give the first functional evidence for IRS4 as a critical regulator of BMP/Smad and Akt signalling in the context of muscle differentiation.</s><s>This represents a new mechanism explaining cell-context specific actions of BMPs as IRS4 serves as a molecular switch in early myogenic differentiation and provides implications in muscle regeneration and maintenance.</s></p></div>
