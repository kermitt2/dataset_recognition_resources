<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of the SDFT injuries</head><p><s>The ultrasonographic images were reviewed and scored using a previously validated scoring system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> by a single researcher (R.A.).</s><s>Each ultrasonographic study was qualitatively assessed for the type of SDFT lesion (SDFT tendonitis with or without a core lesion, Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the length of the injury (number of zones affected; from 1 to ≥5 zones) and the location of the maximal injury zone (MIZ), defined as zones 1A-3C <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Three ultrasonographic parameters within the MIZ were assessed semiquantitatively: a) lesion echogenicity (anechoic, hypoechoic or hyperechoic); b) proportion of SDFT cross-sectional area affected (MIZ-CSA %), categorised into one of four groups: 1) &lt;25% of total tendon crosssectional area, 2) ≥25-50%, 3) ≥50-75% or 4) ≥75%; and c) proportion of disruption of the longitudinal fibre pattern (MIZ-LFP %), categorised into one of five groups: 0) no disruption; 1) &lt;25% disruption of the whole fibre pattern; 2) ≥25-50%; 3) ≥50-75% or 4) ≥75%.</s><s>Other information, such as the affected limb (right, left or both) and, in cases of SDF tendonitis with core lesion, the location of the core (central, peripheral or both) and number of lesions (one or two) were also recorded.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome</head><p><s>To evaluate the outcome of each case, the following data were analysed: sex, age at time of injury, country of origin, racing data (number of races, distance and earnings before and after injury), received treatment, date of the first race following injury, and the reason and date for retirement.</s><s>A successful return to racing was defined as horses that completed five or more races post-injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>Sample size for the study was estimated after analysis of a preliminary cohort study of racehorses over a 5-year period at the same location that were diagnosed with SDFT injury and subsequently retired or recovered and raced again.</s><s>Of the 245 horses, 108 retired due to the initial injury with 93 successfully racing again (≥5 races).</s><s>This gave the study an overall event rate of 44% for the primary outcome (raced successfully again or not).</s><s>The null hypothesis was that ultrasonography of the initial injury site had no clinical diagnostic value for predicting the successful return of a racehorse to racing (i.e. a baseline event rate of 44%).</s><s>We adopted a conservative approach and hypothesised that if ultrasonography at initial injury could better predict if a racehorse made a successful return to racing (≥5 races completed) by a 10-unit change (e.g. from baseline event rate of 44% to 34%) between categories of SDFT injury (e.g. between categories of longitudinal fibre pattern affected &lt;25% vs. ≥75%), this would be clinically significant.</s><s>The sample size required with 90% probability (power) to detect a difference (two-sided a of 0.05) was 203 cases in each arm of the study; a total of 406 cases were therefore required.</s><s>Over the 10-year period, clinical records of 469 cases in total were accessed, giving the study &gt;85% power to observe a 10% difference in our primary outcome.</s></p><p><s>Descriptive data are presented as either mean (AEs.</s><s>tendonitis with or without core lesion) were analysed as two separate data sets with individual descriptors.</s><s>Other factors related to horse (sex, weight and age at injury, country of origin and treatment) or to their racing career (number of races before and after injury and time to the first race post-injury) were also included in the statistical models as potential confounders (i.e. as co-variants, as appropriate).</s><s>The statistical model was built by first testing potentially important factors through univariate analysis, including those contributing at P≤0.10 into a multivariate analysis (generalised linear regression) with a binomial error distribution and a logistic-link function.</s><s>With 'successfully raced again' as the response variable (binomial; yes/no), factors hypothesised to affect that response were initially included as explanatory factors (i.e.</s><s>location of injury such as limb, number of zones affected, location of the MIZ, core or peripheral lesion, MIZ-cross-sectional area and MIZ-longitudinal fibre alignment) and the final model fit assessed by backward stepwise analysis.</s><s>Data are presented as predicted effect size AE s.e.d.</s><s>Effects were deemed as significant when P&lt;0.05.</s><s>All data analysis was undertaken with GenStat v18.</s><s>b</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatments</head><p><s>Treatment options were varied and included use of a controlled exercise programme, NSAIDs, steroids, blistering, shockwave, ice, intralesional therapy (Platelet rich plasma, Stem cell therapy), surgery (i.e.</s><s>desmotomy of the accessory ligament of the SDFT) or various combinations of these.</s><s>The study was powered and designed to test the primary outcome (successfully raced again after SDFT injury) rather than the efficacy of a particular treatment regimen.</s><s>Hence, interpretation of secondary outcomes such as treatments for SDFT are not within the scope of the study, but are included for interest and with a cautionary note in supplementary information (Supplementary Item 3).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors influencing a successful return to racing</head><p><s>In Group 1, five factors at the time of the initial injury were found to significantly influence the chances of successfully returning to racing: age of the horse (P&lt;0.001),</s><s>number of starts prior to the injury (P&lt;0.001),</s><s>location of the core lesion (P = 0.02), MIZ-CSA grade (P = 0.03) and MIZechogenicity grade (P = 0.029).</s><s>Despite investigating the same factors in Group 2, only two US parameters were significant; MIZ-echogenicity (P&lt;0.001) and MIZ-LFP (P = 0.002).</s><s>Further multivariate logistic regression analysis of factors important for a successful return to racing in Group 1 and Group 2 was performed separately.</s><s>For Group 1, MIZ-CSA (P = 0.03), MIZ-echogenicity (P = 0.04) and core lesion location (P = 0.04), and for Group 2, MIZ-LFP (P = 0.002) and MIZ-echogenicity (P = 0.008) remained as significant influences.</s><s>More specifically, a reduction in echogenicity (hypoechoic or anechoic) of the MIZ at the time of injury was found to be significant in both groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Predicting values for a successful return to racing (completing ≥5 races) are presented for MIZ-CSA in Group 1 and MIZ-LFP in Group 2 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This is the first study to describe how specific features from the first ultrasonographic examination of a forelimb SDFT injury can be used to predict likely long-term outcome for that racehorse (successfully completing ≥5 races after injury).</s><s>In particular, cases in which a high proportion of the tendon CSA was affected (≥50%) or where there was significant disruption of the LFP (≥75%) had a reduced likelihood of making a successful return to racing.</s><s>In accordance with previous research, completion of five or more races is considered an appropriate indicator for successful treatment and return to productive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our finding that the right forelimb was injured more often than the left is in agreement with previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>This may reflect that training and racing at the HKJC is mainly in a clockwise direction.</s><s>In contrast, the left forelimb was found to be more commonly affected in horses worked in an anticlockwise direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>These findings suggest that the inside limb, which tends to be the lead limb at the gallop around a bend <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, is predisposed to injury.</s><s>This cannot simply be explained by the magnitude of loads as the ground reaction force is highest in the nonlead limb at the canter and is predicted to be similar at higher speeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Further biomechanical studies are required to elucidate potential mechanisms behind this risk factor.</s></p><p><s>In this study, the prevalence of bilateral SDFT pathology was less than 10%, which is in contrast to National Hunt (NH) racehorses in the UK where both forelimbs are affected in 35% of cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Shorter races, different loads in the absence of jumps and younger horses may account for this variation.</s><s>Previous studies have found that the risk of injury increases with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, which was explained by age-related changes in the tendon matrix.</s><s>Conversely, this study found that the number of SDFT injuries increased gradually up to the age of 4 years old and then decreased.</s><s>However, data were not analysed in relation to the total number of horses racing/training at different ages and therefore the prevalence of SDFT tendonitis in this population was not assessed.</s><s>In addition, some horses without a complete initial ultrasonographic examination were excluded.</s><s>Male sex has also been previously identified as an associated risk factor for SDFT injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, this could not be corroborated in this study as almost all included horses were male.</s><s>Currently, evidence is contradictory about the effect of racing (number of starts) prior to the injury.</s><s>Tendon pathology may accumulate during a horse 0 s racing career, which could increase the risk of injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, although this is confounded with increasing age.</s><s>On the other hand, one study has shown that the number of races completed before injury is associated with a decrease in the risk of tendon injury, suggesting a protective effect.</s><s>Musculoskeletal tissue remodelling following racing/training could lead to tendons that are more resistant to damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the current study, the MIZ was the mid-metacarpus region (i.e.</s><s>zones 2B and 3A), which is in accordance with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Despite cross-sectional area of the SDFT being lowest at this location, the tendon is not significantly weaker <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>However, blood supply to the tendon matrix is minimal in the mid metacarpus region, which may predispose the tendon to hypoxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and/or hyperthermia during exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>This may result in localised necrosis and degeneration of matrix, which may predispose to injury.</s></p><p><s>When present, core lesions were more commonly located centrally (53%) than towards the periphery (39%) of the tendon, which is in agreement with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Core lesions may be related to pre-existing microdamage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> or degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which is more likely to occur in the central region of the tendon during high-speed locomotion.</s><s>Nevertheless, there was no statistical association between the location of the core lesion at the MIZ and successful return to racing.</s><s>In cases with a core lesion, the proportion of the cross-sectional area of the tendon affected at the MIZ was related to the likelihood of a successful return to racing as in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>The proportion of the cross-sectional area of the tendon affected has been suggested as the most objective measure of tendon pathology as it can be assessed accurately using ultrasonography and it is a relative measure and, as such, less affected by variation in technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Cases that had both peripheral and central core lesions at the MIZ, were significantly less likely to race again, which may simply reflect the fact that the overall proportion of the tendon cross-sectional area affected was greater.</s></p><p><s>In cases with tendonitis without an obvious core lesion, the percentage of cross-sectional area affected at the MIZ was not a useful predictor of return to racing.</s><s>However, the injuries in the majority of the horses in this group did not affect a high percentage of the tendon 0 s cross-sectional area, giving low statistical power to this US parameter.</s><s>The percentage of longitudinal fibre pattern affected at the MIZ was found to be the strongest factor influencing a successful return to racing in these cases.</s></p><p><s>Reduced echogenicity (hypoechoic or anechoic) represented an important, and significant factor influencing the likelihood of a successful return to racing in both groups.</s><s>However, this US parameter should be considered a confounding factor for both Groups 1 and 2, since all acute injuries are, by definition, either hypoechoic or anechoic and all cases in this study were acute (assessed by US at the time of injury).</s><s>The hypoechoic or anechoic appearance of acute SDFT lesions represents haemorrhage, oedema and early granulation of tissue within the lesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>There were no hyperechoic lesions in this study.</s></p><p><s>There is some discussion that cases of SDFT tendonitis with a discrete core lesion may represent more severe injuries than those without a core lesion.</s><s>However, this study found that in cases that successfully return to racing, the average time to first start and the number of races following injury was similar between the two types of injury.</s><s>Both types of injury should therefore be considered equally important.</s></p><p><s>A potential limitation of this study is operator and equipment related variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Ultrasonographic exams were obtained over a 10-year period by several different clinicians using different ultrasound machines.</s><s>However, all ultrasonographic images were analysed by a single person (R.A.) in this study using an ultrasonographic scoring system that has been previously validated <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, allowing for a more objective, reliable and repeatable assessment of all images.</s><s>Although no attempt was made to assess or compare the quality of the images, which is also a potential limitation of this retrospective study, the test conditions throughout the study were kept consistent.</s><s>The ultrasonographic scoring system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> used in this study had been previously validated by experienced clinicians using only clinical cases from this population and included cases from each year of study.</s><s>In this study, the date of the first scan was used as the date of the injury.</s><s>It is acknowledged, however, that a majority of horses may have sustained the injury a few days before the initial exam, as a fixed protocol for reporting of SDFT injury was not in place.</s><s>Nevertheless, this minor difference in time of injury should not materially affect our primary outcome.</s><s>Indeed, performing US examinations too soon after injury can result in an underestimation of injury severity, as SDFT injuries tend to worsen within the first 7 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The range of treatments used for SDFT injury in this study were varied and beyond the control of the investigators, since we were conducting a retrospective analysis.</s><s>However, as a potential confounder for our primary outcome we considered the effect of differing treatments.</s><s>Ideally, if a severe injury is present then the average time to retirement should be less than 7 days.</s><s>Reaching this decision between the owner, trainer and veterinarian could sometimes take significantly longer.</s><s>Therefore, for this part of the study, the authors have excluded all the horses that were retired within the first 28 days post-injury.</s><s>We suggest that the current ultrasonographic study can help inform that evidence-base such that other reasons like a horse's ability/performance, value, concomitant maladies or age are secondary to simple facts about the nature and extent of the lesion itself.</s><s>As a result, reaching any decision that could once take many days and only increase the retirement time of some of those horses and reduce their welfare could be made almost immediately at the time of initial examination.</s><s>For this study, horses retired within the first 28 days following SDFT injury were considered retired straight away without any attempt to return to training/racing.</s><s>This explains that the average retirement time for horses that were retired straight away in this study is 12 and 6 days for Groups 1 and 2 respectively.</s><s>There were not enough cases included in the study to perform valid statistical analysis to evaluate intralesional therapies or surgical treatment.</s><s>The confidence intervals for  those treatments analysed were wide, indicating low sample size with high variability.</s><s>Based on these results, it is unlikely that any of the assessed treatments influenced the results of this study.</s><s>Indeed, when included as potential confounders in a logistic regression model, our main outcomes remained significant.</s><s>Reaching agreement among veterinarian, owners and trainers is always difficult as each have differing priorities (i.e.</s><s>clinical, financial and practical issues are involved).</s><s>Variation in healing and subsequent success in racing could potentially be a confounding factor in this study due to variation in treatment, amount of rest and the type of rehabilitation.</s></p><p><s>The study population reported here is unique and highly controlled, in that it includes almost entirely male racehorses that train and compete in a clockwise direction on the same dirt or turf surface, respectively.</s><s>Therefore, these predictive factors should be used with caution in other sporting horse populations (i.e.</s><s>eventers, showjumpers or Thoroughbred racehorses racing in other countries) as different factors might be involved.</s></p><p><s>Future studies are warranted to characterise SDFT injury in other sport disciplines.</s></p><p><s>This study presents robust evidence that ultrasonography has value in characterising the extent and nature of SDFT injuries.</s><s>It also provides data on predictive factors based on simple ultrasonographic measures which can be easily applied in equine practice.</s><s>The key factors at the site of maximal injury were the extent of cross-sectional area affected in cases with a core lesion, or the severity of longitudinal fibre pattern disruption in cases without a core lesion.</s><s>All assessments were made at the initial ultrasound examination of the horse.</s><s>Our data, therefore, will enable equine clinicians to make early evidence-based decisions on SDFT injury.</s><s>This will significantly affect racehorse welfare in the short-and long-term, as it provides a scientific basis for owners and trainers to make timely decisions, and consider early retirement or alternative career options for specific horses.</s></p></div>
