<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Drug screening for the identification of compounds with anticancer activity is commonly performed using cell lines cultured under normal oxygen pressure and physiological pH.</s><s>However, solid tumors are characterized by a microenvironment with limited access to nutrients, reduced oxygen supply and acidosis.</s><s>Tumor hypoxia and acidosis have been identified as important drivers of malignant progression and contribute to multicellular resistance to different forms of therapy.</s><s>Tumor acidosis represents an important mechanism mediating drug resistance thus the identification of drugs active on acid-adapted cells may improve the efficacy of cancer therapy.</s></p><p><s>Methods: Here, we characterized human colon carcinoma cells (HCT116) chronically adapted to grow at pH 6.8 and used them to screen the Prestwick drug library for cytotoxic compounds.</s><s>Analysis of gene expression profiles in parental and low pH-adapted cells showed several differences relating to cell cycle, metabolism and autophagy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>The screen led to the identification of several compounds which were further selected for their preferential cytotoxicity towards acid-adapted cells.</s><s>Amongst 11 confirmed hits, we primarily focused our investigation on the benzoporphyrin derivative Verteporfin (VP).</s><s>VP significantly reduced viability in low pH-adapted HCT116 cells as compared to parental HCT116 cells and normal immortalized epithelial cells.</s><s>The cytotoxic activity of VP was enhanced by light activation and acidic pH culture conditions, likely via increased acid-dependent drug uptake.</s><s>VP displayed the unique property to cause light-dependent cross-linking of proteins and resulted in accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins without inducing inhibition of the proteasome.</s></p><p><s>Conclusions: Our study provides an example and a tool to identify anticancer drugs targeting acid-adapted cancer cells.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activity of Verteporfin in acidic and metabolically-stressed colon cancer cells</head><p><s>VP (trade name Visudyne ¬Æ ) is a benzoporphyrine derivative used as a photodynamic agent for the treatment of macular degeneration, with limited toxicity.</s><s>Recent studies have proposed that VP has anticancer activity both in vitro and in preclinical animal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, VP has been suggested as a specific inhibitor of the YAP-1 protein whose role is important in the biology of colon carcinoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Firstly, we confirmed that VP was equally effective in reducing viability of AA-HCT116 cells with respect to their parental cell line by viability assay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>) and clonogenic cell survival (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>) using monolayer cultures.</s><s>Data from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref> indicates that the IC 50 of VP for HCT116 and AA-HCT116 cells are 3.4 ¬±0 .77</s><s>ŒºM and 1.72 ¬± 0.43 ŒºM, respectively (P‚â§0.05).</s><s>Taken together these results suggest that VP can be effective in killing cancer cells in metabolically stressed environments.</s><s>To confirm this, we tested the activity of VP in the 3D model of multicellular spheroids (MCS).</s><s>MCS more accurately reproduce the biochemical and metabolic heterogeneity of the tumor environment by containing hypoxic and acidic regions when compared to monolayer cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, many of the hit compounds identified in our screen have been reported to inhibit mitochondrial function in 3D drug screening models using HCT116 cells suggesting some selectivity for metabolically stressed cores <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>We observed that VP was effective in reducing cell viability of MCS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>), similar to compounds like salinomycin (SAL) and VLX600 which have been recently reported to have a strong killing activity in MCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Given the light-sensitive nature of VP we conducted experiments under conditions where the cultures were either expose or not to ambient light.</s><s>When the activity of VP on MCS was analysed in terms of clonogenic cell survival we observed a dramatic, light-dependent inhibitory effect even at very low VP doses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>).</s><s>In fact, despite being a photosensitizing agent, VP has been reported to inhibit cell growth of different cancer cell lines even without light activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s>In line with these findings, VP exposure to ambient light resulted in a dramatic enhancement in cytotoxic activity in both HCT116 and AA-HCT116 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5e, f</ref> ).</s><s>Importantly, in our experimental settings we did not employ the specific 690 nm wavelength laser light that is routinely used for photodynamic activation of VP, but instead we simply exposed the treated cell cultures to ambient light for 30 min before moving the plates into the incubator.</s><s>Pharmacological properties of compounds such as solubility, logD and pKa are determinants of drug sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>VP is an acidic compound with a predicted pKa of 4.12 and in line with this we observed increased intracellular VP levels by approximately threefold in AA-HCT116 cells as compared to parental HCT116 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s><s>This increased accumulation in acidic conditions was confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>) on AA-HCT116 and by fluorimetric analysis on parental HCT116 cells transiently exposed to pH 6.8 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>).</s><s>These data suggest that acidic conditions enhance uptake and intracellular VP availability.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VP alters levels of polyubiquitinated proteins without inhibition of the proteasome</head><p><s>Due to the reported activity of VP as an autophagy inhibitor, we next investigated whether it differentially affected autophagic flux (AF) in parental and AA-HCT116 cells.</s><s>Surprisingly, we observed that AF measured by WB analysis of LC3-II was not significantly altered under VP treatment in either cell line (Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>).</s><s>In line with RNAseq data in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>, we observe that basal expression of SQSTM1 is increased in AA-HCT116 cells.</s><s>SQSTM1 is a protein that functions as an autophagy receptor shuttling ubiquitinated proteins for autophagosomal mediated degradation.</s><s>VP treatment caused the disappearance of the autophagy cargo receptor SQSTM1 at the expected molecular weight.</s><s>VP was recently reported to cause cross-linking of SQSTM1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and in fact, we observed that VP treatment caused a concentration-dependent accumulation of high-MW (&gt; 62 kDa) SQSTM1 that was concomitant with loss of SQSTM1 at the expected MW (Additional file 3: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A</ref>).</s><s>Such an effect of VP on protein oligomerization was recently reported for STAT3 and mTOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s>Treatment of HCT116 and AA-HCT116 with VP induced protein oligomerization of mTOR and GRP78 also in our hands (Additional file 3: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3B, C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We reasoned that disturbance of SQSTM1 function might alter the dynamics of the UPS in AA-HCT116 cells.</s><s>Utilizing the RNA-seq data, we could identify a clear differential expression of UPS-related genes in AA-HCT116 cells, suggesting that changes in the UPS could be responsible for the increased sensitivity of AA-HCT116 cells to VP treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>).</s><s>Gene ontology (GO) analysis further supported this observation, revealing enrichment of several UPS related gene ontology terms (Additional file 3: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3D</ref>).</s><s>As observed for Bortezomib (BZ), a known proteasome inhibitor, VP treatment also induced a concentration-dependent accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins and concurrent decrease in the amount of free ubiquitin (Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>), which normally indicates defective proteasomal degradation and/or deubiquitination activity.</s><s>Interestingly, VP seems to induce the appearance of polyubiquitin complexes with MW higher than those induced by Bortezomib, suggesting some differences in the mechanism of action of these two drugs.</s><s>To investigate this possibility, we used Suc LLVY-AMC, a fluorogenic substrate for measuring the chymotrypsin-like peptidase activity of the 20S proteasome.</s><s>HCT116 and AA-HCT116 cells were treated with 1 and 5 ¬µM VP, with BZ used as positive control.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7d</ref>-e, while the proteolytic activity of the proteasome was strongly reduced by treatment with BZ, no major effects were observed on either of the cell lines treated with VP.</s><s>Consistent with this observation, VP did not affect degradation of the proteasome substrate UbG76 V-YFP in the MelJuSo reporter cell line, indicating that proteasomal degradation is fully functional in VP-treated cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">7f</ref> ).</s><s>Moreover, unlike BZ, VP does not affect the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A, a protein whose turnover is regulated by proteasomal degradation (Fig. <ref type="figure">7g</ref>).</s><s>Due to the light-dependent effects of VP on cell viability, we assessed the effects of light exposure during the treatment and protein extraction steps.</s><s>As shown in Additional file 3: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3E</ref>, the presence of high MW polyubiquitinated proteins was observed when all experimental procedures were conducted in presence of light.</s><s>In contrast no polyubiquitinated proteins were observed when all procedures were conducted in complete darkness.</s><s>Taken together, these experiments show that although VP induced the accumulation of high MW ubiquitinated proteins, this effect is light dependent and not due to inhibition of proteasomal activity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Tumor acidosis has been acknowledged as an important feature of solid tumors that can dramatically alter pathobiology of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Although it has been known that acidosis also negatively modulates drug sensitivity, few studies have aimed to identify agents with preferential activity towards cancer cells cultured in acidic conditions.</s><s>Standard 2D cell culture has long been applied for the identification of compounds with activities on either proliferation or cell survival in preclinical settings.</s><s>Conventional culture conditions imply the use of media with high glucose content, non-physiological oxygen pressure and alkaline pH set at 7.4.</s><s>Overall, such conditions are poorly representative of the complex physiological environment that cancer cells experience in vivo and hence drug screening performed in these simplified conditions might overestimate the potential clinical efficacy of identified compounds.</s><s>With the aim to partially overcome such limitations, we developed and characterized HCT116 cells chronically adapted to low pH culture conditions.</s><s>To our knowledge, the characterization of the transcriptome of acid adapted cells has thus far been limited.</s><s>RNAseq analysis was applied to define major differences between parental and adapted cell lines, as In line with previous reports on other cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, AA-HCT116 cells show upregulation of several autophagy genes.</s><s>AA-HCT116 cells also upregulate the expression of CD274 (PDL-1), a molecule whose expression on tumor cells mediates immunosuppression by inhibiting the activation of CTL and NK cells.</s><s>Interestingly, acidosis is known to have a strong immunosuppressive activity, thus modulation of tumor acidosis has been suggested as a mechanism to improve immune therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s>An initial pilot screen with clinically used anticancer drugs showed that nearly all drugs had a lower cytotoxicity on AA-HCT116 as compared to parental HCT116 cells, confirming that cells chronically adapted to acidosis are resistant to many chemotherapeutics.</s><s>Interestingly, Everolimus was recently reported to selectively target melanoma cells adapted to acidic pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and in our study the activity of Everolimus and Sorafenib was similar in the two cell lines.</s></p><p><s>These findings prompted us to use systematic screening to identify compounds with cytotoxic activity also against acid-adapted colon carcinoma cells, leading to the identification of VP as an interesting hit, with equipotent activity also on the adapted cell line.</s><s>VP has been safely used as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of acute macular degeneration and it is under investigation in PDT of pancreatic cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, it was suggested that VP specifically targets Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Based on this report, VP has been used as a pharmacological tool to study the protumorigenic activity of YAP1 in several cancer models <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, some studies have also suggested that VP inhibits YAP activity in the absence of light activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>.</s><s>However, a very recent study has shown that VP demonstrate activity against cancer cell lines that is independent of YAP1 and instead dependent on the ability to induce high MW protein oligomers, in particular STAT3 and SQSTM1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, VP was recently shown to induce cross-linking of SQSTM1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>In line with these studies, we observed that treatment with VP induces the accumulation of protein oligomers, including SQSTM1, GRP78 and mTOR.</s></p><p><s>Here, we extend these studies to demonstrate that the activity of VP towards cancer cells is pH-dependent and light-dependent and associated with protein crosslinking and alterations of polyubiquitinated proteins.</s><s>The exact mechanism by which VP induces such a phenomenon is still unclear.</s><s>However, we could exclude any involvement of the proteasome since we did not observe any inhibition of proteasomal function upon VP treatment using three different methods.</s><s>Importantly, we observed that treatment of cells and protein extraction in complete darkness totally abolished the effects of VP on the observed accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting that extreme care should be taken in experimental studies addressing the mechanism of action of this drug, as recently pointed out by Kostantinou and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, contrary to many studies where exposure to ambient light is not specifically addressed in experimental procedures, these authors present strong experimental evidence that cross-linked oligomers and formation of high MW complexes is mostly a light dependent mechanism.</s><s>In line with this, we observed that the effects of VP on cell viability was also light-dependent since exposure of VP to ambient light for 30 min before treatment greatly increased VP effects in both HCT116 and AA-HCT116 cells.</s></p><p><s>Although the scope of this study was not to unravel the molecular mechanism by which VP affects cancer cell viability, we observed that VP has a preferential activity towards colon cancer cells grown in acidic conditions.</s><s>This might be simply related to the higher intracellular availability of VP in both AA-HCT116 and parental HCT116 cells transiently exposed to acidic medium.</s><s>This behavior may be predicted by the acidic pKa of the compound, which likely facilitates the uptake and intracellular availability.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our study describes the phenotypic and transcriptomic profile of acid adapted colon cancer cells.</s><s>We used these cells to screen a library of FDA-approved compounds and identified Verteporfin as a hit compound preferentially targeting acidic cancer cells.</s><s>Given that VP (Visudyne ¬Æ ) is already available for therapeutic applications, its use as anticancer agent might be easily translated into clinical oncology for specific cancer types.</s></p></div>
