<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Trial Design and Participants.</head><p><s>The study protocol was designed by experts from Department of Hematology and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital.</s><s>Study approval was obtained from ethics committees at our hospital.</s><s>They were responsible for the training and guidance of investigators and oversaw all aspects of coordination and data collection.</s><s>Records of the allocation details were kept at our hospital for data verification and checking at monitoring visits.</s><s>The study was undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and registered at http://www.chictr.org.cn</s><s>(Clinical Trials.</s><s>Gov ID: ChiCTR-INR-16009001).</s></p><p><s>This was a single-center, prospective, randomized, openlabel, controlled clinical trial of ZPO versus chlorhexidine dressing for HU-induced leg ulcers in patients with MPNs.</s><s>We recruited 71 patients from Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital between July 2016 and April 2018.</s><s>Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years and no older than 70 years, had histologically or cytologically confirmed MPNs which were treated with HU, and had grade 1 to 3 leg ulcer (Wagner's classification) that had persisted for at least 2 months.</s><s>Patients who had severe infection or autoimmune disease, severe liver, kidney, cardiovascular and mental diseases, diabetes, severe malnutrition, or history of bleeding disorder were excluded.</s><s>Enrolled patients who had severe adverse events, who had poor compliance, and who asked for withdrawal were eliminated.</s><s>All patients provided written informed consent.</s></p><p><s>The primary objective was to compare rate of complete healing with co-primary analyses of ulcer improvement (changes in the area of the ulcer) and healing time (number of days taken to achieve complete wound healing).</s><s>Secondary endpoint was adverse events which were evaluated and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE 4.0).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Procedures.</head><p><s>Based on our preliminary experimental results, the rate of complete healing of the intervention group and control group at the fourth week was 95% and 64%, respectively.</s><s>Accordingly, in this superiority trial, the sample size was 54 (with = 0.05, two-tailed and = 0.2).</s><s>All eligible patients were randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to receive either ZPO or chlorhexidine dressing with standard wound care.</s><s>Randomization lists were generated through http://www.randomizer.org</s><s>and held at our hospital.</s></p><p><s>The pharmacological properties of ZPO are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>ZPO was manufactured by the pharmacy of our hospital by the standard preparation method of traditional Chinese ointment medicine.</s><s>The entire process was carried out in a bacteria-free environment and with strict quality control.</s></p><p><s>Standard wound care included local debridement of necrotic tissue or callus and dressing changes once daily until the wounds were completely healed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>All wounds were cleansed with sterile saline prior to assessment and dressing application.</s><s>ZPO (about 1 mm thick) was applied to the surface of the ulcer which was then covered by a sterile dressing.</s><s>For the control group, chlorhexidine dressing was applied to the surface of the ulcer directly.</s><s>The duration of follow-up was 8 weeks and every patient was followed up once a week.</s><s>Changes in the area of the ulcer (cm 2 ) were assessed at each follow-up visit.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>HU-induced leg ulcers, though rare, are recalcitrant to treatment and mandate cessation of HU therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>The  present randomized trial showed that the Chinese medicinal herbal ZPO was effective in promoting the healing of HUinduced leg ulcers, providing an alternative treatment for the disease.</s></p><p><s>HU remains the therapeutic choice for myeloproliferative neoplasms such as polycythemia vera <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, essential thrombocythemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and myelofibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Painful leg ulcers are a rare but troublesome complication that has been described in patients receiving high-dose, long-term HU treatment, often leading to discontinuation of HU.</s><s>Although the exact mechanism for the development of this complication is still unclear, it has been hypothesized that inadvertent minor injury to the malleolar region that is inadequately repaired may jeopardize the regenerative potential of the epidermis.</s></p><p><s>To date, only single case reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> or singlecenter experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> have been published regarding this phenomenon, with a reported incidence ranging from 5% to 10% of HU treated patients.</s><s>A 5% incidence of skin ulcers during HU treatment also has been reported in a large randomized trial in patients with essential thrombocythemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Currently, the occurrence of skin ulcers during HU treatment is considered as HU intolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our data suggested that during the first three weeks, the two groups showed no statistically significant difference in the area healed (%), but by week 4, patients receiving ZPO exhibited a significant improvement compared to the control group.</s><s>Moreover, all patients in the intervention group achieved complete healing at week 4.</s><s>In addition, the intervention group achieved healing significantly more rapidly than the control group, with significantly fewer pathological scars, highlighting the efficacy of ZPO in healing HU-induced leg ulcers.</s></p><p><s>The underlying mechanism for the ulcer healing effects of ZPO still remains unclear.</s><s>In chronic skin ulcer, intense and persistent inflammatory response, reduced angiogenesis and cell proliferation, decreased cell growth factors and collagen synthesis and degradation of excessive extracellular matrix all contribute to impairment of wound healing.</s><s>Amongst these, the regeneration of capillary and vascular network formation plays an important role.</s><s>As the most important regulatory factor of angiogenesis and neovascularization, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can stimulate the formation, proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells of the blood vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The continuous secretion of VEGF plays a very important role in accelerating wound healing.</s><s>Another study conducted by our team on the treatment of nonhealing wounds after breast cancer operation showed that the expression of VEGF in wound tissues was upregulated in patients treated with ZPO (data not shown).</s><s>Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch, a component of ZPO, was reported to promote gastric ulcer healing by regulating inflammatory mediators <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>We speculate that the ZPO may improve wound healing via multiple mechanisms including modulating the content of VEGF or inflammatory mediators.</s><s>The levels of these molecules were not investigated in the current study and are worthy of further exploration.</s></p><p><s>Given the limited treatment options for HU-induced leg ulcers, our current randomized controlled trial demonstrated that the ZPO offers an effective therapeutic option for HUinduced leg ulcers.</s><s>The study has certain limitations.</s><s>The study population is relatively small, given the rarity of the condition.</s><s>In addition, our hospital is a tertiary care center and the findings of the study may not be applicable to primary care settings.</s><s>Furthermore, a mixture of medicinal herbs was used in the ZPO, rendering it difficult to attribute the actions of the ointment to any particular compound.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our randomized controlled trial demonstrates that the ZPO is effective in promoting the healing of HU-induced leg ulcers in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, providing a therapeutic option for a condition that is recalcitrant to conventional therapy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
