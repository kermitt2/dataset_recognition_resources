<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Rare conditions -Disorders/differences in sex development "Disorders/differences of sex development (DSD)" is used as an umbrella term for various rare conditions that are characterized by an incongruence of chromosomal, gonadal and genital sex development.</s><s>The approximate incidence of genital anomalies is estimated to occur 1:4500 live births <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The term DSD and a new system for nomenclature were introduced by the Chicago Consensus Group in 2005, replacing previous nomenclature that was perceived negatively by affected individuals.</s><s>The classification of DSD distinguishes three major groups: (1) DSD with atypical sex chromosome configurations, including Turner syndrome (45,X0 and mosaicisms), Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY and mosaicisms) and conditions with 45,X/46,XY or 46,XX/46,XY karyotypes; (2) XY DSD, encompassing conditions characterized by 46,XY karyotype and impairment of testicular development, androgen biosynthesis or action, AMH biosynthesis or action, hypospadias, cloacal exstrophy and other syndromic forms; (3) XX DSD, comprising conditions characterized by 46,XX karyotype and androgen excess, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, P450 oxidoreductase deficiency, aromatase deficiency or exogenous causes, impairment of ovarian, uterine or vaginal development and other syndromic forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The multitude of mechanisms related to sex determination and sex differentiation-such as genes involved in gonadal development, androgen receptor function and steroid biosynthesis-makes the diagnoses of the XY DSD group complex and challenging.</s><s>The heterogeneity of clinical presentations of DSD conditions results in variations of treatment options, including medical, surgical or psychotherapeutic, while their rarity carries the consequence of limited ad hoc knowledge about those various options <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Clinical studies on DSD are often single-centre experiences from regional samples with a limited number of unambiguous diagnoses of participants, and many of the studies lack appropriate comparison groups.</s></p><p><s>The comparability of these studies is often impeded because different definitions and study methodologies are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The study dsd-LIFE, funded by the European Commission (7th Framework Programme, FP7), has sought to overcome some of the above-mentioned challenges by using a standardized and consistent study methodology in a large number of individuals with DSD conditions in six European countries.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods/Design</head><p><s>The dsd-LIFE study dsd-LIFE investigates and compares the long-term outcomes of surgical and hormonal therapy and psychological and social support in adequate numbers of adolescents (from the age of 16) and adults with DSD conditions, aiming to provide the basis for improvements in evidence-based recommendations for care.</s><s>The long-term impact of the study is expected to result in improvement of care and subsequently higher overall quality of life (QoL) and better integration and participation of individuals with DSD in society.</s><s>To reach these aims, we assessed as main outcomes QoL, psychosexual and mental health aspects.</s><s>As determinants we collected objective data on sociodemographic factors, social participation, religion, culture, physical and mental health, risk for mental health such as anxiety, depression, autism and ADHD, treatments such as genital surgery and hormone therapy, fertility, psychological and social support, current and past health care, psychological factors such as self-esteem, coping, autonomy, attachment and subjective appraisal of relationships as well as appraisal of relations and personal' views on ethics of care (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The dsd-LIFE consortium consists of 16 European partners from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom (UK).</s><s>Fourteen of these partners acted as recruiting sites, including Berlin, München, Lübeck, Münster (D), Paris, Lyon Montpellier and Toulouse (F); Amsterdam and Nijmegen (NL); Lodz and Warszawa (P); Stockholm (S); and Birmingham (UK) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In addition to the recruiting sites, the consortium included one centre with expertise in medical ethics (Göttingen) and one partner with expertise in European community (EC) project management (München).</s><s>The Scientific Advisory Board consisted of international experts in the fields of endocrinology, psychology, surgery, and ethics and a representative of a longstanding patient support group for androgen insensitivity syndrome.</s><s>An important scientific basis for this study was the results of a German network DSD study published in 2009, which was the largest clinical evaluation study of DSD available at the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this paper, we outline the theoretical and methodological framework of the study.</s><s>We compare the study aims related to participation rates and data quality to the actual sample recruited and the information that became available from various sources.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual model, study design and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual model</head><p><s>Historically, clinicians, administrators, researchers, and policy makers have evaluated the effectiveness of treatments and interventions with little input from patients.</s><s>With the rising participation of patients and clients in shared decision making, evaluation of the impact of care on day-to-day life has become increasingly important.</s><s>When validated questionnaires are administered directly to participants without involving clinicians, they are called patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and may include reports on objective parameters such as sociodemographic factors, measures of functioning and health status as well as subjective appraisal of one's QoL and other relevant aspects of well-being.</s><s>Conceptually, dsd-LIFE developed a framework to determine the major outcome QoL solely from the subjective perspective of the participant and adopted the definition of health proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO), namely, physical, psychological and social well-being (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>For each dimension of QoL, dsd-LIFE sought to collect information from at least one additional perspective.</s><s>For physical health, dsd-LIFE aimed to collect data from clinicians through medical histories, clinical examinations and data documented in medical records.</s><s>For psychological health, we probed for indicators of special health care needs, clinical diagnoses and screening instruments of mental health conditions.</s><s>For social well-being, we collected information on sociodemographics, participation and inclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>For satisfaction with health care, we measured the subjective rating of the participants of the care they had received, such as satisfaction with medical and psychological care, medical information management, patientcentred care and doctors' behaviour.</s><s>To relate outcomes to treatments, we collected medical data of current and past treatments and interventions from medical files as available.</s><s>The overall aim of the study was to improve health care in the clinical population of individuals with DSD conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>dsd-LIFE was designed as a non-interventional, clinical, cross-sectional study.</s><s>The inclusion criteria covered all conditions described as DSD in the classification system of the Chicago Consensus Conference and an age of 16 years or older.</s><s>Verification of the correct diagnosis was conducted by examining clinical medical and genetic data; all participants had to be seen at least once at one of the recruiting sites.</s><s>Health status was assessed by a physical examination, potentially augmented by further examinations.</s><s>Current and past treatment data were obtained from a medical interview and medical chart review.</s><s>The wide age range of the subjects allowed assessment and comparison of treatments that were typical in certain decades but changed over time.</s><s>PRO data came mainly from an online survey, allowing privacy and confidentiality for all participants.</s><s>The design was chosen to allow the analysis of associations of treatments and interventions experienced in the past with contemporary QoL, physical and mental health, psychosexual functioning and satisfaction with care.</s><s>In addition, we sought to examine participants' views and perspectives on the ethics of general health care and controversial treatments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We did not recruit a comparison or control group, but results of major outcomes will be compared to reference data.</s><s>Moreover, we planned to use group comparisons of the diagnoses within the sample because some issues such as e.g.</s><s>fertility or psychosexual problems are, to varying degrees, issues for all people affected by DSD.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p><s>The use of available, standardized instruments with reference data from the general population was preferred whenever possible, thus allowing comparisons to the general population, specifically in the areas of sociodemographics, QoL and screening measures of physical and mental health, psychosexual outcome, psychological factors and overall satisfaction with health care.</s><s>For specific aspects of DSD, we included "self-constructed" items.</s><s>The iterative review of the suggested instruments and measurements was performed by experienced patient support group representatives and by the project's Advisory Board.</s><s>For application of the final questionnaire in all studyrelevant languages (Dutch, English, French, German, Polish, and Swedish), professional translation of the instruments used was required.</s><s>To some extent, the standardized instruments chosen were available in the languages needed (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>For those instruments and (self-constructed) items that required translation, we followed the linguistic validation process of the international translation guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical interview, retrospective chart review and medical examinations (part 1)</head><p><s>Generally, the data came from a personal medical review on contemporary signs and symptoms, past medical history and a physical examination with a physician; the data were input by a study nurse or physician (case report form; CRF):</s></p><p><s>1.</s><s>The medical interview (239 items) collected standardized information on the diagnosis, karyotype and comorbidities of the participants and their families, physical activity, smoking behaviour, current therapy, application, therapy monitoring, previous hormone therapies and psychological counselling and menstruation.</s></p><p><s>A retrospective chart review of past diagnosis and medical treatment was performed to obtain information from medical records, including birth history and genital phenotype at diagnosis, date of diagnosis, and hormones and hormone therapy at diagnosis (dosage, application) (79 items).</s><s>Previous surgical procedures and complications were also retrieved from medical records (29 items).</s><s>Further retrospective data related to hormone treatment were gathered from medical records at the time of puberty (Tanner stage II) (6 items) and completion of puberty (&gt; = 16 years) (45 items).</s><s>For individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), additional data on hormone therapy were taken from the records at the ages of 9 months and 6 years to evaluate steroid hormone levels and treatment outcomes (30 items each).</s><s>Moreover, descriptions of ambiguity of genitalia (44 items) were gathered from the records, if applicable.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient-related outcomes (PROs, part 2)</head><p><s>This part of the study included standardized instruments and self-constructed questionnaires (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>1. Sociodemographic data such as age, area of dwelling, education, household and family, occupation, nationality, religious denomination and social participation were gathered according to the European Social Survey (ESS; source questionnaire amendment 01, 2012/2013).</s><s>All questions were provided in interview format to maximize the accuracy and objectivity of the information.</s><s>For dsd-LIFE, we transformed these questions into self-reporting questionnaires, retaining the response format.</s><s>Validated translations and reference data are available for all countries of the dsd-LIFE consortium (http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org).</s><s>2. For the assessment of QoL, we used the WHOQOL-BREF, which evaluates physical and psychological QoL, social relationships, environment and global QoL; reference data on both the general population and clinical samples for comparison are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. 3. To assess physical health we used questions from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) and self-constructed condition specific questions.</s><s>4. To evaluate mental health we used questions from the EHIS and self-constructed questions.</s><s>We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to screen for depression and anxiety.</s><s>We used the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)-10 test and the Adult ADHD Self-Report to screen for signs and symptoms of for autism and ADHD as they have been described as common comorbidities in the DSD population in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. 5. To asses psychological factors the following questionnaires were chosen: the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES) for self-esteem, a self-constructed questionnaire for shame, stigma and coping, questions form the ESS for autonomy, the Relationship Structures (ECR-RS) Questionnaire for attachment.</s><s>6. Psychosexual issues were evaluated by standardized and condition-specific self-contructed questionnaire.</s></p><p><s>The Body Image Scale (BIS) was chosen to investigate body satisfaction, an issue of high relevance in the condition groups studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>We opted to evaluate gender dysphoria with the well-established and relatively short Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale (UGDS).</s><s>This instrument has been developed for the assessment of people without DSD who have gender identity disorder but has been used in previous studies in DSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition, feelings of male-and femaleness were evaluated by two self-constructed questions.</s></p><p><s>We chose not to evaluate gender role behaviour, which shows a wide variation in the normal population and does not have clinical relevance in itself.</s><s>The questionnaire on sexuality was developed for the German network study evaluating developmental milestones sexual problems, feelings and satisfaction with sexual life.</s><s>The items had performed positively in that study, and the scale was thus selected and translated into the various languages for dsd-LIFE <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>Sexual orientation was measured with the Kinsey scale, and the wording was changed to make the questions less dichotomous in terms of gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>7.</s><s>For evaluation of satisfaction with health care, the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ4) and an adapted version of the Child Health Care -Satisfaction, Utilization, and Needs Questionnaire (CHC-SUN) was chosen.</s><s>The CHC-SUN was originally developed as a proxy-report version for parents of children with chronic conditions and later adapted and tested as a self-report version for young adults with chronic diseases.</s><s>For this study, an extended short form of the CHC-SUN was applied, and several self-constructed items on satisfaction with care and needs were added <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>For assessment of current and past health care, satisfaction with information management, satisfaction with hormone therapies, genital surgery, current and previous treatment/psychological/social support and fertilty self-constructed questions were used.</s><s>8. Participants' perspectives on ethical issues were assessed by self-constructed questionnaires.</s><s>The items on ethical issues had been developed by the ethical research group in Göttingen based on qualitative work with focus groups and individual interviews.</s><s>The interview questions were closely related to the recommendations for care of individuals with DSD, which were developed by the German Ethical Council in 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> Obligatory requirements for participation in the study were participation in the medical clinical interview and completion of the PRO questionnaire.</s><s>Medical examinations were considered an important part of the study but were not obligatory.</s><s>Participants not interested in medical examinations were included into the study if they met the above requirement, if they had visited the centre in person at least once, and if they had documented previous clinical consultations and diagnosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion criteria</head><p><s>The study included individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of DSD with variants in sex chromosomes, including Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome and mixed gonadal dysgenesis (45,X/46,XY); XY conditions, including testicular dysgenesis, impairment of testosterone synthesis or action and hypospadias; XX conditions, including ovarian dysgenesis, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and XX males; and ovotesticular DSD.</s><s>XY male participants with CAH (21-OHD and 11ß-HSD deficiency) were included, although, according to the definition, they do not belong to the DSD classification.</s><s>This group was an addon study population because it was hypothesized that in many ways these subjects might face similar problems as persons within the DSD classification, such as e.g.</s><s>sex hormone imbalances and fertility problems.</s><s>Participants had to be at least 16 years old with a medically confirmed clinical and/or genetic diagnosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>The age limit of 16 years was chosen because pubertal development is essential for the evaluation of psychosexual development.</s><s>Moreover, the initial effects of treatment in childhood and adolescence on the metabolic system can be evaluated at the beginning of adulthood.</s><s>In addition, the perspectives of adolescents regarding their DSD condition and treatment are of particular interest.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exclusion criteria</head><p><s>Individuals not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria or incapable of giving consent or answering the questions on their own were excluded.</s><s>Subjects with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (uterus agenesis) and other complex non-endocrine urogenital malformations were also excluded as most centers had no access to patients with these diagnoses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics</head><p><s>Ethical approval was first sought from the medical ethics committee at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</s><s>Ethical approvals were subsequently sought from the other study centres.</s><s>Data protection and valid procedures to secure the anonymity of the participants were crucial requirements of the study and for the ethical approval.</s><s>Dsd-LIFE participants were informed thoroughly about the study content, aims and potential risks and subsequently gave written informed consent.</s><s>The informed consent was written in lay language to ensure the understandability of the aims, procedures and potential risks of participation.</s><s>All participants had to consent to the release of their medical data retrieved from medical charts, including genetic test results.</s><s>If the participant was underage, both the potential participant and the parents of the participant had to give written informed consent.</s></p><p><s>The opportunity for withdrawal from the study was possible at any stage of the study.</s><s>Travel costs of the participants were covered upon request.</s><s>According to the World Medical Association's Helsinki Declaration and the Council of European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, dsd-LIFE posed minimal risk for the participants (e.g., medical exams, blood sampling) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment</head><p><s>The 14 recruiting centres approached former and current patients with a diagnosis meeting the inclusion criteria for dsd-LIFE and promoted participation in the study in various additional ways.</s><s>The means of contacting potential study participants included regular mail, e-mail, phone, direct contact of the physician (at consultation hours at the recruitment site or at consultation hours of regional endocrinologists linked to the recruitment site), patient support groups and information from the dsd-LIFE website (www.dsd-life.eu).</s><s>A standardized record was kept by each centre to document the recruitment procedure and the informed consent process.</s><s>In this way, the process of individual approach and information about acceptance or denial of participation and inclusion were retained.</s><s>Participant recruitment started on February 1, 2014 and ended on September 30, 2015.</s><s>To obtain adequate numbers in the XY DSD group, recruitment for this group was prolonged from 16 to 20 months.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>dsd-LIFE is the first and largest European crosssectional study including the majority of conditions encompassed by the DSD classification.</s><s>The data analyses will focus on issues that are important for the improvement of care and the development of clinical recommendations for patients with these conditions, such as hormone therapy, surgery, fertility, psychological and social support, and psychosexual and ethical issues.</s><s>Moreover, the specific aspects of single conditions, such as Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome, 45,X/ 46,XY, CAIS, PAIS and CAH will be considered for improvement of care.</s><s>A special focus will be to analyse and consider the participants' views on the different issues.</s><s>Altogether, QoL, psychosexual issues, physical and mental health and satisfaction with treatment, support and helath services will be measured in the whole cohort and in sub-samples if indicated.</s><s>The data from this large sample will provide a sufficient basis for evidence-based recommendations for improvement of clinical care of individuals affected by a DSD condition.</s></p></div>
