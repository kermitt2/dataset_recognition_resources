<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we found that respiratory rate, lung density, and healthy lung volume measurements obtained 5 months post-irradiation were all highly predictive of survival after irradiation of the whole thorax.</s><s>We dichotomized the mice into abnormal and normal groups based on their measurements 5 months post-irradiation and found that survival was significantly lower in the abnormal groups for each of the three metrics.</s></p><p><s>The survival trends and relatively high lung radiation sensitivity of the C57L/J mice in this study was consistent with the findings of other groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>We compared mice irradiated in the presence of a 1.5 T magnetic field to those irradiated in the absence of a magnetic field and found that the 1.5 T field had little to no effect on survival.</s><s>The dose to which the mice were irradiated was a much stronger predictor of survival.</s><s>When we assessed the effect of irradiation in a 1.5 T field on non-invasive measurements of radiation-induced lung damage, however, we found that there was a significant effect on the ED50 at 5 months post-irradiation for each of the three measured responses (an increased respiratory rate, an increased lung density, and a reduced healthy lung volume).</s><s>For each of the three responses, the ED50 for the 1.5 T group was smaller than that for the 0 T group.</s><s>While these differences were small (2%-3%), they were consistent between the different measurements.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have investigated the correlation between post-irradiation changes seen in lung imaging and radiation-induced lung damage.</s><s>El-Khatib, et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> used CT to monitor changes in lung density after irradiation, which they correlated to histological changes due to radiation-induced pneumonitis.</s><s>Plathow, et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> used CT to detect increases in lung density, intralobular opacity, and fibrotic strands to monitor the development of radiation-induced lung fibrosis.</s><s>Other research groups, when comparing the response to thoracic radiation in various strains of mice, measured post-irradiation changes in lung density and volume on both micro-CT and MRIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The results of our study demonstrated that post-irradiation changes in lung density and healthy lung volume were significantly predictive of survival (p&lt;0.0001), and therefore support the continued utility of imaging as a non-invasive tool to measure radiation-induced lung damage.</s></p><p><s>Respiratory rate is most commonly measured using either an unrestrained single-chambered whole-body plethysmograph or a restrained double-chambered plethysmograph <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>While plethysmography is appealing because it does not rely on anesthesia, intubation, tracheostomy, or thoracotomy, it is costly and requires the mouse to be taken out of its standard environment, which introduces stress and could affect the measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s><s>Another existing technique for measuring respiratory rate is the use of a pulse oximeter, which can be clipped onto the tail of an anesthetized mouse or placed around the neck of a conscious or anesthetized mouse (MouseOx Plus, STARR Life Sciences, Oakmont, PA).</s><s>While these techniques are minimally invasive, they have the disadvantages of being costly, having a low throughput, being time intensive, having questionable reproducibility, and causing stress to the animal (which in turn affects the measurement).</s><s>In the study herein, we developed a completely non-invasive technique for measuring respiratory rate in mice while they are asleep in standard laboratory cages.</s><s>This technique is low cost: the only piece of equipment needed is a camera capable of recording at least 30 fps, and we have made the measurement software open source.</s></p><p><s>Our results demonstrated that the measurements of respiratory rate, lung density, and healthy lung volume at 5 months post-irradiation were correlated with each other.</s><s>While each metric is valuable on its own, this correlation demonstrates that if a study is limited in terms of time, funds, or equipment, it is possible to use only one of these techniques to assess radiationinduced lung injury.</s></p><p><s>One limitation of our study was that mice underwent irradiation of the whole thorax, whereas in MRIgRT treatments, a smaller portion of the patient's lungs would be expected to be irradiated.</s><s>Another limitation was that we assessed the effect of magnetic-field-induced dose perturbations on radiation-induced pneumonitis, but did not assess the effect on subsequent fibrosis.</s><s>Only mice from the 0 Gy, 9.0 Gy, and 10.0 Gy dose groups survived until the end of the study.</s><s>This was not a sufficient number of mice to draw any definite conclusions about the effect of a magnetic field on radiation-induced fibrosis.</s></p><p><s>Our finding that there was no significant difference in survival between mice irradiated in a 1.5 T magnetic field and mice irradiated in the absence of a magnetic field supports the idea that MRIgRT is safe for use in the thoracic region.</s><s>However, our finding that the 1.5 T field affected measurements of respiratory rate, lung density, and healthy lung volume suggests that further investigation is warranted.</s><s>Although the strong transverse magnetic field had no effect on survival, its effect on our assays of radiation-induced lung damage implies that MRIgRT in the thoracic region could potentially affect patients' quality of life.</s></p><p><s>It has been hypothesized that dose hot spots and dose cold spots in MRIgRT treatment plans can be eliminated with parallel-opposed fields or Monte-Carlo-based IMRT treatment planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>While this is certainly possible in the planning stage, it is not necessarily the case in patients, who have heterogeneous, malleable tissue that can change in position over time.</s><s>Care should be taken in introducing MRIgRT to the clinic, especially for treatments in regions with inhomogeneous tissue.</s><s>It is important to rigorously test new technologies in the preclinical stage before they are introduced to the clinic.</s><s>Although a technique may be theoretically possible, we should be cautious in the clinical introduction of a technology before it has been thoroughly investigated.</s></p></div><figure
