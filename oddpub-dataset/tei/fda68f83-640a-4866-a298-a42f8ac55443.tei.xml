<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a global burden, and low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) are particularly affected compared to high-income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The current projections indicate that the gap in T2DM burden between high-income countries and LMIC will further widen in the coming decades.</s><s>Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is expected to experience the fastest increase globally in the number of people living with T2DM in the next two decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Migrant populations in high-income countries are disproportionately affected by T2DM compared with the local host populations.</s><s>A recent meta-analysis indicates that SSA migrants are among those most affected by T2DM with the prevalence being nearly 3 times higher than in European host populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Migrant populations also tend to develop T2DM at a younger age and have more diabetes-related complications such as cardiovascular disease than local populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite the high levels of T2DM and related complications among migrant populations, evidence on T2DM awareness, treatment and control rates among SSA migrants in Europe is lacking and limited for the SSA region.</s><s>Sobngwi et al. reported low proportion of T2DM control in the SSA region (29%), but this study was conducted among patients in specialized centers, and thus does not provide us with population-based information <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, it is unclear how this is distributed across rural and urban SSA sites and whether the levels of T2DM management outcomes (i.e.</s><s>T2DM awareness, treatment, and control) among SSA migrants vary across European countries.</s><s>Adequate T2DM management is crucial for prevention of T2DM related complications.</s></p><p><s>T2DM prevalence rates seem to be influenced by contextual factors in the country of residence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>A higher T2DM prevalence was observed among Africans in the Netherlands compared to Africans in the United Kingdom, similar to the differences seen between host populations in these countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Possibly, contextual factors also result in cross-country differences in T2DM management outcomes.</s><s>The Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom and Ghana differ in contextual factors that may affect T2DM awareness, treatment and control.</s><s>These contextual factors entail among others different healthcare systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> including access to health care.</s><s>No data are available about T2DM management among sub-Sahara Africans residing in these countries.</s><s>Gaining insight into the differences in T2DM awareness, treatment and control among sub-Sahara Africans resident in multiple locations can help shape future management efforts in varying contexts.</s><s>Therefore, we aimed to assess differences in awareness, treatment and control of T2DM among a relatively homogeneous SSA population (i.e.</s><s>Ghanaians stemming mainly from one region in Ghana) living in different European cities and in urban and rural Ghana.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data analysis</head><p><s>Awareness was calculated as the proportion of self-reported T2DM cases among those with T2DM.</s><s>Treatment was defined by documented use of hypoglycemic medication at the research location, or a positive reply in the questionnaire to being treated for T2DM in the past 12 months, use of oral T2DM medication or use of insulin injections.</s><s>Treatment was calculated as the proportion of treated participants among those with T2DM.</s><s>Control was calculated as the proportion of those having HbA1c levels ≤ 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> out of those with T2DM.</s><s>In additional analyses we calculated the proportion controlled (HbA1c ≤ 7.0% (53 mmol/mol)) out of those treated for T2DM (supplemental figure).</s></p><p><s>The characteristics of the study population were expressed as numbers and percentages, means with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), or medians and 25 th and 75 th percentiles.</s><s>We found no significant statistical interaction between sex and site in relation to T2DM awareness, treatment and control.</s><s>Hence, analyses were combined for men and women.</s><s>Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between site and T2DM awareness, treatment and control with adjustments for age and sex.</s><s>Differences in education level are present between the sites and might influence T2DM awareness, treatment and control rates.</s><s>Therefore, additional adjustment for level of education was done to study the differences between sites in T2DM awareness, treatment and control independent of differences in education level.</s><s>Rural Ghana served in all models as reference category because we conceptualize rural Ghana as the origin from where Ghanaians migrated to urban Ghana, and subsequently to Europe.</s><s>Data were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI.</s><s>Data were analyzed in SPSS version 23 and R version 3.1.2.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Key findings</head><p><s>Our findings show differences in T2DM management outcomes between Ghanaians resident in multiple sites, in particular in relation to T2DM control.</s><s>While T2DM awareness and treatment hardly differed between the European sites and urban Ghana, T2DM control was lower in urban Ghana and London compared to the other sites.</s><s>Despite lower T2DM awareness and treatment rates in rural Ghana compared to all other sites, T2DM control rate was high.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Discussion of key findings</head><p><s>Awareness of T2DM status, treatment and adequate blood sugar control are essential in prevention of T2DM complications.</s><s>The levels of T2DM awareness and treatment we found were relatively high for Ghanaians resident in Europe.</s><s>Ghanaians resident in all European sites had awareness and treatment rates of at least 67% and up to 79%.</s><s>In the Ghanaian sites awareness and treatment rates were, as expected, lower than in the European sites, and were around 50%.</s></p><p><s>The lower T2DM awareness and treatment rates in Ghana as compared to Europe could be partially attributed to a difference in access to health information and care.</s><s>The European sites have health care systems in place that allow for high T2DM awareness and treatment.</s><s>In the Netherlands and Germany, a mandatory health insurance covers the costs for essential curative care <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, while in the UK, permanent residents have free access to care <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In Ghana, a national health insurance structure is in place, yet this is voluntary and despite the low premium, the health insurance remains unaffordable to the poorest part of the population, resulting in a subscription rate of approximately 45% <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>For the poorest, who most often live in rural areas, this might constrain access to screening and medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> which could result in lower awareness and treatment rates in rural Ghana.</s><s>Local circumstances in rural Ghana could further explain the awareness and treatment rates, such as far distance to a health care facility, unaffordable transportation to reach the health care facility, lack of human resources, or medication that is out of stock <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The explanations for the lower control rates in urban Ghana and London are unclear, although most likely multifactorial.</s><s>Post-hoc analyses in our study showed that factors including years since T2DM diagnosis and type of medication did not contribute to the differences between the sites.</s><s>Neither did the individual factors physical activity and energy intake, which could affect treatment efficacy, and thereby contribute to differences in control between sites.</s><s>Possibly, sedentary lifestyle not fully captured by the physical activity questionnaire contributed to the lower control in urban Ghana and London.</s><s>Sedentary lifestyle is likely to be higher in London compared to Amsterdam and Berlin due to the higher educational level in London, which often results in more sedentary professions.</s><s>Similarly, a sedentary lifestyle is likely to be more prevalent in urban Ghana compared to rural Ghana.</s><s>Other unmeasured contextual factors such as factors related to access and use of the health care systems may also be contributing to the differences in control between sites.</s><s>The relatively low T2DM control in urban Ghana compared to rural Ghana in particular could potentially be explained by a high motivation among rural Ghanaians to adequately take the medication once the barriers to obtain medication are overcome, compared to urban Ghana where these barriers are likely to be lower due to a higher density of health facilities.</s><s>The T2DM control rate among Ghanaians in London was 40% in our study, compared to 60% among the general British population with T2DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Because of universal free access to health care in the UK, the lower rates of control in the Ghanaian population are unlikely related to access itself, but rather to health care use, for example differential health care quality, clinician inertia, or specific cultural factors.</s><s>In the Netherlands, higher control levels (74%) have been reported for the general population compared to what we found among Ghanaians (63%) as well.</s><s>T2DM control rates in Germany (64%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> were similar to control rates among Ghanaians in Berlin in our study (63%).</s><s>Further research is needed to study the role of health care use in T2DM management among SSA migrants and their compatriots in SSA.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>RODAM is a unique study with data of a relatively homogeneous SSA population resident across different sites.</s><s>The RODAM study includes a representative sample of Ghanaians as previously described by Agyemang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> of which all T2DM cases were selected for the present analysis.</s><s>It is therefore a very suitable study to compare T2DM awareness, treatment and control rates between different sites.</s><s>The RODAM study sites (Amsterdam, Berlin, London, urban Ghana and rural Ghana) employ different health systems and policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> that could potentially affect T2DM awareness, treatment and control.</s><s>Comparison of these sites therefore allows for gaining insight into the role of local contexts.</s></p><p><s>A point of discussion is the use of HbA1c for T2DM control.</s><s>Even though ADA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> ratifies the use of HbA1c to determine T2DM control, certain factors such as anemia, abnormalities of hemoglobin and uremia might disturb the HbA1c level, which is therefore a less reliable measure to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The alternative measure for T2DM control is fasting plasma glucose.</s><s>Fasting plasma glucose, however, is subject to short-term fluctuations and is unstable, whereas HbA1c is more stable over time and thus gives a better impression of the T2DM control over the longer term <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the use of HbA1c was the best choice for the purpose of this study.</s><s>A sensitivity analysis using fasting plasma glucose showed similar patterns for T2DM control as seen when using HbA1c, although differences between sites were less pronounced when using fasting plasma glucose.</s></p><p><s>Another limitation to the present analysis is that we could not adjust our models for occupation which is commonly done in other health studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and which could potentially have captured sedentary lifestyle from office professions.</s><s>The contribution of occupation to differences in T2DM awareness, treatment and control rates between sites could not be studied due to a large number of missing values for the occupation variables.</s><s>However, level of education was included which has been shown to be a good proxy for socio-economic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Conclusion</head><p><s>T2DM awareness and treatment rates among Ghanaian migrants in Europe and urban Ghanaians were better than rural Ghanaians.</s><s>However, T2DM control rates in London and urban Ghana were lower than other sites.</s><s>More work is needed to identify potential factors, including the role of health care related factors, contributing to the poor awareness and treatment in rural Ghana, and to the poor control in urban Ghana and in Ghanaian migrants in London to assist prevention and clinical management efforts.</s><s>Data are n (%), or: * = mean (95% confidence interval) † = median (25 th -75 th percentile)</s></p></div>
