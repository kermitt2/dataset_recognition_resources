<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The cellular metabolism represents a network of thousands of chemical reactions and transport processes, most of them catalyzed by specific enzymes and transport proteins.</s><s>The function of this network consists basically in the conversion of chemical compounds that are taken up by the cell from the extracellular space (input) into a large variety of chemical compounds (output) serving either as building blocks for the formation and maintenance of cellular structures (e.g.</s><s>organelles, cytoskeleton), extracellular structures in case of tissue cells (e.g.</s><s>glycosaminoglycans, collagens), donors of chemical energy needed to drive otherwise endergonic reactions (e.g.</s><s>ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP) or signaling molecules released from the cell (e.g.</s><s>hormones, cytokines, neurotransmitters).</s><s>As the term 'biomass' is commonly reserved to designate all chemical compounds constituting a cell, tissue or organism, we will use the term 'metabolic output' to indicate all kinds of chemical compounds required to maintain the structure and physiological functions.</s></p><p><s>The most important feature of the cellular metabolic network is its ability to adjust the metabolic output to varying external conditions as, for example, an increase in the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines or growth factors, depletion of specific substrates (in particular oxygen) or challenges by toxic compounds.</s><s>This adjustment of the metabolic network to alterations in the external conditions is achieved by selectively increasing or decreasing the capacity of enzymes and membrane transporters.</s><s>Short-term changes of enzyme activities on a time scale of a few seconds are mainly accomplished by allosteric effects, reversible phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation, and reversible protein-protein or protein-membrane association/dissociation.</s><s>Long-term changes of enzyme activities on a time scale of minutes, hours and even days result from changes in the expression of enzymes, brought about by changes of the rate of transcription (DNA to mRNA), translation (mRNA to protein) and proteolysis (protein to amino acids).</s></p><p><s>Long-term regulation of enzyme capacities by temporal gene expression is constrained by the condition that the total protein content of the cell has to be kept within rather narrow bounds ("proteostasis", i.e., variable allocation of proteins at homeostasis of the total protein pool <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) of 15-35 percent of cell volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>An upper bound of the protein content is defined through the condition that molecular crowding should not reduce the aqueous space to an extent which impairs the diffusive transport of proteins, metabolites and ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, reducing globally the concentration of metabolic enzymes and membrane transporters lowers metabolic fluxes, as the maximal enzyme capacity is approximately a linear function of the protein abundance.</s><s>Therefore, regulation of metabolic networks by temporal changes of enzyme expression can be expected to take place under the constraint of a relative constancy of the total cellular protein abundance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>As a consequence of this constraint, increasing the abundance of a larger group of enzymes belonging to metabolic pathways that have to be operative under a given extracellular setting, should be accompanied by a decrease of the abundance of enzymes belonging to pathways which are less important or even temporarily dispensable.</s><s>This principle of "just-in-time" gene expression of metabolic enzymes according to the actual metabolic needs, similar to the just-in-time production as pioneered in the 50s by Toyota in particular, has been validated theoretically and experimentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Temporal gene expression is generally recognized as an important mechanism with which cells and tissues adapt their metabolism to variations in the external conditions, see e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>However, temporary changes in the gene expression of metabolic enzymes and other cellular proteins are also observed under virtually constant external conditions.</s><s>A prominent example is the so-called "metabolic cycling" with a typical period length of about 300 minutes observed in dense chemostat cultures of budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, when grown under nutrient-limited conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>For more than 50 years the cycling in yeast cultures was thought to be directly coupled to the cell division cycle.</s><s>However, recent studies have provided evidence for the occurrence of cycling in single yeast cells from unsynchronized steady-state (not growing) populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>This finding implies that the cycling is an intrinsic and autonomous feature of yeast cells that is neither dependent on metabolic synchronization of cells, nor an active cell cycle or carbon limitation.</s><s>Hence, the compelling explanation of metabolic cycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> as a means to separate the S-phase of the cell cycle from the oxidative metabolic phase during which an enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the respiratory chain may occur has to be put into question.</s><s>Other examples for metabolic cycles are the occurrence of an ultradian metabolic rhythm between oxic and anoxic processes in the diazotrophic cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp.</s><s>ATCC 51142 under constant culture conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and a self-sustained rhythm in glucose uptake by undifferentiated stem cells that is not coincident with rhythmic expression of clock genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Given that temporal variations in the expression of metabolic enzymes is a general feature of the cellular metabolism that is not necessarily induced by temporal environmental changes, the question remains what the evolutionary background of such metabolic variations might be.</s><s>Looking at the evolution of metabolic networks from a Darwinian perspective, one is tempted to figure out the selective advantage that cells existing in a (idealized) constant environment might have acquired by switching between several metabolic states.</s><s>Here we hypothesize that one possible reason for such metabolic switches is the shortening of the time period to generate a demanded metabolic output with a fixed total amount of protein that can be invested into metabolic enzymes and membrane transporters.</s><s>The idea underlying our theoretical approach can be illustrated by comparing the metabolic network with a factory that has to deliver a specific quantity of different items (e.g.</s><s>different types of cars = target metabolites) with a constant number of employees = enzyme protein.</s><s>One may ask whether it is economically more favorable, i.e., saves total production time, to produce all of these different items all the time in fixed proportions or to use the full man (and machine) power of the factory to produce these items in different proportions over limited time spans.</s><s>Analogously, we address in this theoretical study the intriguing question whether even without changes of the external conditions (e.g.</s><s>availability of substrates, strength of hormonal signals etc.) temporal switches in the allocation of protein to the various pathways of the cell's metabolic network may be advantageous for an efficient biomass production.</s><s>Importantly, our theoretical approach does not envisage the possibility that the expression of genes can be always optimally tuned in a way that the amount of protein allocated to an enzyme perfectly matches the flux it carries, a principle of gene regulation that has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>If such an hypothesis is adopted, the metabolic output of the network regulated by a perfect allocation of protein amounts to enzymes and transporters cannot be surpassed by switching between distinct metabolic phases differing by sets of active and inactive genes, which is the framework developed in this paper.</s></p><p><s>In the first part of the paper, we use a simplistic 3-reaction network to explain our computational concept.</s><s>In the second part, we provide an application to a more comprehensive metabolic network comprising several pathways of the intermediary carbon metabolism.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic assumptions</head><p><s>One basic assumption made in our approach is that the amount of metabolic enzymes (as well as that of any other protein in the cell) is constrained by the general condition that the total protein mass cannot exceed a certain threshold value without reducing the aqueous phase to an extent that effective communication and catalysis inside the cell gets impaired.</s><s>This condition was implemented into our approach by rendering the upper bound of fluxes dependent on the number of simultaneously expressed enzymes: The less enzymes are required, and the smaller their molecular masses, the more protein they can acquire.</s><s>With this constraint on the upper bound of fluxes, the reduction of the biomass production time achieved by the strategy of alternating switches between different metabolic phases appears to be very robust against variations in the expression efficiency of the enzymes in the considered network.</s><s>Importantly, compared to the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> also dealing with the implications of molecular crowding for the computation of feasible flux distributions, we deliberately do not allege that the expression efficiency of individual enzymes can be optimized such that an individual enzyme receives just that amount of protein which is necessary to adjust its upper flux bound to the flux it has to carry.</s><s>A perfect adaptation of the gene expression of metabolic enzymes to flux requirements seems unlikely for several reasons.</s><s>First, this assumption would entail that all enzymes are saturated, i.e., operate at their maximal capacity (v max ).</s><s>In contrast, all metabolic pathways studied so far have in common that only few enzymes (mostly only a single one) are rate limiting, while the others are not saturated with their ligands, and therefore possess a large overcapacity compared to the actual flux they carry.</s><s>Second, an investigation of the control of metabolic flux in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis by quantifying fluxes, transcripts and metabolites in eight metabolic states enforced by different environmental conditions revealed that for the majority of enzymes in central metabolism, enzyme concentrations were insufficient to explain the observed fluxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>In line with this finding, a suboptimal control of gene expression was reported to be widespread in bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Third, from an evolutionary point of view, a perfect economical allocation of proteins to the enzymes and transporters of the cellular reaction networks is unlikely to occur, as biological systems that perform multiple tasks face the fundamental trade-off that a given phenotype cannot be optimal at all tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the capability of cell's to adapt their proteome to the environmental requirements is restrained by the structure and kinetic properties of the underlying regulatory network <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Contemporary gene regulatory networks always bear traces of their evolutionary history: Regulatory circuits as, for example, the operon concept enabling the simultaneous activation and inactivation of genes in functional clusters that may have allowed a perfect adaptation to long-lasting and stable environmental conditions, became highly conserved among different species <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, regulation of the cell's protein abundances is constrained by osmotic and energetic conditions.</s><s>Maintaining the flux through a reaction while reducing the amount of the catalyzing enzyme unavoidably leads to an increase of the concentration of the reaction substrates-the lower the enzyme capacity, the higher the substrate concentration.</s><s>This increase of metabolite concentrations may impair the osmotic equilibrium between the cell and its external milieu-a phenomenon that accounts for the impairment of cells in certain types of inborn enzyme deficiencies.</s></p><p><s>The above arguments of course do not deny the existence of a gross relationship between flux strength and enzyme abundances.</s><s>Taking a more subtle regulation of gene expression into account in our approach would clearly cheapen the gain achievable with metabolic switches.</s><s>In our calculations of the gain, we neglected the additional costs and the additional time-delay caused by the metabolic switches.</s><s>Degradation of proteins (mostly by the ubiquitin-proteasome system) and de novo protein synthesis consumes some extra ATP.</s><s>For a rough estimate of the additional costs associated with the de novo synthesis of enzymes in various metabolic phases, we added up the mass of protein allocated to those enzymes that are additionally expressed when switching from one phase to the next.</s><s>This gave an additional ATP demand of 9% resp.</s><s>8% for the non-dividing resp.</s><s>dividing cell, compared with the basal (maintenance) ATP production flux of 5 mmol/gDW/h.</s><s>Taking into account this extra ATP demand when solving the optimization problem for varying metabolic phases, there was no significant change of the gain in biomass reproduction time.</s><s>Regarding the time-delay caused by switching from one enzyme expression pattern to the next, experimental observations suggest this switch to occur in a smooth fashion in that the degradation of proteins (and related mRNAs) active in the preceding metabolic phase goes hand in hand with the synthesis of new proteins of the next metabolic phase.</s><s>Such a tight coupling between protein degradation and synthesis assures the homeostasis of the cellular amino acid pool <ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Minimal gene sets</head><p><s>In our approach, the activation and inactivation of genes is accomplished by the regulation of so-called minimal gene sets.</s><s>These are defined as sets of genes that can only be collectively turned on and off, because they are under the control of common transcription factors.</s><s>This concept takes into account the existence of signaling pathways and related transcription factors (TFs) that specifically control metabolic pathways of the cell.</s><s>For example, up-regulation of the transcription factor HIF-1 under hypoxic conditions leads to a higher expression of genes coding for glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes.</s><s>Transcription factors belonging to the group of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are known to specifically enhance the expression of genes related to lipid storage (PPAR-γ) and lipid oxidation (PPAR-α).</s><s>The cellular synthesis of proteins can be globally enhanced by the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR.</s><s>Hitherto, the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the activation of metabolic enzymes by various TFs and the mutual interactions of different TFs at one and the same promotor are not exactly known.</s><s>Hence, our concept of minimal gene sets appears to be at the moment a reasonable surrogate for the still not completely understood gene regulation of metabolic enzymes.</s><s>It has to be critically noted, however, that the results of our optimization approach, i.e., the strategy used to sequentially activate metabolic pathways strongly depend on the assumptions made on the cistronic regulation of pathway enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, without constraining the activation of single genes to the activation of commonly regulated gene sets, reduction of biomass production times by alternating metabolic phases becomes even more pronounced.</s></p></div>
