<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ELISA</head><p><s>C5a and TCC levels in serum and CSF samples were quantified by ELISA (Tecomedical AG, Sissach, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.</s><s>CSF indices for C5a and sTCC were calculated as follows: (C5a or sTCC CSF /C5a or sTCC serum )/(albumin CSF /albumin serum ).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics</head><p><s>Protein expression levels in serum and CSF samples were compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test.</s><s>Correlation analyses were performed using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.</s><s>A P &lt; 0.05 was  considered significant.</s><s>All graphs and statistics were done using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.; La Jolla, CA).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>A total of 21 newly diagnosed and treatment-na€ ıve patients with CIDP fulfilling the EFNS/PNS diagnostic criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and 29 controls with noninflammatory neurological disease conditions were included in the analysis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>All patients underwent neurological examination at the time of diagnosis, serum and CSF were collected before induction of immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg body weight over 5 consecutive days) and patients were re-examined after 4 weeks.</s><s>Complement activation can be triggered by various stimuli including immune complexes, extracellular matrix proteins and apoptotic/necrotic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Complement activating pathways converge to the generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a and the TCC, generated by the assembly of C5b through C9.</s><s>The C5b-9 that fails to assemble in the membrane forms a soluble, lytically inert complex, termed sTCC, and complementmediated cell lysis was shown to closely correlate with the generation of sTCC levels in vitro. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>Here, terminal complement activation was quantified in serum and CSF samples by ELISAs specific for C5a and sTCC.</s><s>Compared to controls, patients with CIDP showed significantly higher levels of C5a and sTCC in both serum and CSF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</s><s>C5a serum levels higher than 95.6 ng/mL were exclusively observed in patients with CIDP.</s><s>We additionally analyzed C5a and sTCC serum levels in patients with SLE receiving immunomodulatory therapy (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Compared to patients with CIDP, patients with SLE showed lower levels of C5a (mean: 43.18 ng/mL, SD: 22.68; P &lt; 0.0001) and sTCC (mean: 2782 ng/mL, SD: 1533; P &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>Increased levels of C5a and sTCC in CSF samples of CIDP patients correlated with CSF albumin concentrations (sTCC: r = 0.82, P = 0.0001; C5a: r = 0.77, P &lt; 0.0001) and CSF indices for C5a and TCC were lower in patients with CIDP compared to controls (P &lt; 0.0001 for C5a and P &lt; 0.012 for sTCC) suggesting a systemic increase of terminal complement activation as opposed to local production within the CSF compartment.</s><s>Serum levels of albumin, chosen as control protein, were unchanged in patients with CIDP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</s><s>Thus, systemic terminal complement activation as reflected by C5a and sTCC and levels is increased in treatment-na€ ıve patients with CIDP.</s></p><p><s>We next investigated whether increased terminal complement activation is associated with or anticipates clinical disease severity in patients with CIDP.</s><s>Disease severity was monitored using the INCAT (Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment) disability score <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> during the diagnostic workup and 4 weeks after initiation of IVIG therapy.</s><s>INCAT disability scores were reduced in 16/21 (80%) patients 4 weeks after IVIG therapy induction.</s><s>Both C5a and sTCC levels tended to be higher in patients with higher disability at the time of diagnosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>) and significantly correlated with INCAT scores determined at 4 week follow-up visits (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>).</s><s>No significant correlation could be observed for clinical disease severity and albumin concentrations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</s><s>CSF levels of C5a and TCC at the initial presentation did not significantly correlate with INCAT disability scores at any time point (data not shown).</s><s>Thus, systemic terminal complement activation is associated with residual disease severity 4 weeks after effective IVIG therapy in patients with CIDP.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study demonstrates that systemic terminal complement activation as defined by serum C5a and TCC levels is increased and associated with disease severity in patients with CIDP.</s><s>Sera from CIDP patients which, upon adoptive transfer, induced conduction block and demyelination in rat sciatic nerves show IgG and C3d binding to myelin components on normal peripheral nerve tissue, indicating that their demyelinating capacity is antibody-mediated and complement-dependent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Our data suggest that systemic and local terminal complement activation is a characteristic feature of inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies and support a role of complement activation in the pathogenesis of CIDP.</s></p><p><s>Deficiencies of early components of the classical complement activation pathway such as C1q, C2, and C4 are strongly associated with the development of SLE, presumably due to impaired complement-mediated clearance of dying cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and low concentrations of complement components are observed in a majority of patients with active and severe SLE.</s><s>In contrast, terminal complement activation products such as C5a and sTCC, although reported to correlate with clinical disease activity in individual patients, are either normal or only slightly elevated in sera from patients with established SLE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>The finding that C5a and sTCC levels are substantially higher in patients with CIDP compared to SLE suggest differential mechanisms and functions of terminal complement activation in these diseases, although treatment-related effects cannot be excluded since all SLE patients included in our study received immunomodulatory therapy.</s></p><p><s>Terminal complement activation can be inhibited therapeutically, for example, by eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody which blocks the cleavage from C5 to C5a and C5b, thereby preventing the generation of C5a and TCC formation.</s><s>Eculizumab is approved for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, was shown to be therapeutically effective in a murine model of acute antibodymediated neuropathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and is currently tested for its safety and efficacy in patients with GBS.</s><s>In an open-label clinical trial conducted in 13 patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), eculizumab treatment did not show objective clinical benefits, although improvement of some secondary outcomes such as patient-rated subjective scores and selected clinical and electrophysiological measurements were reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>Our data strongly indicate that inhibition of terminal complement activation should be explored for its potential therapeutic merit in patients with CIDP.</s></p><p><s>There are limitations to our study.</s><s>First, the relatively small number of patients requires validation in larger independent cohorts.</s><s>Second, we did not monitor serum C5a and TCC levels over time in order to investigate whether terminal complement activation remains increased during disease progression and under immunomodulatory therapy since transient reduction of complement proteins and/or complement activation occur after plasmapheresis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> during corticosteroid therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> as well as following IVIG treatment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>A small open-label clinical trial on eculizumab in patients with MMN who concomitantly received IVIG reported that most patients continued to require IVIG despite full inhibition of terminal complement function <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> suggesting that the therapeutic efficacy of IVIG is mediated by immunomodulatory mechanisms other than complement inhibition.</s><s>Furthermore, our study was restricted to patients with ideopathic or typical CIDP characterized by symmetrical, proximal and distal sensory and motor deficits which comprise only 50-60% of patients with CIDP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>Our findings, however, provide incentive to conduct larger prospective investigations to examine terminal complement activation as a potential surrogate marker for clinical disease activity, progression, and response to immunomodulatory therapies in patients with major phenotypic variants of CIDP.</s><s>It remains to be evaluated whether inhibition of terminal complement activation can be harnessed to improve the clinical outcome in patients with CIDP.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>730 ª
