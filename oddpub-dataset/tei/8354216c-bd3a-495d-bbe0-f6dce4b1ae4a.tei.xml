<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated the clinical outcome of DFUs in patients with type 2 diabetes who visited the Emergency Department or required hospitalization via outpatient clinic due to DFUs, and analyzed the data of those patients to illustrate several predictors of LEA.</s></p><p><s>DFU is a disastrous complication of diabetes, often leading to LEA.</s><s>According to data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey, 28.4 LEA events occur per 10,000 patients with diabetes, and LEA among adults with diabetes was 10 times higher than for those without diabetes in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine Vol.</s><s>33, No. 5, September 2018</s></p><p><s>There have been many studies about the risk factors for DFU development; several risk factors for DFU have been reported, such as male sex, older age, history of previous ulcer, smoking, longer duration of diabetes, hypertension, neuropathy, PAD, deformity of foot, poor glycemic control, nephropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[17]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, there are not many longitudinal studies for prognosis of DFU have been reported.</s><s>Several studies suggested the predictors of LEA such as older age, nephropathy, peripheral arterial disease, sensory neuropathy, uncontrolled DM, and infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref>.</s><s>However, there are still not many prospective cohort studies with a multicenter and relatively large sample size to evaluate the predictors of LEA at the present time.</s></p><p><s>After initial assessment of DFU, a treatment strategy should be established according to the proven risk factors and severity of each wound, as many clinical practice guidelines recommend <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, prognosis of DFU and predictors of LEA should be well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The LEA rate (58.9%) in this study was higher than those of other epidemiological studies of LEA for DFU (13.7%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[17]</ref>.</s><s>This can be explained by higher baseline severity of the DFU wound (according to University of Texas classification, 64 patients [33.3%] were over class IIB), as many of our patients were admitted via emergency room for untreated chronic wound or referred from primary care for unhealed wound despite treatment.</s><s>Lower limb amputation due to DFUs contributes to increased medical costs.</s><s>Depending on hospitalization/non-hospitalization, diabetic foot amputation was associated with 1.6 or 2.1 times more annual days of healthcare use, and 2.0 or 2.3 times higher total medical cost than non-diabetic foot amputation.</s><s>DFU was associated with 1.7 or 3.2 times higher total medical cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[6]</ref>.</s><s>One of the important predictors for LEA in this study was depth of wound.</s><s>On the basis of anatomy of foot and several classification system, we classified ulcers by depth: superficial soft tissue, fascia/muscle/tendon level, and bone or joint level <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Whether or not DFU invades the bone or joint level may be an especially important factor for prediction of prognosis.</s><s>While several studies regarded the extent of the wound as an important factor related to LEA, it was not a significant predictor of LEA in our analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref>.</s><s>This may suggest that decisions in the management of DFU could be dependent on the depth of wound, rather than extent of the wound.</s></p><p><s>Other predictors of LEA included the presence of PAD and the combined infection of ulcer.</s><s>PAD is most easily detected by the ABI that is generally used.</s><s>An angiography may reveal significant macrovascular disease requiring intervention.</s><s>In this study, PAD was defined as ABI ≤ 0.9 or compatible findings of PAD in peripheral arterial angiography or CT.</s><s>In terms of degree of ischemia, arterial oxygen supply can also be measured by transcutaneous oximetry.</s><s>A transcutaneous oxygen tension higher than 30 mmHg correlates with a high likelihood of wound healing.</s><s>However, transcutaneous oxygen tension requires expensive equipment and a trained technician, and it cannot be routinely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Although there was more moderate to severe stenosis of arteries in LEA patients, there was not a statistically significant difference between patients with LEA and non-LEA.</s></p><p><s>A total of 76 patients among 192 DFU (39.6%) had a percutaneous lower extremity angiography or lower extremity CT angiography at baseline examination.</s><s>We classified the severity of stenosis of any arteries that perfused the DFU area as mild, moderate, and severe, which were confirmed by the expert radiologist or vascular surgeons.</s><s>Although there was more moderate to severe stenosis of arteries in LEA patients, there was not a statistically significant difference between patients with LEA and non-LEA (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>).</s><s>However, we believe that the statistical analysis for the characteristics of vascular stenosis would not be enough due to the small number of PAD evaluation.</s></p><p><s>There are many studies that suggest combined infection of DFU as a poor prognostic factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, pathogen-specific antibiotics therapy is one of the important factors for optimal treatment of DM foot infection, and should be included in the protocol for managing DFU in each hospital.</s><s>There are several points to consider in the development of the protocol.</s><s>First, the frequency and range of resistance to antibiotics are different in many regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, epidemiologic studies to investigate the pathogen that is the most common or the most virulent in each hospital are essential.</s><s>Each pathogen's resistance to antibiotics also should be investigated.</s><s>Second, proper identification techniques need to be introduced because the pathogens which are elucidated under the current culture-based techniques are not necessarily the most clinically important organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The method used to elucidate the causative organisms in DFU was a wound discharge swab in this study.</s><s>Therefore, cultured organisms include not only the true pathogen but also normal flora of the patient's skin.</s><s>Some patients visited our hospital after several days of treatment with antibiotics.</s><s>For that reason, organisms were not included in the analyses in this study.</s></p><p><s>Considering that important predictors for LEA in this study were the depth of wound and combined infection, for comprehensive management and improved wound care, a multidisciplinary team approach, including orthopedist, plastic surgeon, vascular surgeon, and infectionologist seems to be essential in the initial management of DFU <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In general, adequate glycemic control is essential for prevention of DFUs and LEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">22]</ref>.</s><s>However, the mean HbA1c level during the follow-up period was not different between the LEA and non-LEA groups in this study.</s><s>Glycemic control cannot be shown as important for DFU treatment due to the small sample size and retrospective design of our study.</s><s>Metabolic correction, including high glucose, blood pressure, and lipid profile within target range, with prompt infection control, should be emphasized in DFU patients with type 2 diabetes.</s></p><p><s>There are several limitations in this study.</s><s>First, due to the retrospective study design, we could not assess presence of diabetic neuropathy.</s><s>Because most patients were referred from other primary care, available baseline data for diabetic complications was not sufficient, and additional examinations for neuropathy were not possible on severely damaged wounds.</s><s>As the included patients were those who required admission, and the patients with too little available clinical data from the medical record were also excluded, selection bias has to be taken into account.</s><s>Other limitations of this study include relatively small sample size, retrospective design, and single center studies.</s><s>A larger, prospective study will be needed to validate the findings of the present investigation.</s><s>Additionally, as many studies suggest that infection of DFU is an important predictor for LEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">23]</ref>, the difference in organisms and antibiogram of each DFU should be identified in the future for proper treatment of DFU.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, in cases of severe DFU requiring hospitalization, the LEA risk was high in patients with type 2 diabetes.</s><s>Therefore, DFU prevention is essential.</s><s>Routine examination of the feet is necessary during routine clinical practice.</s><s>Whenever DFU is identified, prompt management of DFUs by a multidisciplinary team would play an important role in lowering the LEA rate.</s></p></div>
