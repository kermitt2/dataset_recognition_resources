target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref></s><s>ll patients fulfilled current diagnostic criteria of acute pancreatitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>According to the revised Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> AZA-induced acute pancreatitis was mild in all 37 cases.</s><s>By then, only few retrospective studies had focused on severity of AP.</s><s>Bermejo et al. analysed 44 thiopurine-induced AP patients from nine university hospitals in Madrid, Spain.</s><s>This retrospective cohort was well comparable to our cohort in regard to gender, type of IBD, smoking, and alcohol habits.</s><s>The incidence of fever was 12% vs 13.5% in our study, and 100% of all AP episodes attributed to AZA⁄6-MP exposure were mild. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref></s><s>Of 335 patients within a recent genetic study [see below], <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> one each [0.3%] had pancreatic necrosis, renal failure and severe metabolic disturbance, and two [0.6%] had shock with respiratory insufficiency.</s><s>In that study, only 11 patients [3.3%] had acute peripancreatic fluid collections, as compared with 10% in our cohort.</s><s>Therefore we believe that AZA-induced acute pancreatitis has a mild course in almost all patients.</s></p><p><s>Less than half of all patients with AZA-induced acute pancreatitis were hospitalised.</s><s>This is not in accordance with the German guidelines, which suggest hospitalisation of all patients with acute pancreatitis for close clinical follow-up. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref></s><s>However, the mild course of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis might support outpatient treatment in selected patients.</s><s>The median length of hospitalisation [5 days] was lower than in all patients with acute pancreatitis [6 days] in the applicable Diagnosis Related Group H62A in Germany, which could be another indication of a mild clinical course.</s></p><p><s>Smoking is a known risk factor of acute pancreatitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21</ref></s><s>According to the data of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults [DEGS1], 29.7% of the 18-to 79-year-old population are smoking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22</ref></s><s>In our study, the prevalence was 23.3% with a 4-fold prevalence of smoking in patients with Crohn's disease, as compared with ulcerative colitis.</s><s>There was a remarkable difference in the frequency of active smoking in 21.2% of patients without and in 48.6% of patients with AZA-induced acute pancreatitis.</s><s>This indicates a significantly increased risk of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis in smokers.</s><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, only simultaneous smoking and AZA therapy increase the risk, whereas earlier quitters have no elevated risk.</s><s>These results support the need to quit smoking after diagnosis of IBD-particularly in Crohn's disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">23</ref></s><s>nother well-known risk factor of acute pancreatitis is alcohol consumption, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21</ref> but we did not find any association between drinking and AZA-induced acute pancreatitis.</s><s>However, almost 85.1% of the IBD patients in our cohort did not drink any alcohol or had less than one drink per week.</s><s>This is lower than in the general population: one-third of men and one-fifth of women are risky drinkers, according to the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test Consumption [AUDIT-C] in Germany. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24</ref></s><s>In contrast to our findings, one study from the USA found that patients with IBD did drink alcohol in a similar pattern to the general population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">25</ref></s><s>atients suffering from Crohn's disease had a 2.7-fold increased risk of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis, in comparison with patients having ulcerative colitis.</s><s>Although not statistically significant, this finding is consistent with a retrospective chart review of 318 Dutch IBD patients, in whom the incidence of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis was 4.9% in patients with Crohn's, but 0% in those with ulcerative colitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">26</ref></s><s>Haber et al. already had reported decades ago that 12 of his 13 IBD patients with thiopurine-induced AP had Crohn's disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref></s><s>Crohn's disease was reported in about 80% of patients with AZA-induced acute pancreatitis who had been retrospectively selected for a recent genetic association study, ulcerative colitis in only 17%.</s><s>However, no IBD characterisation was reported in the control group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref></s><s>he incidence of AP in patients with Crohn's disease seems to be considerably higher than in patients with ulcerative colitis and the general population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">27</ref></s><s>The reasons are unclear, but many typical features of Crohn's disease may contribute to this finding: the high prevalence of autoimmune disorders including autoimmune pancreatitis, duodenal manifestation of the disease, and even potential manifestation of the disease in the pancreas itself. <ref type="bibr">28</ref></s><s>As well, the significantly elevated proportion of smokers may contribute to the elevated risk of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis in patients with Crohn's disease.</s><s>These hypotheses, however, were not been possible to prove in our study.</s></p><p><s>Marked lipasaemia could be suggestive of a worse prognosis of acute pancreatitis at primary evaluation in the emergency room, and suggested a higher probability of hospitalisation in our study.</s><s>One should keep in mind, however, that no laboratory test is practically available or consistently accurate for the prediction of severity in patients with AP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">29</ref> In our study, the clinical course of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis was not different in hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients, nor in in patients with high or low lipase levels at onset.</s></p><p><s>Pancreatitis is listed as a rare side effect in the prescribing information of budesonide and prednisolone.</s><s>Glucocorticoids are classified as drugs with a definite relationship to AP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">30</ref> We found a slight but significant risk of budesonide therapy for AZA-induced acute pancreatitis, whereas prednisolone therapy was protective.</s><s>The exact pathogenesis of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis is not understood yet, but its idiosyncratic nature suggests an allergic pathogenesis.</s><s>Prednisolone is a potential anti-allergic substance and is successfully used in autoimmune pancreatitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref></s><s>It could be hypothesised that the anti-allergic effect of prednisolone prevents AZA-induced acute pancreatitis.</s><s>Budesonide, however, has a high first-pass metabolism with minimal systemic absorption without a putative anti-allergic effect on AZA-induced acute pancreatitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref></s><s>Further research is necessary to understand this phenomenon.</s></p><p><s>Increases of the pancreatic serum enzymes could be found in up to 15% of the IBD patients without pancreatitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33</ref></s><s>Measurements of pancreatic enzymes in asymptomatic patients could be omitted, as an increase after AZA induction is not predictive for AZA-induced acute pancreatitis in our study.</s><s>This is contrary to a previous retrospective study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">34</ref></s><s>It has not been our primary objective to evaluate the usefulness of serial lipase measurements for the prediction of the onset of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis.</s><s>This question could only be finally answered through daily lipase measurements in a large prospective study.</s></p><p><s>Recently, a genetic risk factor for pancreatitis induced by thiopurines has been identified in IBD.</s><s>In two cohorts from 168 sites around the world, Heap et al. identified a strong association of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis with the HLA-DQA1*02:01-HLA-DRB1*07:01 haplotype.</s><s>Patients heterozygous at rs2647087 have a 9% risk of developing pancreatitis after administration of a thiopurine, whereas homozygotes have a 17% risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref></s><s>Future research should focus on the question whether IBD patients at high risk for AZA-induced acute pancreatitis [such as heavy smokers] could benefit from genetic testing.</s><s>The mild clinical course of AP, however, might be an argument against predictive genetic tests.</s></p><p><s>Remarkably, more than one-third of all patients have quitted AZA due to adverse events in our study.</s><s>Post hoc, we analysed risk factors for nausea, the most common adverse event in this study [12.2% of all patients] and in retrospective studies [8%]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">35</ref></s><s>Surprisingly, we have found a higher prevalence of AZA-induced nausea in patients drinking no or very little alcohol.</s><s>One recent study has provided evidence that nausea is the most prevalent adverse event of alcohol in irritable bowel syndrome [IBS], <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">36</ref> an entity frequently accompanying IBD-which could lead to avoidance of alcohol.</s><s>We therefore attribute nausea to visceral hypersensitivity as reported in IBS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">37</ref></s><s>This hypothesis suggests prospective controlled trials to reduce nausea in IBD patients with an indication for AZA.</s><s>Low or split daily AZA dosages, however, had no protective effect against AZA-induced nausea in our cohort.</s></p><p><s>Our study has several limitations.</s><s>Even though acute pancreatitis was diagnosed according to current guidelines, and all patients clinically improved after withdrawal of AZA, no AP recurrence with a re-challenge was demanded in the study protocol.</s><s>Recurrent AP after AZA re-challenge would define a gold standard of association, but was not done in any of our 37 patients.</s><s>Furthermore, it may be contraindicated due to a high risk of AP recurrence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">38</ref></s><s>he real-life setting of our study might cover confounding factors of acute pancreatitis.</s><s>Other causes of AP in IBD, such as gallstones, other medications, duodenal Crohn's involvement, or acute pancreatitis as an extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's itself, could have been missed in our cohort, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">39</ref> as we neither asked for singular alcohol excesses in otherwise non-alcoholics nor obligated profound work-up for biliary pancreatitis.</s><s>However, the two patients with AZA-induced acute pancreatitis and a history of asymptomatic gall bladder stones got acute pancreatitis 16 and 28 days after the first AZA pill, respectively.</s><s>The first patient vomited, and exhibites a maximal CRP of 152 mg/l and peripancreatic oedema.</s><s>The other had a very mild course.</s><s>Both patients were hospitalised but recovered quickly after AZA cessation.</s><s>We therefore believe that AZA but not a gallstone was the predominant cause of pancreatitis in both cases.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, we believe that AZA has been the cause of AP in all of our patients, as AP developed within the typical time frame after AZA induction in every case, and all patients improved rapidly after withdrawal of the drug.</s><s>Second, it has been our aim to investigate the impact of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis in a real-world setting.</s><s>This allowed the investigators to miss out abdominal imaging in suspected AZA-induced acute pancreatitis [n = 7], or to omit any lipase measurement after AZA induction [n = 78].</s><s>In addition, patients with an asymptomatic elevation of lipase were allowed to stop AZA, as assessed by the local investigator [n = 5]; and AZA doses outside the dose range of 2-2.5 mg/kg were allowed.</s><s>Data analysis, however, did not show any signal that those factors might influence the main outcomes of this study.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, AZA-induced acute pancreatitis is a common side effect of AZA in IBD patients, more common than thought previously.</s><s>Regarding the exclusively mild course of acute pancreatitis, the fear of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis should not be an argument against starting AZA at every appropriate indication.</s><s>Smoking is the most important risk factor.</s><s>Lipase measurements in asymptomatic patients can be omitted, as lipase increase above the upper limit of normal after AZA induction is rare and not predictive for the development or severity of AZA-induced acute pancreatitis.</s></p></div><figure
