walking have been shown to exhibit statistical persistence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>While stride speed fluctuations during treadmill

target="#b31">32</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Reduced stride-to-stride persistence has been interpreted differently in relation to the function of the underlying motor control system.</s><s>Loss of statistical persistence in stride time fluctuations has been observed in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , different neurological patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , and has been suggested to reflect a degraded motor control function <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>However, reduced persistence observed in frail individuals has been suggested to potentially implicate an increased control effort to achieve a more cautious gait pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s></p><p><s>These contradicting observations call for caution when linking loss of stride-to-stride persistence to either an impaired motor control function or enhanced motor control effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>The aforementioned studies have applied detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to assess the presence and strength of statistical persistence in the investigated time series.</s><s>However, DFA does not quantify the time dependency on an interpretable physiological or physical time scale.</s><s>This means that even though existence of statistical persistence can be confirmed by DFA, the stride-to-stride dependency cannot be quantified in terms of a specific number of previous strides that influences the current stride.</s><s>Equally, DFA does not quantify for how long into the future in terms of seconds or minutes a completed stride will influence new strides.</s></p><p><s>In addition to DFA, sample entropy (SaEn) has been applied to both kinematic signals and stride time interval time series recorded during gait in order to quantify the predictability of the gait pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>SaEn is high in random white noise signals where no point-to-point dependency exists and the predictability is low.</s><s>In contrast, in both chaotic and periodic signals, point-to-point dependency does exist and they are characterized by relative low SaEn indicating high predictability (e.g.</s><s>demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> ).</s><s>However, the predictability is reported on a relative scale and cannot be translated into physical or physiological terms.</s><s>Both DFA and SaEn quantify the time dependency of a time series but return outcome values not easily interpretable in relation to other physiological measurements (e.g.</s><s>duration of muscle activity, latency in reflex measurements, reaction time).</s></p><p><s>Inspired by multiscale entropy (MSE) and to overcome the aforementioned methodological limitation, entropic half-life (ENT½) was proposed by Zandiyeh and Von Tscharner <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>ENT½ estimates the time until the predictability in a time series is halved.</s><s>This is also a measure of how long data points remain related to one another.</s><s>Applied to movement related variables, ENT½ could quantify how long time elapses before previously performed movements have substantially reduced their influence on future movements 2 .</s></p><p><s>While DFA, SaEn, and MSE previously have been applied to characterize the stride-to-stride time dependency in human gait, ENT½ has to the best of our knowledge not previously been used to quantify time dependency in stride-to-stride time intervals.</s><s>When applied to strideto-stride time interval time series, ENT½ will estimate how long (in terms of number of strides) it takes to deteriorate the predictability of the stride time intervals by 50 %.</s><s>DFA could be used to quantify decay in time persistence of time series through an application similar in manner to ENT½.</s></p><p><s>In many gait experiments, the treadmill has been used instead of overground walking due to its advantages with respect to continuous data collection of motion capture, ground reaction forces, etc.</s><s>The results and interpretation have often been extrapolated to overground walking even though substantial biomechanical differences have been observed between treadmill and overground walking <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>The constraints of the constant speed and limited space of the treadmill have been suggested to induce a less persistent and more unpredictable walking pattern compared to overground walking <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The present study aimed at introducing two novel tools, ENT½ and SPD as methods to quantify time dependency in stride-to-stride time intervals during human gait.</s><s>To validate the use of these methods, the present study included known theoretical signals (i.e., periodic, chaotic, and random) and stride time data recorded during overground and treadmill walking.</s><s>With respect to the theoretical signals, it was hypothesized that the periodic signals would be characterized by high ENT½ and SPD, the random signal would be characterized by low ENT½ and SPD and the chaotic signals would be characterized by intermediate ENT½ and SPD.</s><s>Further, experimental data from one-hour of walking overground and on a treadmill were used to verify the use of the methods.</s><s>Based on previous observations of less statistical persistency and more unpredictability during treadmill walking <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , we hypothesized that the time dependency during treadmill will be less pronounced indicated by lower ENT½ and SPD values compared to overground walking.</s></p><p><s>As a secondary aim, the association between statistical persistence and predictability were investigated.</s><s>If changes in the statistical persistence in stride-to-stride time intervals observed during human walking <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> could explain changes in the predictability; it was hypothesized that the scaling exponent and SaEn in such time series would correlate.</s><s>Furthermore, if changes in the deterioration in statistical persistence in stride-to-stride time intervals could explain changes in the deterioration in the predictability, ENT½ and

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Procedures</head><p><s>To verify the interpretation of the outcome measure, twenty time series of four different mathematical signals of 2500 data points with different characteristics (periodic, chaotic, and random) were created using the colored noise generator function in Matlab (MathWorks R2011b).</s><s>These signals included a brown noise signal (power spectrum of 1/f 2 ) which was considered to be periodic, a signal derived from the second Lorenz differential equation (σ = 10, ρ = 28, and β = 8/3) which was considered to be chaotic, a pink noise signal (power spectrum of 1/f) which also was considered to be chaotic, and a white Gaussian noise signal (constant power spectrum) which was considered to be random (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The periodic brown noise signal and the random Gaussian noise signal represented two extremes for each of the four applied analyses with the chaotic Lorenz attractor and pink noise as intermediate signals.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol</head><p><s>The study consisted of two experimental sessions.</s><s>During the first session the subjects completed a one hour overground walking trial on an elliptical indoor track (circumference ~ 201m) at their self-selected walking speed.</s><s>The walking speed was not recorded and was allowed to fluctuate.</s><s>At the second session, the subjects completed a one hour treadmill walking trial at a constant self-selected walking speed.</s><s>The walking speeds were not registered.</s><s>During both walking trials, footswitches (Trigno™ 4-channel FSR Sensor, Delsys Inc., Natick, MA) placed under both heels recorded heel strikes at a sampling rate of 148 Hz.</s><s>No objective measurement of fatigue was obtained during the trials.</s><s>However, none of the subjects reported fatigue to influence their gait.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p><s>The right heel strike data series from each walking trial was processed in Matlab (MathWorks R2011b) in order to create stride time interval time series (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and supplementary material 1).</s><s>Stride time was defined as the time from heel strike of one foot until the subsequent heel strike of the same foot.</s><s>Each time series was cut to contain 2500 strides and were subjected to four different analyses: 1) SaEn, 2) ENT½, 3) DFA, and 4) SPD.</s></p></div>

a random permutation of the data points in the original time series.</s></p><p><s>The normalized SaEn values were then plotted in a semi logarithmic plot as a function of the stride number (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The stride number corresponding to the first SaEn value above 0.5 was considered the stride number indicating a change in the characteristics of the reshaped time series from predictability to unpredictability and termed entropic half-life <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Detrended

random permutation of the data points in the original time series and σ αRan is the corresponding standard deviation.</s><s>Thus, the critical limit was based on the upper 95% confidence limit (μ + 2σ) of the scaling exponent of the randomised time series.</s><s>As the order of data points changed with every rescaled time series, the statistical persistence changed towards the critical limit.</s><s>Any scaling exponent below the critical limit was not significantly different from that of randomised patterns in the original time series.</s><s>The number of strides required to reduce

be followed by deviations in the same direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>It has been emphasised that the statistical persistence should be interpreted within the context of the control process of the parameter in question, the influence of biomechanical, anatomical, and neuro-muscular redundancy and the task constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Thus, the constraints imposed by the treadmill on the motor control system cause a reduction of the statistical persistence which has been suggested to be linked to a tighter control <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, Terrier and Deriaz 31 observed that a reduction in statistical persistence in stride time intervals was accompanied by a reduction in largest Lyapunov exponent of the centre of mass accelerations during treadmill walking.</s><s>The authors interpreted this as an increase in gait stability during treadmill walking compared to overground walking.</s><s>Interestingly, this proposed tighter control is accompanied by a lower predictability in the stride time intervals.</s><s>Inducing further constraints through use of virtual reality environments with different optic flow, Katsavelis and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> observed an additional decrease in predictability (quantified by approximate entropy).</s></p><p><s>Two alternative interpretations could be made based on this.</s><s>It could be speculated that the tighter control during constraint walking (e.g.</s><s>treadmill or virtual reality environment) increases the gait stability (decrease in largest Lyapunov exponent) through more usage of the available degrees of freedom (increase in sample/approximate entropy).</s><s>This interpretation suggests that treadmill walking constitutes an optimal walking condition compared to overground walking.</s><s>Alternatively, it could be speculated that the unconstrained overground walking is successfully performed through a more flexible control which relies on the self-organized interplay of the degrees of freedom within the body.</s><s>This interaction creates a movement solution characterized by higher statistical persistence and a sufficient level of predictability enabling an adaptable walking pattern.</s><s>This would furthermore indicate that the human locomotor control during unconstrained walking is more complex compared to constrained walking as suggested by Costa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Accordingly, constrained walking could be considered a more challenging task compared to unconstrained walking for the motor control system to solve which induces a more randomlike pattern in the stridetime intervals.</s><s>As a consequent, tighter motor control reduces the rate of divergence of the centre of mass accelerations to ensure a stable upper body motion.</s><s>Although both explanations are valid, we consider the latter to be the most likely.</s><s>In support of this explanation, Dingwell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> observed that during treadmill walking stride speed fluctuations exhibited anti-persistence while stride time and stride length exhibited statistical persistence.</s><s>It was suggested that while stride speed required a tighter motor control in order to stay in the middle of the treadmill belt, stride time and stride length was allowed to fluctuate more freely with more flexible control due to the redundancy of these two parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, Terrier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> observed that during overground walking the stride speed as well as stride time and stride length exhibited statistical persistence and suggested that these parameters were allowed to fluctuate freely.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the scaling exponent and SaEn, the two walking conditions did not induce differences in ENT½ and SPD.</s><s>This could indicate that while the constraints imposed by the treadmill may affect the observed statistical persistence and predictability, it does not seem to affect the rate at which this deteriorates.</s><s>Furthermore, the present study investigated the relationship between SaEn and scaling exponent and between ENT½ and SPD, to assess the potential shared mechanisms behind the generation of statistical persistence and predictability observed in stride time intervals.</s><s>The result showed low to moderate nonsignificant correlations between SaEn and scaling exponent and between ENT½ and SPD for both walking conditions indicating a limited relationship between the generation of statistical persistence predictability and between the rates of deterioration of the statistical persistence and gradually reduction in predictability.</s><s>Based on this, it could be speculated that the sources of these characteristics in the gait pattern does not change these parameters synchronously.</s><s>It is well established that the motor cortex, corticospinal tract, and spinal cord are involved in the motor control of human locomotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Although potentially involved in generating the observed time dependency in gait, the actual contribution from the nervous system is unknown.</s><s>Furthermore, the need for involvement of higher cortical-spinal structures in the formation of the statistical persistence observed in human gait has been questioned <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>In addition, it has previously been established that the statistical persistence in stride time intervals is lower in patients of neurological diseases, elderly, and fall prone individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Thus, pathological and age-related changes in both neurological musculoskeletal structures could contribute to altered temporal structure of the gait pattern 8 .</s><s>However, whether the time dependency is affected in these types of individuals is a topic for future research.</s></p><p><s>The present study only included walking at the preferred walking speed of the included subjects.</s><s>Thus, the motor control was not challenged beyond what could be considered the less demanding walking task.</s><s>Thus, it remains unknown if the time dependency of stride time intervals quantified with ENT½ and SPD exhibits the same walking speed relationship as previously shown for scaling exponent at walking speeds beyond and below the preferred walking speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Time dependency was only quantified in the stride-to-stride time intervals.</s><s>Thus, it remains unknown if the observed results also apply to other gait characteristics (i.e., stride length, stride speed).</s><s>Additionally, future studies should explore the potential of using ENT½ and SPD on lower limb joint angle trajectory data obtained during walking.</s><s>Previous studies have applied various nonlinear analyses (e.g.</s><s>largest Lyapunov exponent, correlation dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> ) to assess joint angles dynamics.</s><s>Thus, difference the knee angle joint dynamics has been observed between young and elderly individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and between the injured and healthy knee in ACL deficient patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>It is likely that differences in the time dependency in joint angles during various locomotion tasks could be detected by ENT½ and SPD.</s><s>The gait pattern of elderly individuals has been observed to be more random compared to younger individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>This would potentially be characterized by a shorter ENT½ and SPD in the elderly group.</s><s>However, future studies should investigate this topic.</s></p><p><s>The present study introduced ENT½ and SPD as novel methods to quantify time dependency during overground and treadmill walking and was able to show that predictability in stride time intervals was halved after approximate 14 strides and that the statistical persistence was deteriorated to uncorrelated noise after approximately 50 strides.</s><s>These observations were accompanied by a lower statistical persistence and lower predictability during treadmill walking compared to overground walking.</s><s>Calculation procedure for ENT½ (see text for
