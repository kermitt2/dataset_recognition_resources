<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Vascular calcifications such as arteriosclerosis, which is characterized by a calcificiation of the tunica media, represent major comorbidities e.g. in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).</s><s>An essential step during the development of arteriosclerosis is the transdifferentiation/calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) resembling osteogenesis.</s><s>The matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and −9 were shown to promote these VSMC calcifications and their inhibition is of therapeutic value to prevent arteriosclerosis in preclinical studies.</s><s>Aiming for an understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms of MMPs we here investigated, if the MMP-mediated VSMC calcification involves altered signaling of the Wnt pathway, which is known to impact osteogenesis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p><s>We used an experimental in vitro model of vascular calcification.</s><s>Transdifferentiation/calcification of murine VSMC was induced by elevated calcium and phosphorus levels.</s><s>Calcification was assessed by calcium and alkaline phosphatase measurements.</s><s>Activation/activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 was assessed by conversion of fluorescence-labelled substrates.</s><s>Activation of the Wnt pathway was analysed by a reporter gene assay.</s></p><p><s>Results: Besides pro-calcifying culture conditions, also activation of Wnt signaling by a specific agonist (under normal culture conditions) stimulated VSMC-calcification accompanied by enhanced expression and secretion of the gelatinases MMP-2 and −9.</s><s>Vice versa, recombinant MMP-2 and −9 induced a time-delayed activation of Wnt signaling after 72 h in VSMC but showed no direct effects after 24-48 h.</s><s>These effects were blocked by pharmacological inhibition of MMPs or of Wnt signaling.</s><s>Conclusions: Our study suggests that the pro-calcifying environment in CKD induces Wnt signaling in VSMC which in turn contributes to the induction of MMPs which then foster the development of arteriosclerosis.</s><s>Thus, besides MMP inhibition, the inhibition of Wnt signaling in VSMC might represent a therapeutic target for the prevention of vascular calcifications.</s></p></div>
