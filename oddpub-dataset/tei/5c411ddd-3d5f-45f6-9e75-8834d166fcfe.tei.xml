<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Glycosylation is a highly versatile, complex and ubiquitous form of post-translational modification.</s><s>Glycans, covalently attached carbohydrate moieties, participate in a variety of intracellular processes or dictate basic protein characteristics such as biological activity, protein folding or proteolytic stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, glycans decorate eukaryotic cell surfaces mediating multiple binding and recognition events of cell-matrix and cell-cell communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The biosynthesis of glycans is non-template driven and is rather realized by a complex and sequential interaction of enzymes (glycosyltransferases and glycosidases).</s><s>Manipulations and studies of glycosylation cannot be achieved by conventional genetic approaches.</s><s>In this regard, metabolic glycoengineering, also referred to as metabolic oligosaccharide engineering, is a straightforward and nascent strategy to create modified glycans by incorporation of exogenously supplied sugar analogues.</s><s>A landmark work was published in 1992 by Reutter and coworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which reported on the substrate permissivity of the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway for derivatives of the metabolic precursor N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) with unnatural elongations at the N-acyl position.</s><s>Subsequently, a multitude of functional groups (such as azides, thiols, alkynes or ketones) were introduced and served as targets for chemoselective ligation reactions enabling glycan detection for quantitative and functional studies or visualization and localization of glycoconjugates <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Since the sialic acid metabolism served as a workhorse for methodology development and pioneered this technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the scope of metabolic glycoengineering has been broadened to further glycosylation pathways.</s><s>In this regard, the deoxyhexose fucose was addressed as the first non-amino sugar.</s><s>Owing to their terminal position at glycan structures and their relevance in important cellular and pathological processes such as fertilization, immune response, inflammation or tumor metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the study of fucosylated glycoconjugates is of high interest.</s><s>Structural modifications of the fucose C-6 position by azide or alkyne substituents were shown to be tolerated by fucosyltransferases and the biosynthetic pathway in several reports of the Bertozzi and Wong group, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Besides visualizing the dynamics and localization of glycans on cell surface level or imaging their intracellular distribution via introduced structural modifications, also unmodified sugars and metabolic precursors are a key aspect of ongoing research.</s><s>On the level of cell surface glycoconjugates, uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) 2-epimerase (part of the bifunctional enzyme GNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) was reported to catalyze the rate-limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway of sialic acids and, thus, be a major determinant of cell surface sialylation.</s><s>In this context, hyposialylation was shown to be metabolically complemented by ManNAc treatment in human hematopoietic cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Monosaccharide therapy of GNE myopathy, a neuromuscular genetic disorder associated with impaired glycan sialylation, was investigated by oral administration of mannosamine (ManN) and ManNAc <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> or sialic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> in mouse models, respectively.</s><s>Moreover, oral mannose is an efficient therapy for patients of phosphomannose isomerase deficiency-the only congenital defect of glycosylation that can be treated <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Experiments based on findings of Marquardt and colleagues revealed that oral supplementation of fucose and incorporation via salvage pathway correct the metabolic defects found in patients with leucocyte adhesion deficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>In a biotechnological approach, Gu and Wang addressed the sialylation level of recombinant human interferon-γ by supplementing the CHO culture medium with ManNAc <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In a similar study, Bork et al. increased the sialylation of recombinant erythropoietin by ManNAc treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Further potentials of metabolic glycoengineering for biotechnological applications were also reported for recombinant sialoglycoproteins expressed in insect cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Large-scale adaption of metabolic glycoengineering on a cellular level is hindered by low metabolic utilization of sugars or their analogues requiring millimolar quantities of the monosaccharides to overcome plasma membrane barrier and maximize efficient incorporation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Masking the hydroxyl groups of sugar residues by acetylation (that is removed intracellularly by unspecific esterases) was introduced by Sarkar et al. in 1995 as a strategy to increase hydrophobicity and cellular uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Acetylated ManNAc derivatives were later reported to be used with up to 900-fold improved efficiency in contrast to their underivatized counterparts in various mammalian cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Further elongations of the carbon chain length of ester derivatives attached to the hydroxyl groups (as for tetra-O-propanoylated or -butanoylated ManNAc) were also cleaved by cytosolic esterases and resulted in additional increase of metabolic utilization at low concentrations (&lt;150 µM), but also showed enhanced toxicity at higher concentrations (such as 500 µM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The current work addresses the fucose salvage pathway via the metabolic glycoengineering method.</s><s>According to the approach of Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we transferred the basic principle from ManNAc to fucose applying acylated analogues to facilitate passive diffusion across the cell membrane and, thus, cellular uptake (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>A tetra-O-propanoylated derivative (Prop4Fuc) was used in comparison to standard acetylated fucose (Ac4Fuc).</s><s>Since the elongation of ester groups can potentially raise solubility or toxicity problems, we also investigated the usage of a novel PEGylated fucose (PEG4Fuc).</s><s>Due to the activity of cytosolic esterases with broad substrate spectra and the absence of any modifying group, we assumed that our analogues are introduced in the form of unmodified fucose units into the biosynthesis pathway (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Thus, a proof of successful monosaccharide incorporation had to be provided by an increase of fucosylation itself.</s><s>As an appropriate test system in order to clearly distinguish the effects of exogenously supplied sugar, we chose a CHO cell line in which the de novo fucose synthesis pathway is blocked by heterologous expression of the prokaryotic enzyme GDP-6-deoxy-D-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase (RMD) (GlymaxX ® technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We also focused on a recombinantly expressed and secreted immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody in these CHO cells.</s><s>Fucosylation is known to crucially affect one of the antibody's effector functions: antibodies lacking core fucose in their Fc N-glycan exhibit significantly increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>In this regard, we aimed at a sequential antibody fucosylation by applying controlled concentrations of fucose analogues in our metabolic glycoengineering experiments.</s><s>Moreover, the relation between the fucosylation level and its effect on IgG activity were investigated via a FcγRIIIa binding assay indicating ADCC bioactivity.</s><s>Biosynthesis of L-fucose (red triangle) occurs mainly via de novo synthesis and, to a minor extent, through the salvage pathway that is exploited here in the course of metabolic glycoengineering; Acyl moieties (shown in B) are introduced to fucose to facilitate cellular uptake across the plasma membrane and are thought to be cleaved intracellularly by cytosolic esterases.</s><s>Emanating from GDP-mannose (green circle), the de novo pathway can be blocked by enzymatic conversion of the intermediate GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose into a dead-end product (GDP-rhamnose, green triangle) by GDP-6-deoxy-D-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase (RMD) as previously shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Other monosaccharide symbols are explained in Section 2.8.</s></p></div>
