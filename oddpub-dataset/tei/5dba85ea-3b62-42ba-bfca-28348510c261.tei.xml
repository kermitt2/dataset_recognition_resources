<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairment and progressive neuropsychiatric changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Harper 1996)</ref>.</s><s>It is caused by an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in huntingtin (HTT), a large, ubiquitously expressed, multidomain protein with multiple cellular functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Harjes and Wanker 2003)</ref>.</s><s>The elongated polyQ sequence is believed to confer a toxic gain of function to HTT, leading to a selective neurodegenerative disease phenotype primarily in patient brains <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(DiFiglia et al. 1995)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A hallmark of HD pathology is the accumulation of insoluble aggregates that are formed of N-terminal HTT fragments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(DiFiglia et al. 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Aggregates of HTT in the brains of patients and transgenic animals are sequestered into nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions.</s><s>These structures also contain molecular chaperones or components of the ubiquitin proteasome system involved in cellular defense mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ciechanover and Brundin 2003)</ref>.</s><s>This as-sociation, as well as the fact that the formation of inclusion bodies correlates with motor impairment in HD transgenic mice, suggests that inclusions with large insoluble HTT aggregates are harmful for neuronal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Yamamoto et al. 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, evidence has been provided that the toxic species in HD may be diffusible oligomeric or protofibrillar HTT aggregates with pathogenic polyQ tracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hands and Wyttenbach 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to large inclusion bodies, these smaller structures are described as highly mobile and able to associate with numerous cellular proteins, leading to abnormal protein-protein interactions and dysfunction of a range of important cellular processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Miller et al. 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In any case, the molecular mechanisms by which toxic, polyQ-containing HTT protein complexes and aggregates form in neuronal cells and cause selective dysfunction and toxicity remain unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hands and Wyttenbach 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Various studies have demonstrated that polyQ tracts with about 40 or more glutamine residues drive the spontaneous misfolding and aggregation of N-terminal HTT fragments in cell-free and cell-based assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Scherzinger et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Waelter et al. 2001)</ref>.</s><s>This is supported by investigations in Caenorhabditis elegans, which show that GFPtagged fusion proteins with long polyQ tracts (more than 40 glutamines) form inclusion bodies much more efficiently than fusion proteins with short polyQ tracts (20-35 glutamines) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Morley et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Initially, it was suggested that the spontaneous misfolding and aggregation of HTT fragments is initiated by hydrogen bonds that stabilize intermolecular interactions between polyQ tracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Perutz et al. 1994)</ref>.</s><s>More recent studies, however, indicate that polyQ flanking sequences, rather than the polyQ tracts themselves, initiate spontaneous HTT protein aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Saunders and Bottomley 2009)</ref>.</s><s>For instance, it was shown that the first 17 amino acids in HTT, which adopt an Œ±-helical conformation, can initiate the spontaneous aggregation of pathogenic polyQ tracts in cell-free assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Thakur et al. 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The importance of this polyQ flanking sequence for HTT misfolding is supported by biochemical studies with a chaperonin, which directly binds to the first 17 amino acids of HTT and blocks the de novo aggregation of N-terminal HTT fragments <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Tam et al. 2009</ref>).</s><s>Thus, proteins that directly associate with polyQ flanking regions appear to strongly influence the spontaneous polymerization of disease proteins.</s></p><p><s>Potential modifiers of mutant HTT aggregation expressed in neurons may be waiting to be discovered in the large number of proteins that associate with N-terminal polyQ-containing HTT fragments in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) or coimmunoprecipitation assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goehler et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kaltenbach et al. 2007)</ref>.</s><s>The challenge has been to distinguish modifiers with relevance to disease from other interaction partners.</s><s>Several observations may be helpful in meeting this challenge.</s><s>First, neuronal cell death in HD occurs predominantly in particular brain regions.</s><s>Second, disease-causing mutations can lead to perturbations in the PPI networks in affected tissues, thereby influencing pathogenesis.</s><s>Changes in functional protein interactions are frequently linked to changed protein levels in cells; both phenomena have been shown to favor spontaneous protein misfolding and are indicators that a protein might influence HTT aggregation and HD pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Pechmann et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Vavouri et al. 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we reasoned that HTT interaction partners displaying abnormal changes in abundance in regions of the brain that are particularly vulnerable to HD may be disease-relevant modifiers that influence mutant HTT misfolding and aggregation.</s></p><p><s>To identify them, we developed a simple but powerful computational procedure.</s><s>We exploited published gene expression data obtained from specific brain regions and HD patients to carry out a step-by-step filtering of a large HTT PPI network that includes more than 500 known interaction partners directly or indirectly linked to HTT.</s><s>By applying sequential interaction network filtering, we defined 13 HTT-associated human proteins whose expression in the caudate nucleus of HD patient brains is likely to be abnormal.</s><s>Evaluation of available data and focused confirmation studies enabled the discovery of the protein collapsin response mediator protein 1 (CRMP1), a neuron-specific phosphoprotein that plays a central role in neuronal development and communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Charrier et al. 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Levels of CRMP1 transcription were abnormally low in the brains of HD patients.</s><s>Experimental studies in cell model systems revealed that overproduction of CRMP1 significantly reduces both misfolding and toxicity of mutant HTT, whereas down-regulating the protein using siRNA had the opposite effect.</s><s>We confirmed these findings in a Drosophila melanogaster model of HD.</s><s>Further investigations in cell-free assays revealed that CRMP1 directly targets aggregation-prone HTT molecules and reduces their propensity to spontaneously self-assemble into insoluble amyloid structures.</s><s>A mutant, nonfunctional CRMP1 protein (D408V) did not produce this effect.</s><s>Thus, our results indicate that CRMP1 acts as a chaperone-like protein in neuronal cells, where it associates with polyQ-containing HTT and reduces its conversion into proteotoxic protein aggregates.</s><s>This has implications for HD pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies.</s><s>More generally, our experimental results confirm our computational network filtering procedure to be highly valuable to identify disease-relevant proteins.</s><s>It can be applied for interaction network analysis and the identification of aggregation modulators in a wide variety of diseases.</s></p></div>

10 ‚àí4 ) (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</s><s>This resulted in the brain-specific network PPI 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), which consists of 113 interactions.</s><s>In PPI 2 , 88 human proteins are directly or indirectly linked to the disease protein HTT (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S4A</ref>,B).</s></p><p><s>HD affects the whole brain, but certain areas such as the caudate nucleus are more vulnerable than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Vonsattel et al. 1985)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore generated a brain region-specific protein interaction network in step II of the filtering procedure.</s><s>We defined genes as differentially expressed in the caudate nucleus (CN) by comparison to motor cortex (MC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and cerebellum (CE), again using publicly available gene expression profiles for healthy brain regions (ŒîEG 2 , P 2 &lt; 10 ‚àí3 ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>; Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>).</s><s>This filtering step yielded PPI 3 , a network with caudate nucleus proteins that are potentially altered in their abundance in comparison to other brain regions.</s><s>This network connects 66 human proteins via 84 interactions directly or indirectly to <ref type="bibr">HTT (Fig. 1A;</ref><ref type="bibr">Supplemental Table S6A,</ref><ref type="bibr">B)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies suggested that dysregulated HTT-interacting proteins might influence the propensity of HTT to misfold and self-assemble into insoluble protein aggregates <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goehler et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Behrends et al. 2006)</ref>.</s><s>In step III of the filtering procedure we therefore searched for HTT-associated proteins dysregulated in HD patient brains.</s><s>In a comparison of gene expression profiles from 38 HD patients and 32 healthy individuals (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>), we identified human genes that are differentially expressed in the caudate nucleus of HD patients and healthy individuals (ŒîEG 3 , P 3 &lt; 10 ‚àí6) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>; Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>).</s><s>This set was then utilized to filter the PPI 3 network to yield the final, HD dysregulated caudate-nucleus-specific HTT interaction network PPI 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>;

(2) caudate nucleus compared to other brain tissues; and (3) brains of HD patients compared to healthy individuals.</s><s>This finally resulted in the generation of a focused network with potentially dysregulated HTT-associated proteins (PPI 4 ) that might influence HTT misfolding and aggregation in neurons.</s></p><p><s>We designed our protein interaction network filtering procedure to create a focused HTT interaction network that contains a high percentage of already known HD therapy targets (HDTTs).</s><s>These targets were shown in previous studies to influence the pathogenesis in various HD model systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kalathur et al. 2012)</ref>, suggesting that the other proteins in the network PPI 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) might also affect the disease process in HD.</s><s>Through our network filtering approach, four proteins (HMGA1, KLF6, CFLAR, and CRMP1) were selected that have not previously been linked to HD pathogenesis.</s><s>They subsequently were systematically examined in cellbased assays to determine whether they influence mutant HTT aggregation.</s><s>Strikingly, we found that three (HMGA1, CFLAR, and CRMP1) of four computationally predicted proteins are potent modulators of mutant HTT aggregation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), supporting our initial hypothesis that among dysregulated HTT interaction partners, aggregation modulators can be identified.</s><s>Intriguingly, two of them are located in chromosomal regions (CFLAR: 2q33;
