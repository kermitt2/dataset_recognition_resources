<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>At present, there is increasing interest in developing alternative methods for toxicological evaluations that do not require the testing of animals.</s><s>In addition, particularly in Europe, several legislative imperatives drive an assessment of chemicals and products based on animal-free toxicological methods.</s><s>For example, animal testing is banned in the cosmetic legislation and non-animal testing methods have to be used to fulfill the legal request for safe products (7th amendment to the European Union's Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EE).</s></p><p><s>Hence, both legislations underscore the need for non-animal tools and methods predicting the inherent toxic properties of chemical substances.</s></p><p><s>In REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals), (Regulation (EC) <ref type="bibr">No. 1907</ref><ref type="bibr">No. /2006))</ref>, chemical risk assessment requires providing information on chemicals, the extent of which depends on the yearly production volume of the chemical.</s><s>Whereas, the information required is clearly defined, the tools by which the information is gathered remain open and the legislative text [Annex XI of Regulation (EC) <ref type="bibr">No. 1907</ref><ref type="bibr">No. /2006] ]</ref> stipulates only that animal experiments should be avoided whenever possible.</s><s>Promising approaches, like grouping of substances and read-across (ECHA, 2014) are described under Section 1.5 of the above-mentioned Annex XI of Regulation (EC) <ref type="bibr">No. 1907</ref><ref type="bibr">No. /2006</ref>.</s><s>In this legislative text, similarity is defined based on a common functional group, common precursor or degradation product or a constant pattern in the potency of properties across the category.</s></p><p><s>Several guidance documents and their discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(OECD, 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">ECHA, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">ECHA, , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">ECHA, , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">NAFTA TWG, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Patlewicz, 2014)</ref> describe the principles but also the challenges of read-across approaches in detail.</s><s>A quantitative read-across encompasses three steps (i) a definition on which similarity the search for analogs is based (physicochemical properties, chemical structure, shared mechanism, or a combination) (ii) a search for analogs with experimental data for the endpoint of interest (iii) a selection of the most similar substances out of step 1 and derivation of the missing point of departure for risk assessment.</s></p><p><s>In the context of defining a shared mechanism, the concept of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) 1 is becoming increasingly important <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(OECD, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>This concept has been developed as a structured approach to portray the linkage between initiating molecular events and the relevant adverse outcome at organism level (National Resarch Council/Committee on Toxicity Testing Assessment of Environmental <ref type="bibr">Agents, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>AOPs assemble existing information into a concept, which includes knowledge on molecular interactions, cellular metabolism, and consequences of disturbances at check points.</s></p><p><s>Recently, after the Guidance Document on Developing and Assessing AOPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(OECD, 2013)</ref>, OECD established an AOP knowledge base in September 2014.</s><s>Furthermore, this approach has already been used to categorize nitrobenzene for their toxicity endpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Sakuratani et al., 2013b)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The combination of chemical structural similarity with shared mechanism of action was the basic conceptual approach of the project, which we will present in this publication.</s><s>The aim of the project was to establish substance categories for complex endpoints of toxicity after repeated dosing.</s><s>We explored several innovative strategies for setting up categories that would enable an estimate of repeated-dose toxicity supporting a readacross approach.</s><s>Two databases were established containing physicochemical data including structure and molecular weight as well as toxicity data from repeated-dose testing.</s><s>We adapted methods for clustering chemicals based on structural and on toxicological information by detecting groups of chemicals with similar toxic profiles and pathways/mechanisms of toxicity.</s><s>We have evaluated the chemical clustering results, by assessing their chemical and toxicological similarities with the aim of identifying clusters with a concordance between structural information and toxicity profiles/mechanisms.</s><s>The resulting clusters are discussed in detail in this publication and can be used for (quantitative) read-across.</s><s>The overall tool is provided as a free web service 2 .</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Databases</head><p><s>Within this project the clustering is performed on a dataset consisting of data coming from a database on repeated dose testing of industrial chemicals (ELINCS) and the RepDose database 3 .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data From ELINCS</head><p><s>The sources of the data are the regulatory documents from ELINCS (European List of Notified Chemical Substances), which is the new substance notification of the Chemicals Act <ref type="bibr">(European Commission, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The repository comprises new industrial chemicals registered in Europe between 1982 and 2008, which have been tested in subacute and/or subchronic studies.</s><s>Practically, data on the substances were stored in the archive of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR).</s><s>The data comprise physicochemical and toxicological information.</s><s>Access to the data from this source was restricted and regulated by a contract of confidentiality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kalkhof et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This contract allowed the use of the data on the premise that the structures and chemical identity are held confidentially.</s><s>The analysis of the confidential data was performed therefore only by the authorized authors.</s><s>The data are of high quality because they have been obtained under defined internationally accepted experimental OECD-standards <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 1998a,b and former versions)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, as a rule, regulatory scientists of an EU member state reviewed the studies and their results and assigned reliabilities.</s><s>The full ELINCS repository is available to all European Competent Authorities for chemical assessment.</s></p><p><s>To enable the analysis of the ELINCS data, the studies were stored in a database format in accordance to the RepDose database.</s><s>Only studies performed with chemical substances with a purity ≥90% were entered in this final database.</s><s>The purity of 90% was also applied as prerequisite for further study selection in this analysis.</s><s>Studies with dermal or inhalation route of exposure were not available in the digital version of ELINCS data.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the full database includes 540 substance entries.</s><s>All studies are compliant with the OECD guidelines 407 and 408 <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 1998a,b and former versions)</ref>.</s><s>ELINCS tabulates substances by the registration number with the standard format: xx-xx-xxxx.</s><s>The first digits represent the year of notification, followed by two digits representing the country of notification.</s><s>The last four digits allow sequential numbering of individual dossiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barabair et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data From the RepDose Database</head><p><s>The RepDose database is a relational database on toxicological animal testing after repeated administration.</s><s>Information from publically available peer-reviewed reports and original publications on existing organic chemicals with defined structures (no polymers, no mixtures) is collected in the RepDose database.</s><s>Chemicals were selected if evaluations exist e.g., by German MAK committee, in EU Risk Assessments on existing chemicals, in OECD Existing Chemicals Screening Information Data Sets (SIDS), or in the eChem-Portal (REACH).</s><s>In addition, projects like the development and evaluation of TTC concepts with a special focus on inhalation application contributed information to the database.</s><s>Originally, the database was funded by a CEFIC LRI project with the basic idea of providing a user-friendly tool for setting up structure-activity relationships as well as other supporting methods for a simplified and scientifically sound risk assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bitsch et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The data within the RepDose database are organized by information types: physicochemical properties of the test chemical, study design including guideline compliance, purity and scope of examination, observed effects at the related doses [effect Lowest Observed Effect Level (LOELs)] based on glossaries for organs and related effects.</s><s>Overall, the RepDose database contains about 850 chemicals with 2900 related studies of which about 400 studies were selected as being guideline-conform to oral or inhalation subacute or subchronic studies with rats.</s><s>The guideline compliance is coded in the RepDose database analog to Klimisch Codes with A-guideline conform-and B-minor deviations from guidelines-being considered for this project.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset</head><p><s>As mentioned above, the following selection criteria were applied to compile a consistent dataset out of the two sources:</s></p><p><s>-duration is subchronic (84-99 days) or subacute (28-32 days), route of application is oral or inhalation.</s><s>-studied species is rat.</s></p><p><s>-studies are highly reliable as conducted in conformity to (current) guidelines.</s><s>-purity of the substances is at least 90%.</s></p><p><s>The organization of toxicological data in both databases follows the same basic structure; the data are organized by an organ toxicity split into subgroups according to similarities at the phenotypic and the mechanistic level.</s><s>All target organs and effects are named according to a thorough chosen and curated glossary.</s></p><p><s>The final dataset comprises 1022 studies (64 both, 557 subacute, 278 subchronic) for 899 organic industrial chemicals.</s><s>The toxicological information of a chemical is taken from all studies available.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curation and Refinement of the Dataset</head><p><s>We developed a common glossary for all endpoints, which were applied to the toxicological findings.</s></p><p><s>In developing the common glossary, it became obvious that there was a conflict between the level of granularity and the density of data in the matrix and a compromise had to be found.</s><s>The following procedure was followed:</s></p><p><s>At the beginning, LOELs for up to 460 different organ-effectcombinations were extracted from the databases.</s><s>The results were characterized by a very sparse matrix with many missing LOELs, where there were different reasons for missing LOELs such as no finding, not investigated and no information available.</s><s>To reduce the number of missing values we introduced first a cut-off of 5% only organ effect combinations that occur at least for ≥5% of all substances that were included in the dataset.</s><s>In a second, related step, organ-effect combinations were merged according to their toxicological relationship and based on toxicological expert knowledge.</s><s>For illustration liver-degeneration, liverhypertrophy, liver-inflammation-regeneration, and remaining liver effects were aggregated to liver effects and effects on erythrocytes, hematocrit, and hemoglobin were collected as rbc effects.</s><s>Thereby, a plausible compromise between specific but not too sparse information was obtained.</s><s>In the final dataset, every substance is characterized by 28 endpoint/organ combinations.</s></p><p><s>In case of multiple LOELs for one study due to different organs affected the lowest LOEL was taken and was declared the study LOEL.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discretization of Data</head><p><s>In addition to the toxicological profile, we decided to include the toxicological potency using LOEL values.</s><s>In a further step, these LOEL values were categorized into high-potency and lowpotency as described in this section.</s></p><p><s>One of the challenges of modeling in vivo data is the high uncertainty of experimentally derived endpoint values.</s><s>Moreover, aggregating the dataset from numerous studies introduces more noise.</s><s>Hence, to simplify modeling, we converted the numeric data (LOELs) to binary nominal data with class values for high-potency and for low-potency for each endpoint (organ-effect combination).</s><s>As toxicological effects are related to the number of moles present at the site of actions, the doses were converted to moles of chemicals/kg bw/day taking into consideration the molecular weight of the chemicals.</s><s>We developed a clustering-based discretization method that automatically detects a threshold specifically for each endpoint: Compounds with a LOEL lower or equal to this threshold are categorized as high-potency compounds; compounds above this threshold are categorized as low-potency compounds.</s><s>An example is given for red blood cells in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,B</ref>.</s><s>The main idea of our approach is to adjust the threshold to the existing data distribution.</s></p><p><s>Our technique produces a balanced ratio of high-potency and low-potency class values, which is often preferable for modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we manually limit the threshold to a fixed range of 1.5-2.0</s><s>µmol (for subacute studies).</s><s>Subsequently, our clustering method determines a threshold dynamically within this range, in contrast to the rigid threshold that is applied by, e.g., Equal Frequency Discretization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dougherty et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>This method yields a mean ratio of 49% high-potency compounds in the overall dataset.</s><s>The distributions of LOELs for effects on red blood cells are shown as example in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,B</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The dataset used in this publication is composed of subacute studies with study durations of 28-32 days and subchronic studies with 84-99 days.</s><s>Overall the distribution of our data supports the assessment factors proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">ECHA (2012)</ref> showing a factor two between subchronic and subacute effects.</s><s>The analysis of effects on red blood cell is given as example (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,B</ref>).</s><s>Hence, in the further processing of the data we have adjusted the threshold for subchronic studies according to ECHA guidelines to take the increased study duration into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(ECHA, 2012)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Handling of Missing Values</head><p><s>As described above, the dataset has been compiled from various studies for a multitude of chemicals.</s><s>This implies that not all endpoints were affected and/or tested for every chemical.</s><s>In total, 82% of the compound endpoint pairs are "missing, " which means that information on these endpoints was not available (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>To make the most of the available information and to enable clustering in the first place, we are using a method for so-called imputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Schafer, 1997)</ref>, i.e., a method substituting missing values by "best guesses."</s><s>The imputed values are chosen, taking advantage of known variable correlations.</s><s>One approach for imputation is employing machine learning models, i.e., learning a classifier to predict the missing values, which has been shown to yield good results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jerez et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>As our dataset has multiple nominal endpoint values for each compound, a Multi-Label-Classification (MLC) algorithm is required that predicts multiple endpoint values simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Tsoumakas and Katakis, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>We have selected Ensemble of Classifier Chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Read et al., 2011)</ref> as MLC model to predict the missing values in our dataset.</s><s>The imputed values are exclusively used as input for the clustering algorithm (i.e., the PCT algorithm is applied to a "filled up" version of the dataset without missing values).</s><s>The analysis of the resulting clusters is restricted to the non-imputed data including missing values.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Available Tools</head><p><s>Predicting repeated dose toxicity still faces many challenges such as the lack of sufficient, good quality data and a shortage of mechanistic interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cherkasov et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Read-across seems a promising option among other available prediction tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Schilter et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However, it relies to a high degree on expert knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Patlewicz et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One of the read-across tools is the HESS system, contained in the OECD QSAR Toolbox.</s><s>With this tool grouping and read-across for about 40 categories and 20 structural alerts can be performed for repeated toxicity endpoints in mammalians 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Yamada et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Yamada et al., , 2013a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Yamada et al., ,b, 2014;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sakuratani et al., 2013a,b)</ref>.</s><s>The further evaluation of the predictions using the HESS system remains an open task.</s></p><p><s>Another framework that aids identifying analogs and rating their suitability for read-across is presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wu et al. (2010)</ref>.</s><s>The prediction framework Lazar (Lazy Structure-Activity Relationships) resembles an automated read-across procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Maunz and Helma, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Maunz et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>It predicts a query compound by performing a similarity search on the training dataset and building a local (Q)SAR model using only similar compounds.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Low et al. (2013)</ref> present a chemical-biological readacross (CBRA) approach that infers toxicity based on structural similarity but also on biological similarity.</s><s>Similar to Lazar, the method uses instance-based local models with similarity warning and present neighbors.</s><s>However, this method is not a pure in silico method, as biological responses of compounds have to be measured in vitro in short-term assays.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, there are commercially available tools, for example DEREK (Lhasa Limited, UK) and TOPKAT (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, USA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Venkatapathy et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rupp et al., 2010)</ref> which may be used for read-across purposes.</s><s>Whereas, DEREK provides qualitative information on the target organ toxicity based on similar patterns or structural alerts, TOPKAT is performing predictions on the basis of structural similarity and claims to be quantitative; it predicts LOAELs.</s><s>Testing the TOPKAT tool by using the same ELINCS dataset as in the current analysis, revealed dissatisfying results showing that the use of a refined prediction tool is highly warranted <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rupp et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Our Approach/Project</head><p><s>There is an obvious need for prediction tools.</s><s>However, all the available tools have limitations and there seems to be room for improvement in read-across tools.</s><s>In the project presented in this paper, a clustering algorithm for repeated dose toxicity was developed in a bi-dimensional approach, combining physical structural properties and organ toxicity data, an idea, which has been also discussed in the paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Maunz et al. (2013)</ref>.</s><s>This was achieved by applying PCTs, a decision-tree based clustering tool that can handle multiple endpoints simultaneously.</s><s>Applying this tool yielded a hierarchical clustering of our dataset, including a description of the structural properties that were used to assign compounds into sub-clusters of compounds with similar rat repeated dose toxicity profiles.</s><s>To characterize the compounds we selected lists of structural features and two simple PC-descriptors (molecular weight and log P) as features for constructing the PCT model with homogenous toxicological fingerprints as criterion of the clustering process.</s><s>The features, which are employed to create nodes within the tree to divide compounds into sub-clusters, yield a transparent description for each cluster.</s></p><p><s>It is a distinguishing feature of this project that the toxicological dataset used for the clustering algorithm is a highly refined and curated dataset of high quality.</s><s>In addition, the number of chemicals is higher than in any other curated dataset, containing data from repeated dose toxicity testing performed according to OECD guidelines.</s><s>To prepare the common dataset, which was derived from two sources, a common glossary has been developed and the data have been curated to allow using the whole dataset of 899 substances.</s><s>In this dataset, LOELs from 460 different organ-effect-combinations were available.</s><s>This information was finally condensed to 28 endpoints describing organ-effect combinations.</s><s>The dose-response relationship, namely the LOELs, was discretized per endpoint resulting into substances with high and low potency.</s><s>Missing values were filled by imputation, predicting the missing values with a dedicated prediction model.</s></p><p><s>Within the curation steps, several shortcomings of the data base which would have negatively influenced the clustering results had to be dealt with.</s><s>The noise of underrepresented and/or unspecific endpoints was reduced by restriction to 28 aggregated organ-effect combinations.</s><s>It is well-known that dose spacing has major impact on the LOEL values causing imbalances in the resulting LOELs of different substances.</s><s>We overcame this problem by the process of discretizing the LOELs per endpoint.</s><s>We applied imputation to limit the impact of missing values on the clustering outcome.</s></p><p><s>As it is shown in this publication, the final results were achieved by several rounds of iterations and optimizations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lessons Learned</head><p><s>From our study, the simplest predictors for a high probability of low toxicity are a molecular weight above 500 and/or a log P below 0 or above 5.</s><s>It is interesting to note that in a retrospective study on their opinions, the SCCS found a similar molecular weight (above 500 Da) and similar log P (between below −1 and above 4) for a low or even very low dermal absorption and hence toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(SCCS, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Further support is provided by several authors for the importance of log P for toxicity resulting in screening drug candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hughes et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Greene et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lu et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Physicochemical properties are important parameters to predict diffusion processes through biological membranes and therefore also relevant for the prediction of chemical uptake.</s><s>In this context, our findings demonstrate the role of internal exposure for toxicity.</s><s>In order to include the absorption properties in our cluster information, it is relevant to implement physicochemical descriptors into the clustering process.</s></p><p><s>The clusters derived in this clustering approach have been analyzed from a toxicological point of view.</s><s>This evaluation showed in the 28 clusters with a structural similarity of 100%, that in 60% of these, there was a toxicological similarity of ≥75% (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>However, considering that the clustering procedure resulted in 119 clusters for which only 28 (14%) gave a consistent structural and toxicological similarity; there is room for improvement in the decision hierarchy.</s></p><p><s>Several factors increase the complexity in the relationship between structural and toxicological similarity, leading to the consequence that in only 60% of clusters with 100% structural similarity, there was also a similarity in the toxicological profile:</s></p><p><s>• First, as has been shown for example with the glycols, metabolism plays an important role for the toxicity.</s><s>However, reliable tools to predict metabolic pathways, which would give useful information, are not yet sufficiently developed to be fit for purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anger et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The importance and the difficulties in prediction of metabolism have also been shown for the hepatotoxicity of allyl esters <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Yamada et al., 2013b)</ref>.</s><s>• Secondly, as demonstrated by the example of the effects on the thyroid, there are several mechanisms, which may show the same effect.</s><s>Hence, several structural properties, each related to a separate mode of action or AOP may result in the same effect at the organ level (e.g., effects on the thyroid weight; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Yamada et al., 2013a)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>From our analysis we learned about the additional value of implementing the toxicity into the clustering procedure by the example of compounds with nitro moiety.</s><s>This example shows that a better partitioning in clusters can be reached if toxicity targets, potency, and mode of action have been implemented into the clustering procedure.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Categories Suitable for Read-Across</head><p><s>We have identified some clusters with a high degree of structural similarity (assessed as 100%) as also showing a high degree of toxicological similarity.</s><s>These clusters could be taken into consideration as new categories in a qualitative readacross (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The structural and toxicological similarities give a reasonable basis for further evaluation of the linking mode of action and the complete toxicological fingerprints taking into account the role of metabolism.</s><s>Furthermore, clusters in which the ratio between the geometric mean of LOEL and the lower end of the LOEL range do not exceed 5 could be used in a quantitative read-across approach (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>If the geometric mean of the cluster LOEL is taken to predict the LOEL of a chemical substance falling in one of the indicated clusters, the true LOEL might be higher or lower than the (geometric) mean.</s><s>From a regulatory point of view, it would only matter, if the true LOEL were lower than predicted.</s><s>The use of an additional uncertainty factor might be necessary to be on the safe side.</s><s>As a value of 5 was chosen as cut-off criterion for the ratio in selecting the clusters for a quantitative read across, using an additional factor of 5 would be sufficient to take into account this uncertainty.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In conclusion, a new method for clustering databases on chemical substances with accompanying toxicological information according to their chemical properties was introduced, by developing a decision tree that uses structural and toxicological information to calculate the similarity of the test compound.</s></p><p><s>The procedure is intended to support a read-across approach.</s></p><p><s>In analyzing the clustering results from the toxicological point of view, we did find out that in some of the clusters, the cluster members have common mechanisms of action and that the toxicological target and effects are similar.</s><s>In these cases, the clustering leads not only to structurally but also to toxicologically meaningful results.</s><s>We propose that these clusters are suited for a read-across.</s><s>These clusters encompass clusters of category 1 (100% structural similarity/100% toxicological similarity) and category 2 (100% structural similarity/≥75% toxicological similarity).</s><s>For others, the clustering resulted in disparate toxicity and/or chemical structures of the cluster members without a common mechanism of action.</s><s>Furthermore, some clusters were identified in which the ratio between the geometric mean of the cluster LOEL and the LOEL of the lower end of the range was small (≤5).</s><s>We propose that those clusters might be used for a quantitative read-across.</s><s>In risk assessment, the additional uncertainty of this approach can be taken into consideration by applying an additional uncertainty factor of 5.</s><s>This publication shows that structural analyses combined with effect analyses give the advantage of identifying mechanism related to structures and hence provide a tool for improving the prediction of relevant structures.</s><s>However, it is clear that further improvement is needed, e.g., by incorporating data on metabolism and bioavailability.</s><s>For further development it could also be envisaged to add additional toxicological data such as environmental concentrations or in-vitro data if available thus enabling comparison between LOELs and other data for special applications.</s><s>The insights provided by this project will help research in this field by eliciting the requirements for even more advanced tools.</s></p></div>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">In this paper we use the expression generic target organ to indicate that there is the target organ known (i.e., liver), however no specific effect (e.g., liver weight increase) was observed. The expression "specific target-organ effect" is used when a specific effect is described (e.g., liver necrosis). MOA means mode of action which indicates a description of the route by which the adverse effect is mediated, whereby however several intermediate steps are not known. The expression fingerprint is used to indicate a chemical or chemical group specific toxicological pattern with toxicological effects in several organs/tissues.</note>
