<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The human cortex is affected by several debilitating acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, which target specific types of cortical neurons.</s><s>Emerging evidence indicates that stem cells and reprogrammed cells can be used to generate human cortical neurons both for cell replacement by transplantation, and for disease modeling and drug screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Several laboratories have established in vitro protocols for the derivation of excitatory pyramidal neurons, the principal type of neuron in the adult cortex, from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Efficient production of corticofugal projection neurons (CfuPNs) from ES cells has also been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>While the temporal generation of neurons belonging to the different cortical layers is largely maintained in vitro, and the presence of neurons belonging to specific layers has been found, the proportion of cells characteristic of each layer varies considerably depending on the method used <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, most available protocols are time-consuming, inefficient and the generated neurons are often immature and with incomplete functional properties.</s><s>It also remains to be assessed how closely the ES cell-derived cortical neurons resemble their in vivo counterparts.</s></p><p><s>Transcription factor (TF) programming is a fast and efficient approach for generating different types of cells.</s><s>This methodology is based on the logic of direct conversion, using lineage-specific TFs to drive differentiation, but applying them to pluripotent stem cells rather than to somatic cells such as fibroblasts.</s><s>Transcription factor programming of human ES cells efficiently gives rise to functional excitatory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> and inhibitory neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s>These human ES cell-derived induced neurons (hES-iNs) exhibit neuronal morphology and gene expression profile, are able to produce action potentials and establish synaptic connections, and survive transplantation into neonatal mouse brain.</s><s>However, even though the excitatory hES-iNs possess a homogenous gene expression profile resembling that of excitatory forebrain neurons, it is unclear whether they represent a cell population with specific cortical layer and area identity.</s></p><p><s>Our long-term goal is to develop strategies for efficient production of functional human cortical PNs with specific layer identity using TF programming of ES cells.</s><s>For this purpose, we have, in this study, chosen to evaluate, in transcription factor programming experiments, the most prominent TFs involved in upper and deep layer PN specification during cortical development.</s><s>First, SATB2 which represses subcerebral features in callosal neurons, therefore driving upper layer cortical identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Second, FEZF2 which is a key regulator in deep-layer cortical neuron development <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>We tested SATB2 and FEZF2 in combination with NGN2, a key TF for excitatory cell derivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The properties of the hES-iNs derived by three different combinations of TFs, i.e., NGN2 only (N), NGN2 plus FEZF2 (NF), and NGN2 plus SATB2 (NS), were analyzed and compared with those of fetal and adult human cortical neurons.</s></p><p><s>We show here that all three TF combinations were able to drive human ES cells to a neuronal fate, exhibiting properties of functional excitatory cortical neurons, which morphologically resembled adult more closely than fetal human cortical neurons.</s><s>Using ex vivo transplantation to human organotypic cultures, we obtained evidence that these hES-iNs integrated into adult human cortical neural networks.</s><s>However, immunohistochemistry and patch-clamp electrophysiology showed only subtle differences between the TF combinations in the phenotype of the hES-iNs.</s><s>This finding was corroborated by single-cell analysis, which also revealed that individual hES-iNs expressed markers of both upper and deep cortical layers, similar to fetal human cortical neurons, but exhibited a more mature neuronal gene expression pattern compared to the fetal cortical cells.</s><s>Thus, we show that programming using three different TF Crafoord foundation.</s><s>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</s></p><p><s>combinations gives rise to similar progeny, i.e., cells with many properties characteristic of human cortical neurons but lacking the molecular signature signifying specific layer identity.</s></p></div>

comparison between the different hES-iNs, derived with the three combinations of TFs, did not reveal any striking differences in either morphology, marker expression, molecular signature or electrical activity.</s><s>Thus, our findings provided no evidence that the hES-iNs had acquired a distinct cortical layer phenotype depending on the TF combination used.</s><s>Instead, our single-cell data showed that the hES-iNs expressed both upper and deep layer cortical neuronal markers.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have indicated that the in vitro differentiation of human ES cells towards cortical

the strong intrinsic differentiation cues provided by overexpressing FEZF2 or SATB2 did not force the human ES cells expressing NGN2, which guides ES cells to an undefined excitatory neuronal phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, to become cortical neurons with specific layer identity.</s><s>Only subtle differences in gene expression pattern and marker expression were observed between the hES-iNs generated by the three TF combinations.</s><s>These findings were surprising since FEZF2 has been reported to be necessary and sufficient for cortical progenitors to generate deep-layer neurons and is specifically expressed in layer V neurons throughout life <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>.</s><s>FEZF2 has also been shown

accelerated temporal order, it is conceivable that the human ES cells need not only the correct molecular cues but also the precise timing of their expression in order to generate specific subtypes of cortical neurons.</s><s>Second, TF levels may have been suboptimal.</s><s>During development, Fezf2 is expressed at high levels by subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) and at lower levels by corticothalamic projection neurons (CThPN) and subplate neurons.</s><s>Also, TBR1 is mainly expressed postmitotically by CThPNs and subplate neurons but also at lower levels by CPNs in upper layers

signaling molecules and growth factors may also be necessary for subtype specification.</s><s>Even if part of cortical neurogenesis is controlled cell-autonomously through TF expression, a number of extracellular cues are also involved.</s><s>In particular, members of the classical morphogen families, i.e., retinoic acid, Wnts, bone morphogenic proteins/transforming growth factors, sonic hedgehog, and fibroblast growth factors are expressed throughout cortical development <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref>.</s><s>This raises the possibility that addition of a defined cocktail of morphogens would guide the human ES cells subjected to TF programming to acquire a specific neuronal subtype identity.</s><s>Our data from the single-cell analysis revealed that individual hES-iNs generated by all three TF combinations expressed canonical markers of both upper and deep cortical layers.</s><s>This finding was unexpected given the well-established roles of NGN2, SATB2 and FEZF2 during embryonic development, driving progenitor fate to distinct cortical layer phenotypes in vivo.</s><s>The complex upper/deep layer expression pattern of hES-iNs was not influenced by the used TF combination.</s><s>With the accelerated functional maturation of hES-iNs, one may speculate whether the generated cells followed a normal temporal differentiation order with regard to their identity choice, or some steps of differentiation were not occurring at all, causing cellular fate 'confusion'.</s><s>The hES-iNs shared many features of their molecular signature with hFCtx F .</s><s>However, neural progenitor markers were not expressed in hES-iNs, suggesting that they had advanced further into maturation compared to hFCtx F cells.</s><s>Importantly, we found that also single hFCtx F cells

fate "confusion."</s><s>In fact, recent data <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref> indicate that mouse neural precursors are transcriptionally primed to make diverse cortical neuron subtypes with post-transcriptional mechanisms selecting when and where neuronal specification mRNAs are translated.</s><s>For mouse cells, this transcriptional flexibility can persist even after neurogenesis is complete and neurons are committed to a single identity at the protein level <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In analogy with the findings of Zahr and co-workers, our single-cell data

including testing of a broader range of TFs, have to be met in order to reach our long-term objective to generate pure populations of hES-iNs with specific cortical layer identity.</s><s>We also conclude that analysis of multiple markers in single cells will be necessary to convincingly demonstrate the generation of bona fide subtypes of cortical neurons.</s><s>It is likely that even if a correct combination of TFs is chosen, and they are expressed with precise timing and at optimum doses, also other molecules may have to be present in order to achieve this goal.</s></p></div>
