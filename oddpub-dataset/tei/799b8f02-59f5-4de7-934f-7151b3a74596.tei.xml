with abnormal ECG findings (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>According to the haematocrit, low hydration-potentially impacting on cardiac preload-was not linked to abnormal ECG findings.</s><s>However, analysing athletes with ST-T-segment deviations, AF or ventricular arrhythmias, the underlying mechanisms of these pathological conditions may differ and the results of the multivariate analysis do not apply to a single condition.</s><s>Despite the fact that increased levels of physical activity were associated with a lower relative risk of myocardial infarction, 4% of patients with myocardial infarction report having performed strenuous exercise within hours before the cardiovascular event. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>By using different cut-offs, transient elevations in the level of troponin T or troponin I have previously been reported in 18%-69% of marathon runners. <ref type="bibr">10-12 29</ref></s><s>In the Berlin Beat of Running cohort, hsTnT was elevated in 18 (17%) out of 107 athletes but normalised within 48 hours in 17 (94%) athletes.</s><s>Interestingly, elevation of hsTnT was not related to age, sex, training status, the cardiovascular risk profile or the presence of cardiac arrhythmias during the race, but was related to exercise-induced ST-T-segment deviation (p&lt;0.0001) and inversely correlated with the haematocrit (measured immediately after the race).</s></p><p><s>Cardiac MRI is now the gold standard for detecting myocardial damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> and myocardial oedema as well as decreased ventricular function after a marathon race. <ref type="bibr">31 32</ref></s><s>e were not able to demonstrate late gadolinium enhancement as an indicator of permanent myocardial fibrosis Taken together, vigorous exercise can go along with transient troponin elevation, ST-T-segment alterations or nsVT in a fit and active population.</s><s>However, athletes with ST-T-segment deviation or nsVT during the race did not report a cardiovascular event within 1 year afterwards.</s><s>Thus, these findings are likely to be benign, but it was still recommended to rule out structural heart disease or obstructive coronary artery disease in these athletes.</s><s>Our results strengthen the assumption that hsTnT elevation originates from the heart and not primarily from non-cardiac sources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>However, we are unable to draw final conclusions.</s><s>Whether borderline cardiac damage by repetitive strenuous exercise could lead to permanent (potentially arrhythmogenic) cardiac remodelling is under debate. <ref type="bibr">6 33</ref></s><s>ocusing primarily on the feasibility of portable ECG monitoring and detection of ECG changes during the race, major limitations of the observational 'Berlin Beat of Running' study are the missing (serial) echocardiography or cardiac stress MRI, thus limiting the clinical significance of the observed ST-T-segment changes and elevated hsTnT levels.</s><s>Furthermore, a normal cardiac MRI within days after the race does not completely rule out (transient) exercise-induced cardiac damage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>Since only one-fourth of all athletes were women and because of a potential selection bias during enrolment, the generalisability of our results is limited.</s><s>Moreover, due to the limited number of endpoints observed, we believe that the results of the multivariate analysis should be interpreted with caution.</s><s>Combining nsVT and ST-T-segment deviations for statistical analysis may have introduced an information bias.</s><s>Unfortunately, it was impossible to assess the mean duration of ST-T-segment deviation in more detail, as ST-T-segment changes were present intermittently.</s><s>Finally, exercise capacity testing would have allowed more accurate evaluation of training status.</s></p></div>
