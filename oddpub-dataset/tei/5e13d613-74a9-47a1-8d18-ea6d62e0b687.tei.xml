<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associations Between the Quantity of TILs and Clinicopathological Factors</head><p><s>In the overall cohort, the median (IQR) for presence of stromal TILs was 12.5% (5.0%-30.0%).</s><s>Hormone receptor-negative (12.5% [3.0%-35.0%])</s><s>compared with HR-positive tumors (10.0%</s><s>[5.0%-22.5%])</s><s>had significantly higher median (IQR) levels of TILs at diagnosis (P = .02)</s><s>(eFigure 1 in the Supplement).</s><s>There was no significant difference between levels of TILs according to PIK3CA genotype (P = .17),</s><s>age (P = .92),</s><s>more involved lymph nodes (P = .26),</s><s>tumor size (P = .74),</s><s>or if the patient was a candidate for planned breast conservation surgery (P = .97).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associations Between the Quantity of TILs and Rates of pCR</head><p><s>In this analysis, we found that the relationship between pCR and presence of TILs was nonlinear (eFigure 2A in the Supplement).</s></p><p><s>Rates of pCR increased sharply when levels of stromal TILs were greater than 5%, regardless of treatment group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.60 (95% CI, 1.26-5.39;</s><s>P = .01)</s><s>(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>There was no significant interaction between presence of TILs and the combination group of trastuzumab and lapatinib vs trastuzumab alone in predicting pCR (P = .51).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associations Between the Quantity of TILs and EFS</head><p><s>We then assessed the association between the levels of TILs and EFS after a median (IQR) follow-up of 3.77 (3.50-4.22)</s><s>years.</s><s>Here the relationship between presence of TILs and EFS was found to be linear, similar to our previously published data in the adjuvant setting (eFigure 2B in the Supplement).</s><s>When the clinicopathological prognostic variables were entered as potential regression candidates, only stromal TILs percentage and planned conservative surgery were significant predictors of EFS in the multivariate model in analyses using both baseline characteristics and the landmark analysis that included pCR (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and eTable in the Supplement).</s><s>Every 1% increase in TILs was associated with a 3% decrease in the rate of an event (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95-0.99];</s><s>P = .002)-in</s><s>other words, the higher the level of TILs present in the primary tumor at diagnosis, the better the EFS after use of trastuzumab, lapatinib, or the combination.</s><s>This effect is also shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref> and 2B using the median TIL value and a high TIL value, which was associated with a 3-year EFS of approximately more than 90%.</s><s>Of interest, patients who had higher TIL levels (greater than the median) and did not achieve pCR had EFS similar to those who did achieve pCR (Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</s><s>Patients with a baseline TIL level of at least 40% had excellent 3-year EFS (97% [95% CI, 88%-99%]) regardless of pCR outcome (of those patients with ≥40% TILs, only 21 of 60 [35%] achieved a pCR) (Figure <ref type="figure">2D</ref>).</s><s>Patients who did not achieve pCR and had low levels of TILs had the poorest survival (Figure <ref type="figure">2C and 2D</ref>).</s><s>There was no significant interaction between presence of TILs and the combination group of trastuzumab and lapatinib vs trastuzumab alone and EFS (P = .38</s><s>for the full population and P = .38</s><s>for the landmark population).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this prospectively planned analysis of a neoadjuvant clinical trial of HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, we have shown

standard anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy.</s></p><p><s>These results add to our previous data in trastuzumabtreated patients with survival information, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> and hence we believe that this analysis firmly establishes the stromal TILs vari- able as a positive prognostic marker in primary HER2-positive breast cancer treated with anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy and provides new prognostic data regarding TILs in the neoadjuvant setting with pCR and the more robust EFS end point.</s><s>Given the data regarding TILs and better outcomes in primary triple-negative breast cancer, we cannot exclude the possibility that the prognostic effect of TILs could predominantly be the result of the chemotherapy.</s><s>Notably here, the TILs effect was found to be nonlinearly associated with pCR but was linear for EFS.</s><s>We hypothesize that the anthracycline given after surgery (fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) could explain the further improvement in clinical outcomes in the presence of higher TIL levels (eFigure 2 in the Supplement), supporting the importance of anthracycline therapy for HER2-positive disease and similar to results from the BIG 2-98 trial analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> as well as preclinical data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14</ref></s><s>n this study, information on TIL levels and pCR provided independent prognostic information: we noted that patients with high levels of TILs at baseline had better outcomes independent of whether they achieved pCR in the neoadjuvant phase.</s><s>Hence, as we move forward into an era of dual anti-HER2 therapy, it is possible that we can identify a subgroup of patients defined by their TIL level at diagnosis who may not require more than the current adjuvant standard of trastuzumab and chemotherapy.</s><s>Although previously we had arbitrarily chosen a TIL level cutoff of 50% to 60% to describe the category of "lymphocyte-predominant breast cancers," 1,3 this value had not been derived from a data set of contemporary HER2-positive early breast cancers treated with standard anti-HER2 therapy and also included intratumoral TIL evaluations, which we have since found to have lower interobserver reproducibility. 11</s><s>Whereas we did not observe any treatment interaction with TIL levels as originally hypothesized, analysis using the adjuvant trial samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref> will better answer this question because it is likely that we lacked statistical power to reveal an interaction in this data set.</s></p><p><s>At present, we do not understand why patients either do or do not have TILs present in their tumors at diagnosis.</s><s>Exome and RNA sequencing of the NeoALTTO samples is ongoing and may shed light on this issue because mutant peptides have been hypothesized to initiate a T-cell response. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref></s><s>Tumor PIK3CA genotype has been associated with poorer outcomes in HER2-positive disease, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> but here we did not observe any significant difference in levels of TILs between patients with mutant and wild-type PIK3CA.</s><s>We have previously shown a correlation between levels of TILs and mRNA levels of genes representing T-cell activation and suppression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref></s><s>Because levels of T-cell checkpoint markers at the mRNA level are highly correlated with levels of TILs, T-cell checkpoint inhibition could be effective in combination with anti-HER2 therapy, particularly in patients with lower levels of TILs (ie, 5%-40%).</s><s>This concept remains to be tested in future clinical trials.</s><s>This study's findings are strengthened by the use of a large phase III neoadjuvant clinical trial evaluating anti-HER2 treatments with both pCR and EFS end points and the fact that recent international guidelines were followed for evaluation of TILs. 11</s><s>However, we acknowledge that pCR is not a validated surrogate end point for improvement in EFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18</ref> and that the num-  ber of events for the survival end point (EFS) is low.</s><s>Efforts are currently ongoing in an attempt to improve the reproducibility and consistency of TIL measurement among pathologists globally.</s><s>Another limitation of our findings is that because the lapatinib with trastuzumab combination was not statistically superior to the control group in the adjuvant study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref> it is unlikely that this combination will be used in the future.</s><s>Studies of the prognostic effect of TIL levels in clinical trials evaluating other dual anti-HER2 strategies are planned.</s><s>At this stage, data suggest that the "TILs effect" will be similar with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and chemotherapy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19</ref> although this remains to be definitively shown in the adjuvant setting.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Finally, in conclusion we propose the concept that a group of patients with "high" TIL levels can have an excellent outcome with the current standard of trastuzumab therapy alone with chemotherapy, although we acknowledge the difficulty of proposing such cutoffs for clinical implementation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20</ref></s><s>If a TIL cutoff can be identified and robustly validated using the large adjuvant HER2-positive data sets, future clinical trials of anti-HER2 therapy may be better placed to test the efficacy of new therapies in the poor prognostic group.</s><s>A, Three-year EFS was 88% (95% CI, 82%-92%) for patients whose tumors contained at least 12.5% TILs (the median level of TILs) and 71% (95% CI, 64%-78%) for patients with less than 12.5% TILs (log-rank P &lt; .001).</s><s>B, Three-year EFS was 97% (95% CI, 88%-99%) for patients whose tumors contained more than 40% TILs and 77% (95% CI, 72%-83%) for those with less than 40% TILs (log-rank P &lt; .001).</s><s>C, Three-year EFS was 67% (95% CI, 57%-74%) for patients with no pCR and less than 12.5% TILs; 85% (95% CI, 77%-90%) for patients with no pCR and at least 12.5% TILs; 81% (95% CI, 67%-90%) for patients with pCR and less than 12.5% TILs; and 92% (95% CI, 83%-97%) for patients with pCR and at least 12.5% TILs.</s><s>D, Three-year EFS was 72% (95% CI, 65%-77%) for patients with no pCR and less than 40% TILs; 95% (95% CI, 80%-99%) for patients with no pCR and more than 40% TILs; 85% (95% CI, 76%-91%) for patients with pCR and less than 40% TILs; and 100% for patients with pCR and more than 40% TILs.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Rates of Pathological Complete Response According to Levels of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes Binned by Quartile to Illustrate the Nonlinear Effect</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
