<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the current study, we have demonstrated that symptomatic patients with a variable number of cardiovascular risk factors and absence of coronary artery stenosis display significant differences in endocardial -epicardial distribution of myocardial perfusion and perfusion reserve.</s><s>Low MPR in both endocardial, mid-, and subendocardial layers was observed specifically in obese patients.</s><s>The endocardial -epicardial distribution of increasing MPR in the endoto epi-direction observed in these patients appears to correlate with similar perfusion patterns reported in animal models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>ur results appear to be in concordance with previous studies that have reported an association between obesity and impaired endothelial dysfunction in both peripheral and coronary circulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>In contrast to previous studies, we found that reduced MPR as assessed by CT in obese patients was the result of an increase in AD rest values rather than reduced vasodilator response to adenosine.</s><s>The explanation for this difference compared with previous studies remains unknown, but could be related to differences of patient selection and/or methodology used.</s><s>It is noteworthy that differences of resting perfusion between normal and obese in our study were unrelated to age and gender in the groups that could suggest that increased body weight was the determining factor for our finding.</s></p><p><s>We found the effect of BMI on MPR was only observed in patients with chest pain symptoms and not in patients without.</s><s>However as the subgroup of patients without chest pain symptoms was small, this finding could be due to low statistical power.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have shown that women have a higher coronary bloodflow at rest compared with men, which is confirmed in our study. <ref type="bibr">17 -19</ref></s><s>Chareonthaitawee et al. found that this resulted in an overall lower MPR in women.</s><s>However, in accordance with other studies we did not find a significant difference in MPR between women and men. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr"

and hypertension to have significant impact on MPR as this has previously been reported in studies using  Myocardial perfusion reserve with CT positron emission tomography (PET) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, but did only find a trend. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>This could be explained by a lower sensitivity of the static CT perfusion method compared with dynamic

moreover that adenosine MPR increases in the endocardial to epicardial direction.</s><s>Cardiac contraction impedes myocardial blood flow.</s><s>During systole, the myocardial compressive force increases from intrathoracic pressure at the epicardial surface to equal or to exceed intraventricular pressure at the endocardial surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>The limited systolic flow is directed towards the epicardium and blood in the deepest subendocardial layers is squeezed retrograde into more superficial subepicardial arterial vessels.</s><s>these mechanical effects that increase impedance to blood flow in the deeper myocardial layers, it is a consistent finding across more than 20 animal studies using microsphere derived blood flow that there is a net transmural gradient of blood favouring the subendocardium, which reflect oxygen requirements of the subendocardium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>This requires an augmentation of subendocardial blood flow during diastole in proportion to the degree of systolic underperfusion.</s><s>This diastolic gradient of blood flow favouring the subendocardium is dependent on a transmural gradient of vasomotor tone, with vascular resistance during diastole being lowest in the subendocardium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Relative myocardial perfusion as assessed with CT is a measure of diastolic flow distribution and especially in this phase of the cardiac cycle (and during rest) the gradient of vasomotor tone appears to be a major determinant of the preferential subendocardial blood flow supply. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>he uncoupling of regional energetic demands and myocardial flow by pharmacological vasodilation with adenosine-that acts by relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells of resistance vessels-appears to result in a partly offsetting of the transmural differences of vasomotor tone resulting in a higher epicardial flow reserve.</s><s>In concordance with a previous magnetic resonance imaging study, our observations confirm that in symptomatic patients-without obstructive CAD-there is a significant adenosine-induced increase in both subendocardial and subepicardial perfusion and moreover that subepicardial MPR is higher than subendocardial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>Thus, we found no evidence

type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>Our study suggests that the higher septal MPR is due to higher resting flow in the septum.</s><s>This was most pronounced in the septal subepicardium that
