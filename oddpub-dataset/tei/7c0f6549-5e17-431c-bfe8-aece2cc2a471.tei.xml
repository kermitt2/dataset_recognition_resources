<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glycerol Induced the Upregulation of FABP4 Expression in Kidney of AKI</head><p><s>Male C57BL/6 mice were injected by glycerol to create a model of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI as indicated, and FABP4 protein and mRNA expression was examined.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, glycerol increased the expression of FABP4 protein.</s><s>Similarly, the levels of FABP4 mRNA in kidney tissue were markedly increased after glycerol injection.</s><s>The localization of FABP4 in kidney was confirmed by double immunofluorescence labeling of E-cadherin (green, a biomarker of tubular epithelial cell) and FABP4 (red).</s><s>Compared with control, increased positive expression of FABP4 was observed in tubular epithelial cells in glycerol-induced AKI group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s></p></div>

target="#b13">(Furuhashi et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Erbay et al., 2009)</ref>, however, the effect of FABP4 in rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI has not been determined.</s><s>In the present study, we reported pharmacological effect of FABP4 in a murine kidney disease model of glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis.</s><s>Selective inhibition of FABP4 by BMS309403 pretreatment at a dose of 30 mg/kg/d for four consecutive days remarkably reduced serum creatinine, proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 as well as attenuated tubular damage in glycerol-injured kidneys.</s><s>Oral administration of BMS309403 attenuated renal ER stress in AKI as evidenced by transmission electron microscope analysis and the related protein expression of GRP78, CHOP, p-PERK, and ATF4.</s><s>Furthermore, BMS309403 in vitro dose-dependently improved myoglobin-induced ER stress and inflammation in renal proximal tubular HK-2 cells.</s></p><p><s>Rhabdomyolysis is a serious syndrome caused by skeletal muscle injury and subsequent release of breakdown products from damaged muscle cells into systemic circulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bosch et al.,

Lye, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Although considerable evidences continuously focused on the mechanisms and therapeutic strategy of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI, the details remained limited.</s><s>In the study, a well-established animal model of rhabdomyolysis was induced by intramuscular injection of glycerol and further used for the exploration of kidney injury.</s><s>Although there are several important makers including KIM-1 and NGAL for evaluating renal tubular injuries, sCr and BUN are still the most widely used indices for AKI.</s><s>Thus, we measured levels of sCr and BUN in animal model of rhabdomyolysis in our study.</s><s>For the first time, we demonstrated that the mice following glycerol injection developed severe AKI as indicated by acute renal dysfunction and histologic changes, companied by the increased FABP4 expression.</s><s>Previous study has reported that FABP4 was detected in some tubular cells in patients with stage IV lupus nephritis, not in normal kidneys, suggested that the increase of FABP4 in renal tubular cells might be related with renal dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Tanaka et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In our study, FABP4 was also highly expressed in the cytoplasm of tubular epithelial cells in mice following glycerol injection by double-immunohistochemical staining; consistent with that the increased expression of FABP4 was in vitro induced by myoglobin in renal proximal tubular HK-2 cells.</s></p><p><s>Genetic deletion or chemical inhibition with selective smallmolecule inhibitor have been confirmed to have powerful therapeutic for type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Furuhashi and Hotamisligil, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Our previous data indicated that suppression of FABP4 activity by a highly selective inhibitor BMS309403 could ameliorate renal structural damage, improve renal function and reduce ER stress of tubular cells in mice of ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Shi et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>However, the potential of FABP4 as drug target for the treatment of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI was still unknown.</s><s>In the present study, we further investigated and found that pretreatment with BMS309403 effectively reduced serum creatinine and attenuated renal tubular damage in the glycerol-injured kidneys, indicated that pharmacological inhibition of FABP4 improved the kidney dysfunctions in response to rhabdomyolysis.</s><s>Interestingly, the FABP4 inhibitor BMS309403 protected against kidney injuries without affecting the level of

including mutant protein aggregation, hypoxia, energy deprivation, and metabolic dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Xu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fan et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Declined proteinfolding capacity in ER led to an abundance of misfolded proteins, initiating ER stress.</s><s>Overwhelming ER stress induced inflammatory response by typical signal pathways, PERK-ATF4, IRE1, and ATF6 pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chaudhari et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>When the ER was overloaded and caused the accumulation of unfolded proteins, GRP78 bonded to the unfolded proteins in the ER, freeing its client proteins PERK, ATF6, and IRE1, which then served as the primary mediators of UPR signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Inagi, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>During UPR, PERK was released from its chaperone protein GRP78, leading to the activation of ATF4 and CHOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gardner and Walter, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The elicitation of UPR in turn activated NF-kB pro-inflammatory signaling pathway to regulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Tam et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Considerable evidence suggested a link between FABP4 and ER stress in disease models including diabetes, atherosclerosis and kidney disease, etc., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hotamisligil and Bernlohr, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In our study, we found that along with the high expression of FABP4, the protein levels of ATF4, GRP78, CHOP, in glycerol-injured kidneys of mice and myoglobin-treated HK-2 cells were increased, whereas FABP4 inhibitor BMS309403 decreased the levels of corresponding proteins.</s><s>No significant changes in expression of IRE1 and ATF6 proteins were found by western blot analysis in our study (data not showed), thus we believe the expression of IRE1 and ATF6 was not mandatory in this study.</s><s>Taken together, these data indicated that protective effects of BMS309403 against rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI were mediated, at least partially, by the inhibition of renal ER stress.</s></p><p><s>Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are crucial mediators in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jang and Rabb, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6,

study, the results exhibited that inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly elevated in the kidneys of glycerolinduced mice.</s><s>Inhibition of FABP4 considerably reduced the production of these inflammatory cytokines, although there was no statistical significance between BMS309403-treated and glycerol group.</s><s>Our previous results have shown that chemical inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway possessed renal protective effects on rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI by regulating proinflammatory cytokines production <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Huang et al., 2017)</ref>, while FABP4 inhibitor BMS309403 dose-dependently improved myoglobin-induced expression of TLR4, NF-κB p65, and p-IκB proteins in renal proximal tubular HK-2 cells, consistent with our previous data.</s><s>Macrophage infiltration into kidney tissues was responsible for the pathogenesis of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Belliere et al., 2015)</ref> and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Sinniah and Lye, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>MCP-1 is one of the key chemokines that regulate migration and infiltration of monocytes/macrophages to influence immune inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Munshi et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the elevation of MCP-1 in renal tissue of BMS309403-treated mice might be favorable to macrophage migration to exert anti-inflammatory effects during acute phase.</s><s>Anyway, further detailed studies are needed to determine whether macrophage FABP4 expression was involved in rhabdomyolysis related kidney injury.</s><s>These results indicated inhibition of FABP4 affected glycerol-induced kidney injury through regulating inflammatory cytokines production.</s></p><p><s>ER stress and inflammatory responses are integrated at several levels and modulate each other: inflammation could compromise ER function, and ER stress could promote inflammation <ref type="bibr"

inflammatory pathways and ER stress are of great interest in kidney diseases and understanding the intricate links and identification of drug target FABP4 are crucial for developing effective therapeutics against renal disease cluster.</s><s>However, the intrinsic link between ER stress and inflammatory response should be studied further.</s><s>In summary, our findings demonstrated that rhabdomyolysis resulted in the increase of FABP4 in tubular epithelial cells and pharmacological inhibition of FABP4 activity by BMS309403 protected against rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI via the regulation of ER stress and inflammation in tubular epithelial cells.</s><s>Therefore, our data indicated that FABP4 might be a promising target for the treatment of AKI and further investigation of
