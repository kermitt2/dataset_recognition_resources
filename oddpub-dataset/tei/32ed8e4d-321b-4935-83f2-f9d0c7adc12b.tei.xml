<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mutation identification</head><p><s>Because the clinical presentation was compatible with du Pan dysplasia we first sequenced the coding region and exon-intron boundaries of GDF5 and identified no mutation.</s><s>Upon sequencing of BMPR1B we detected a homozygous c.91C&gt;T (p.Arg31Cys) variant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>No DNA from other affected and unaffected family members was available to test for co-segregation with du Pan dysplasia.</s><s>Consistent with BMPR1B being located in an autozygous region, genotyping of two highly polymorphic BMPR1B intragenic STRs showed homozygosity and SNP array genotyping confirmed a large (20.2</s><s>Mb) homozygous region at the BMPR1B locus in the proposita, defined by the flanking SNPs rs2131361 and rs17278473 (data not shown).</s><s>Residue Arg31 is moderately conserved in BMPR1B orthologs.</s><s>It is conserved e.g., in mouse, rat, cat, dog, and platypus; it is replaced with a histidine in e.g., green monkey, panda and hedgehog, and with a glutamine in e.g., opossum and turtles.</s><s>None of the &gt;60 species included in the UCSC multiple species alignment has a cysteine at the corresponding position.</s><s>While the ExAC browser (http://exac.broadinsti</s><s>tute.org/)</s><s>lists a p.Arg31His substitution (rs200035802) with an allele frequency of 18/121.162,</s><s>p.Arg31Cys was only identified in 1/121.150</s><s>alleles, compatible with p.Arg31Cys being disease causing.</s><s>Consistently, PolyPhen-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> predicts p.Arg31Cys as "possibly damaging" and p.Arg31His as "benign" (both variants are predicted "not tolerated" by SIFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>).</s><s>Finally, no variant predicting p.Arg31Cys was identified in exome sequences from 30 Moroccan patients with unrelated disorders (Jaber Lyahyai, personal communication) and no p.Arg31Cys homozygotes or heterozygotes were present in the 5,718 exomes included in the Institut Imagine (Paris) in-house database, which is enriched for exomes of Maghrebian individuals, and contains a very conservatively estimated number of Moroccan exomes of 33.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural modeling of the BMPR1B mutation p.Arg31Cys</head><p><s>Arg31 is located at the beginning of the BMPR1B ligand binding domain (LBD), suggesting that the p.Arg31Cys mutation may interfere with GDF5 binding.</s><s>We modeled p.Arg31Cys using the structure of human BMPR1B bound to human GDF5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Residue 31 shares no direct contact with the ligand GDF5 and is more than 10 Å remote (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Thus, a direct impact on the GDF5-receptor binding by loss of direct van der Waals interactions seems unlikely.</s><s>In our in silico models the exchange of Arg31 by cysteine however places an unpaired thiol group in close proximity to Cys32, Cys47, Cys53, and Cys71 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) thereby possibly allowing for an alternate disulfide network.</s><s>The model of such a rearranged disulfide bond network suggested that it will not necessarily destroy the BMP receptor's three-finger toxin fold, but may introduce conformational changes in the disulfide-bond connected loops in particular of the β1β2-loop (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>As this loop is engaged in contacts with GDF5 and has been implicated in ligand recognition and binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> even such smaller changes may affect ligand-receptor interaction.</s><s>The effects of p.Arg31His seem subtler as those predicted for p.Arg31Cys (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We have identified the homozygous BMPR1B missense mutation p.Arg31Cys in a patient with ACD du Pan type.</s><s>Previously, GDF5 mutations have been shown to constitute the major cause of ACD Grebe and du Pan types <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and BMPR1B mutations had been identified in single families with Grebe syndrome and a Grebe dysplasia-like phenotype with genital anomalies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>However, whether BMPR1B mutations, presumably mutations with milder functional effects, can also cause du Pan dysplasia was unknown.</s><s>The following evidence supports a diagnosis of du Pan dysplasia in the proposita rather than another ACD or ACD-like skeletal dysplasia: normal appearing radius, ulna and femur including the corresponding joints; mal-shaped but present phalangeal bones of the hands; normal length of the second metacarpal; and milder involvement of the tarsals, metatarsals, and phalangeal bones of the toes.</s><s>In Grebe and Hunter-Thompson ACD the clinical and radiological manifestations are more severe: the humerus, radius and ulna are short and bowed, the hand bones are more deformed or missing and the elbow and knee joints are affected.</s><s>Thus,   <ref type="figure">3</ref> The Arg31Cys substitution in BMPR1B causes a moderate loss of function.</s><s>a NIH/3 T3 cells were co-transfected with the empty vector pCS2+ or the indicated HA-tagged variants of Bmpr1b with the luciferase constructs BRE-pLG3ti and pRL-TK and stimulated with 2 nM of human recombinant GDF5.</s><s>BMPR1B WT strongly induced luciferase activity.</s><s>The variant BMPR1B Arg31Cys showed nearly no activity without ligand stimulation.</s><s>It was activated after GDF5 treatment but could not accomplish the level of BMPR1B WT.</s><s>Arg31His induced signaling, but considerably lower compared to BMPR1B WT.</s><s>BMPR1B Cys53Arg did not activate SMAD signaling at all.</s><s>Data were tested for normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnoff normality test) and analyzed using a One-Way-ANOVA with subsequent Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison Test (n = 8; ns not significant, *** p &lt; 0.001).</s><s>b NIH/3 T3 cells were transfected with the indicated HA-tagged Bmpr1b variants.</s><s>Using an anti-HA antibody the expression of BMPR1B could by visualized via confocal microscopy.</s><s>DAPI was used for staining of cell nuclei.</s><s>All BMPR1B variants were translocated to the cell membrane our results show that both Grebe and du Pan dysplasia can be caused by BMPR1B mutations in rare cases.</s><s>While the number of affected individuals with ACD due to BMPR1B mutations is small, our previous <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and present results indicate a possible genotype-phenotype correlation according to which BMPR1B mutations with a strong functional effect would cause Grebe syndrome, while milder mutations would result in the clinically and radiologically milder du Pan dysplasia.</s></p><p><s>Indeed, when the Arg31Cys mutation or the Arg31His variant are compared with other BMPR1B mutations, e.g., the Cys53Arg exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the assumed impact of a missense substitution at position 31 on structure and BMP binding seems rather moderate.</s><s>The substitution of Cys53 not only disrupts the structure-stabilizing disulfide bond network, but also likely causes local unfolding in the center of the BMPR1B ligand-binding domain due to strong van der Waals overlaps from introducing a bulky, charged arginine side chain into the tightly packed hydrophobic core around Cys53.</s><s>In contrast, the side chain of Arg31 faces the protein surface being surrounded by bulk solvent.</s><s>Thus, exchanges against most other amino acid types will likely not alter the structure of the BMPR1B ligand-binding domain.</s><s>Furthermore the residue at position 31 does not contact GDF5, thus only amino acid substitutions that (indirectly) cause a conformational rearrangement of ligand-binding loops can affect BMP binding.</s></p><p><s>A luciferase reporter gene assay indeed revealed that both BMPR1B variants, Arg31Cys and Arg31His, can still be stimulated by GDF5 but signal with diminished biological activity compared to BMPR1B WT.</s><s>This suggests that the exchanges at position Arg31 have for that matter only moderate functional effect and do not completely prevent ligand binding, as it is the case for Cys53Arg.</s></p></div>
