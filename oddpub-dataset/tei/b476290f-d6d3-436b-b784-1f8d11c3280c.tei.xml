and cost in both the United States and world-wide <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Despite new therapies and advanced diagnostic modalities, much remains to be done to mitigate the consequences of this disease.</s><s>CVD is a complex, multifactorial disease; its development and progression is driven by the interplay of genetics, environment, and diet.</s><s>Furthermore, the transition from stable, atherosclerotic disease to a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE, e.g.</s><s>unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke) is poorly understood though it is likely to be driven, in part, by platelet mediated thrombosis of the coronary or cerebral vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The biologic pathways and genes that underlie susceptibility to cardiovascular events are only beginning to be described.</s><s>Genome wide association studies are unraveling the genetic architecture of such events <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> but are limited in the consideration of environmental effects.</s></p><p><s>An alternative approach to understanding MACE biology has been to study biologic responses to known environmental stimuli that are associated with CVD.</s><s>Genomic technologies that interrogate genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites at the genome-wide level hold the promise of identifying novel disease genes and pathways as they are dynamic and thus integrate the effects of the genome and environmental triggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Such an approach may help to elucidate the biologic pathways perturbed by environmental exposures known to affect CVD, and thus help reduce the complexity of diseases such as CVD.</s><s>A variety of these types of studies have been performed to date using dietary <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, pharmacologic <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, psychological <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and environmental stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and have identified genes, pathways, and potential biomarkers for CVD.</s><s>Measuring the levels of genomic markers that reflect specific environmental exposures within an individual may provide a molecular "snapshot" of their CVD risk.</s></p><p><s>Cigarette smoking has long been identified as a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and MI <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Smoking promotes a pro-atherogenic state through vasomotor dysfunction, increased inflammation, and the generation of a higher-risk lipid profile through increased amounts of oxidized LDL <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, smoking produces a pro-thrombotic state driven by increased platelet dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and other hypercoagulable effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Heightened platelet reactivity, independent of smoking, is also a risk marker for platelet-mediated thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>Aspirin is a potent inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), leading to decreased production of thromboxane B2 which in turn inhibits platelet function <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Although a major pathway for aspirin's effect on platelet aggregation, there are likely effects of aspirin beyond COX-1 on platelet function, though there is limited understanding of these additional effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Smoking is also known to influence the inhibitory effects of aspirin on platelet function, with smokers exhibiting higher residual platelet reactivity compared to nonsmokers on aspirin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>While aspirin use and smoking status are easy to obtain from patients, capturing their biologic effects on thrombotic risk is challenging in the clinical setting due the technical challenges associated with platelet function testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In prior work we discovered and validated peripheral blood gene expression signatures for cigarette smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, two specific environmental exposures known to affect platelet aggregation, CVD, and risk for MACE.</s><s>Briefly, the aspirin response signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is a set of 62 predominantly platelet derived genes, identified in peripheral blood that is correlated with aspirin's inhibitory effects on platelet function and MACE events, and is likely regulated by a transcriptional mechanism in megakaryocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>ITGA2B is a prominent member of the aspirin response signature and can be used as a surrogate for the remaining genes in this signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>We have also previously described the development and validation of a 5 gene peripheral blood smoking gene expression score (sGES) that can classify smoking status in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Given the potential molecular interactions between smoking, aspirin, and platelet reactivity, we investigated the use of these gene expression signatures as predictors of MACE risk in a population of patients referred for elective, invasive coronary angiography <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The transition from stable, asymptomatic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to unstable disease is poorly understood and is in part a platelet-mediated thrombotic event of a coronary or cerebral artery leading to myocardial infarction or stroke, respectively.</s><s>Although the degree of atherosclerotic stenosis in a given vessel is wellknown to correlate with future risk of MACE, plaque composition and so called "vulnerable plaque" also plays a central role <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, the concept of "vulnerable blood", a condition in which elevated prothrombotic potential exists in an individual, has been posited for many years.</s><s>A number of factors contribute to this increased potential, including age, sex, diabetes, race, renal function, and smoking.</s><s>Conversely, the use of therapeutics such as aspirin and platelet P2Y12 inhibitors has become standard of care in treating platelet hyperactivity associated with acute coronary syndromes and subsequent MACE.</s><s>However, the biologic pathways affected by aspirin and smoking are not well described nor is the extent to which they are related to MACE.</s><s>Using a large, multi-center clinical trial population of patients referred for elective coronary angiography (PREDICT) with wellcharacterized outcomes, we tested the hypothesis that pro-and anti-thrombotic gene expression signatures are associated with MACE.</s><s>We found that both smoking and aspirin response signatures were associated with MACE, independent of each other and with traditional risk factors.</s></p><p><s>Cigarette smoking is a well-recognized risk factor for cardiovascular events and has been associated with heightened platelet aggregation and venous and arterial thrombosis for over fifty years <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>We and others have previously demonstrated a strong association between peripheral blood gene expression and cigarette smoking.</s><s>Utilizing gene expression profile data from over 1000 subjects, we constructed a 5 gene smoking expression score (sGES) predictive of self-reported smoking status, which we previously validated in 180 independent subjects with an AUC of 0.82 (sensitivity = 0.63; specificity = 0.94 utilizing a 50% probability of smoking as a cutoff ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>In this study we further validated the sGES in an independent group of PREDICT trial patients not studied previously and demonstrated a similar ability to identify smokers as in the derivation studies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>PREDICT patients were relatively low risk with only 3.5% developing MACE during the 12 month follow up period and 37% with obstructive CAD by coronary angiography at baseline.</s><s>Despite these low risk features, we observed that the smoking GES was associated with MACE, independent of the presence of oCAD.</s><s>In a stratified analysis, the association between the smoking GES and MACE appeared restricted to current smokers, suggesting the sGES is a marker of the biologic response or dose response to smoking with some patients having  OR odd ratio, CI 95% confidence interval; ** = p &lt; 0.01; * = p &lt; 0.05 a heightened cardiovascular hazard of cigarette smoking than others.</s><s>The association of the sGES with MACE was primarily driven by smoking status; adjusting for Framingham Risk Score which incorporates other clinical risk factors for MACE did not affect the association (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Platelet aggregation studies conducted ex vivo have long been used to reflect the capacity for platelets to aggregate in vivo and are correlative of cardiovascular events and although informative, have limited clinical use as they need to be performed on fresh samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>We have previously shown that a peripheral blood gene expression aspirin response signature (ARS), is associated with aspirin's effects on platelets and is associated with death/MI <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Of the genes identified in the ARS, we chose ITGA2B for the present study as it showed the strongest association with aspirin response and was independently associated with MACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>ITGA2B encodes a subunit of the alpha-IIb/beta-3 integrin cell adhesion receptor for fibrinogen, plays a critical role in mediating platelet aggregation, and is the target of several platelet inhibitor medications.</s><s>In the current study we validated our previous observation, demonstrating an association between peripheral blood ITGA2B expression and MACE.</s><s>Adjusting for platelet count, aspirin use, smoking status, or FRS did not alter this association.</s><s>Although adjusting for oCAD widened the precision of the association between ITGA2B and MACE (i.e.</s><s>wider 95% confidence interval) the point estimate was similar (1.41 vs. 1.36,</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) suggesting an independent association with larger sample size.</s><s>Stratifying by aspirin use appeared to show a stronger effect in aspirin users vs. not (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), which is consistent with the hypothesis that aspirin response signature genes report on the effects of aspirin on platelet inhibition and with our prior data demonstrating an association between aspirin response genes and platelet function only in the presence of aspirin <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>This apparent diminished effect in non-aspirin users however may also be partially driven by decreased power to detect interactions due to sample size, as adjusting for aspirin usage did not affect the association between ITGA2B and MACE.</s><s>A primary purpose of this study was to investigate potential interactions between cigarette smoking, platelet function and CV-related events.</s><s>Unexpectedly, we observed a significant inverse relationship between the sGES and ITGA2B expression levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>); this was also observed between smoking status and ITGA2B expression.</s><s>One possible explanation for these findings is that the pro-thrombotic effects of smoking on platelets may lead to secondary effects which lower expression of aspirin response genes, including ITGA2B.</s><s>Under this model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), an activator of platelet function such as smoking leads to a decrease in aspirin response genes in patients with excessive platelet activation, consistent with a homeostatic feedback mechanism that aims to restore platelet function to normal levels.</s><s>A similar but opposite effect was observed in our prior work where we demonstrated that ITGA2B levels are inversely correlated with platelet aggregation in healthy volunteers on aspirin, with higher levels associated with lower residual platelet aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>While speculative, this model proposes that the expression of aspirin response genes in platelets may serve as a "sensor" within a given individual modulating excessively low or high levels of platelet aggregation caused by environmental stimuli.</s><s>An example of such a homeostatic mechanism exists for maintaining platelet count through the platelet thrombopoeitin (TPO) receptor, which binds circulating TPO.</s><s>In this system thrombocytopenia leads to higher circulating levels of TPO, which can then stimulate thrombopoesis by the bone marrow.</s><s>Similarly, thrombocytosis leads to lower TPO levels to reduce platelet production.</s><s>Other possible explanations for the observed inverse correlation are: 1) that although there is discordance at the mRNA level that there is positive correlation at the protein level; 2) smoking may alter the composition of circulating platelets (by shifting their clearance, production, or maturity, for example) such that high ITGA2B expressing platelets are underrepresented thus creating a synthetic inverse correlation with smoking;
