<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient characteristics</head><p><s>Between February 2007 and April 2012, 14 patients with malignant melanoma with an overall amount of 52 unresectable metastases were included in this retrospective study.</s><s>There were 37 visceral metastases, including 31 hepatic metastases, 4 lesions located in the adrenal gland and kidney, and 2 lymph node metastases.</s><s>In addition, 15 pulmonary metastases were treated.</s><s>No patient with pulmonary lesions had a history of previous lung surgery.</s><s>All the patients who underwent lung treatments had a clinically fully compensated lung function.</s><s>The patient population comprised 12 men and 2 women; the median age was 66 years (range: 50-81 years) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>All patients had been pretreated with systemic chemotherapy or chemo-immunological treatment.</s><s>In detail, eight patients were pretreated with interferon alpha.</s><s>After treatment with interferon alpha, six patients showed a progressive disease.</s><s>Furthermore, one patient who was pretreated with interferon alpha finished the therapy because of side effects.</s><s>Four patients were treated with Dacarbazine and three patients received Fotemustine.</s><s>All patients displayed tumor progression at the time of referral to our institution for local treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and eligibility criteria</head><p><s>In this retrospective study, primary endpoint was the local tumor control and secondary endpoint was the safety of CT-or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided HDR brachytherapy.</s><s>The indication for the HDR brachytherapy was determined for all patients in an interdisciplinary consensus of dermatologists, oncologists, visceral surgeons, and interventional radiologists.</s><s>The inclusion criteria for performing image-guided brachytherapy were technically unresectable tumor due to its location or due to e.g.</s><s>reduced liver function or low residual tissue, medical contraindication for resection or comorbidities, and denial of operation.</s><s>In case of pulmonary lesions, we performed pulmonary function tests before the treatment to secure sufficient lung capacity.</s><s>A Karnofsky Index ≥ 70% as well as appropriate coagulation parameters (thrombocytes &gt; 100,000/nl, prothrombin &gt; 50%, partial thromboplastin time &lt; 50 s), and liver parameters (bilirubin &lt; 30 µmol/l) qualified for the treatment.</s><s>The administration of anticoagulants like coumarin derivatives and inhibitors of platelet aggregation were discontinued 7 days prior to intervention and changed to low-dose heparin if necessary.</s><s>The exclusion criteria for performing brachytherapy were a diffuse uncontrollable tumor spread.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment characteristics</head><p><s>The median diameter of the metastases was 1.5 cm (range: 0.7-10 cm).</s><s>There were 5 lesions with a maximum tumor diameter between 5 and 10 cm, which were treated with 5 or 6 catheters.</s><s>Metastases with a maximum tumor diameter of 2 to 5 cm received 1 or 2 catheters depending on the geometrical position of the first catheter implanted, or depending on specifics of adjacent critical organs.</s><s>Patients with tumor &lt; 2 cm received a single applicator per lesion only.</s><s>All lesions were treated once by a single fraction HDR brachytherapy.</s><s>The prescribed minimal tumor dose (D 100 ) was 20 Gy.</s><s>However, in some patients, the minimal dose had to be lowered to spare adjacent risk structures.</s><s>The applied minimal doses inside the clinical target volume (CTV) ranged from 15 to 20 Gy (median dose D 100 : 19.9 Gy).</s><s>A complete coverage of the tumor with 20 Gy was applied in 15 pulmonary and 21 hepatic lesions.</s><s>In the adrenal gland and in the retroperitoneum, a dose of 15 Gy was given.</s><s>Total irradiation time ranged between 7 and 45 min.</s><s>The mean hospital stay of the patients was 4 days (range: 3-13).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In metastatic malignant melanoma, tumor resection or image-guided ablation must be considered a palliative treatment option, not a curative approach.</s><s>Due to macroscopically undetectable tumor spreading, progression free survival after these interventions is usually limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>The effect of debulking, i.e. the reduction of the unresectable tumor mass, either by surgery or radiation is so far unknown due to the lack of prospective randomized data.</s><s>However, in a retrospective data, long-term survivors have been described after liver and lung surgery specifically in ocular rather than cutaneous melanoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>In pulmonary metastases of malignant melanoma, a number of factors have proven to be predictive for sur-vival, including site of primary lesion, histological type, lymph node status, disease-free interval, number of metastases, and the presence of extra-thoracic metastases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Based on these data, surgical resection or local ablation of lung metastases has been adopted in the treatment algorithm in many centers, even in patients displaying minor additional non-visceral tumor implants.</s></p><p><s>The objective of surgery or local ablation in metastatic melanoma is symptom relief such as pain or organ compression, e.g.</s><s>jaundice caused by obstruction of the bile duct.</s><s>Few studies reported the application of image-guided local ablation by radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or laser induced thermotherapy (LITT), with limited efficacy in tumor larger 5 cm and in proximity to critical organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>That includes bile duct in the liver hilum, large liver vessels that lead to cooling effects, and therefore incomplete ablation, lung hilum, proximity of gut or tubular structures (ureter) and more.</s><s>Image-guided HDR brachytherapy, a technique that has been so far predominately evaluated in metastatic colorectal as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, renders a new minimally invasive approach unharmed by those restrictions.</s><s>In contrast to thermal ablation, tumor size, cooling effects of large vessels, or proximity to risk organs such as liver or lung hilum, bile duct or intestines do not limit its efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the study described herein, we report only one major complication after MRI-guided brachytherapy of a central localization in the liver with a presentation of cholangitis.</s><s>Other than this, the treatments were well tolerated with just one minor pneumothorax in another patient, which disappeared without treatment.</s><s>Even though the applicator sizes are similar in RFA, LITT, and image-guided brachytherapy, mechanical damage, such as pneumothorax, seems to be more frequent in cases, in which thermal ablation techniques are used, with a reported frequency of 30% to 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the instantaneous thermal effect holds, at least theoretically, a higher risk of acute complications and, by formation of necrotic cavities, a higher risk of late adverse effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p></div>

3, &lt; 3) was related to the appearance of recurrence.</s><s>However, the diagnosis melanoma was a predictive factor for developing local recurrence in an univariate analysis when compared to other diagno-sis such as colorectal, breast or neuroendocrine primary.</s><s>Most likely the comparatively aggressive tumor biology of melanoma is responsible for earlier and more frequent detection of tumor recurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are also promising results in the literature regarding the treatment of malignant melanoma in the nasal cavity and choroidal melanoma by using brachytherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s>In this case report, a patient with choroidal melanoma was successfully treated with brachytherapy, achieving tumor control for 12 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>After the treatment with HDR brachytherapy, we achieved a median overall survival of 8 months.</s><s>Over the last decades, only two systemic treatments were approved in the therapy of metastatic melanoma until 2010: Dacarbazin and Vindesine.</s><s>The reached prolongation of median overall survival was limited to 6-10 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Similar rates of remission or survival were reached with the treatment of interferon-alpha and interleukin-2.</s><s>With the introduction of new target therapies like Ipilimumab and BRAF-inhibitors Vemurafenib, two new effective options are available.</s><s>Diverse phase II studies showed a prolongation of overall survival up to 15 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In the future, the combination of target therapies and local ablative options, such as image-guided HDR brachytherapy, could be a promising strategy.</s><s>We achieved a median progression-free survival of 6 months, which is comparable to the literature.</s><s>As mentioned, the introduction of target therapies like BRAF-inhibitors in combination with MEK inhibitors may prolong the progression-free survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several limitations to our study need to be acknowledged.</s><s>The first weakness of this study is the retrospective nature and the short follow up period.</s><s>However, the results of this investigation show that HDR brachytherapy can be safely used for local tumor control in selected patients.</s><s>To identify appropriate candidates for local ablation with the intention to prolong survival, a prospective comparative trial is needed, i.e. to assess the combination of local ablation plus systemic treatments versus systemic treatment alone.</s><s>In such a study format, HDR brachytherapy would just be one out of a set of tools for local tumor treatment, supplemented by RFA, SBRT, TACE, Y90 radioembolisation, surgery, and others.</s><s>A thoughtful, interdisciplinary consideration of local and systemic treatment options will in future be mandatory for optimal treatment success in each patient with metastatic melanoma.</s></p><p><s>We conclude that for patients in a palliative and non-curable stadium, image-guided single high-doserate brachytherapy is a promising alternative and well-tolerated treatment, which can be used in most tumor locations, and may therefore be considered specifically in metastases causing symptoms or metastases at risk to cause complications.</s><s>Treatment rationale should be the reduction of clinical symptoms by reduction of the tumor volume, and therefore the improvement of quality of life.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Local tumor control in a 58-year-old female patient with histological proven malignant melanoma metastases.</s><s>A) Preoperative axial contrast-enhanced liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (liver specific contrast agent Gd-EOB-DTPA) shows two metastases in segment V in the right liver lobe (open arrow), former partial resection of the liver segment IV (outlined arrow).</s><s>B) Both metastases were treated by open MRI high-dose-rate brachytherapy using one catheter.</s><s>C) Treatment planning and dosimetric analysis, tumor encircling isodoses (red line indicates 20 Gy).</s><s>D) Follow-up contrast-enhanced liver MRI at 3 months shows the shrinking ablation zone with local control of the treated lesions</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,56.68,274.96,226.80,186.24" type="bitmap" /></figure>
