<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient characteristics</head><p><s>Between February 2007 and April 2012, 14 patients with malignant melanoma with an overall amount of 52 unresectable metastases were included in this retrospective study.</s><s>There were 37 visceral metastases, including 31 hepatic metastases, 4 lesions located in the adrenal gland and kidney, and 2 lymph node metastases.</s><s>In addition, 15 pulmonary metastases were treated.</s><s>No patient with pulmonary lesions had a history of previous lung surgery.</s><s>All the patients who underwent lung treatments had a clinically fully compensated lung function.</s><s>The patient population comprised 12 men and 2 women; the median age was 66 years (range: 50-81 years) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>All patients had been pretreated with systemic chemotherapy or chemo-immunological treatment.</s><s>In detail, eight patients were pretreated with interferon alpha.</s><s>After treatment with interferon alpha, six patients showed a progressive disease.</s><s>Furthermore, one patient who was pretreated with interferon alpha finished the therapy because of side effects.</s><s>Four patients were treated with Dacarbazine and three patients received Fotemustine.</s><s>All patients displayed tumor progression at the time of referral to our institution for local treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and eligibility criteria</head><p><s>In this retrospective study, primary endpoint was the local tumor control and secondary endpoint was the safety of CT-or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided HDR brachytherapy.</s><s>The indication for the HDR brachytherapy was determined for all patients in an interdisciplinary consensus of dermatologists, oncologists, visceral surgeons, and interventional radiologists.</s><s>The inclusion criteria for performing image-guided brachytherapy were technically unresectable tumor due to its location or due to e.g.</s><s>reduced liver function or low residual tissue, medical contraindication for resection or comorbidities, and denial of operation.</s><s>In case of pulmonary lesions, we performed pulmonary function tests before the treatment to secure sufficient lung capacity.</s><s>A Karnofsky Index â¥ 70% as well as appropriate coagulation parameters (thrombocytes &gt; 100,000/nl, prothrombin &gt; 50%, partial thromboplastin time &lt; 50 s), and liver parameters (bilirubin &lt; 30 Âµmol/l) qualified for the treatment.</s><s>The administration of anticoagulants like coumarin derivatives and inhibitors of platelet aggregation were discontinued 7 days prior to intervention and changed to low-dose heparin if necessary.</s><s>The exclusion criteria for performing brachytherapy were a diffuse uncontrollable tumor spread.</s></p></div>

3, &lt; 3) was related to the appearance of recurrence.</s><s>However, the diagnosis melanoma was a predictive factor for developing local recurrence in an univariate analysis when compared to other diagno-sis such as colorectal, breast or neuroendocrine primary.</s><s>Most likely the comparatively aggressive tumor biology of melanoma is responsible for earlier and more frequent detection of tumor recurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are also promising results in the literature regarding the treatment of malignant melanoma in the nasal cavity and choroidal melanoma by using brachytherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s>In this case report, a patient with choroidal melanoma was successfully treated with brachytherapy, achieving tumor control for 12 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>After the treatment with HDR brachytherapy, we achieved a median overall survival of 8 months.</s><s>Over the last decades, only two systemic treatments were approved in the therapy of metastatic melanoma until 2010: Dacarbazin and Vindesine.</s><s>The reached prolongation of median overall survival was limited to 6-10 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Similar rates of remission or survival were reached with the treatment of interferon-alpha and interleukin-2.</s><s>With the introduction of new target therapies like Ipilimumab and BRAF-inhibitors Vemurafenib, two new effective options are available.</s><s>Diverse phase II studies showed a prolongation of overall survival up to 15 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In the future, the combination of target therapies and local ablative options, such as image-guided HDR brachytherapy, could be a promising strategy.</s><s>We achieved a median progression-free survival of 6 months, which is comparable to the literature.</s><s>As mentioned, the introduction of target therapies like BRAF-inhibitors in combination with MEK inhibitors may prolong the progression-free survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several limitations to our study need to be acknowledged.</s><s>The first weakness of this study is the retrospective nature and the short follow up period.</s><s>However, the results of this investigation show that HDR brachytherapy can be safely used for local tumor control in selected patients.</s><s>To identify appropriate candidates for local ablation with the intention to prolong survival, a prospective comparative trial is needed, i.e. to assess the combination of local ablation plus systemic treatments versus systemic treatment alone.</s><s>In such a study format, HDR brachytherapy would just be one out of a set of tools for local tumor treatment, supplemented by RFA, SBRT, TACE, Y90 radioembolisation, surgery, and others.</s><s>A thoughtful, interdisciplinary consideration of local and systemic treatment options will in future be mandatory for optimal treatment success in each patient with metastatic melanoma.</s></p><p><s>We conclude that for patients in a palliative and non-curable stadium, image-guided single high-doserate brachytherapy is a promising alternative and well-tolerated treatment, which can be used in most tumor locations, and may therefore be considered specifically in metastases causing symptoms or metastases at risk to cause complications.</s><s>Treatment rationale should be the reduction of clinical symptoms by reduction of the tumor volume, and therefore the improvement of quality of life.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Local tumor control in a 58-year-old female patient with histological proven malignant melanoma metastases.</s><s>A) Preoperative axial contrast-enhanced liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (liver specific contrast agent Gd-EOB-DTPA) shows two metastases in segment V in the right liver lobe (open arrow), former partial resection of the liver segment IV (outlined arrow).</s><s>B) Both metastases were treated by open MRI high-dose-rate brachytherapy using one catheter.</s><s>C) Treatment planning and dosimetric analysis, tumor encircling isodoses (red line indicates 20 Gy).</s><s>D) Follow-up contrast-enhanced liver MRI at 3 months shows the shrinking ablation zone with local control of the treated lesions</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,56.68,274.96,226.80,186.24" type="bitmap" /></figure>
