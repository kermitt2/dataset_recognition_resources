<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by pathological concerns over shape and weight, and disturbed eating and weight-control behaviour.</s><s>They are more common in females and typically start during adolescence, with a peak onset between ages 15 and 20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>However, the age at which disordered eating behaviours (DEBs) and associated cognitions initially develop has not been widely studied, and it is unclear at what age the sex differences in the prevalence of DEBs emerge.</s><s>Large prospective longitudinal cohort studies of community-dwelling adolescents are required to answer such questions, although the optimal method of assessing DEBs in adolescents remains unclear.</s></p><p><s>The use of multiple informants in assessing emotional and behavioural problems in youth is often advocated <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, as multiple perspectives of a child's behaviour are likely to enrich assessment, and can be important in diagnosing disorders involving symptom denial <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>It has been proposed that parental reports may be beneficial for assessing anorexia nervosa (AN) as sufferers themselves often downplay symptoms at the start of the illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, parents may be unaware and under-report behaviours characteristic of bulimia nervosa (BN) that are often associated wtih secrecy and shame, such as binge eating and purging <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>However, agreement between informants tends to be low <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, reliance on multiple informants may be problematic, as others' responses may be biased by their own attitudes, personality and internal state <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Poor-to-moderate agreement between youth and parent ratings has been observed for DEB among clinical samples.</s><s>For example, Mariano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> found acceptable agreement for the presence of behavioural symptoms (e.g.</s><s>binge eating, self-induced vomiting, and laxative/diuretic misuse), but poor agreement on frequency of behaviours and experience of disordered eating cognitions, with greater severity reported by young people compared to their parents.</s><s>Similarly, Salbach-Andrae et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> observed poor concordance between parent and adolescent reports, particularly for internalising behaviours.</s><s>While several studies have observed good concordance for symptoms of AN <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, one study reported less concerns over weight and restraint in child reports (aged 6-12 years) compared to their parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and another study revealed greater concordance for adolescents with BN compared to those with AN-Restrictive subtype <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, youths suffering from BN have been found to report greater severity of cognitions and frequency of behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, shape concerns and restraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> compared to their parents.</s><s>Thus, concordance between parent and youth reports in clinical populations may depend on the nature of the behaviour and the stage or severity of illness.</s></p><p><s>Similar levels of non-concordance have been reported in non-clinical samples.</s><s>Studies have reported good agreement on the absence of DEBs and modest agreement for the presence of eating disordered cognitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, but poor concordance for bulimic symptoms such as binge eating <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>One study observed that similar prevalences of DEBs were reported by parents and youth, but found high levels of within-dyad disagreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, parents may not be aware of their children's engagement in such behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, parents and children may differ in their understanding of problematic eating behaviours <ref type="bibr"

adolescent and parent reports, and investigated the degree of concordance between informants.</s><s>It was predicted that DEBs would be more prevalent amongst girls compared to boys, adolescent reports compared to parents, and at age 16 compared to age 14.</s><s>Our data revealed that DEBs were more consistently endorsed amongst girls compared to boys and adolescents compared to their parents.</s><s>However, prevalence did not vary widely as a function of age.</s><s>This may be due to similarities between ages 14 and 16 years in terms of physical development (i.e.</s><s>post-pubertal) and environmental challenges.</s><s>Greater differences in prevalence may be expected if comparisons are made between time points characterised by different environmental challenges and both physical and neural developmental stages, i.e. pre-versus postpuberty, or early versus late adolescence.</s><s>For example, in the context of clinical diagnoses, Allen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> reported that the prevalence of EDs increased significantly from age 14 to ages 17 and 20 in females but only between ages 14 and 20 in males.</s><s>Thus, future studies may wish to model the impact of the interaction between age and sex on symptom prevalence.</s></p><p><s>DEBs were more prevalent amongst girls compared to boys at both time points.</s><s>Although the magnitude of the sex differences observed in this study is smaller than that reported in treatment-seeking samples, it is of similar magnitude to population-based studies in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>However, there is some inconsistency regarding the direction and specificity of the differences in prevalences between sexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>For example, one recent study in the UK found a greater prevalence of some DEBs in girls compared to boys using parental reports (including fear of weight gain, distress about weight/shape, food restriction and avoidance of fattening foods), but equivalent endorsement of binge eating and purging across the sexes (approx.</s><s>5 and 0.2%, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Another study reported a greater prevalence of binge eating amongst girls compared to boys in adolescent self-reports, but no sex-related differences in parent reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, we found a greater prevalence of all DEBs in girls (including binge eating and purging) in both the parent and adolescent reports, suggesting that the sex-related differences in prevalence are not simply a matter of the informant.</s><s>However, factors such as issues in general recognition of DEBs in boys or willingness to report may have contributed to these findings.</s><s>For example, Lee-Winn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> reported that although no sex differences were observed with respect to recurrent overeating, emotional aspects of binge eating (loss of control, distress) were more prevalent in girls than boys.</s><s>These authors suggested that this may be due to emotional expression being seen as less socially acceptable amongst boys.</s><s>Consistent with previous studies, our data revealed slight to fair concordance between parent and adolescent reports of ED symptoms.</s><s>All symptoms were more prevalent amongst adolescent self-reports compared to parent reports, particularly with respect to binge eating and purging.</s><s>This may be due to the secrecy and shame often associated with these behaviours (Wilfley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>).</s><s>We also found that the number of parents reporting binge eating and/or purging in adolescents who report themselves as symptomatic at both time points does not improve over time.</s><s>However, contrary to Swanson et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> findings of increased prevalence estimates for some DEBs (e.g.</s><s>binge eating, fasting) DEBs obtained using the "OR" rule (i.e. reported by either informant) compared to reports from adolescents/children only, combining parent and adolescent reports in our study elicited prevalence estimates that were only slightly higher than those from the adolescent reports alone for all DEBs.</s><s>In contrast, they were substantially higher than the prevalence estimates from parent reports.</s><s>These findings suggest that parents are unaware of their children's endorsement of such behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The lack of awareness of adolescents' binge eating and purging in mid-adolescence may contribute to a central issue in EDs, namely difficulty in early recognition.</s><s>If this is correct, it is important to educate parents, raise awareness of these symptoms and to take note of symptoms in late childhood and early adolescence.</s><s>However, such discrepancies may also be explained by differences in attitudes towards, understanding or interpretation of DEBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>Future studies may wish to investigate the similarity of interpretations of behavioural definitions between informants to address issues of comparability between reports.</s></p><p><s>The main strength of this study is the use of a large, representative, multinational community sample with repeated measurements at 2 time points and a range of parental/caregiver figures.</s><s>We considered a range of ED symptoms and how the persistence of symptoms over 2 years may influence adolescent-parent concordance.</s><s>Although we did not take into account the contact time between parents and adolescents, which may influence the parent's awareness of the adolescent's behaviour, it is expected that our sample encapsulates a broad array of parental involvement.</s><s>Moreover, the use of a community sample may explain the high rates of concordance for the absence of DEBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study has some limitations.</s><s>Firstly, due to the use of skip rules in the DAWBA, the majority of the "absent" responses were presumed absent based on negative responses to all five screening questions.</s><s>Thus, individuals who may engage in these behaviours although they did not endorse the screening questions would not have been accurately represented.</s><s>However, post hoc exploration of the endorsement of entry questions yielded similar findings to our GEE models, whereby entry questions were more frequently endorsed in girls compared to boys (by both informants) and by adolescents compared to parents (for both sexes), and this did not vary widely between time points: (adolescents: 58.0-58.5% girls and 23.1-29.7%</s><s>boys; parents: 20.9-25.2%</s><s>girls and 5.3-9.6%</s><s>boys).</s><s>Secondly, there were insufficient data to investigate differences in symptom severity.</s><s>Finally, parental weight and parental history of an ED were not assessed.</s><s>Parents experiencing difficulties with eating or weight regulation may not be as good at noticing eating problems in their children <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, maternal and paternal BMI have been reported to be predictors of ED caseness at age 14 compared to healthy controls and psychiatric controls, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, parental weight and disordered eating should be included as predictor variables in future models of symptom prevalence.</s></p><p><s>Our findings suggest that adolescent reports (compared to parent reports) elicit greater prevalence of ED symptoms in mid-adolescence in the community.</s><s>It is unclear, however, whether the behaviours are being over-or underreported by adolescents and parents, respectively.</s><s>While the use of multiple informants can provide a broader picture of the adolescent's behaviour, they may also introduce errors with inaccurate reporting of behaviour.</s><s>Given the limitations of self-report, alternative perspectives provided by a second informant may be useful in identifying potentially vulnerable individuals who may not identify themselves as symptomatic, or for conceptualising an adolescent's behaviour in different contexts.</s><s>Indeed, there has been some support for the use of computerised diagnostic assessments such as the DAWBA that takes into consideration multiple informants' reports to calculate the probability of a child/ adolescent having an ED <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s><s>However, a Swiss study of child and adolescent outpatients comparing the ICD-10 diagnoses provided by clinicians to those reached through expert review of DAWBA data revealed that although agreement between the DAWBA expert and clinician ratings was observed, this was largely driven by negative ratings of EDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the context of diagnoses determined using information from multiple informants, the question remains as to how to prioritise or combine this information.</s><s>While parent reports may be superior and more practical when assessing young children <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, it is likely that adolescents will be sufficiently aware of their own thoughts/behaviours, and thus may be a reliable source of information.</s><s>Additionally, parent reports may be useful in determining symptom severity, which this study was unable to assess.</s><s>For example, it has been suggested that persistent disagreement between informants could indicate a poorer prognosis compared to individuals for whom informant ratings consistently converge <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>.</s><s>However, parental reports may be important with respect to the denial that often occurs at the start of the illness, particularly in AN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, in the present study, 51 additional cases were identified by parental reports as endorsing any DEB at both time points (who were not also endorsed at both time points by adolescent reports); however, this is substantially smaller than the 341 additional cases identified by adolescent reports.</s><s>To better understand the utility of multiple informants in identification of DEB in adolescents, future studies should aim to clarify how concordance rates differ throughout childhood and adolescence in relation to a broader array of symptoms, the factors that influence concordance (e.g.</s><s>parental weight/eating difficulties) and how this relates to prognosis and the duration of untreated symptoms/ED.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Participant demographics
