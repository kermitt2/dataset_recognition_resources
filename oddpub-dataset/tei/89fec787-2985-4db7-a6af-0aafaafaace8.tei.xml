<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic deficiency of miR-29 prevents cardiac remodeling.</head><p><s>Starting from the observation that raising miR-29 levels and activity by synthetic miR-29 molecules induced hypertrophy of primary cardiac myocytes in vitro (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we asked whether inhibition or reduction of this miRNA was beneficial in cardiac disease models in vivo.</s><s>We did not obtain mice with complete genetic loss of both miR-29 clusters (miR-29, a/b1, and b2/c), which is in good agreement with a recent report <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">27</ref> , according to which the offspring ratio was 1%, with those born dying within few weeks.</s><s>Therefore, we used mouse lines with partial deficiency of miR-29 variants, that is, mice with miR-29 ab1 −/− b2c +/− or ab1 +/+ b2c −/− genotype.</s><s>Again consistent with other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[29]</ref> , mice with triple-allelic deletion of miR-29 show some growth retardation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) and increased mortality, whereas mice with miR-29 ab1  Heart weight-to-tibia length ratio and e WGA staining of left ventricular tissue from mice described in c for determination of cardiac and CM hypertrophy.</s><s>f (Left) Representative left ventricular sections stained with Sirius Red/Fast Green of the indicated treatment groups and (right) quantification of interstitial fibrosis.</s><s>g Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of molecular markers for cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (Nppa, Myh7/Myh6) and of fibrosis-associated collagens.</s><s>All scale bars: 50 µm.</s><s>All quantifications derive from n = 5-14 mice/group, PCR performed with 2 replicates each.</s><s>All quantitative data in panels c-g are reported as means ± SEM. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001 determined by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test phenotypical effects as, for instance, in body weight nor was there evidence for the induction of fibrosis in other organs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Cardiac miR-29 levels (miR-29 referring here and in the following to the respective 3p strands, as we found the 5p strands to be hardly expressed) in miR-29 ab1 −/− b2c +/− or ab1 +/+ b2c −/− mice were reduced by 80% or 65%, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), but-under basal conditions-this deficiency did not elicit a cardiac phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-e</ref>).</s><s>We then proceeded to test these mice in a disease model for left ventricular pressure overload, induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC).</s><s>TAC-treated miR-29 ab1 −/− b2c +/− or ab1 +/+ b2c −/− mice showed a reduction of miR-29 by 60% or 40%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, both mouse lines were protected from TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and functional impairment, showing better heart function than wildtype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), reduced myocardial (i.e., heart weight) and cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c, d</ref>) and lower levels of hypertrophyassociated marker genes Nppa and Myh7 (in relation to Myh6) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>Remarkably, also myocardial fibrosis was reduced in these miR-29-deficient mice, as determined by Sirius Red staining of left ventricular sections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c, e</ref>) and by collagen expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>Comparably minor effects were seen in Sham-treated animals, where only two genes were modestly deregulated (i.e., 2fold for Col1a1, 0.5-fold for Col3a1 in miR-29 ab1 −/− b2c +/− vs. WT) and matrix staining with Sirius Red was found to be unchanged (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AntimiR-29 protects against cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.</head><p><s>To exclude that compensatory mechanisms in miR-29 ab1 −/− b2c +/− or miR-29 ab1 +/+ b2c −/− mice had obscured additional effects, we next sought to inhibit miR-29 acutely in the adult animal.</s><s>Three consecutive injections of a chemically modified antisense oligonucleotide, designed to target all members of the mouse miR-29 family (antimiR-29), lead to a 70% reduction of myocardial miR-29 under basal conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a, b</ref>) and in the TAC model (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>This relative reduction was observed in cardiac myocytes as well as in cardiac fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with our findings in miR-29deficient mice, infusion of antimiR-29 protected from cardiac dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy at the tissue and cellular level, and from fibrosis (Figs.</s><s>2c-f and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, the corresponding gene expression signatures revealed a decrease of markers for hypertrophy (Nppa, Myh7) and fibrosis (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s><s>One study reported increased perivascular fibrosis upon application of a miR-29b inhibitor, without affecting cardiac hypertrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">30</ref> .</s><s>This could be due to different oligonucleotide chemistries or the specific targeting of variant miR-29b which, due to nuclear localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">32</ref> , may have functions other than, or in addition to, variants a and c.</s><s>Because of these unresolved discrepancies, and in view of the therapeutic effects observed thus far, we chose to analyze in detail the expression of miR-29 variants in healthy and diseased myocardium.</s></p><p><s>The miR-29 family is dynamically regulated.</s><s>By quantitative real-time PCR analysis, we found myocardial levels of each miR-29 variant strongly increased with age (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>This is consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">33</ref> and interesting with regard to a proposed function of miR-29 in body growth control <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">33</ref> .</s><s>Most remarkable with respect to disease, however, are the temporal changes in miR-29 expression that occur in mice subjected to TAC.</s><s>This model of pressure overload lead to a prominent increase of cardiac myocyte miR-29 in the first 48 h after surgery, followed by downregulation in the late phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>Upon isolation of myocytes and fibroblasts from myocardium of these mice, total as well as individual levels of miR-29 variants were substantially (×6) higher in CM compared to CF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>This finding is remarkable, given previously reported, higher levels in CF than in CM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">13</ref> .</s><s>We identified a possible explanation for this discrepancy by quantifying miR-29 in CF before and after  cultivation: within one week of cultivation, an abnormal and drastic upregulation of miR-29 occurred in primary CF from neonatal rat as well as from adult mouse (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d, e</ref>).</s><s>Besides this cell culture-related phenomenon in CF, the high endogenous expression of all miR-29 variants in CM suggests a role in this cell type.</s><s>Interestingly, downregulation of miR-29a and miR-29b in chronic myocardial disease was not only observed in the murine disease model, but also in myocardium from patients with aortic valve stenosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>In line with this, a recent HITS-CLIP analysis of Argonaute protein 2 (Ago2)bound RNAs in human myocardium found miR-29 targets to be enriched in this context <ref

augmentation of miR-29 suggest a dominant role of miR-29 in CM over that in CF. miR-29 de-represses Wnt signaling in cardiac myocytes.</s><s>To assess whether miR-29 levels in cardiac myocytes correlate with profibrotic signaling, we analyzed the secretome of primary cardiac myocytes after manipulation of miR-29.</s><s>CMs were transfected with antimiR-29 or a control antimiR, and proteins from the culture supernatant were isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>, we identified several factors with

may be under direct control of miR-29.</s><s>Indeed, four factors of the Wnt pathway contain binding sites for miR-29, namely GSK3B, ICAT/CTNNBIP1, HBP1 and GLIS2.</s><s>3′-UTR reporter activity

(Fig. <ref type="figure">5f</ref>).</s><s>The role of miR-29 as a mediator of NFAT activation became further evident by decreased NFAT-dependent transcriptional activation of Regulator of calcineurin 1 (Rcan1) in mice injected with antimiR-29 or miR-29-deficient mice after TAC (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>), and by the finding that addition of the NFAT inhibitor VIVIT to cultured

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we demonstrate a role of the miR-29 family in pathologic hypertrophy of the myocardium and fibrosis.</s><s>These processes of cardiac remodeling occur in response to chronic cardiac stress, and we show here that inhibition or genetic deficiency of miR-29 protects from cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in a mouse model for chronic cardiac pressure overload.</s><s>In a previous study, we had singled out variants miR-29a and c by phenotypic library screening as potential prohypertrophic microRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">26</ref> .</s><s>The present study substantiates and extends this early observation and identifies cardiac myocyte miR-29 to exert a key role in cardiac remodeling.</s><s>We show that, in myocardium, miR-29 is prominently expressed in cardiac myocytes (CM) and that CM-specific genetic deficiency of miR-29 in vivo significantly reduced the development of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy (while, consistently, overexpression in CM in vivo exerted the opposite effect).</s><s>Intriguingly, analysis of proteins secreted by CM and their validation by 3′ UTR reporter assays suggested that miR-29 exerts these effects, at least in part, by direct regulation of factors of the Wnt signaling pathway.</s></p><p><s>The Wnt pathway stands out from most other signaling cascades, because its activation occurs by liberation from constitutive inhibition (upon reducing beta-catenin degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">39</ref> ).</s><s>Our data suggest that the effects of miR-29 on the Wnt cascade occur by repressing several factors that constitute this inhibition (Fig. <ref type="figure">5g</ref>): (i) GSK3B, the function of which is to commit beta-catenin to degradation and which, in mice transgenic for its hyperactive S9A mutant, protects from TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">41</ref> , (ii) CTNNBIP1 (also known as ICAT), a protein that blocks activated beta-catenin from interacting with the transcription factor TCF/ LEF, and deficiency of which causes heart enlargement 42 , (iii) HBP1, a negative regulator of TCF/LEF 43 and (iv) GLIS2, a transcriptional repressor that binds to, and is cleaved by, p120 catenin <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">44</ref> .</s><s>We propose the beneficial effect exerted by antimiR-29 to result to a considerable extent from restoration of the inhibition of Wnt signaling.</s><s>Formal proof for this hypothesis would require the inhibition of Wnt-signaling together with manipulation of miR-29 in cardiac myocytes in vivo, which should be the focus of further studies.</s><s>Of note in this respect, the data presented here also support a previously suspected correlation between miR-29 and Wnt signaling in osteoclasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">45</ref> .</s></p><p><s>An unexpected outcome of our studies in the pressure overload model was that antimiR-29 not only prevented cardiac hypertrophy, but also cardiac fibrosis.</s><s>This is a remarkable finding, considering that elevation, rather than inhibition, of miR-29 suppresses fibrosis in tissues other than myocardium.</s><s>Fibrosisthe secretion of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagensoccurs in response to various disease conditions.</s><s>Based on target prediction algorithms, miR-29 has early been suspected to negatively regulate the expression of collagens and, indeed, this has been confirmed by manipulating miR-29 in vitro or in various tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">30</ref> .</s><s>More importantly, studies on miR-29 in fibrosis disease models in liver, lung and kidney have demonstrated the potential benefit of elevating miR-29 levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[48]</ref> .</s><s>In this respect, our findings that inhibition or genetic deficiency of miR-29 in vivo prevents (rather than promotes) myocardial fibrosis in a cardiac disease model were, at first, unexpected.</s><s>We thus reasoned that the unique myocardial tissue context may determine the net balance of pro-or antifibrotic miR-29-controlled processes more than its individual activity in cardiac fibroblasts.</s><s>The hypothesis of a dominant miR-29 function in CM finds support by our observations that (i) endogenous levels of miR-29 variants in vivo are substantially higher in CM, compared to CF (a discrepant previous observation in cultured CF <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">13</ref> seems attributable to aberrant expression that occurs during cultivation, see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d, e</ref>), that (ii) mice with CM-specific deficiency for the miR-29b2/c cluster (upon infection with iCre-encoding AAV9 vector) were largely protected from pressure overloadinduced cardiac remodeling (consistently, AAV9-mediated overexpression exacerbated cardiac remodeling in this model) and that (iii) induction of fibrosis-involved collagens 1a1, 1a2 and 3a1 in TAC-exposed myocardium is reduced in miR-29-deficient or antimiR-29-treated mice (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f, 2g</ref>).</s><s>Together, these data illustrate a function of miR-29 in the interplay between myocardial cell types that promote cardiac remodeling, and highlights a perspective for therapeutic inhibition of miR-29.</s><s>Interestingly, inhibiting miR-29 may
