<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study to evaluate PROs following the treatment of erythema of rosacea with brimonidine gel 0.33% compared to vehicle gel, all patients had self-perceived severe erythema (PSA grade 4).</s><s>However, when assessed by clinicians, around half (51.1%) had severe erythema (CEA grade 4) and around half (48.9%) had moderate erythema (CEA grade 3).</s><s>The difference in the proportion of subjects with a PSA score of 4 compared to a CEA score of 4 indicates that the subjects in this study over-estimated the severity of their erythema.</s><s>Disease perception may be affected by depression and healthcare-seeking behaviour is associated with higher subjective disease perception. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>ot surprisingly, almost all subjects in this study population were dissatisfied with their appearance at baseline.</s><s>However, after 8 days of treatment, 36.9% of subjects in the brimonidine 0.33% group were satisfied or very satisfied with their facial appearance, and 28.3% were not at all embarrassed or self-conscious about their facial redness.</s></p><p><s>The emotional impact of rosacea has been shown to have an important role in patient's quality of life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>The subject satisfaction questionnaire showed that significantly more subjects in the brimonidine 0.33% group than in the vehicle group were satisfied with the overall treatment, the improvement in their facial redness, and the time to treatment effect (at least P &lt; 0.05).</s><s>According to the patient daily diary data, subjects saw an almost immediate improvement with 83% of subjects in the brimonidine 0.33% group able to control their redness compared to 39% in the vehicle group from Day 1.</s><s>The pivotal Phase III studies demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant improvement in erythema from 30 min after application of bri-monidine gel 0.33%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>This fast onset of action explains why an improvement in facial redness, and subsequent decrease in embarrassment due to facial redness, was observed so quickly after the start of the study using this once-daily regimen.</s><s>The decrease from baseline to Day 8 of the percentage of subjects who were somewhat, moderately or extremely embarrassed about their facial redness was significantly greater in the brimonidine 0.33% group (77.1-54.3%)</s><s>than in the vehicle group (84.1-81.0%).</s></p><p><s>The significant decrease in embarrassment and greater improvement in satisfaction with appearance in the brimonidine 0.33% group reflects the good efficacy of brimonidine gel 0.33% in treating facial erythema of rosacea.</s><s>After 8 days of treatment, significantly more subjects in the brimonidine 0.33% group than in the vehicle group had at least a one-grade improvement in their erythema, as measured by either CEA (71.7% vs. 35.7%;</s><s>P &lt;

nevertheless, most treatment-related AEs were dermatological in nature, mild, transient and resolved spontaneously.</s><s>There was one recorded case of a patient in the brimonidine 0.33% group with treatment-related AEs of severe erythema and moderate swelling during the treatment period that led to treatment discontinuation; a subsequent re-challenge with brimonidine gel 0.33% gave no symptoms.</s><s>Treatment-related erythematous events have been reported in brimonidine Phase III clinical trials in 3.6% of brimonidine subjects (n = 277) and all were mild or moderate and led to discontinuation in only one subject (0.4%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>In a recent publication, the term 'paradoxical erythema' was proposed for this early onset reaction (with or without additional symptoms such as burning) and the authors suggested that it can be minimized by preparing the barrier of the skin, using a mild moisturizer for rosacea-prone skin, before starting therapy.</s><s>Also, they highlighted the need to educate patients to avoid exposure to triggers during treatment and to teach them how to optimize treatment application. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s> possible limitation of this study is the short study duration but previous safety studies and pharmacovigilance data have shown that most adverse events occur within the first 2 weeks of starting treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>It is noteworthy that the results may have been influenced by any intra-and inter-day fluctuations in the intensity of erythema in the absence of treatment and/or exposure to environmental and lifestyle triggers.</s><s>Any perceived worsening erythema after treatment may in fact have been related to normal variation in the presentation of the disease and/or expo-sure to triggers, which may have had an impact on the PRO for certain subjects.</s><s>Furthermore, it could be expected that patients who have suffered from erythema for a long time (almost twothirds of subjects had suffered from rosacea for over 5 years) may need some time to adapt to being able to control their redness, as well as to learn how to apply the medication in a very thin uniform layer.</s><s>Nevertheless, a significant proportion of subjects in the brimonidine 0.33% group were able to control their facial redness from Day 1, and they became more satisfied with their appearance and less embarrassed by their facial redness within 8 days.</s><s>In the Phase III long-term safety study, brimonidine gel 0.33% treatment was shown to have a positive impact on social life from the first evaluation at Month 3 and this was maintained during the full 12-month study period. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>It thus seems reasonable to expect that the improvement reported here could be similarly long-lasting.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, once-daily application of brimonidine gel 0.33% in the treatment of persistent facial erythema of rosacea allowed patients to control their facial redness and rapidly led to significantly improved PROs and greater patient satisfaction, reflecting the good efficacy and safety of brimonidine gel 0.33%.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 Facial Redness questionnaire (FRQ) responses to the questions (a) 'How satisfied are you with the appearance of your facial skin right now?' and (b) 'How embarrassed are you about your facial redness right now?'
