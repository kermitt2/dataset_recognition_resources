<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we evaluated DP innervating afferents' sensitivity to cold though the expression of the cold-sensitive receptors TRPM8 and TRPA1 and their respective contribution to cold-evoked activation of trigeminal neurons.</s><s>We show that the proportion of TRPM8 and TRPA1 immunoreactive neurons is not different in the neuronal population innervating the DP or the facial skin.</s><s>Interestingly, a higher proportion of neurons innervating the buccal mucosa were immunoreactive for TRPA1 compared to neurons innervating the other tissues.</s><s>However, in calcium imaging experiments the selective TRPA1 agonist AITC activated a similar proportion of neurons innervating the skin (56%) compared to neurons innervating the mucosa (47%).</s><s>Overall, these proportions are higher than what was found in immunohistochemical quantification in which 25% of neurons innervating the skin and 43% of neurons innervating the mucosa were immunoreactive for TRPA1.</s><s>There are several possible explanations for this difference.</s></p><p><s>First, the neuronal expression of TRPA1 is highly sensitive to physiopathological conditions, especially inflammation.</s><s>It was shown that a single subcutaneous injection of formalin or Complete Freund's Adjuvant increased TRPA1 expression up to one-week post injection <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, ethanol, which we used as solvent for the retrotracer DiI, was shown to induce an inflammation associated with cyclooxygenase-2 upregulation in a model of gut inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> and therefore, could have affected TRPA1 expression in our experiments.</s><s>Second, although we used an acute culture model to limit the upregulation of TRPA1, the process of dissociating and culturing the TG could produce an upregulation of TRPA1.</s><s>Barabas et al. showed, in cultured mouse TG neurons, a rapid increase in the proportion of neurons responding to the TRPA1 agonist cinnamaldehyde, from 27%, 4 h after cell plating, to 66%, 10 h after cell plating <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s><s>Thus, the discrepancy between our immunohistochemical versus  calcium imaging data could be due to the injection of the retrotracer and the cell culture processing that could have increase TRPA1 expression in TG neurons.</s></p><p><s>The DP sensitivity to cold was evaluated through the expression of the marker of neuronal activation, cFos, in the trigeminal nucleus.</s><s>We showed that a repeated unilateral cold stimulation on the tooth increases cFos expression in the ipsilateral trigeminal nucleus compared to the contralateral side.</s><s>The upregulation of cFos was localized in dorsal part of the Vi/Vc transition zone between the caudalis and the interpolaris regions of the trigeminal nucleus.</s><s>In general, the projection structure of nociceptive neurons innervating the orofacial area is the caudal part of the trigeminal nucleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> .</s><s>However, it was shown that trigeminal nociceptive neurons project also in the Vi/Vc region and painful stimulation in various orofacial areas, including the DP, activate neurons in the Vi/Vc region <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> .</s><s>The Vi/Vc region is important to trigeminal pain, as a large proportion of Vi/Vc neurons project to the parabrachial nucleus, which is involved in affective and autonomic response to pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, a local injection of NMDA receptor antagonist or glial inhibitors in the Vi/Vc region reduced pain induced by temporomandibular joint inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> .</s><s>Collectively, these data support that the increase in cFos expression in Vi/Vc region observed with cold stimulation of the tooth was a relevant endpoint to assess the participation of TRPM8 and TRPA1 in cold-induced tooth pain.</s></p><p><s>We showed that the genetic deletion of TRPM8 or the pharmacological blockade of TRPA1 did not reduce the cold-induced cFos upregulation in the trigeminal nucleus, suggesting these receptors have a minor contribution in DP noxious cold perception.</s><s>Many studies have demonstrated that TRPM8 and TRPA1 receptor mediate cold detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> , however, in line with our results some contradictory studies using TRPA1 antagonists and TRPA1 KO mice failed to show a reduction of cold sensitivity in physiological conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, the lack of TRPM8 contribution in DP cold detection, evidenced by our observation that cold-induced c-Fos upregulation was not prevented in TRPM8 KO mice, would be explained by the small proportion (5%) of neurons innervating the DP that express TRPM8.</s><s>All together these data suggest that, in physiological condition, DP sensitivity to cold stimuli involves TRPM8/A1 independent mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>To date the mechanisms underlying the sensory perception of the DP are not fully understood.</s><s>The most largely accepted theory to explain activation of the pulpal afferents is the hydrodynamic theory, in which tooth stimulation causes fluid movement within dentinal tubules, activating sensory afferents located in or near the dentinal tubules.</s><s>Indeed, it was shown that application of a noxious cold stimulation (0 °C) on teeth induces dentinal tubule fluid movements and neuronal activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> .</s><s>In our experimental condition, the stimulation applied on the tooth was certainly cold enough (Frigi-dent −50 °C out of the can) to induce dentinal tubule fluid movements that would then mechanically activate pulpal sensory afferents activating central pain pathways evidenced by c-Fos upregulation in the trigeminal nucleus.</s><s>However, from the study we cannot exclude the participation of an important cold-detecting neuronal population that does not express TRPM8 and TRPA1.</s><s>In line with our results in sensory neurons innervating the skin and the mucosa, previous studies showed that a significant proportion of sensory neurons are activated by cold stimulation but are insensitive to TRPM8 and TRPA1 agonists <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> .</s><s>The cold sensitive receptors expressed in these neurons have not been fully identified, but could include sodium and potassium channels such as eNaC, TREK1 and TRAAK, which genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade were shown to reduced cold-induced pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Whether a subpopulation of sensory neurons innervating the DP is indeed cold sensitive but not due to TRPA1 and TRPM8 expression has not yet been investigated and further studies are needed to clarify the potential existence of this neuronal population and the involvement of other cold-sensitive receptors in cold-induced tooth pain.</s></p></div>
