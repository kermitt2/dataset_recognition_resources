<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecular genetics</head><p><s>In search of the underlying genetic defect, we performed homozygosity mapping and wholeexome sequencing, followed by Sanger sequencing of patients and family members (see the Online Methods and Supplementary Note for details).</s><s>Homozygosity mapping identified an especially large perfect marker interval of over 50 Mb in family A on chromosome 17; within this interval, family B had two non-adjacent perfect intervals spanning 1.8 Mb and 0.5 Mb.</s><s>The asymptotic logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for these intervals are +4.2 (+1.8 for family A and +2.4 for family B), and peak observed LOD scores, with a more realistic disease haplotype frequency of 0.05, were 3.0 (+1.2 and +1.8).</s><s>There were approximately 36 genes located in the two shared intervals, including SMARCD2.</s></p><p><s>We identified distinct segregating homozygous mutations in SMARCD2 in all three pedigrees (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a-c</ref>).</s><s>Mutations are described by their putative effect on transcript SMARCD2-001 (ENST00000448276; NM_001098426.1).</s><s>Effects on hypothetical transcripts are shown in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</s><s>At the DNA level, the mutations in pedigrees A and C affected splice sites, while the mutation in pedigree B was a duplication of 25 bp, leading to a frameshift and premature termination (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Immunoblot analyses showed an absence of SMARCD2 protein in patient-derived cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref> and Supplementary Data 1).</s><s>To confirm that the SMARCD2 mutations lead to a loss of function, we sequenced reverse-transcribed mRNA from patient-derived cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>) and determined their putatively encoded proteins.</s><s>We then cloned (primers listed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) two isoforms of patient AII.1 (AII.1a:</s><s>p.Ile362Cysfs*3 and AII1b: p.Ser394Argfs*1), one isoform of patient BII.1 (BII.1:</s><s>p.Gln147Glufs*5) and one isoform of patient CII.1 (CII.1:</s><s>p.Arg73Valfs*8).</s><s>FLAG-tagged expression vectors carrying mutated SMARCD2 versions and a red fluorescence protein gene separated by an internal ribosomal entry sequence (IRES.RFP) were transfected into 293T cells, and the encoded proteins were investigated for coimmunoprecipitation with native SWI/SNF core members.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref> (Supplementary Data 2), only the wild-type version of SMARCD2 was able to coprecipitate with SMARCA4 (BRG1), SMARCC2 (BAF170), SMARCC1 (BAF155), and SMARCB1 (BAF47); none of the mutant versions were able to co-precipitate with any of these proteins, suggesting that the mutations constitute loss-of-function alleles.</s></p><p><s>Because all SMARCD2-deficient patients had either been subjected to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell therapy (HSCT) or had died from their disease, primary SMARCD2-deficient HSCs were not available for further experiments.</s><s>To further study the role of SMARCD2 in neutrophil differentiation, we established several in vivo and in vitro models.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>smarcd2 regulates granulopoiesis in zebrafish</head><p><s>As a first model organism, we used zebrafish (Danio rerio), in which smarcd2 (XP_692749.2) is the ortholog of human SMARCD2.</s><s>Using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs), we created Smarcd2-deficient zebrafish in two reporter strains with fluorescent neutrophil granulocytes: Tg(mpx:EGFP) i114 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a-c</ref> and Supplementary Data 3a,b) and Tg(lyz:dsRed) nz50 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</s><s>smarcd2 MOs were designed to block either translation initiation (label ATG) or splicing (labels SB1 and SB2, for MOs targeting splice donor and acceptor sites, respectively) of smarcd2.</s><s>In both fish lines, there was a significant reduction in the number of neutrophil granulocytes in comparison to controls at 72 h post fertilization (h.p.f.) for the ATG and SB1 MOs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</s><s>MO SB2, which failed to disrupt smarcd2 splicing (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>), provided an additional negative control indicating specificity of the on-target smarcd2 MO effect to reduce neutrophil abundance.</s><s>Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in zebrafish, we also created a frameshift mutant smarcd2 allele smarcd2 1/1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>), which also showed reduced granulocyte abundance at 72 h.p.f. in comparison to wild-type controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b,c</ref>).</s><s>There were no marked effects of smarcd2 MO on zebrafish granulocyte morphology (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>There were no qualitative differences in O-dianisidine-stained hemoglobinized erythrocytes and no quantitative differences in numbers of Tg(mpeg1:mCherry) gl25xc264 -marked macrophages and Tg(cd41:EGFP) la2 -marked thrombocytes after smarcd2 MO knockdown (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</s><s>This underlines the lineage-specific effects of smarcd2.</s><s>Collectively, these zebrafish models provide concordant evidence that a requirement for SMARCD2 in neutrophil granulocyte differentiation is evolutionarily conserved.</s></p></div>
