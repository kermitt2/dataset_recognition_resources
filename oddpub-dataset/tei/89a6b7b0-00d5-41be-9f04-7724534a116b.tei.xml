<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening inflammatory syndrome characterized by fever, organomegaly, and pancytopenia.</s><s>The disease is defined by the HLH 2004 criteria established by the Histiocyte Society, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> containing clinical, laboratory, and cytological parameters.</s><s>Inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) lesions, in the presence or absence of systemic features, are another characteristic manifestation of the syndrome.</s><s>The full picture of the condition usually requires aggressive immunosuppressive therapy.</s><s>However, in patients with hereditary defects predisposing to HLH, such as familial HLH (FHL) 2-5, Griscelli syndrome 2 (GS2), x-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) 1 and 2, and Chédiak Higashi syndrome (CHS), this is not sufficient to provide long-term disease control.</s><s>The vast majority of patients thus require an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for eventual cure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The choice of the conditioning regimen is an important factor contributing to the success of HSCT in HLH.</s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> However, RIC is more likely to result in mixed chimerism, which may place the patient at risk of HLH reactivation.</s><s>The reported frequency of mixed chimerism in HLH patients after MAC is approximately 20% and reaches 50% in a study with high proportion of haploidentical donors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref></s><s>RIC results in mixed chimerism in 30% to 75%, depending on donor selection and type of conditioning.</s><s>Mismatched donors and late ("proximal") application of alemtuzumab have been identified as factors that increase the occurrence of mixed chimerism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref></s><s> careful assessment of the risk of reactivation is important because weaning or withdrawal of immune suppression, donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), and stem cell boosts as therapeutic measures to stabilize or increase donor chimerism (DC) can all be associated with adverse events, notably graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).</s><s>The last resort is a second HSCT, which has a number of associated risks.</s><s>In a mouse model of FHL2 (perforin deficiency), DC in the overall hematopoietic and the CD8 1 compartments between 10% to 20% was sufficient to prevent HLH recurrence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref></s><s>However, the minimum DC level required to prevent reactivation of HLH in humans remains unknown.</s></p><p><s>We therefore performed an international retrospective multicenter study to investigate the relationship of DC level and the occurrence of HLH reactivations following HSCT.</s><s>We also correlated functional immunological assays with the DC level to determine whether these studies can help guiding treatment decisions.</s><s>Finally, we analyzed the treatment policies in the participating centers when mixed chimerism occurs.</s><s>The study did not aim at evaluating risk factors for the appearance of mixed chimerism in HLH patients (such as type of conditioning regimen, donor, or GVHD prophylaxis) because this has been addressed in previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref></s><s>e observed that a DC .20%-30%</s><s>was protective beyond the period of post-HSCT immune suppression.</s><s>However, lower DC levels did not necessarily lead to recurrence, even in the long term.</s><s>In the HLH episodes that occurred during the first 6 months, the distinction was not always clear-cut between HLH related to the genetic defect and secondary HLH related to the HSCT with immunosuppressive treatment and consecutive viral infections.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chimerism analysis</head><p><s>Chimerism was assessed according to the standards of the participating center, mostly by variable number tandem repeat analyses, and less frequently by fluorescence in situ hybridization with x and y probes in cases of sexmismatched donors.</s><s>In addition to the overall chimerism (mostly whole blood, less frequently bone marrow), lineage-specific chimerism analyses were performed in some patients after enrichment of CD3 1 and CD56 1 cells.</s><s>The DC and dates were recorded at the following time points: first occurrence of DC below 75%; the lowest DC level; the DC at last follow-up; and the DC when it first reached the final level (610%) (ie, the level at last follow-up or death or second HSCT).</s><s>If applicable, DC was reported at the time of therapeutic interventions (weaning or withdrawal of immune suppression, DLI, stem cell boost, or second HSCT), at recurrence of HLH, and at the time of functional immunological analyses.</s><s>DC after a second HSCT was not evaluated.</s></p></div>

target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> To account for this uncertainty, we separately analyzed HLH events that occurred during and events that occurred after the phase of most profound immune suppression, with a cutoff at 180 days after HSCT.</s><s>HLH episodes before day 180 occurred in 10/18 patients.</s><s>Viral pathogens could be identified in 6 patients of this group, mostly potent HLH triggers such as EBV and CMV.</s><s>DC levels were #10% in 6 patients, 22% in 1 patient, and 63% to 100% in 3 patients.</s><s>The latter included a case of EBV-PTLD, a mild partial flare, and a case in which the diagnosis of CNS-HLH must be considered uncertain.</s><s>We conclude that for patients in this vulnerable phase, low DC is likely to contribute to the development of HLH.</s><s>However, it is difficult to establish a definite DC threshold that can be considered protective against HLH predominantly related to the genetic defect during this phase.</s></p><p><s>In the 8 events after day 180, DC levels were #10% in 4 patients, 10% to 20% in 2 patients, and 20% to 30% in 2 patients.</s><s>The diagnosis of a partial flare at a DC of 28% was questionable in retrospect, because only 2 HLH criteria were fulfilled.</s><s>Reliably diagnosing partial flares is always a challenge, and some degree of uncertainty frequently remains.</s><s>A reactivation occurred in 1 patient when the DC level was steeply declining from 30% before the event toward full autologous reconstitution shortly after onset, rendering the exact DC at the beginning uncertain.</s><s>Of note, a weak viral trigger (norovirus) was found in only 1 event.</s><s>Because none of the pertinent viral triggers is identified in many cases of first presentation of hereditary HLH (except for XLP), this supports the assumption that HLH in this cohort is predominantly attributable to the functional compromise conveyed by low DC levels.</s><s>We conclude that in patients beyond the phase of profound immune suppression, the likelihood of recurrence of HLH is low, at an approximate DC threshold of 20% to 30%.</s><s>This figure is similar to a perforin knock-out mouse

recurrence when DC falls below that level does not appear to be true.</s><s>Fourteen patients without recurrence had low DC #30%, and in 5 patients DC was ,10%, including CD3 1 and CD56 1 compartments for up to 10 years.</s><s>It is noteworthy that in patients with long-term, low-level DC without recurrence, CD3 1 DC was higher than overall DC, whereas no difference was seen in patients at reactivation.</s><s>Given the key role of T cells in HLH pathogenesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> this may indicate that higher CD3 1 DC may be protective in patients with low overall DC.</s><s>It is thus advisable to determine CD3 1 DC in patients with mixed chimerism.</s></p><p><s>The affected gene and the severity of the genetic defect did not strongly influence the likelihood of a recurrence.</s><s>The proportion of HLH onset in infancy was similar in patients with recurrence compared with patients with long-term, low-level DC.</s><s>Yet, none of the patients with systemic or CNS reactivation had a hypomorphic FHL mutation.</s><s>Because of limited numbers, we could not evaluate if a heterozygous carrier status of a related donor compared with wild-type donors and if the results of functional immunological analyses had an influence on the likelihood of recurrence.</s><s>Although a positive correlation of DC and NK cell degranulation in FHL3-5, GS2, and CHS could be shown, DC levels did not consistently predict NK cell cytotoxic capacity.</s><s>This may be because NK cell cytotoxicity is not only permanently reduced in hereditary defects, but transiently in acquired conditions as well.</s></p><p><s>The outcome of patients with a DC nadir #30% was significantly inferior compared with patients in whom DC never fell below that level.</s><s>The hazard ratios of overall and event-free survivals were 3.5 and 4.6, respectively, with an event being defined as HLH recurrence, second HSCT, or death.</s><s>This underscores the need to optimize HSCT to prevent
