receptors of these cells are poorly understood.</s></p><p><s>Here we present a crystal structure of CD1c determined at 2.4 Å revealing an extended ligand binding potential of the antigen groove and a substantially different conformation compared with known CD1c structures.</s><s>Computational simulations exploring different occupancy states of the groove reenacted these different CD1c conformations and suggested cholesteryl esters (CE) and acylated steryl glycosides (ASG) as new ligand classes for CD1c.</s><s>Confirming this, we show that binding of CE and ASG to CD1c enables the binding of human CD1c self-reactive T-cell receptors.</s><s>Hence, human CD1c adopts different conformations dependent on ligand occupancy of its groove, with CE and ASG stabilizing CD1c conformations that provide a footprint for binding of CD1c self-reactive T-cell receptors.</s></p><p><s>CD1 | lipid antigen | antigen presentation | T cell | cholesteryl ester C luster of differentiation 1 (CD1) proteins are a family of MHC class I-like glycoproteins that present lipid antigens to T cells.</s><s>CD1 restricted T cells are abundant in humans and play important roles in host defense and immune regulation.</s><s>Human CD1 proteins comprise five CD1 isoforms, CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e, which exhibit different intracellular trafficking behaviors and ligand binding preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Structurally, the main differences between these CD1 isoforms lie in the architecture of their lipophilic ligand binding grooves.</s><s>Whereas all CD1 isoforms share a highly conserved A′ channel (or pocket) for binding C18-C26 acyl chains, specialization is provided by further connecting channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(2)</ref><ref

target="#b13">(7)</ref>.</s><s>In CD1a, the A′ channel is "fused" to a wide and shallow F′ channel, enabling binding of lipopeptides such as mycobacterial didehydroxymycobactin (DDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(8)</ref>.</s><s>CD1b features a unique T′ tunnel that connects A′ and F′, thereby forming a "superchannel" for accommodating very long acyl chains (e.g., mycobacterial mycolates) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">4)</ref>.</s><s>CD1d, the only isoform also conserved in rodents, exhibits a twobranched ligand binding groove with two linear channels A′ and F′ connected near the main portal into the groove, known as the F′ portal.</s><s>A similar two-branched arrangement of A′ and F′ is seen in CD1e, the only CD1 isoform not expressed on the cell surface.</s><s>Compared with CD1d, CD1a, and CD1b, the portal into the groove in CD1e is widely exposed, consistent with its known role in lipid transfer processes inside lysosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(6)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>CD1c presents foreign- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">10)</ref> as well as self-lipid antigens to T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(11)</ref>.</s><s>Two recent crystal structures of human CD1c revealed a two-branched design similar to that of CD1d and CD1e, with two channels A′ and F′ connecting near the groove portal.</s><s>In these structures, a mycobacterial phosphomycoketide (PM) or mannosyl-β1-phosphomycoketide (MPM) occupied the A′ channel, whereas an undefined short ligand was present in the F′ channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">12)</ref>.</s><s>The spatial arrangement of these ligands in the CD1c groove was very similar to and virtually overlapping in 3D comparisons with that of alpha-galactosylceramide (αGC) in human CD1d (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1 A and B</ref>).</s><s>Because CD1c and CD1d are known to traffic to the same intracellular compartments for antigen sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(13)</ref>, these CD1c-PM and CD1c-MPM structures did not readily explain how CD1c and CD1d could functionally differentiate.</s><s>Furthermore, the F′ channel in both CD1c-PM and CD1c-MPM was widely open to solvent, which was strikingly different from known structures of CD1a, CD1b, and CD1d and reminiscent of CD1e <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">12)</ref>.</s><s>Based on these facts we hypothesized that human CD1c might undergo substantial conformational transformations Significance T cells autoreactive to cluster of differentiation 1c (CD1c) are abundant in human blood but lipid antigens recognized by these T cells remained poorly understood.</s><s>A new 2.4-Å structure of CD1c and computational simulations thereof indicated substantial conformational plasticity of CD1c with ligandinduced formation of an F′ roof and G′ portal, as well as the potential of CD1c to present acylated sterols.</s><s>Confirming these predictions we demonstrated CD1c loading and biophysical interaction of CD1c-lipid complexes with self-reactive human T-cell receptors for two lipid classes: cholesteryl esters similar to those accumulating in foamy macrophages (e.g., in atherosclerosis) and acylated steryl glycosides from Borrelia burgdorferi.</s><s>These findings differentiate CD1c from other CD1 isoforms and open up new avenues for research into the role of CD1c in human immunity.</s></p><p><s>in the F′ channel region upon binding of more optimal ligands, with relevance for T-cell receptor binding.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Structural Features of Human CD1c with Extended-Ligand Binding and Closure of the F′ Channel Roof.</s><s>Based on our experience with human CD1b and CD1d (2, 3), we first attempted to refold the extracellular α1-α3 domains of human CD1c ("wild-type CD1c," CD1c wt ) together with β2m, using detergents as surrogate ligands.</s><s>Although CD1c wt /β2m complexes of correct size and stoichiometric composition could be purified, these complexes rapidly disintegrated after buffer exchange at 4 °C.</s><s>This suggested an unstable quaternary conformation of the complex with loss of the noncovalent association between CD1c wt and β2m.</s><s>Thus, we decided to use a strategy similar to that used by Scharf et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(7)</ref>, by grafting the α3 domain of human CD1b onto the antigen binding α1-α2 domain of human CD1c (CD1c bα3 ).</s><s>Using CD1c bα3 instead of CD1c wt , with otherwise identical refolding conditions as before, resulted in stable soluble CD1c bα3 /β2m complexes that ultimately yielded diffracting protein crystals.</s><s>The structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined with the use of data to 2.4 Å (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The structure shows the typical MHC class I-like domain arrangement that is common to all known CD1/β2m complexes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Clear electron density is seen for three hydrocarbon chain spacer ligands (SL) filling the A′ and F′ channels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>We refer to this new ligand occupied state as CD1c-SL.</s><s>Similar to other known CD1/ligand structures, including CD1c-PM and CD1c-MPM, a single C18 stearic acid ligand saturates the A′ channel of CD1c-SL and protrudes slightly into the F′ portal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In striking difference from previous CD1/ligand structures, including CD1c-PM and CD1c-MPM, the F′ channel of CD1c-SL is occupied by two C12 SL, likely corresponding to lauric acids present in the refolding mixture, that are stacked in a parallel manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>These differences in ligand saturation between the previously solved CD1c structures and CD1c-SL are paralleled by radical differences in the conformation of the F′ channel.</s><s>In contrast to either CD1c-PM or CD1c-MPM, the F′ channel in CD1c-SL is shielded from solvent by an F′ channel roof (F′

target="#b18">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">19)</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, it had remained unclear whether and how ligands bound to the F′ channel of CD1c could influence T-cell receptor binding.</s><s>In CD1c-PM and CD1c-MPM, a small undefined ligand was observed in the F′ channel.</s><s>In striking difference to other known antigen-presenting CD1 proteins, the F′ channel in these structures showed a widely open conformation, thus potentially exposing its contents to solvent <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(12)</ref>.</s><s>In stark contrast, two lauric acid molecules, stacked on top of each other, fill the F′ channel in the new CD1c structure presented here, CD1c-SL, where tethering interactions between the two alpha-helices provide for a roof over the F′ channel, thereby shielding the bound ligands from solvent.</s><s>Based on its position above the F' channel, this new roof structure in CD1c-SL is called the F′ roof.</s><s>Below the F′ roof, a well-defined large portal, here proposed to be called the G′ portal, provides an open conduit from the exterior into the F′ channel of CD1c-SL <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(20)</ref>.</s><s>The clear conformational differences between CD1c-SL and the previous CD1c structures suggested that the F′ channel of CD1c behaves similarly to a venus flytrap, dramatically adapting its conformation with closure of the roof over the channel in response to a sufficient degree of ligand occupancy.</s><s>The results of our MD simulations of CD1c-SL supported this model.</s><s>In these MD simulations, ligand evacuation from the F′ channel rapidly induced a seamless transition from a closed F′ roof conformation, as seen in CD1c-SL, to an open F′ groove conformation, as seen in CD1c-PM or CD1c-MPM.</s><s>Together, these findings identify an F′ roof and G′ portal in CD1c-SL as new structural features of the CD1 protein family <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(20)</ref>.</s><s>Prompted by the observed extended-ligand

extend these findings to other ASG and to CE, and to assess whether ASG and CE support CD1c recognition by the CD1c self-reactive NM4-TCR we devised a novel cell-free, MACSi bead-aided, flow cytometry-based assay.</s><s>Starting from CD1c-SL-coated MACSi beads we found that NM4-TCR tetramer binding to these beads was lost upon washing with the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 but could be
