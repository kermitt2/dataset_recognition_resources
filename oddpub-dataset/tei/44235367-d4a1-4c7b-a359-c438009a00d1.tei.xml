<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Due to the capability of working under all weather and all time conditions, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important tool in ocean surveillance.</s><s>Because of the great significance of ship monitoring in shipping management and military applications, many research works focusing on ship targets have been carried out, such as ship detection, discrimination, and recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Among these studies, ship segmentation is a fundamental and meaningful work: The accurate segmentation can facilitate subsequent interpretations.</s><s>On the one hand, segmenting the ship from the background is necessary for extracting target features that are often used in discrimination and classification; on the other hand, the refined segmentation is the pre-processing of the training set in some deep learning-based recognition algorithms, because eliminating the interference of background clutters contributes to classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Though widely studied, object segmentation in SAR images still remains challenging largely due to the two facts.</s><s>Firstly, the multiplicative speckle noise caused by SAR systems is a common problem.</s><s>The speckle noise may sharply reduce the image quality and greatly influence image interpretations.</s><s>Many efforts have been devoted to overcoming the speckle effect.</s><s>Efficient stochastic models of speckle noise, focusing on the multiplicative nature, have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Suitable distributions that fit SAR images (e.g., K, Gamma, and G 0 distributions) are employed to improve the segmentation performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>Secondly, the variations of backscattering coefficients also brings much trouble to image segmentation.</s><s>By contrast, the research in this area is still limited.</s><s>As is known, the grayscale of a pixel in the SAR image represents the proportion of microwave backscattered from the corresponding region.</s><s>The intensity values on both sides of the contour are supposed to be homogeneous respectively in many segmentation algorithms.</s><s>However, this proposition may have some differences in ship segmentation.</s><s>This is because some specific structures on ships may lead to obvious intensity variations, especially in high resolution SAR images.</s><s>With the development of the imaging technology, more details can be displayed in images.</s><s>Therefore, ships appear to have various texture characteristics, instead of bright objects, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Since some dark regions embedded in the ship are similar to the background clutters, it is difficult to extract the ship completely and precisely by the traditional algorithms.</s><s>The active contour model (ACM) is a popular tool for image segmentation, due to the ability to locate the object outline accurately.</s><s>It is a framework for guiding contours toward the boundary of the object by minimizing the energy functional.</s><s>In some early works, ACMs were mainly based on edge information, such as the snake and the geodesic active contour (GAC) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>They utilize edge detectors and guide the contour towards sharp gradients of pixel intensity.</s><s>However, this kind of ACM is sensitive to noise.</s><s>To handle the problem, region-based ACMs have been presented, like Chan-Vese (CV), region-scalable fitting (RSF), and local and global intensity fitting (LGIF) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>They have better noise robustness, since regional information is introduced into the contour evolution.</s><s>To improve the performance, Wang et al. modified the local region fitting function of the RSF model incorporating a Gaussian distribution and proposed the local Gaussian distribution fitting (LGDF) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Based on this work, Thieu et al. incorporated the local and global information into a fuzzy energy function and proposed the local and global fuzzy Gaussian distribution (LGFGD) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which achieved success in medical image segmentation.</s><s>Besides, Some hybrid ACMs were proposed, which absorbed the advantages of those two kinds <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>They have been demonstrated to have good performance in many applications.</s><s>Variational ACMs have also been widely applied in SAR image segmentation.</s><s>Most of them are based on the level set due to the high efficiency of contour evolution and the ability to handle the topological change <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As an important feature of SAR images, the statistical property is often used to improve the robustness of ACMs.</s><s>For example, Shuai et al. designed a new energy functional to search for a stationary global minimum, in which the homogeneous regions were modeled by a Gamma distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Feng et al. developed a variational multiphase segmentation framework for SAR images, and the G 0 statistical model was introduced into the regional term of the energy functional to improve the performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Ayed et al. proposed a level set segmentation method, which measured the conformity of region data to a Weibull distribution representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Tu et al. combined the modified CV (MCV) model and RSF model by replacing the Euclidean distance by a new ratio distance defined with respect to the probability density functions of regions in SAR images.</s><s>They integrated the energy functional with Chan's global minimization active contour framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and proposed global minimization of the modified LGIF (GMLGIF) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>It can be seen that most of these methods are based on the hypothesis that the intensities of targets and the background are homogeneous or follow the same distribution.</s><s>As we discussed previously, however, this may not be true for ship segmentation in SAR images.</s><s>That is why the segmentation performance is limited.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we propose a variational nonlocal ACM for ship segmentation in SAR images.</s><s>Different from the preceding works, the level set is implemented by the nonlocal comparison of patches.</s><s>The energy functional consists of two terms: the nonlocal energy term, defined by pairwise interaction, measuring the dissimilarity of patches inside and outside the segmented region, and the regularization term for smooth boundaries.</s><s>Only the local homogeneity of image features is utilized in the procedure of the nonlocal patch comparison; hence, this method can capture the regions with spatially-varying features.</s><s>Inspired by Tu's idea, we introduce the ratio distance into the pairwise interaction and rewrite the nonlocal energy in order to make the method applicable for SAR images.</s><s>The experiments based on real SAR images show that the proposed method can precisely extract ship targets from the background.</s></p><p><s>Contributions: This paper proposes an improved segmentation strategy for ship targets in order to overcome the problems of speckle noise and intensity variations.</s><s>The main contribution of our study can be summarized as follows.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Discussion of Parameters</head><p><s>The proposed method contains some parameters, such as τ, σ, and λ, which were empirically set in the given experiments.</s><s>λ is the weight adjusting the regularity of the region boundary, often used in many other ACMs.</s><s>In this section, we analyze the influence of the other two parameters, related to the patch comparison of the nonlocal processing.</s></p><p><s>Considering that τ is the half patch size and σ is the scale of the Gaussian kernel, we suppose that these two parameters are independent from each other.</s><s>Therefore, the control variate method was adopted in parameter analysis.</s><s>In other words, we changed one parameter and fixed the other one at a time.</s><s>The experiments were implemented on the first three chips in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. Firstly, we set τ = 3 and the range of σ from 10-30.</s><s>The corresponding MADs and DMs of the segmentation results with various values of σ are shown in the top row of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>.</s><s>It can be seen that σ, in the range from 12-20, was appropriate for these images.</s><s>When σ was beyond this range, the segmentation performance degraded.</s><s>σ is the scale of the Gaussian kernel, and it controls the weight of patch comparison according to the Euclidean distance between patches.</s><s>Too small of a σ would greatly weaken the influence of the interaction between nonadjacent patches.</s><s>As a result, the model cannot reach the global optimal segmentation.</s><s>However, if σ becomes too large, the interaction between patches of different categories would lead to segmentation error.</s><s>Generally speaking, an image made of an almost constant pattern demands a large σ.</s><s>By contrast, fast feature variations requires a small one.</s></p><p><s>Secondly, we fixed σ = 15 and range of τ from 1-10 to test the influence of τ on segmentation.</s><s>The quantitative evaluations are shown in the bottom row of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>.</s><s>The half patch size τ directly influences the local statistical description of a pixel.</s><s>If a patch is too small, it is hard to estimate its local statistics.</s><s>Otherwise, too big of a patch is no longer locally homogeneous, and it reduces the segmentation accuracy.</s><s>When τ was set from 2-5, the segmentation kept relatively robust.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p><s>Aiming at the problems of the multiplicative noise and variations of backscattering coefficients, we proposed an improved nonlocal ACM for ship segmentation in SAR images.</s><s>A new nonlocal energy, incorporating the distribution metric of a ratio distance, was defined to optimize regions with spatially-varying features.</s><s>The integral histogram was utilized in pairwise interactions to reduce the computational cost.</s><s>The advantages of the proposed method were verified by several rounds of experiments on the real SAR images from different sensors.</s><s>The results demonstrated that the proposed method was able to segment ship targets from speckled SAR images with intensity variations.</s><s>Compared with some existing algorithms, the proposed method achieved obvious improvement in refined segmentation.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>The intensity variations of ships in SAR images.</s><s>(a) Oil tanker; (b) carrier.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,97.77,306.90,82.68,82.68" type="bitmap" /></figure>
