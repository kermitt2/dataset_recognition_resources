<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Participants</head><p><s>Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data were used from 30 487 women participating in 18 population-or community-based studies in Europe, North America, or Australia.</s><s>The birth weight of 1 child per mother was included (see eTable 1 for full details of participant characteristics and eTable 2 for genotyping information, both in the Supplement).</s><s>Birth weight was measured by trained study personnel (n = 2 studies), from medical records (n = 10 studies), or from maternal report (n = 6 studies).</s><s>The offspring years of birth were from 1929 to 2013.</s><s>Multiple births, stillbirths, congenital anomalies, births before 37 weeks' gestation, and individuals of non-European ancestry were excluded.</s><s>Informed consent was obtained from all par-ticipants, and study protocols were approved by the local, regional, or institutional ethics committees.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection of Maternal Obesity-Related Traits and SNPs</head><p><s>In addition to BMI, traits were selected that are associated with maternal obesity and may affect fetal growth through the intrauterine environment.</s><s>Their effects were modeled in the directions hypothesized by their relationships to maternal BMI (Box 1).</s></p><p><s>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms known to be robustly associated (P &lt; 5 × 10 −8 ) with BMI and each obesity-related trait were selected.</s><s>Full details of the selected SNPs are provided in eTable 3 in the Supplement.</s><s>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes were used to represent maternal glycemia.</s><s>The type 2 diabetes SNPs were considered to represent exposure to maternal diabetes in pregnancy, including gestational diabetes, given overlap between type 2 and gestational diabetes' genetic susceptibility variants. <ref type="bibr">15</ref></s><s>For blood pressure, SNPs were selected that are primarily associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP), although all also show strong evidence of association with diastolic blood pressure.</s><s>For vitamin D status, 2 SNPs with hypothesized roles in vitamin D synthesis were used to represent 25(OH)D levels (an indicator of overall vitamin D status), as previously recommended. <ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">17</ref></s><s>Further details of SNP selection are provided in the eMethods in the Supplement.</s></p><p><s>A weighted genetic score was calculated for each maternal trait (see eMethods in the Supplement for full details).</s><s>Very few of the selected SNPs have been tested in pregnancy.</s><s>Genetic scores were validated by confirming that each was associated with its respective maternal trait, measured during pregnancy (with the exception of BMI, for which the prepregnancy value was used).</s><s>Maternal prepregnancy BMI was available from registry data (n = 2 studies) or calculated from selfreported weight and height (n = 3 studies).</s><s>In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) study, the self-report was validated with a clinic measure. <ref type="bibr">18</ref></s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maternal BMI, Birth Weight, and Fasting Glucose</head><p><s>To estimate how much of the association between maternal BMI and birth weight might be mediated by fasting glucose, available data were used first to estimate the approximate causal relationship between a 1-SD higher maternal BMI (≈4 points) and (1) fasting glucose and (2) SBP.</s><s>Then, using each of those estimates, the results of the mendelian randomization analyses were rescaled to represent the effects of fasting glucose and SBP that could be directly compared with the causal relationship between a 1-SD higher maternal BMI and birth weight (see eMethods in the Supplement for a detailed description of the method).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correcting for Direct Fetal Genotype Effects</head><p><s>Genotypes of maternal-fetal pairs were available in up to 8 studies (total for analysis, 11 493).</s><s>Analyses were repeated including the fetal genotype at each SNP in the model to correct for potential confounding caused by direct effects of the fetal genotype.</s><s>A 2-sided P value &lt;.05 was considered to provide evidence against the null hypothesis.</s><s>Statistical software used for data analysis within each individual study is detailed in eTable 2 in the Supplement.</s><s>All meta-analyses were performed using Stata v.13 (StataCorp).</s><s>If a maternal trait causally influences offspring birth weight, then a risk score of genetic variants associated with that trait will also be associated with birth weight.</s><s>Because genotype is determined at conception, it should not be associated with factors that normally confound the association between maternal traits and birth weight (eg, socioeconomic status).</s><s>Estimates of the genetic score-maternal phenotype association (w) and the genetic score-birth weight association (x) may be used to estimate the association between the maternal trait variation that is due to genetic score and birth weight (y = x/w), which is expected to be free from confounding.</s><s>If the estimated causal relationship, y, is different from the observational association between the measured maternal phenotype and birth weight, this would suggest that the observational association is confounded (assuming that the assumptions of the mendelian randomization analyses are valid). <ref type="bibr">14</ref></s><s>The dashed line connecting maternal trait with fetal growth indicates that the causal nature of the association is uncertain.</s><s>It is important to adjust for possible direct effects of fetal genotype (z).</s><s>Body mass index is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; ponderal index of neonatal leanness, calculated as birth weight in kilograms divided by birth length in meters cubed.</s></p></div>

7.2 mg/dL was associated with a 114 g (95% CI, 80-147 g) higher birth weight, whereas genetically higher maternal SBP of 10 mm Hg was associated with a −208 g (95% CI, −394 to −21 g) lower birth weight.</s><s>These results provide evidence that genetically elevated maternal glucose and SBP may have directionally opposite causal associations with birth weight.</s><s>The estimated associations between these maternal traits and birth weight (either increased or reduced) are substantial and of clinical importance.</s><s>They support efforts to maintain healthy gestational glucose and blood

fasting glucose.</s><s>There was no evidence of association of offspring brith weight with a genetic score for maternal triglycerides, which have also been hypothesized to be important contributors to higher birth weight in overweight or obese women.</s><s>Other lipids, or specific subclasses of triglycerides, might be important but require further study.</s><s>These results provide genetic evidence of a potentially causal association between maternal glycemia and birth weight and ponderal index, even in women with no preexisting or gestational diabetes, which is consistent with published observational data. 5</s><s>A possible explanation for this finding is that women with a higher genetic score for type 2 diabetes have relatively higher glucose levels in pregnancy, as a result of inadequate beta-cell compensation in response to gestational insulin resistance, <ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">20</ref> leading to increased placental glucose transfer and fetal insulin secretion, 21 and consequently higher birth weight.</s><s>These data did not support a causal association between maternal triglyceride, HDL-C or adiponectin levels and birth weight or ponderal index.</s><s>The genetic associations between maternal triglycerides and adiponectin and birth weight were null, in contrast to the observational associations, suggesting that the observational associations seen herein, and in other published studies, 8,9,12 are confounded.</s></p><p><s>The mendelian randomization analysis showed that the positive observational association between SBP and birth weight is confounded, most likely by BMI, which is both an important risk factor for higher SBP in pregnancy and positively associated with birth weight. <ref type="bibr"

randomization approach: since genotypes are determined at conception, such confounding is avoided.</s></p><p><s>There are some limitations to this study.</s><s>Despite attempts to maximize specificity of the genetic scores, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the selected genetic variants act on more than one maternal trait.</s><s>Although all available information was used, there was

limited for some maternal traits (see eMethods and eTable 10 in Supplement for power calculations).</s><s>The total sample provided more than 99% power to detect associations at P &lt; .05 between birth weight and genetic scores such as fasting glucose and systolic blood pressure that explain at least 0.1% variance in birth weight.</s><s>However, larger samples (&gt;80 000) will be needed to confidently detect or rule out the association with vitamin D status suggested by our data, or smaller positive or negative causal associations between maternal triglycerides, HDL-C or adiponectin and birth weight.</s></p><p><s>Although adjusting for the fetal genetic scores was necessary to separate maternal effects from the direct effects of genetic variants in the fetus, this could introduce bias via association with paternal genotypes.</s><s>Assortative mating for BMI could additionally result in a correlation between maternal and paternal genotypes, leading to similar bias.</s><s>However, a father's genetic score would only confound the mendelian randomization estimates if the father's phenotype were related to birth weight, and we found only very weak associations of fathers BMI and related traits with offspring birth weight (eTable 11 in Supplement).</s><s>Another potential bias could be induced by the use of the genetic score for SBP, which was derived from a genome-wide association study of blood pressure conditional on BMI.</s><s>Because BMI is also associated with birth weight, this could bias the results.</s><s>However, similar results were obtained using an alternative genetic score that was unadjusted for BMI (eMethods).</s></p><p><s>In mendelian randomization analysis, a weak statistical association between a genetic score and a maternal trait (due to low variance explained or small sample size) has the potential to cause weak instrument bias toward the observational results. <ref type="bibr">29</ref></s><s>The proportions of maternal trait variance explained by the genetic scores are modest in our study (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>However, the large overall sample size ensured that the possible causal
