<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and treatment</head><p><s>The ENEST1st was a multicenter, single-arm study evaluating nilotinib at 300 mg twice daily (bid) in newly diagnosed and previously untreated patients.</s><s>ENEST1st was registered in the <ref type="bibr">EU Clinical Trials Registry (2009-017775-19) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01061177)</ref>.</s><s>In this subanalysis, the patients were stratified to four subgroups according to age at the time of study entry.</s><s>The 4 groups that were defined for the purpose of this study were young patients (18-39 years), middle-aged patients (40-59 years), elderly patients (60-74 years), and old patients (≥75 years).</s><s>The primary end point was the rate of MR 4 at 18 months from the initiation of nilotinib.</s><s>The secondary end points included rates of MR 4 and MR 4.5 at various time points, OS, and PFS.</s><s>Safety was evaluated throughout the study, and National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event (AE) reporting was used to report AEs.</s><s>All patients were treated with an initial dose of nilotinib 300 mg bid for up to 24 months.</s><s>Dose escalation was not allowed beyond 300 mg bid of nilotinib.</s><s>Dose reductions were permitted for grade 3 or 4 hematologic AEs related to white blood cells or platelets and for clinically significant nonhematological AEs of severity greater than grade 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p><s>The intention-to-treat (ITT) population and the safety sets consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and was used for demographics, baseline characteristics, efficacy analyses, and safety.</s><s>For the evaluation of the molecular response, only those patients in the ITT population with typical BCR-ABL1 transcripts at screening, i.e., b3a2 and/or b2a2, were considered.</s><s>For calculation of response rates "at" a designated time point, patients were considered responders only if an assessment at that time point showed achievement of the response.</s><s>Response rates "by" a designated time point were calculated as cumulative response rates, counting all patients with a response detected at or before the specified time point as responders.</s><s>All response rates were calculated as raw proportions.</s><s>Rates of freedom from progression to AP/BC on treatment and OS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates according to ITT principles.</s></p></div>
