<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The induction of an adaptive immune response requires the interaction of several lymphoid and myeloid cell types.</s><s>For the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), initial activation of naive CD8 + T cells occurs via antigen-presenting cells (APC) that engage the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) and other stimulatory surface receptors of these lymphocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Curtsinger and Mescher, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The critical MHCI molecules involved in TCR recognition by CD8 + T cells can be loaded with antigenic determinants by a direct antigen-presentation pathway involving cytosolic proteins or by a cross-presentation pathway, which is fueled by extracellular proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kurts et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The latter is believed to play an essential role for pathogens that do not directly infect professional APC.</s></p><p><s>A second conventional T cell, the CD4 + helper T cell, is activated via antigen-presenting MHCII molecules.</s><s>In distinction to the ligands involved in activation of CD8 + T cells, antigenic peptides presented by MHCII molecules are typically derived from extracellular proteins or intracellular proteins that are recycled from the cell surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Germain, 1994)</ref>.</s><s>These CD4 + T cells provide crucial soluble and membrane-associated signals to antigen-specific B lymphocytes, leading to effective adaptive humoral immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Crotty, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>As with B cells and humoral responses, CD4 + T cells also provide molecular ''help'' to CTL, optimizing cellular immune responses by enhancing CD8 + T cell clonal expansion, differentiation, and survival <ref type="bibr">(Castellino and Germain, 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although the functional parallel is clear, a conceptual problem in comparing CD4 + T cell help for humoral versus cellular responses in mouse models is that the interaction between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells cannot be direct, based on TCR engagement, as mouse CD8 + T cells do not express the necessary MHCII molecules to provide ligands for the CD4 + T cell TCR.</s><s>This paradox was resolved by experiments showing that dendritic cells (DCs) serve as a platform to mediate communication between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mitchison and O'Malley, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ridge et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Both T cell subsets must interact with the same DC in an antigen-and TCR-dependent manner, meaning that the ''platform'' DC must present antigen to CD4 + and CD8 + T cells via both the MHCII and MHCI pathways, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bennett et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cassell and Forman, 1988)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Given that naive lymphocytes specific for a given foreign antigen are rare, it has been argued that the likelihood of a (simultaneous, random) three-cell encounter is too low to be effective at driving the responses in question <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bevan, 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This argument has been weakened by experiments showing that (1) a DC that had interacted with a CD4 + T cell could help a CD8 + T cell even after the CD4 + T cell was removed, removing the need for contemporaneous three-cell clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ridge et al., 1998)</ref> and (2) DC-CD4 + T cell interactions lead to the production of the chemokines CCL3/4 that attract CD8 + T cells via CCR5 to the licensed DC optimizing rare cell contacts <ref type="bibr">(Castellino et al., 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The same intravital imaging methods that revealed such chemokine-mediated guidance also showed that, upon encounter with antigen-laden DCs, T cells arrest and initiate long-term interactions lasting for several hours (16-20 hr) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bousso and Robey, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Miller et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Stoll et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>This means that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells would be substantially delayed in finding a common DC even with chemokine guidance.</s><s>Furthermore, the past decade has seen an increasingly detailed parsing of dendritic cells into distinct subsets with specific localizations within secondary lymphoid tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gerner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kissenpfennig et al., 2005)</ref>, as well as the emergence of strong evidence for preferential presentation of antigen via MHCI and MHCII by different DC types <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(den Haan et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dudziak et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schnorrer et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Together, the dynamic considerations and the complexity of DC biology raise the crucial issue of when, where, and on which DC do CD4 + and CD8 + T cells become activated and communicate.</s></p><p><s>In light of these unresolved questions, the present study aimed to elucidate the spatial and temporal events that occur during CD4 + T cell augmentation of CD8 + T cells responses (''help'') and to reveal the location and identity of the DC subset(s) that serve(s) as the communication platform for CD4 + and CD8 + T cells.</s><s>Surprisingly, we found that early post-infection, antigen-specific activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells is spatially separated and mediated via non-infected and infected DC, respectively.</s><s>XCR1 + (CD8a + ) DCs, which have been described to play a central role in CD8 + T cell priming, appeared to be dispensable for this initial activation of CD8 + T cells.</s><s>After the triggering of both T cell subsets, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells translocated to a specific area in the paracortex, where they interacted with a third, non-infected XCR1 + DCs population, defining the platform for delivery of help.</s><s>These findings delineate the complex choreography of cellular interactions underlying effective cell-mediated anti-viral responses with parallels to the spatiotemporal events involved in delivery of CD4 + T cell help during humoral immune responses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Direct Priming of CD8 + T Cells Does Not Require XCR1 + DC To understand how CD8 + T cells and CD4 + T cells interact with DCs during the induction of robust cell-mediated immune responses, we used a model system of vaccinia virus (VV) infection that supports both direct and cross-presentation pathways and elicits a CD4 + help-dependent CD8 + T cell response <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Norbury et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wiesel et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>To allow for a timeresolved analysis of the cellular events, we initially carried out our experiments with the replication-deficient variant MVA (modified vaccinia virus Ankara).</s><s>This attenuated virus produces a single round of infection with full expression of early and late viral antigens <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Drexler et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>4 hr after intravenous (i.v.) infection of mice with MVA-GFP, we could detect infected DCs based on GFP expression.</s><s>Phenotypic analysis of infected DCs revealed a comparable infection rate among CD8a + and CD11b + DCs in the spleen (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>After infection with a recombinant virus that also expresses the ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL determinant (MVA-NP-S-GFP), the infected DCs also presented virally expressed antigens via MHCI as quantified by antibody staining with clone 25.D1, which recognizes SIINFEKL bound to the mouse MHCI molecule H-2Kb.</s><s>To test whether such directly infected DC could drive CD8 + T cell proliferation, we infected Kbm1 animals (Kbm1 is a mutant Kb unable to bind SIINFEKL) with MVA-OVA and MVA-OVA-Kb, respectively.</s><s>In this experimental set-up, only MVA-OVA-Kb-infected DCs were able to present antigen and promote proliferation of OT-I cells (CD8 + ovalbumin-specific, TCR transgenic T cells), whereas non-infected or MVA-OVA-infected DC were unable to stimulate OT-I cell proliferation in culture (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>This demonstrates that directly infected DCs present viral antigens and induce proliferation of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells ex vivo.</s><s>In vivo, we could detect direct interactions between MVA-OVA-GFP-infected DCs and transferred OT-I lymphocytes shortly after infection using intravital two-photon microscopy (IVM) and analysis of stained lymph node (LN) sections (Movie S1 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Arrested T cells were typically seen at the subcapsular sinus (SCS) and formed clusters in the interfollicular area and the cortical ridge as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hickman et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kastenmu ¨ller et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Because both DC and macrophages populate the area in which we see clusters of OT-I cells early after infection, we depleted macrophages using clodronate liposomes or used additional DC-specific reporter animals (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A-S1C</ref>) and analyzed clusters shortly after MVA-OVA-GFP infection.</s><s>These data also indicated that DCs are the predominant cellular targets of early antigen recognition by the OT-I cells.</s></p><p><s>To elucidate whether different infected DC subsets have a differential capacity to stimulate OT-I cells, we infected mice i.v., sorted splenic CD11b + or CD8a + DCs 8 hr later, and co-cultured the sorted cells with CFSE-labeled OT-I cells.</s><s>At 72 hr post-coculture, we consistently observed similar proliferation of OT-I cells after co-incubation with either DC subset (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D and  S1D</ref>).</s><s>CD8a + DCs substantially overlap with the XCR1 + DC subpopulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Becker et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, to further test whether CD8a + DCs are required for activation of OT-I cells in vivo, we transferred OT-I cells into wild-type (WT) or XCR1-DTR animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Yamazaki et al., 2013)</ref>, treated them with Diphtheria toxin (DTX) to deplete the XCR1 + DCs, infected the animals with MVA-OVA in the footpad (f.p.), and then analyzed the expression of the early activation markers CD69 and CD25 on OT-I cells in the draining lymph node (dLN) 12 hr later.</s><s>We found that the early activation of OT-I cells was unaltered in the absence of XCR1 + DCs (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E and 1F</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, we found a small but consistent reduction in the early activation of OT-II cells (CD4 + ) also specific for OVA but presented by MHCII molecules <ref type="bibr">(Figures 1E and 1F)</ref>.</s><s>In summary, we conclude that MVA infects various DC subsets in vivo that express and present antigens to CD8 + T cells leading to activation and T cell proliferation.</s><s>For this initial activation, XCR1 + (CD8a + )-expressing DCs appear to be dispensable.</s></p><p><s>Early Activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T Cells Occurs on Spatially Distinct DCs Having established that antigen-specific CD8 + T cells are initially activated by infected DCs, we wished to clarify whether CD4 + T cells can provide cognate help via such infected, CD8 + T cell-engaged DCs.</s><s>To this end, we transferred OT-I and OT-II cells into mice, infected the animals with MVA-OVA, and  observed the migratory behavior of the transferred T cells in situ using IVM.</s></p><p><s>As expected, we could readily detect arrested OT-I cells clustering around infected DCs.</s><s>Surprisingly, however, OT-II cells did not co-arrest with their CD8 + T cell counterparts (Movie S2 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Instead, they migrated similarly to polyclonal CD4 + control T cells at around 10 mm/min (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Later after infection (8-12 hr), we were unable to detect OT-I/OT-II co-clusters using IVM (data not shown), although kinetic experiments with isolated cells recovered from these animals revealed that the majority of the OT-II cells were activated (CD69 hi ) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>) and therefore were likely to have engaged antigen-rich APC by this time point.</s><s>These findings suggested that OT-II cells might be activated in deeper areas of the LN that are not typically visualized using IVM.</s><s>Therefore, we analyzed frozen LN sections to identify the location OT-I and OT-II cell co-clusters.</s><s>In line with our IVM data, we found that OT-II cells did not accumulate and cluster in the SCS area in contrast to OT-I cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>), which were found in proximity to MVA-infected (GFP-expressing) cells.</s><s>OT-II cells did not cocluster substantially with OT-I, showing only random colocalization with OT-I at frequencies similar to OVA antigen-unspecific polyclonal CD4+ T cells <ref type="bibr">(Figures S2A and S2B)</ref>.</s><s>To further assess this spatial separation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells during initial antigen-dependent priming after viral infection, we analyzed spleen sections at similar time points.</s><s>(legend continued on next page)</s></p><p><s>Again, we found a segregation of antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells.</s><s>OT-I cells were localized at the marginal zone in proximity to infected APC <ref type="bibr">(Figures S2C and S2D)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, OT-II cells remained in the white pulp, where they clustered and were activated by non-infected (GFP-negative) APC (Figures <ref type="table">S2C and S2D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine whether the segregation of OT-I and OT-II cells during activation is a phenomenon related to their particular TCRs, we generated MVA-GP-Venus and analyzed a different TCR transgenic T cell pair specific for the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoprotein (GP) (Smarta/CD4 + , P14/ CD8 + ).</s><s>Similar to our previous results, we found accumulation of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells (P14) around MVA-GP-Venusinfected DC while antigen-specific CD4 + T cells (Smarta) accumulated in the paracortex (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E and S2E</ref>).</s><s>Smarta cells formed homogenous clusters in the paracortex of dLN that were only randomly intermixed with P14 cells, similar to nonspecific control cells (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F and 2G</ref>).</s><s>To further evaluate whether the observed separated activation of antigen-specific CD4 + versus CD8 + T cells is a more general feature of initial activation, we examined two additional experimental systems.</s><s>As a first approach, we used recombinant adenovirus infections and found that OT-I cells translocated to the SCS and IFA to interact with directly infected APC, whereas OT-II cells remained in the paracortex where they were activated in an antigen-specific manner (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2F-S2I</ref>).</s><s>Second, we immunized mice with soluble OVA protein and LPS as adjuvant.</s><s>Again, we found that activation of OT-I and OT-II cells is predominantly separated (Figures S2J-S2M and Movie S3).</s><s>In summary, we conclude that the initial activation of antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells is segregated and involves distinct DC in different locations within the lymph node or spleen.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of DCs that Present Viral Antigen via both MHCI and MHCII Later after Infection</head><p><s>These findings were surprising in light of previous reports demonstrating that CD4 + help for CD8 + T cells occurs on a single DC co-presenting MHCI and MHCII antigens <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bennett et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cassell and Forman, 1988)</ref> and our prior studies showing how chemokines guide T cells to DCs co-presenting MHCI and MHCII ligands <ref type="bibr">(Castellino et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>One way to reconcile the present observations with these prior findings is to postulate that the licensing and/or the delivery of help occurs later during the course of infection.</s><s>To examine this possibility, we transferred OT-I, OT-II, and polyclonal CD4 + T cells into mice that had been infected for 30 hr and analyzed the location of these transferred cells in LN sections 8 hr after transfer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref>).</s><s>With this experimental setup, we could readily detect OT-I and OT-II cell co-clusters, while polyclonal CD4 + T cells showed an unbiased distribution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3B</ref>).</s><s>When systematically comparing cellular positioning in the LN early (10 hr) versus late (38 hr) after infection, we found marked differences for OT-I cells and modest differences for OT-II cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C</ref>).</s><s>This reflects the predominant activation of OT-I at the SCS/IFA early after infection (10 hr) versus the presence of antigen-bearing DCs in the paracortex at later time points (38 hr).</s><s>These paracortical DCs were able to present antigen to and activate both OT-I and OT-II T cells, as indicated by the OT-I and OT-II T cells expressing activation markers in co-clusters surrounding such DCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3D</ref>).</s><s>Thus, later during infection, a common DC, positioned in the peripheral paracortex, presents antigen able to productively engage the TCR of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells.</s><s>Use of two experimental approaches to block DC migration (site removal, lymph vessel obliteration) revealed that migratory DCs were not required for the formation of OT-I/OT-II cell co-clusters during the late phase of infection (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3A and  S3B</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, Batf3 KO animals that lack migratory CD103 + DCs but only a fraction of LN resident CD8a + (XCR1 + ) DCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Edelson et al., 2010)</ref> showed mixed OT-I/OT-II cell co-clusters, confirming that CD103 + migratory DCs were dispensable for the formation of such clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3B</ref>).</s><s>It is important to note that the presence of clusters consisting of three different cell types (OT-I/OT-II/DC) does not necessarily mean that those ternary interactions occur or are necessary for delivery of help under physiological conditions, as in these experiments an artificially high number of precursor T cells was used to facilitate detection of the co-presenting DCs.</s></p><p><s>Non-infected Cross-presenting XCR1 + DCs Are the Information-Transmission Platform for CD4 + and CD8 + T Cells Given that XCR1 + DCs were dispensable for early CD4 + and CD8 + T cell activation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) but play a central role in immunogenic CTL priming <ref type="bibr"
