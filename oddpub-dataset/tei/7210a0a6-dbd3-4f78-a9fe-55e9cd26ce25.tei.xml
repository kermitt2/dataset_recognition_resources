<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a well-established surgical treatment.</s><s>Several types of intervertebral spacers can be used, but there is increasing evidence that PEEK cages yield insufficient fusion and thus less clinical improvement.</s><s>The study aim was to assess the outcomes of single-level ACDF with an empty PEEK cage partially coated with titanium.</s><s>Methods: This prospective multicenter single-arm clinical study collected follow-up data at 6, 12, and 18 months.</s><s>A post hoc comparison was made to closely matched patients from another similar trial treated with identically designed, empty, uncoated PEEK cages.</s><s>Results: There were 49 of 50 patients (98%) who met the MCID of 3+ points of improvement on VAS pain or had an 18-month VAS ≤ 1.</s><s>Yet even by 18 months post-op, only 40 of 50 (80%) PEEK + Ti patients achieved complete bony fusion.</s><s>The PEEK + Ti group (n = 49) seemed to have somewhat better fusion scores and significantly better pain relief at 6 M than the matched controls (n = 49), but these differences did not persist at 12 M or 18 M.

Several preclinical animal studies have also documented this issue and provided various speculative explanations for it, including the inertness of PEEK as a material, difficulty of bony ongrowth to the implant, and/or a possible immune reaction to PEEK <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>Whatever the underlying biological explanation(s) might be, we recently reported on a large, prospective, multicenter clinical trial (the "PIERCE-PEEK" trial), which also showed that singlelevel empty PEEK cages had an 18-month rate of complete fusion of only 83% <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, consistent with one earlier study <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> but contradicting the rest of those earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that suffered from important limitations, patients in our study who failed to achieve complete bony fusion of the vertebrae at any follow-up showed significantly less improvement of pain and disability at that follow-up and all subsequent follow-ups, compared to patients who had achieved complete fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Since it has sometimes been reported that titanium has better rates of bony bridging <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and bony fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> than PEEK, it was widely thought that coating a PEEK cage with a thin layer of titanium would improve the radiographic fusion rate, while retaining the material advantages of PEEK mentioned above.</s><s>But because the process of applying a titanium coating is technically difficult (especially in the implant's central hole) and increases the cost, one of the first manufacturers to pursue this important innovation tried applying a solid coating of titanium on just the top and bottom surfaces of these cages, where they make contact with the vertebral endplates.</s><s>It was hoped that this would be sufficient to improve the rate of bony fusion.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to investigate the radiographic and clinical outcomes of a clinical trial performing singlelevel ACDF using empty PEEK cages coated with titanium on the top and bottom surfaces.</s><s>This paper also reports a post hoc comparison of these patients to matched controls implanted with an uncoated but otherwise identical PEEK cage in an earlier similar trial.</s><s>The present report completely replaces an earlier interim analysis on a subset of the patients reported previously in conference abstracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s></p></div>

it is not a randomized controlled trial.</s><s>Consequently, the titanium coating on the PEEK implants cannot be considered the definitive cause of any difference or lack of differences between the two groups.</s><s>The comparison group was mostly treated in earlier years, sometimes by other surgeons at other hospitals, so there might be other subtle but relevant difference between the two study groups and their treatment besides the titanium coating.</s><s>Second, this study only compared 49 cases and 49 controls, so it was often somewhat underpowered.</s><s>For this reason, true differences between the two study groups may not be apparent or may not have strong statistical significance.</s><s>If readers view the p-values leniently, it is often possible to see what difference titanium makes, but readers should be careful about rejecting findings here that do not quite reach a traditional level of p &lt; 0.05, because this study was sometimes not quite as large as it should have been to reach that level.</s><s>With these two design limitations in mind, it should be noticed that the quality of this study is otherwise high: it is a prospective multicenter study, with no missing data, and the comparison group was very well matched on sex, age, and cervical level.</s><s>Yet it must be emphasized that this report is not a "case-control study" in the terminological meaning of that kind of study design.</s><s>Rather, this study is a prospective single-arm cohort clinical trial, with a post hoc statistical comparison to a closely matched subsample of patients from another nearly identical prospective single-arm cohort clinical trial.</s></p><p><s>The main outcome of this study is that ACDF with this implant (a PEEK cage coated with titanium on the top and bottom surfaces only) yields very good clinical outcomes.</s><s>Almost every patient obtained clinically important relief of neck pain, and about 3 in 4 patients achieved all three clinical criteria of success.</s><s>However, the radiographic outcomes for this cage remain less than desirable, implying that some patients did not obtain as much benefit from ACDF with this cage as perhaps they could have.</s><s>The comparison of these two cohorts suggests that although titanium is not irrelevant, coating only the top and bottom remains inadequate.</s><s>The PEEK + Ti was about 2.6 times as likely to achieve fusion at 6 months than the plain PEEK group, but this difference disappeared at later timepoints.</s><s>Correspondingly, the PEEK + Ti group had more improvement of pain at 6 months but not later.</s></p><p><s>This lack of lasting advantage in the PEEK + Ti group is not surprising, considering that the lateral walls of the cage both internally and externallyremain uncoated, and thus no different from the plain PEEK cage.</s><s>Perhaps partial coating of the implant endplates improves the bony ongrowth at those junctures, (though that cannot be seen on the x-rays or tested functionally in human patients).</s><s>That might explain the better fusion rate at 6 months: bony ongrowth at the endplates might reduce motion on dynamic x-rays sooner.</s><s>But measurable radiographic fusion requires bridging bony growth between the two vertebrae, across the implant, both around its external lateral surfaces and through its interior hole.</s><s>If those lateral and internal surfaces remain uncoated, then the fusion across the cage will be no better than for a plain PEEK cage.</s><s>So, obviously enough, the implants should be entirely coated in titanium.</s></p><p><s>More broadly and importantly, this study supports the strong findings of our previous study (the "PIERCE-PEEK" trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>) that achieving bony fusion of the vertebrae is indeed important for maximizing the clinical benefit of ACDF.</s><s>Patients in the present study who were fused (with either cage) had more improvement of pain at 6 months and disability at 6 and 12 months than patients who did not achieve complete fusion.</s><s>Thus the general issue of how to improve the radiographic fusion is indeed relevant to patient-experienced outcomes, and not mere technological obscuritanism.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In conclusion, ACDF is an effective treatment for radiculopathy and myelopathy.</s><s>Achieving bony fusion of the vertebrae is important for maximizing the clinical improvement.</s><s>The speed and frequency of achieving bony fusion is suboptimal with PEEK cages.</s><s>Titanium coating appears useful, but coating only the top and bottom surfaces is inadequate.</s><s>A large prospective clinical trial of PEEK cages coated entirely with titanium would be an important next step toward improving treatment.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 X</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.2X-ray of the implant inserted between C5 and C6.</s><s>As this x-ray shows, most of the implant, being made of radiolucent PEEK, cannot be seen on the x-ray.</s><s>But two of the four vertical tantalum pins can be seen here (the two vertical lines connecting the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies); they serve to indicate the position of the implant on x-rays.</s><s>Along the edge of the endplates of the vertebral bodies, we can also see two wavy lines, which are the titanium coating of the toothed top and bottom surfaces of the implant.</s><s>This image thus illustrates how thin the coating of titanium is, and how it follows the form of the implant's toothed top and bottom surfaces.</s><s>The small insert is an electron-microscope image (provided by the implant manufacturer), which shows the titanium coating from another specimen of this same model of implant used in the study</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,65.99,94.85,215.21,150.69" type="bitmap" /></figure>
