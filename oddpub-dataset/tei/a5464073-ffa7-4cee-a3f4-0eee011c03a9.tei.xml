<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Since 2000, there is a renaissance of neurosurgical treatments of psychiatric disorders.</s><s>Many researchers and clinicians hope that modern neurosurgical approaches will be established as treatment options for a growing number of therapy-refractory psychiatric disorders.</s><s>About 90% of functional neurosurgeons feel optimistic about the future of psychiatric neurosurgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Lipsman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mendelsohn et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Modern psychiatric neurosurgery includes DBS and ablative neurosurgical procedures (thermal or radiofrequency ablation, and radiosurgery).</s><s>DBS and thermal or radiofrequency ablation procedures require a craniotomy.</s><s>Radiosurgery (Gamma Knife Radiosurgery) is performed without craniotomy, mostly as an ambulant treatment.</s><s>In future, high intensity focused ultrasound might become another option.</s><s>The worldwide first four patients have been treated with this technique in South Korea <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Na et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Many authors consider DBS as the most modern and superior technology, particularly because of its adjustability and high degree of reversibility.</s><s>However, in the wake of DBS development, ablative neurosurgical procedures are seeing a comeback, although they had been discredited and nearly completely abandoned in the 1970s because of their frequent serious complications and their unethical practice.</s><s>Since modern stereotactic ablative procedures, particularly radiosurgery are much safer and more efficient than their historical antecessors, a re-evaluation of this technique is required.</s></p><p><s>Until now, ethical discussion about non-DBS psychiatric neurosurgery is scarce, whereas psychiatric DBS is intensively discussed ethically.</s><s>This blind spot in neuroethics is astonishing for several reasons: First, the fraction of ablative procedures in psychiatric neurosurgery is big: in North America, 50% of psychiatric neurosurgeons use lesioning exclusively or combined with DBS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Lipsman et al., 2011)</ref>; outside of North America even 54.9%</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Mendelsohn et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Second, two expert panels have affirmed stereotactic ablative procedures as important alternatives for appropriately selected patients (Parkinsonism: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bronstein et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">psychiatric disorders: Nuttin et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Third, a clear superiority of any procedure in all relevant aspects cannot be established.</s><s>Forth, which approach is optimal, depends significantly on patients' individual medical and non-medical properties.</s><s>Fifth, the much higher costs of DBS, particularly for long-term treatment, exclude this option for the majority of patients world-wide.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, a comprehensive ethical analysis of the pros and cons of the different approaches is necessary, based on clinical facts, not on ideological prejudices.</s><s>Particularly, it is not justified to characterize modern lesioning procedures as successors of historical psychosurgery, while presenting DBS as something quite different.</s><s>In fact, both psychiatric DBS and modern ablative psychiatric neurosurgery are significantly improved successors of the historical psychosurgery.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Different Paradigms</head><p><s>The different approaches of modern psychiatric neurosurgery refer to different paradigms: microsurgical ablative procedures is based on the paradigm 'quick fix, ' radiosurgery on the paradigm 'minimal-invasiveness, ' and DBS on the paradigm 'adjustability.'</s></p><p><s>The purpose of ablative microsurgical procedures is to disconnect limbic system circuits related to different psychiatric disorders in order to enhance brain function and reduce psychiatric symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Martinez-Alvarez, 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Radiosurgery is usually considered as an ablative treatment.</s><s>However, recent neurophysiological, radiological, and histological studies challenge this view.</s><s>Radiosurgical protocols for neurological or psychiatric disorders might have differential effects on various neuronal populations and remodel the glial environment, leading to a modulation of function while preserving basic processing.</s><s>Thus, modern functional radiosurgery might be based on neuromodulatory effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Régis, 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>DBS has been considered as a method to produce reversible lesions.</s><s>Indeed, high-frequency DBS has a similar effect as lesions, i.e., inhibition of targets that are hyperactive in psychiatric disorders.</s><s>However, its mechanism of action is unclear, and several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the blocking effect of stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Lévèque, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Its main advantage is that the stimulation effect can be adjusted by adapting the stimulation parameters.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy</head><p><s>A direct comparison of the efficacy of the different approaches is not yet possible, particularly because of the heterogeneity of the studies, the small patient numbers, and the fact that most studies are neither placebo-controlled nor double-blind.</s><s>The rapid development of the methods aggravates their comparison: In psychiatric DBS, many targets (mostly overlapping for different diagnoses) are tested with different stimulation parameters.</s><s>In radiosurgery, the radiation doses used decreased significantly.</s><s>Randomized controlled trials would be optimal to directly compare the efficacy of the different approaches.</s><s>However, this scientific standard cannot be met for practical and ethical reasons.</s><s>Nevertheless, studies that directly compare different approaches with matched patients would also provide a valid efficacy comparison.</s><s>In any case, this would be much better than the current practice of publishing reviews.</s><s>The problem with most reviews is that they summarize only data published in medical journals in English language.</s><s>However, this practice does not represent the clinical reality but presents a distorted picture.</s><s>Therefore, we expect a severe publication bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Schläpfer and Fins, 2010)</ref>, leading to a systematic over-evaluation of the benefits.</s></p><p><s>The publication bias is no minor problem in psychiatric neurosurgery, but a fundamental problem, which corrupts the evaluation of risks and benefits of the different procedures.</s><s>For example, we have performed a systematic literature search on psychiatric neurosurgery for treating anorexia nervosa, which yielded only 27 cases <ref type="bibr">(Müller et al., forthcoming)</ref>.</s><s>However, from presentations on conferences we learned that a multiple of the patients reported in journals have been treated with ablative neurosurgery.</s><s>Websites of private clinics in Europe as well as in Asia offer ablative surgery for a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders as part of clinical routine.</s><s>These treatments are not part of clinical studies and usually not published.</s><s>Recently, a book of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sun and De Salles (2015)</ref> has been published which presents original data from several studies with ablative neurosurgery for different psychiatric disorders which had not been published in medical journals.</s></p><p><s>That being said, we summarize available data on the efficacy of the different approaches, whereby we refer to the most recent reviews as well as to the above mentioned book of Sun and De Salles.</s></p></div>

of microsurgical ablative procedures the rapid onset of action; and of radiosurgery its noninvasiveness and low rate of adverse effects.</s><s>Furthermore, it differs individually what counts as an advantage or disadvantage: For example, the delayed onset of action of radiosurgery makes it disadvantageous for patients who need a rapid symptom reduction.</s><s>However, the gradual development of effects might be advantageous since it alleviates the psychological adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lindquist et al., 1991)</ref>.</s><s>This may be protective against feelings of being manipulated, self-estrangement and the burden of normality syndrome.</s></p><p><s>We support further research in this area generally, but think that therapeutic adventurism cannot be justified.</s><s>The current research practice in psychiatric neurosurgery does not fulfill the highest ethical and scientific standards.</s><s>We plead for ethical reasons for better safeguards in research and clinical practice.</s><s>Since psychiatric neurosurgery has both the goal and the potential to change core features of the patients' personalities, these interventions require a solid scientific fundament.</s><s>Particularly, we recommend the following:</s></p><p><s>• Case registries should become obligatory for all clinical studies in order to avoid a publication bias and its negative consequences, namely faulty evaluations of therapies, flawed therapy recommendations, unpromising treatment attempts and unneeded clinical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Morishita et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Individual treatment attempts should not be performed.</s></p><p><s>• A multi-center, randomized, controlled study should be performed that directly compares DBS, microsurgical ablative procedures and radiosurgery for different psychiatric disorders.</s></p><p><s>• Since multiple circuits seem to be involved in psychiatric disorders, targets of DBS or ablative procedures, respectively, should be selected specifically with regard to the prominent symptoms instead of using the institution-specific target for all patients.</s><s>• Since no single procedure is absolutely superior, patients should be informed comprehensively about the different treatment options and their respective benefit-risk-profiles.</s></p><p><s>Individual factors have to be crucial in decision making, particularly the patients' social situation, individual preferences, and individual attitudes (e.g., whether they could tolerate implanted whether they are more afraid of the irreversibility of an ablative procedure or of the medical risks of brain surgery).</s></p><p><s>We are convinced that the different approaches are not only rivals, but also enriching mutually.</s><s>DBS is preferable for exploring new targets, which may become candidates for ablative microsurgery or radiosurgery.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>TABLE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Comparison of different approaches of modern psychiatric neurosurgery.</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>DBS</cell><cell>Microsurgery</cell><cell>Radiosurgery</cell></row><row><cell>Paradigm</cell><cell>Adjustability</cell><cell>Quick fix</cell><cell>Minimal-invasiveness</cell></row><row><cell>Adjustability</cell><cell>Very high</cell><cell>Low (through a second intervention</cell><cell>Low (second intervention to produce another</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>to produce another lesion or to</cell><cell>lesion) to medium (through a step-by-step</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>enlarge the lesion)</cell><cell>approach)</cell></row><row><cell>Addressing different</cell><cell>No</cell><cell>Yes</cell><cell>Yes</cell></row><row><cell>targets in a single session</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Reversibility</cell><cell>High (exception: permanent adverse effects</cell><cell>No</cell><cell>No</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>due to lesions, infections, bleeding)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Invasive craniotomy</cell><cell>Yes</cell><cell>Yes</cell><cell>No</cell></row><row><cell>Onset of action</cell><cell>Hours to 12 months</cell><cell>Days or weeks</cell><cell>6-12 months</cell></row><row><cell>Appropriateness for</cell><cell>No</cell><cell>Patients who would not comply</cell><cell>Patients</cell></row><row><cell>patients with special</cell><cell></cell><cell>with long-term follow-up</cell><cell>-Who would not comply with long-term</cell></row><row><cell>needs</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>follow-up</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>-With higher risks of anesthesia</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>-With higher infection risks</cell></row><row><cell>Time and effort of the</cell><cell>Single surgery;
