<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>Twenty healthy volunteers (11 females, 9 males; 28 ± 3 years; 1 left-handed and 19 right-handed) with normal or corrected-tonormal vision were enrolled.</s><s>None of the subjects had neurological diseases.</s><s>The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Helsinki University Hospital and was in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>The subjects gave their written informed consent prior to the experiments.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p><s>Peripheral vision is important since it allows detection of unexpected or deviant signals and in many cases our survival depends on the ability to perceive the movement of significant objects (e.g., detecting peripheral driving vehicles on the road, avoiding a predator or a falling tree, etc.).</s><s>Therefore, it is important to describe the neuronal mechanisms of such stimulation.</s><s>Consequently, in this study, we use two displays to simulate a more realistic situation.</s></p><p><s>The subjects sat in a comfortable chair and were instructed to remain awake, to keep their eyes open and to focus on a white fixation cross presented on a black background in front of them.</s><s>They were also advised to minimize any unnecessary movements and blinking.</s><s>Two 21-inch full-HD screens were placed laterally at 80 cm from the medial head line.</s><s>The viewing angles of each monitor ranged from 59 • (distal side) to 90 • (proximal side) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>White circular spots (radius of 150 pixels, 37 mm, visual angle 2.65 • ) were presented simultaneously on both screens (one spot per screen).</s><s>The spots moved in a circle with angular velocity of about 42 rpm, the direction of this rotary motion defining the difference between the standard and deviant stimuli.</s><s>The direction of the motion was randomized among subjects.</s><s>From 657 to 837 (800 ± 8) stimuli were presented semi-randomly in an oddball paradigm with a 1:7 ratio, i.e., 81 to 100 (98 ± 1) deviants and 576 to 737 (702 ± 8) standards.</s><s>The stimulus duration was 1400 ms which corresponds to one rotation of the spots.</s><s>The interstimulus interval was randomized between 2300 and 2800 ms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EEG recordings</head><p><s>The electric potentials on the scalp were recorded with a 60channel eXimia EEG <ref type="bibr">(Nexstim Plc., Helsinki, Finland)</ref>, electrodes being placed according to the international 10-20 system.</s><s>The signals were referenced to the right mastoid; the ground electrode was over the right cheek bone.</s><s>Eye movements were recorded with two additional electrodes; one electrooculography (EOG) electrode was placed on the frontal process of the zygomatic bone and the other under the eye (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>The impedance of all electrodes was kept below 5 kY.</s><s>The signals were band-pass filtered from 0.1 to 350 Hz and digitized at 1450 Hz.</s><s>The EEG was recorded for about 90 min with a 1-minute break after every 5 min of recording.</s></p></div>
