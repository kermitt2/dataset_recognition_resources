<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: This study aimed the feasibility to assess longitudinal changes in biomarkers of cartilage turnover and to determine their relationship with patient-rated outcomes over 2 years in volleyball athletes.</s><s>Methods: Thirty-seven athletes were studied: 18 adolescents (age 15.9 ± 0.64 years) in a 2-year intensive volleyball training program and 19 adult recreational volleyball players (age 46.5 ± 4.9 years).</s><s>Blood and serum samples were taken at baseline (BL) and 2-year follow-up (FU).</s><s>Subjects completed the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form and the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) at BL. Results: Thirteen adolescents (72%) had open growth plates at BL (BL open adolescents), the rest had closed growth plates at BL (BL closed adolescents), and all but one adolescent had closed growth plates at FU as assessed by MRI.</s><s>BL open and closed adolescents had greater levels of the cartilage degradation-based biomarkers 45 mer collagenase peptide of type II collagen (C2C-HUSA) and C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) than adults.</s><s>BL open adolescents showed decreases in C2CHUSA, collagen synthesis marker C-propeptide of type II procollagen (CPII), and CTXII, and adults showed increases in cartilage intermediate layer protein 2 (CILP-2) and C2C-HUSA.</s><s>In adolescents, IKDC scores were correlated with CPII changes.</s><s>In adults, SF-36 Physical Component Scores were correlated with cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) changes.</s><s>Conclusion: Significant differences in biomarker levels over time show the feasibility to assess their changes.</s><s>Greater levels of C2C-HUSA and CTX-II in adolescents than in adults may reflect increased cartilage turnover in response to higher joint loading.</s><s>CPII and COMP may be more reflective of subjective patient outcomes.</s><s>These biomarkers may thus be useful in assessing mechanical loading-induced cartilage changes, their associated symptoms, and Osteoarthritis risk in athletes.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The primary aims of this study were to compare biomarkers of cartilage turnover in adolescent and adult volleyball athletes over 2 years.</s><s>Our main findings were that in adolescents, regardless of growth plate status, there were higher levels of C2C-HUSA and CTX-II than in adults.</s><s>Adolescents with BL open growth plates showed decreases in CPII, C2C-HUSA, and CTX-II, whereas adults showed increases in C2C-HUSA and CILP-2, and adolescents with closed BL growth plates showed no biomarkers changes from BL to FU. IKDC scores were correlated with CPII changes in adolescents, whereas SF-36 scores were correlated with COMP changes in adults.</s><s>C2C-HUSA is an assay that recognizes a 45 mer collagenase-generated cartilage derived peptide containing the C2C neoepitope.</s><s>It has been found to increase with the onset and progression of cartilage degeneration in patients with early articular cartilage degeneration and in those with knee OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cibere et al. 2009)</ref>.</s><s>A study in knee OA patients found that C2C-HUSA levels were correlated with more severe knee cartilage lesions, lower Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS), and worse functional abilities of the lower limb <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tamm et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The increase of C2C-HUSA we found in adults is likely reflective of cartilage breakdown in that cohort over 2 years, corroborating a previous study in this cohort which found a decrease in their knee cartilage thickness and subchondral bone plate area during this time period <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Eckstein et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, C2C-HUSA decreased in BL open adolescents likely due to their ongoing growth, in which type II collagen cleavage by collagenases is very pronounced in the hypertrophic zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bernardo et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, both adolescents with and without open growth plates at BL had significantly higher levels of C2C-HUSA at BL than adults, although this did not reach statistical significance at FU for BL closed adolescents.</s><s>This difference between the age groups is possibly due to the higher volleyball training intensity in the adolescents in comparison to the adults, which may have led to a higher rate of immediate cartilage degradation in the adolescents, and suggests that C2C-HUSA may reflect more short-term, immediate cartilage turnover stimulated by high joint loading.</s><s>This encourages further studies of C2C-HUSA to determine whether it can predict risk of knee OA in this high-risk population.</s></p><p><s>High levels of the articular cartilage degradative marker CTX-II, the C-telopeptide of type II collagen, have also previously been associated with greater risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cibere et al. 2009</ref>) and severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fang et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Jiao et al. 2016</ref>) of radiographic OA, as well as with MRIdetected knee cartilage defects in subjects with and without radiographic OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ding et al. 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Elevated CTX-II has also been found in the urine of growing children, attributed to growth plate activity, and was found to decrease with age in a study of healthy adults between the ages of 20 and 55 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mouritzen et al. 2003)</ref>.</s><s>These findings could explain the significantly higher levels of CTX-II in both groups of adolescents than in adult volleyball players in our study at both BL and FU and the decrease in CTX-II from BL to FU in the BL open adolescents, reflecting the transition from open to closed growth plates.</s><s>However, our finding that levels of CTX-II at FU were greater in both groups of adolescents than in adults, when all adolescents but one had closed growth plates, suggests that CTX-II also reflects elevated cartilage turnover due to the adolescents' higher volleyball activity levels in addition to growth.</s><s>Similarly, a study by O'Kane at al. in varsity college athletes found that CTX-II was significantly higher in runners than in crew, swimmers, or controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(O'Kane et al. 2006)</ref>.</s><s>They concluded that the high levels of CTX-II in runners were caused by the increased amount of cartilage remodeling or degradation in that group due to joints stressed by high amplitude loading of the lower skeleton (O' <ref type="bibr">Kane et al. 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Volleyball players likely experience similar amounts of mechanical loading as runners, as both are high-impact sports with substantial loading of the lower limbs.</s><s>Thus, this study adds to previous findings  suggesting that CTX-II reflects mechanical loadinginduced cartilage turnover, making it a promising biomarker to assess pre-OA cartilage changes in an athletic, high-risk population.</s><s>CILP-2 is homologous to CILP-1, cartilage intermediate layer protein-1, which is expressed in the intermediate zone of articular cartilage and has been associated with cartilage degenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lorenzo et al. 1998)</ref>.</s><s>CILP-2 is more localized to the deeper intermediate zone of articular cartilage at maturity, and its expression has been found to be downregulated in mice with experimentally-induced degenerative OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bernardo et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>One study also found CILP-2 to be decreased in adults with radiographic knee OA compared to healthy controls.</s><s>These findings suggest that CILP-2 is inversely associated with cartilage degeneration.</s><s>Moreover, CILP-2 was found to be restricted to articular cartilage and the meniscus and absent in growth plate cartilage, suggesting that it is characteristic of the specialized composition of the extracellular matrix synthesized by articular chondrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bernardo et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the longitudinal increase in CILP-2 seen in adults may reflect long-term articular cartilage remodeling from biomechanical stresses augmented by volleyball participation.</s><s>The lack of longitudinal differences in CILP-2 in the adolescents suggests that there are other age-related factors that contribute to its changes over time.</s><s>It is also interesting that there were no significant differences in BL or FU levels of CILP-2 found between adolescents, either combined or stratified by BL growth plate status, and adults, suggesting that levels of this biomarker may fluctuate over time in response to remodeling of articular cartilage.</s><s>Since CILP-2 has scarcely been investigated in the literature, further studies are required to assess how it reflects cartilage changes in athletic as well as osteoarthritic populations.</s></p><p><s>COMP, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, is a noncollagenous protein which binds and stabilizes type II collagen fibers and is found in synovium, ligamentous tissue, tendon, meniscus, and particularly articular cartilage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hoch et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In adults, SF-36 PCS scores were moderately correlated with COMP changes.</s><s>We found that adults with prior knee injuries had significantly worse SF-36 PCS than those without prior knee injuries, although there was no difference in COMP levels found between these two groups.</s><s>Previous studies have found serum COMP to increase in runners after a marathon <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Neidhart et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Kim et al. 2009</ref>), but another found that increased COMP in college soccer players over a season did not reach the calculated minimum detectable change <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hoch et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Kersting et al.</ref> found that COMP levels did not significantly change after a 1h training session, but noted that the standard deviation and range of COMP levels were notably increased postexercise, indicating that changes may have occurred, albeit in different directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kersting et al. 2005)</ref>.</s><s>The COMP levels in our adult volleyball players also ranged widely at each point, with ranges of 14.1 U/I and 12.4 U/I at BL and FU, respectively.</s><s>This may be why we did not find the COMP level to statistically significantly change over time in the adults, although there were enough changes to correlate with SF-36 PCS scores.</s><s>This suggests that adult volleyball athletes with worse overall physical status, regardless of prior injury status, tended to have increases in COMP over 2 years.</s><s>Although the causes for this are unclear, larger studies with longer follow-up times are required to assess how COMP reflects patient-rated outcomes and cartilage changes in high-risk populations.</s></p><p><s>This study had several limitations.</s><s>A number of subjects were missing serum samples at either BL or FU, which decreased our sample size.</s><s>Many subjects also had prior knee injuries; however, we aimed to assess how biomarkers of cartilage turnover were affected over time in active volleyball athletes, including those who had recovered from prior knee injuries.</s><s>We also compared biomarker values and patient-rated outcomes between these subgroups in the adults.</s><s>Patient-reported outcomes were not collected at FU, so longitudinal changes in this measure could not be assessed.</s></p><p><s>There were also strengths to this study.</s><s>Our cohort consisted of two highly uniform age groups with different levels of volleyball participation for comparison.</s><s>Biomarkers were assessed from both serum and urine samples, which provided a comprehensive assessment of metabolic and pathophysiological cartilage changes.</s><s>Patient-rated outcomes in both a knee-specific and general health score were used to assess subjective clinical outcomes at BL, which provided a more holistic picture of subjective clinical status.</s><s>This is also the first study to assess long-term changes in biomarkers of cartilage turnover in adolescent and adult volleyball athletes.</s></p></div>
