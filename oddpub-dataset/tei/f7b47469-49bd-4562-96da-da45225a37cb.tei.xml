<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Reduction of tumor incidence in GABARAP KO mice.</s><s>In order to investigate the potential roles of GABARAP in tumor incidence, female GABARAP KO (KO) and wild-type C57BL/ 6J (Wt) mice were treated with DMBA.</s><s>Tumors arose in 14 of the 29 Wt mice (48.3%) within 35 weeks after the last dose of DMBA.</s><s>In KO mice, tumor formation was significantly reduced (4 of 33; 12.1%; P = 0.002, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>A variety of tumors developed in each group, for instance, mammary, skin and liver tumors as well as lymphomas.</s><s>When only mammary tumors were considered, a difference between 21.4% (3 out of the 14 tumors in Wt mice) and 0% (0 of the 4 tumors in KO mice) was observed (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Large tumors (41.5 cm 2 ) were only found in Wt mice, whereas only small tumors (≤1 cm 2 ) occurred in KO mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Enhanced sensitivity of GABARAP KO mice to DMBA induced immunotoxicity.</s><s>In addition to mutagenicity, DMBA treatment elicits an immunotoxic effect mainly on splenic cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>In our model, both DMBA-treated groups reduced the spleen volume; however, KO mice showed a higher reduction in comparison with Wt mice after DMBA treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Spleen weights of DMBA-treated Wt mice were decreased to about 40.5% (±0.7%) of vehicletreated Wt mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>However, a more substantial decrease was observed in spleen weights of DMBA-treated KO mice (13.6 ± 1.8%, in comparison with vehicle-treated KO mice, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Consistent with spleen weight, a significant decrease in the total number of splenocytes after DMBA treatment was seen in KO mice (11.6 ± 2.4% of splenocytes from vehicle-treated KO mice) compared with Wt mice (44.7 ± 2.8%, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses were carried out to detect the alterations in the cell populations of splenocytes.</s><s>KO mice showed a substantial reduction in the number of macrophages, B cells, T cells (CD8 + and CD4 + ) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) compared with Wt mice after DMBA treatment (Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A-E</ref>).</s><s>These results highlight the lack of a selective effect of DMBA on particular cell types in both KO and Wt mice.</s><s>To assess whether the reduction in spleen size and weight was due to cell death, a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed.</s><s>TUNEL-stained spleen sections showed increased numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in the DMBA-treated groups.</s><s>However, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly increased in DMBA-treated KO mice compared with Wt counterparts (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e and f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Cytokine secretion from both macrophages and lymphocytes are elevated in GABARAP KO mice.</s><s>Many autophagic genes are known to have a role in immunity, and disruption of GABARAP gene has been reported to increase lethality and expression of interleukin (IL)-1β in two sepsis mouse models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>Here we wanted to determine whether GABARAP deficiency has a role in cytokine secretion upon DMBA treatment.</s><s>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/LPS+ATP (adenosine triphosphate)-stimulated macrophages from DMBA-treated KO mice secreted significantly more IL-1β and IL-6 than macrophages from Wt counterparts (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a  and b</ref>).</s><s>No significant differences were seen for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) secretion between both groups (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>DMBA-treated mice have been reported to be persistently immunosuppressed, mainly through suppression of IL-2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>urprisingly, in our model anti-CD3-stimulated lymphocytes from DMBA-treated KO mice produced significantly more IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-γ than stimulated lymphocytes from Wt counterparts (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d and e</ref>).</s><s>No difference was seen for the secretion of IL-17 between both groups of mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, we found that the level of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF)-β1 was significantly reduced in the serum of DMBA-treated KO mice compared with Wt mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s><s>This is in line with the suppressive function of TGF-β1 towards T helper 1 cell (T H 1)-derived cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-γ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>ll death in mammary glands is promoted in mice lacking GABARAP.</s><s>DMBA is highly carcinogenic when administered to adult female mice by oral gavage and especially relevant to study mouse mammary gland tumorigenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>Therefore, we explored the mammary epithelial cell growth and ductal tree morphogenesis in our model.</s><s>Mammary glands of both female KO and Wt mice at 14 weeks of age showed normal mammogenesis, and no obvious phenotypic difference in mammary epithelial cell growth was noticed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the mammary glands of Wt mice treated with DMBA also showed phenotypically normal mammary epithelial trees compared with vehicletreated Wt mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>However, the mammary glands of DMBA-treated KO mice showed a massive reduction of epithelial cell outgrowth and ductal branching compared with vehicle-treated KO or DMBA-treated Wt mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, the lengths of the ductal outgrowths in DMBAtreated KO mice were significantly shorter than in all other groups of mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, TUNEL-stained mammary gland sections of DMBA-treated KO mice showed a significantly increased number of TUNEL-positive cells compared with the other groups (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Thus cellular death is highly elevated when these KO mice are exposed to the genotoxic carcinogen DMBA.</s><s>This may explain the inhibition of tumor formation of mice after DMBA treatment.</s></p><p><s>Increased expression of tumor-suppressor X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (Xiap)-associated factor 1 (Xaf1) in GABARAP KO mice.</s><s>To investigate the potential cellular and molecular mechanisms by which mammary tumor development, branching and ductal outgrowth was suppressed in KO mice by DMBA treatment, microarray based gene expression profililing of the mammary glands was performed.</s><s>The four experimental groups of mice chosen were: vehicle-treated Wt (CWT), vehicle-treated KO (CKO), DMBA-treated Wt (DWT), and DMBA-treated KO (DKO).</s><s>From this data, a subset of genes whose expression was altered in a GABARAP-dependent manner between CWT and DWT was analyzed.</s><s>The set of the most differentially expressed genes upon KO is shown in a heat map (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>As expected, there was a pronounced difference in GABARAP expression between Wt and KO mice.</s><s>In addition, the analysis revealed that Xaf1 gene was highly and differentially expressed in the mammary glands of KO mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>6]<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> We additionally explored the relationship between GABARAP and Xaf1 expression by interrogating different expression databases.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the levels of GABARAP were significantly higher when compared to Xaf1 in normal and malignant breast tissues as well as cancer cell lines from various organs (Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2 and S3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Xaf1 was originally identified as a novel negative regulator of Xiap. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>Interestingly, in our model Xiap shows a significant upregulation in Wt mice upon DMBA treatment, whereas DMBA-treated KO mice exhibited only modest downregulation of Xiap compared with vehicle-treated KO mice (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>These findings suggest that Xaf1 upregulation in the mammary glands of KO mice contributes to the inhibition of tumor formation and in so doing enhance cell death induction upon DMBA treatment.</s></p><p><s>Alteration in gene expression in mammary glands of DMBA-treated mice.</s><s>We further analyzed the expression of genes controlling cell death, cell cycle, DNA replication and autophagy in the data obtained from our mammary gland microarray expression experiments.</s><s>We found numerous genes that were differentially expressed upon DMBA treatment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In DMBA-treated KO mice, pro-apoptotic (Bid, Apaf1), cell death (Tnfrsf10b, Ripk1) and cell cycle control (Cdkn2c) genes were upregulated compared with vehicletreated KO mice.</s><s>Bax, Siva1 and Cdkn1a were upregulated upon DMBA treatment in Wt as well as in KO mice, compared with their vehicle-treated counterparts.</s><s>In Wt mice only, DMBA treatment had a positive effect on the expression of Cdc7, Cdk1 (genes encoding essential proteins of cell cycle control), E2f4, Tfdp2 and NF-κB1 (transcription factors).</s><s>NF-κB1 had been reported to have a role in mammary tumorigenesis as an early event, which is induced by DMBA treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>Apart from those genes that were upregulated only a few genes were downregulated in the mammary glands of KO mice upon DMBA treatment (Stmn4, Tgfb3, E2f1).</s><s>Overexpression of Siva1 had been found to inhibit stathmin (Stmn), an important regulatory protein of microtubule dynamics, leading to suppression of epithelialmesenchymal transition and metastasis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s>oreover, several autophagy genes were significantly upregulated in Wt and KO mice after DMBA treatment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>To further investigate the effect of DMBA on the autophagic response in GABARAP Wt and KO cells, we conducted western blotting analysis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).</s><s>As depicted in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>, the conversion of soluble LC3A/B-I to lipid-bound LC3A/B-II is an indicator of autophagy induction in

machinery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Contradictory results have been reported for the roles of specific autophagy genes in neoplasia.</s><s>Despite that Beclin1 having been demonstrated as having a tumor-suppression function for autophagy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> KO of Atg5, Atg7 and FIP200, other essential autophagy proteins, failed to initiate malignant

target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>In agreement with these results, DMBAtreated Wt mice showed a reduction in spleen size, weight and cell number.</s><s>Importantly, these effects were more pronounced in KO mice and were accompanied by increased numbers of TUNEL-positive splenocytes.</s><s>Thus GABARAP deficiency promoted cellular death after genotoxic stress by DMBA, which is consistent with the role of its homolog Atg8 in yeast and the concept that autophagy blockade may enhance cellular death under stress conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr"

stress of DMBA may activate the inflammasome in macrophages by preventing the removal of damaged mitochondria, which are responsible for the increased production of proinflammatory cytokines.</s><s>In addition, IL-1β was shown to be engaged in different cellular signaling pathways.</s><s>Roy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> demonstrated that high concentrations of IL-1β induced apoptosis, whereas moderate or low levels kept the same cells normal or stimulated their growth.</s></p><p><s>It is known that DMBA treatment results in suppression of the immune response for prolonged periods of time through inhibition of lymphocyte activity, mainly by suppressing IL-2 production.</s><s>Thus DMBA stimulates tumorigenesis via two mechanisms.</s><s>First, by inducing DNA mutations, and second, by downregulating the immune response that is relevant for cancer cell outgrowth after tumor initiation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>The response in GABARAP KO mice seems to be different.</s><s>Lymphocytes of DMBA-treated KO mice produced significantly higher levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ.</s><s>These results indicated that an immune enhancement of

treatment.</s><s>This was accompanied by a highly significant reduction of mammary epithelial growth.</s><s>Moreover, the gene expression profile revealed significant upregulation of several cell death genes.</s><s>Xaf1 was found to be differentially expressed in the mammary glands of KO mice, irrespective of whether these mice were treated with DMBA or not.</s><s>This gene has been extensively studied in the past decade and has been characterized as an apoptosis-inducer and tumor-suppressor gene.</s><s>Extremely low or undetectable Xaf1 expression is a frequent event in several

mechanisms.</s><s>Straszewski-Chavez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> showed that Xaf1 re-localized to mitochondria in response to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and promoted translocation of Bax into mitochondria and cytochrome C release and thereby induced apoptosis.</s><s>Consistent with these observations, our results revealed an enhancement of the pro-apoptotic genes Bid, Apaf1 and Bax, which are involved in the intrinsic activation of apoptosis by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.</s><s>Activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by Xaf1 was associated with dramatically enhanced TNFα expression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref></s><s>We did not detect any difference in TNFα expression in stimulated macrophages.</s><s>However, we found that Tnfrsf10b and Ripk1, both being TNF receptors, were significantly upregulated in the mammary glands of DMBA-treated KO mice, suggesting that the TNFα signaling pathway may have been affected.</s></p><p><s>Our results have elucidated that autophagy genes are upregulated after DMBA treatment.</s><s>Indeed, cell exposure to genotoxic carcinogens trigger several cellular processes to bypass the damage induced by such chemicals.</s><s>Autophagy is one of these processes that is stimulated in order to cope under times of stress. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>As autophagy is dependent on GABARAP, its deficiency may weaken the maintenance of tissue homeostasis leading to increased incidence of cell death.</s><s>The interplay between autophagy and apoptosis has

expression of the tumor-suppressor gene Xaf1 in non-immune cells, an effect that may trigger cell death events underlying the inhibition of tumor formation.</s><s>GABARAP-deficient immune cells produce elevated levels of several cytokines under genotoxic stress, which could suppress tumor formation and/or may trigger cell death.</s><s>Similar mechanisms in the derangement of immune signaling may be involved in growth suppression seen in the GABARAP KO tumor graft model.</s><s>This prediction requires further investigation in order to clarify the role of GABARAP removal in the reduction of inoculated tumor cell growth expression of GABARAP and Xaf1 may suggest that these genes constitute part of a molecular switch in the decision of a cell to undergo autophagy or apoptosis.</s><s>The nature of how this switch in gene expression operates remains a mystery.</s><s>Interestingly, Xaf1 has been recognized as an IFNstimulated gene and its expression has been promoted by both IFN and TNFα. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref></s><s>IFN-induced Xaf1 expression occurs either through its interaction with the IFN regulatory factor 1-(IRF-1) binding element (IRF-E) or demethylation

by cytokines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref></s><s>Based on our findings, we propose that cytokines are involved in the enhancement of Xaf1 expression, thus pointing to an indirect mechanism of Xaf1 regulation upon GABARAP removal.</s></p><p><s>Finally, our results provide evidence for the role of autophagy in anti-tumor immunity, as we showed that B16 melanoma cells' growth in GABARAP KO mice is reduced.</s><s>Further evidence for this link comes from work done by Noman et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> who inoculated Beclin1 knockdown B16 melanoma cells in a syngenic

this effect may have influenced the growth of the B16 melanoma cells by similar mechanisms that had been proposed by Noman et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> that is, anti-tumor immunity.</s><s>At least, a cell autonomous interplay between autophagy and apoptosis mediated by GABARAP could not explain this effect by itself.</s><s>The precise role of tumor growth reduction needs to be clarified through further studies.</s><s>For example, the role of microenvironment factors that represent an essential demand for tumor growth in vivo, needs to be investigated.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we have identified a novel role of GABARAP in tumorigenesis by using a mouse model and show that ablation of GABARAP in vivo inhibits tumor initiation and progression through enhancement of both antitumor immunity and cell death signaling, as summarized in a working model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s><s>The challenge for
