must be maintained in a controlled balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> .One strategy to minimize endogenous ROS levels is to regulate mitochondrial respiration, which plays a special role in stem cells.</s></p><p><s>Stem cell mitochondrial morphology is immature, rounded and with under-developed cristae.</s><s>Consequently, they depend heavily on glycolysis for their ATP supply <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s><s>When cells differentiate and increase respiration, mitochondrial mass increases, their morphology then shifts to more matured and elongated tubular forms, with more defined cristae and increased mtDNA copy numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>When somatic cells are reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), they depend predominantly on glycolysis and their mitochondria become rejuvenated and transformed back to the immature form <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> .</s></p><p><s>A key element in the reprogramming of metabolism is the HIF1-alpha pathway, which not only reacts in response to hypoxia, but also induces a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> .</s><s>We have reported this "metabolic reprogramming" as an essential step in iPSC-generation, which precedes the activation of pluripotency-associated genes like OCT4 and NANOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to use our previously published iPSC-based cellular model system for NBS and provide a screening platform for antioxidants capable of modulating genome stability.</s><s>NBS-iPSCs may overcome several problems associated with NBS research such as: i) small patient numbers, ii) cell cultures limited to fibroblasts and lymphocytes, iii) premature senescence in cell culture due to high levels of ROS, iv) discovery of new NBS molecular mechanisms and v) provision of new and therapeutically relevant concepts.</s></p><p><s>There are several diseases like NBS which derive from mutated genes in repair pathways, examples of these include Fanconi Anemia (FA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> ,

<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Our group recently published a study on modeling NBS by reprogramming <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s><s>Reprogrammed cells from patients with similar diseases like FA have been reported, though they could only be reprogrammed after genetic correction or with the aid of antioxidants <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> .</s><s>In a study of patients with Cockayne syndrome (CS), a mutation in the repair pathway gene ERCC6 did not impair genetic reprogramming but exhibited elevated cell death rates and ROS production <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> .</s><s>As NBS cells are hypersensitive to DNA damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> , ROS may be detrimental to them under physiological conditions.</s><s>Thus, it was hypothesized that antioxidants or the induction of pluripotency in NBS fibroblasts might suppress and maybe bypass ROS-mediated genome instability.</s></p><p><s>Microcephaly is a significant physical characteristic of NBS which can also be found in FA, LIG4 and NHEJ1 syndromes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Which genes/factors contribute to bypassing of cell cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis.</head><p><s>To understand which mechanisms possibly enabled NBS fibroblasts to achieve pluripotency and therefore overcome cellular senescence, we compared transcriptomic data between NBS-8 fibs, NBS-8-iPSCs and hESCs.</s><s>By identification of the overlaps for expressed genes (determined by expression p value &lt; 0.01) we found 2642 genes to be commonly expressed in NBS-iPSCs and hESCs, but not in NBS fibroblasts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>This subset of genes may contain the distinct profile enabling NBS fibroblasts to reach pluripotency and therefore rejuvenation.</s><s>We further analyzed the subset in an annotation database.</s><s>Among the most over-represented results we found MAPK signaling pathway and genes that were specifically expressed in the brain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>The MAPK signaling pathway is regulated by OCT4 and plays an important role in pluripotency and self-renewal <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> .</s><s>Global transcriptome analysis of NBS-iPSCs.</s><s>Global transcriptome analysis with NBS fibroblasts and NBS-iPSCs was performed to identify the problems interfering with reprogramming in the cell lines 1,3,5,7, determine NBS phenotypes or compensatory mechanisms in NBS-iPSCs derived from NBS-8 fibroblasts.</s><s>In the cluster dendrogram (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>),

clustered closer to hESCs than to other fibroblasts-derived iPSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>But, the parental fibroblast line NBS-8, clustered more distinct to the other fibroblasts.</s><s>The pronounced gap in clustering between NBS-8-Fib-P8 and NBS-8-Fib-P15 indicates acquisition of mutations or aberrations since they only differ in passage number.</s><s>After selecting genes that were significantly de-regulated (p value &lt; 0.05; fold change &gt; 1.5) between the groups of NBS and normal fibroblasts, the list was subjected to "DAVID Annotation Tools" 34 to identify pathways which were most affected by mutated NBN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>The same procedure was performed for the analysis of NBS-iPSCs in comparison with hESCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>There were different regulatory changes in both groups of analyses (NBS fibroblasts and NBS-8-iPSCs), but there was also overlap of pathways, indicating NBS specific traits in cell cycle and cancer.</s><s>Apoptosis and P53, two of the safeguard mechanisms against cancer, were predominantly de-regulated in NBS fibroblasts than pluripotent NBS cells while Mismatch repair, another safeguard mechanism against cancer, was predominantly de-regulated in pluripotent NBS cells.</s><s>Mismatch repair is illustrated in more detail in the heatmap in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref> (color bars: blue = NBS, red = healthy).</s><s>In Cell cycle we observed a shift from down-regulation to equally balanced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,b,d,e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, in NBS-iPSCs, the Glycolysis-pathway was significantly enriched.</s><s>Most enzymes involved in glycolysis, including phosphofructokinase, muscle (PFKM, 2-fold) which catalyzes the rate-limiting step, were at least 1.5-fold up-regulated (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), a gluconeogenesis regulatory enzyme, was significantly down-regulated (2.6-fold).</s><s>As previously reported, hESCs derive their energy from glycolysis rather than OXPHOS and have immature mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .</s><s>It was also observed that cells acquire the same metabolic profile during the reprogramming process <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .</s><s>NBS-iPSCs in this case, depended even stronger on glycolysis than other PSCs.</s><s>NBS-iPSCs as a model for studying molecular mechanisms associated with impaired DNA repair.</s><s>In line with the known predisposition of NBS patients to cancer, we found Pathways in cancer as the most enriched pathway in NBS-fibroblasts compared to healthy fibroblasts as well as in NBS-iPSCs compared to embryonic stem cells via DAVID analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,b</ref>).</s><s>With further cancer-related pathways, Cell cycle was found to be enriched in NBS-fibroblasts and NBS-iPSCs, while Apoptosis and p53 signaling were only enriched in NBS-fibroblasts.</s><s>To further explore the relevance of the KEGG pathways in cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> we performed a further DAVID analysis with the genes annotated with that pathway in differentially expressed genes in NBS-iPSCs compared to embryonic stem cells and this way could refine the functional annotation of the pathways in cancer (suppl.</s><s>Table.</s><s>S2).</s><s>As expected numerous specific cancer types such as lung cancer and Melanoma are annotated with these genes but also pathways related to NBS emerge.</s><s>Cell cycle (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>) and p53 signaling (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S5</ref>) are known to be impaired by NBS and are

Cell cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d,e</ref>), Glycolysis (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S6</ref>), Oxidative phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure <ref

target="#b37">37</ref> .</s><s>Cell cycle appears to shift from predominantly down-regulation (36 of 41 genes) in the NBS-fibroblasts to equal balance (16 genes down-and 12 genes up-regulated) in the NBS-iPSCs.</s><s>Another shift along with the reprogramming took place from Oxidative phosphorylation in the NBS-fibroblasts to Glycolysis in the NBS-iPSCs (Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure">S6 and S7</ref>).</s><s>This effect may have been induced by p53 down-regulation during reprogramming <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> and showed similarities to the Warburg effect in cancer cells which produced energy by Glycolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> .</s><s>In line with our previous publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> , we found that essential genes such

PSCs and fibroblasts and demonstrates differences (including more down-regulation of the genes P53 and TP53I3) in the only NBS line which could be reprogrammed (NBS8) compared to the other NBS lines.</s></p><p><s>Establishing the antioxidant screening platform.</s><s>During cultivation of PSCs, which was performed at 5% oxygen levels, a temporary switch (12 h) to ambient (21%) oxygen resulted in apoptosis of NBS-iPSCs, but HFF1-iPSCs and hESCs were unaffected.</s><s>We tested the effect of low (5%) and high (21%) oxygen quantitatively, by measuring gamma-H2AX, a marker for DNA double strand breaks in the presence or absence of the radiomimetic, Bleomycin.</s><s>The result showed that low oxygen conditions greatly decreased the DNA damage under the influence of the mutagen.</s><s>In addition, NBS Fibroblasts were more sensitive to DNA damage by mutagens than normal fibroblasts and the effect of low oxygen was less pronounced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>NBS-iPSCs were then screened for various types of antioxidants to mimic or enhance the effect of low oxygen.</s><s>The test measuring intracellular ROS levels revealed promising candidates to relieve NBS cells of oxidative stress, of which disulfiram (DSF) and EDHB were the most pronounced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>EDHB is utilized as a substrate analog and competitive inhibitor of prolyl 4-hydroxylases leading to specific inhibition of collagen synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> and to activation of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> .</s><s>We tested the effect of EDHB on intracellular ROS levels under stress conditions by supplementation with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ).</s><s>EDHB decreased normal ROS levels and greatly decreased intracellular ROS levels in the presence of H 2 O 2 in fibroblasts and PSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c,d</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, in fibroblasts, ROS levels were higher in EDHB treatment alone compared to treatment with EDHB plus hydrogen peroxide while in PSCs EDHB alone was lower than that of EDHB plus hydrogen peroxide treatment group.</s><s>This effect was even more pronounced in NBS cells and needs further exploration.</s><s>One possible explanation would be a change in ROS levels due to the shift in energy supply from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis along with the reprogramming which was described in the above paragraph "Global transcriptome analysis of NBS-iPSCs".</s></p><p><s>The effect of EDHB on DNA damage under stress conditions was also tested by supplementation with hydrogen peroxide or the radiomimetic Bleomycin.</s><s>In fibroblasts, EDHB greatly decreased the DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and moderately decreased the DNA damage caused by Bleomycin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>).</s><s>In PSCs, EDHB decreased the DNA damage induced by H 2 O 2 by 50%, but did not alter the DNA damage caused by Bleomycin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the same effects of EDHB, H 2 O 2 and Bleomycin on DNA damage in PSCs could also be detected using western blotting (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As cells from patients with NBS are known to be affected by abnormal cell cycle checkpoints, e.g.</s><s>failure of intra-S checkpoint after radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> , we determined the influence of DNA damage

target="#b46">46</ref> .</s><s>HFF1 cells only showed a slight increase in P-CHEK1 after treatment with bleomycin, but NBS-8 fibroblasts on the other hand exhibited CHEK1 activation without any treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>).</s><s>This was decreased, but not eliminated upon treatment with EDHB.</s><s>Bleomycin did not cause stronger activation than in control and this was not challenged by EDHB treatment.</s><s>Interestingly, the supplementation with H 2 O 2 completely diminished CHEK1 phosphorylation but not in the presence of EDHB.NBS iPSCs were found to
